7/1/2011,"i support, of course. and ccp must understand the quality is the most important thing for us. more :""free to play"" methods, aurum and shiny stupidities are dangerous for the spirit of the game. we want a game with a strong and nice back story, a world complex and interesting. i don't care about facilities, agent without quality and differencies, incursions randomized... i don't pay each month for a monocle, publicities and pants whitch cost more than two month of gaming...

7/1/2011,supported.very thoroughly drafted idea. this would be an ideal solution and i might actually use cq if this was to be implemented.
7/1/2011,"agreed. would show off not only the concept of a capusleer but the lovely internal station environments that we have gotten to love and are now foggy and washed out. yes, needed to showe scale, but why waste any of this games beauty.supported!"

7/1/2011,"+1100% ok. i hope the csm and ccp read this proposal. eve isn't a ""free to play"" game without background and stories. too much mistakes for this 13th update. i want an immersion, not a new incarnation."

7/1/2011,+1 iff cutscenes are optional.
7/1/2011,"incarna is a dangerous way for eve online. i hope ccp can change now, to survive in this way of excellence we love. eve online isn't a game with possibilities of ""free to play"" methods, with monocle which cost more of two month of playing, without listening the community and background stories. please, don't break all the world you made possible. +1 for new eden. +1 for slogan of ccp : excellence. +1 ""because in fact, excellence is sacrificed time and time again to the big god of the release schedule and new features."""
7/1/2011,"i would support it providing that: it was limited to once a year (like attribute remaps)or something similar..there was a fee attached to the service (similar to that of character transfer fee) also there should be a way of looking to see what the original character name was.. e.g. formerly whateverstupidnamewas in character info somewhere. this way people would be able to change they're names while not being able to shake off bad character reputations, for example someone who is a corp thief/scammer cant go change their character name to clear bad rep."
7/1/2011,"supportedperhaps the player's prior identity should not be attached. eve is about risk, and neutering it would water that down. the victory of hydra reloaded/outcast bore that out during this year's tournament - in terms of confusion over them roleplaying as two alliances instead of one, and their victory was accepted by the contest as a sound one. for accomplished eve robbers, i suppose that a name change might be the equivalent of getting a fake id, launching them into a new life of crime somewhere. for other players, name changes could enable them to vanish into witness protection far away from whoever is tormenting them. scary stuff! i wouldn't trust anyone!actually, a mischievous idea that might be amusing, could be to have new names/identities expire after 6 months, reverting the player back to his/her original name. it could be the equivalent of finding an infiltrator in your midst. i've been watching too many thrillers! :psapph"

7/1/2011,implement? that's a couple of sql queries to purge the accounts and to clean up the associated data afterwards.
7/1/2011,if those players have interacted with others ( contracts / kill mails ) there will be broken links in the database.e.g. you killed a trial account player and got a kill mail to him/her.ccp deletes the players record.you kill mail is now broken because it point to a victim who no longer exists.i support renaming them to [caldari|amarr|minmatar|gaylentte] citizen ####### though

7/1/2011,/signed cose i want to know aswell
7/1/2011,"wrong. you misinterpret my message.i said that since they do not care, the rest who do care should be heard and heeded.why? because eve is a ""deliberately democratic"" society. and that is an officially stated goal of ccp.so please read the csm white paper written by ccp before attempting to argue why the opinions of the csm, whose role it is to represent the playerbase, should not have their highest priority requests met (of which mt is one of those):the council of stellar management - implementation of deliberative, democratically elected, council in eve.please run for csm election membership before arguing that our player elected council do not hold the opinion of the playerbase at large.their vote counts, because ccp said it does. again i refer above linked document.please show data that supports an overwhelming opposition to the views of the csm who were voted for by, and thus represent the playerbase.wrong.but first off, i do support vanity-mt and plex, because that revenue supports ccp's development and running costs and provides further profit. but you're wrong in saying i'll continue to support them regardless.i have unsubscribed all three of my accounts (one of which has already expired), and they will remain that way until ccp clarify their stated promise to never have non-vanity mt. many others have also unsubscribed, or are planning to when ccp make the wrong decision:keeping tally of unsubbed playersif you understood the history of eve online well enough, you might understand the educated opinion (yes i mean opinion until and unless proof arrives) that the launch of cq may in fact have been the day that eve online died.this opinion might be wrong, and i do truly hope for the sake of ccp's several hundred employees in something like 4 different countries that ccp does survive and prospers. but i certainly won't be funding a game that was converted from a sub-based to mt-based business model.ccp can still restore their trust and respect with the playerbase."
7/1/2011,"i would be completely against this, it would destroy one of the main hooks that keep a lot of the older players in the game, wreck the character bizarre making everyones toons worthless and also bring about further ingame advantage for those that can pay.(plex allready does that..) also new players should have to work their way up in eve and learn to play the game, id be all for upping the starting xp to say 5 mil, but the idea of someone just starting out and with enough plex/aurum be able to fly the likes or a carrier in a week would just be gamebreaking and would destroy any immersive effect the game has to offer."
7/1/2011,"i have been thinking for a long time now, that eve should have game mechanics that explicitly award the player with small yet noticable amounts of sp, simply for *playing* the game. since at the moment, players who actually *play* get only the same sp-generation capabilities as subscribers who only log-on to change skills.to clarify, time-based sp generation should continue in its current form, but you should also get ""bonus"" sp for actually playing the game. not sitting around in a station mind you, but for killing pirates, participating in the eve economy, researching and invention with bp's, mining, performing exploration tasks, taking part in incursions, etc etc etc, in a fashion not too dis-similar to many other popular mmo's.it would take a bit of work to perfect so it wasn't too easy to ""game"" it for excessive boosting (maybe include a system of diminished-boosting-results), but i think a good balance could be achieved.this would have to be a free addition to game mechanics, with no mt involved. that way the old and new players get the best of both worlds.you'd be not only encouraged to play more often (and i suspect active players tend to encourage their friends to play too, more so than inactive players), but the new players can feel like their actions are boosting their growth while logged on (thus can get into battleships faster for example), but sp's continue to generate as usual even while logged off. the old ""bitter-vets"" (loyal long term paying members who made eve what it is) get to maintain their sp-status for as long as they remain subbed and play the game, and they would get sp-boosts just like everyone else, keeping it ""fair"".i suspect the biggest turn-off for new players is the raw rl time it takes to be able to do bigger and better things. but playing the game could and possibly should boost the rate at which you grow, just without the growth ending when you log off like with ""lesser"" mmo's.i don't know if this has been suggested before, so i apologise if such a mechanic has been debated (and shot-down) previously."
7/1/2011,no no nononoonononoonononon way no big spoiler
7/1/2011,"initially your rage prevented you from following reason, now your zeal is messing with your comprehensive reading skills, how else can one explain that my ""whether ccp will sell sp or not"" is magically read by you as ""they will indeed sell sp"". since you are basing your entire argument on that paper let me be the first to tell you, albeit belated, that the csm has been a farce from day 1.i, as many others, have been with eve long before the csm even came about and every single decision ccp made that the csm opposed was implemented anyway. so please, you can keep dreaming of the csm playing any role in the decision making process at ccp but that's all it is, a dream. nevermind the fact that, again, the overwhelming majority of the playerbase does not even care about the csm as reflected by total vote count.putting some paper ccp wrote front and center is an appeal to authority, which is a logical fallacy. you want to make an argument, then make it, citing some meaningless whitepaper doesn't support your cause.just lol.do you know how many people posted ""omgwtfbbq 14 accounts unsubbed"" when the mom nerf came through? what about the carrier nerf? what about all the other nerfs over time where hordes of players raged on the forums for a whole week how many hundreds and thousands of accounts unsubbed ....yet here we are and the concurrent player count has been stable over time. talk is cheap, biomassing isn't. there is no viable alternative to eve if one wants to keep playing a game like it which is why all the ragers will continue to pay.hollower words have never been spoken. they don't need your trust or respect, they only need your money which you will continue to give them. eve is a service, just like any other service you consume on a daily basis. do you trust and respect your utility company, or do you simply take what they provide and pay for it? what about your isp? i am sure at the very least half the readership has a ****ty opinion of their isp or cell provider, no trust and no respect, yet they keep paying. so please, idealism has no place in the real world."
7/1/2011,"thankyou, you made my point precisely. since if ccp continue to state black and white policy and promises yet continue *not* to honor those promises, then they will lose supporters like myself.that's why the csm paper is fundamental to the point of the argument. they say one thing, yet appear to be doing another. it would be fine with an unreleased game, but not for one that has an 8 year old history.wrong yet again. it is your words that couldn't be hollower.but allow me to reference the alleged words of ccp hilmar: ""i can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what our players do and less of what they say"".so there you have it.as stated, i have made my action, and that was to unsubscribe my accounts. those accounts will remain that way if ccp don't come through with an official statement to uphold or re-enforce their promises regarding mt. and as soon as they do, they'll get my money again. and sure if they then go away and break promises yet again anyway, they'll just have to test out what the consequences are, which hopefully for their employees is to survive and make big profits. there's no denying that there's a risk to be tested though.a relationship is a two way street. when one party breaks the bond, the other party loses interest. the concept is fairly simple, so i'm not sure why you're so convinced that i and many others will continue to give money to a company that doesn't have our interests at heart. i'll just go play another game that suits my play-style better.it is only fair to allow ccp the chance to restore their respect and trust with us.i can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what ccp do and less of what they say."
7/1/2011,"we all know what you were implying, you can not hide behind your intentions, it just doesn't work. your little clause ""whether ccp will sell sp or not"" does not overshadow the intent of your thread.sorry chump, but bull siht doesn't get by on these forums often, don't whine when you get called on it."
7/1/2011,"so thats...400 x 15 dollars6000 dollars. it sounds like a lot, but it's not. not when players are paying for two or three accounts at once. i could make that money in about four or five months at my current pay rate.besides the impact on the game, where everyone would be flying an officer fit supercarrier, what would be the point in playing anymore?we work hard, us players, to move forwards in the game. get used to it, or harden the **** up."
7/1/2011,"i am convinced that most people who say on the forum that they cancelled their accounts are not in fact going to quit the game because history has shown this to be true. over years there were multiple higher profile outrage events with the forum filled with ragequit posts yet the concurrent player count shows that there were no mass-quittings. so either the posters were lying or the server stats are.i wasn't implying anything, i was making my point that your $15/month will be used to get me my microtransactions whether you like it or not. this is independent of whether sp will be offered, other mt items will be offered and it is inevitable that some of those items will be non-vanity items. the writing is on the wall and your money will pay for it."
7/1/2011,"lol, look at you tempting to taunt and weasel your way out of your own thread. grow up. your $15/month will also pay for micro-transactions, and so long as it stays just vanity and is economy neutral, it doesn't bother me. so please keep bleating and squirming around."
7/1/2011,"proof that the majority is for ""mt"" and its good for ccp :20% of the playerbase are statitistically rich and ready to pay for this service. those who unsubscribe and even quit are max also 20% of the playerbase. so the rich players will compensate the leaving of poor. its like a train wich had only 2nd class waggons and now have 1-2 first class waggons. and the big rest 60 % of the playerbase ? some of them, about 5 % will spent extra money from time to time for comfort to feel special in game. so even in this ""horrific"" scenario should 20% of players quit ccp would still make more profit. i for myself would gladly appreciate sp for plex or aurum. to those who think they will ""loose"" somehow because of it- get a life, spent more time in rl get a education and good job and then you can also be special."
7/1/2011,"100% of morlidots22 got their umbilical cord wrapped around their neck during childbirth causing severe oxygen deprivation.see i can make up numbers too, but at least i quoted some evidence to back mine up."
7/1/2011,"i am not against mt in eve, to a certain extent, but this is a horrid idea that would be dangerous to eve, a game you have to pay to play already. this kind of mt could kill eve, unlike selling vanity items."
7/1/2011,"the only thing it proves is that you can type the word ""proof"". now let's see if you can figure out what the word means."
7/1/2011,"well, i've moved past 140m sp and i tell you: it's not about skill points. you dont win eve with skill points. they arent that important.if someone wants them bad enough, sure, let them buy them. the joke is on them really. its just like someone buying a bunch of plex to sell for isk and get a pre-trained account. sure, they will have a lot of skill points, but no clue what to do with them."
7/1/2011,"exactly i totally agree sp limits are their to restrict your ship type and modules but once you can fly a ship with the right modules then the real learning and mistakes come in. i today bought a rapier pvp fit, falcon and dramiel and i'll be enjoying piping in the with my corp over the next few days/weeks trying to learn how to fly them and enjoy them. but right now i have no clue and expect to loose them in short order when not in a bigger gang. having sp doesn't ruin the game it opens it up. there are always more things to train and perfect. most people just want to enjoy playing eve how fast and at whatever pace they want and we should let them."
7/1/2011,"i really do think that you need to work on your reading comprehension skills.just for you, since me making this topic didn't give it away for you, i wholeheartedly support microtransactions thus i will happily pay my $15/mo to support their development and introduction.what amuses me is that your angry $15/mo will support mt and where mt is headed as well even though you don't want that. even if you quit eve the microtransactions are here to stay, which will be good for me regardless."
7/1/2011,and it's time for the ccp holders to sell their children and a kidneyo7
7/1/2011,"this thread is probably so interesting to read due to humpink's reasoning abilities.it frames the picture of a viking warrior beating through waves of unshaven middle-lower-class workers. however the warrior is starting to lose sight of his edge as well.all jokes aside, however, it is clear to anyone that spent time reading and thinking about this topic to conclude that those in favour reason with logic and those against reason with ""the uncertain future"".as perceived in history, if ccp does implement it, it is to secure their survival and therefore the survival of eve. all the nay-sayers may do as they please but eve will never implement anything to cause its demise: no matter how ""vocal"" the forum is.if they don't, which suggests their intention in keeping the current loyal subbers that is convinced paying for a skill to train is good gameplay: which creates a decent bond of attachment in the end. that solution seems more stable too than the burst of sp purchase cash.there is absolutely no reason to theorycraft the doom of markets, imbalance of combat due to new potent (sp-wise) pilots, or any ripples of such. whatever is implemented players who love this game enough will adjust and so will the sandbox. all we need now is time, which may or may not be a key point of this topic."
7/1/2011,"op is clearly a troll.if this 2003 player was such a proud supporter of mts, he probably wouldn't post on his 1 month old alt. as usual, a surefire way to determine just how full of bull**** a poster is.a second indicator: if he was so happy with the current mts, he would have a monocle.so even if this would-be troll does in fact like mts, he had to realize, to his dismay, that he cannot buy eve status with rl money. he just gets flamed for wearing nex **** in a spaceship game. so now he wants to buy something that gives an actual advantage, and voil<U+FFFD>: skillpoints are an integral part of gameplay. can't lose them, either. win/win.and yes, clearly it adds to my entertainment if more ""virtual goods"" are sold on eve. in fact, lets disable skill training altogether until people pay 1000 aurum/day to activate it. would make my gameplay so much more enjoyable.or, and this is a really revolutionary approach, perhaps moronic trolls should just stfu."
7/1/2011,"you've no room to speak of ""reading comprehension skills"". it is your defense when someone manipulates your words, but when you want to manipulate the words of another it is all fair game. anyone can read through this thread and watch your behavior.too bad you no mts rl huh? then maybe you could buy up some karama points."
7/1/2011,"let's think about this ...let's disregard the fact that the forums largely exist in their current state because people are able to post with their alts.anyone who has been actively playing the game for several years is likely deeply invested in the social aspect of the game and revealing the true identity of one's main character is ill advised because the perceived status long term contributions to a corp or alliance created could be severely compromised.it's a bit like leading the war on drugs for years and then come out and say that you are a pothead who does blow every night. that's just not advisable if one values the relationships one has established over the years.other than that, attacking the person because you don't like the idea is a logical fallacy. you want to argue the point then do so, whom the idea is coming from is irrelevant to the discussion.that in itself is a reasonable argument. however, from my personal perspective vanity mt don't excite me. i know lots of people will buy cloths or skins for their ships or whatnot, but to me those items do not carry a value proposition. what do i gain by buying a monocle? nothing. yes, the character looks different, but so what, to me that's irrelevant. when i was forced to go through carbon character creation i clicked the random generator a couple three times till i saw something that wasn't hideous and moved on.i will spend money if it buys me time because i value time. i don't value looks.i don't want to buy status. i want to give money to receive time because time is my most valuable and very finite asset.that line of reasoning that makes it impossible to take your arguments seriously. no one is talking about disabling skill training. you are trying to go to some extreme to invoke an emotional response in the readership, which incidentally is exactly what trolls do.the sale of virtual goods can (can, doesn't have to) add to your entertainment value if it results in more people joining eve for you to play with or to shoot at (if you are a pvper).being opposed to non-vanity mt is a bit like being opposed to buying bread, because at the end of the day you really didn't earn the bread, you didn't plow the field, didn't buy the seeds, didn't tend to the crop, didn't harvest it, didn't mill the grain, didn't fire the oven, didn't kneed the dough, you merely cheated your way to some bread by exchanging money for it."
7/1/2011,so you are a self-proclaimed hypocrite. alright then... next!
7/1/2011,i was about to say.
7/1/2011,still i support this or at least some thought in this direction
7/1/2011,won't work in the current market. wait for eve to evolve more.
7/1/2011,this is a very intresting idea. but a old one.it should be possible with current gamemechanics to implement such a market.but alot of companies should change there strategy. value of a share should be assigned by real value of assets.for instance:money = 50% of its valueassets in lockdown = 100% of its valueassets not in lockdown = 80% of its value.mineral = 80% of its valuevalue is determed on market average. this way shares wil go up or down due to the market and adding of new assets to the share corporation.working with a poolsystem wil get this to work bettercorporation wil own there part of the shares.the poolsystem wil have the rest of the shares.players can buy from the pool. or from other players.buy shares = 110% of valuesell shares = 80% of value tax: depending on skills betwean 5 and 10% (money sink)i will post a compleet worked out version of this system soon.i have reason to markup the current prices. this to do with market fluxuations. and giving the corporation some breathroomgreets and regardsrodrom caldera
7/1/2011,"sounds nice. yes, please."
7/1/2011,"i agree that there should be a system in place that allows for the value to fluctuate. however, i think the value of shares should rely on more than just isk/assets of the corporation. the value should also rely on the actions of the corporation and its members. if a corporation defeats a corporate competitor in a skirmish, for example, this should be reflected. just a thought."
7/1/2011,yes i understand. but how is the game mechanics able to read these achievements? and how would this relate to the shares. share = real value. achievement = nothing. investors are intrested in only 1 thing. profit. that it. easy as pie.but to trow you a ball. how would you see this happening?
7/1/2011,"while i really hate docked war targets, there are ways to get them out. it includes not actually being in their system smack talking them in local.your idea is horrible. i've heard worse ones, but they involved committing felonies on goats.station fighting is fail. eve could perhaps fix it by changing the docking timer to 2 minutes. that might fix it, or it might make people even less likely to fight. could go either way."
7/1/2011,"wasting your time? are they forcing you to sit outside the station and wait for them to undock while they're afk?? ...you're wasting your own time... if they're playing docking games why don't you just ignore them? no. this means you have people in your corp that are stupid.however, i do recall what it was like back in the day when i was a newbie and my player corp got war dec'd by griefers.. and i felt that the system was flawed. something does need to be done and as mentioned in another reply - something as simple as increasing the aggression cool-down by another minute would help i think."
7/1/2011,"as another poster said, the issue you raise isn't really about high sec war, it's about station games in general. your proposal goes a bit too far, in my view. longer aggression timers might help, but could also have unintended consequences, such as ... you shoot at a can flipper while mining, and now you can't dock for 15 minutes. as for high sec wars, your missioners and miners can avoid being killed fairly easily; move to a system far away, keep your watch list up to date and watch local. a fair fight against your wt's is just not going to happen, unless they want one."
7/1/2011,"hmm, no love for this idea. my thinking was, they fight like guerillas so this might fit. i guess not.it's good to see that others are not happy with docking games though, this is a broken aspect of eve across the game.as far as the stupid people being stupid, yeah that's correct. but they are no longer members of the corp i fly with. they got kicked for being stupid, but still, damage is done and the aggressors have all the reason to keep looking for more.and you can't make people undock, not with smack talk. i know our wt use alts to know what's coming, they aren't stupid."
7/1/2011,play approach find a corp that has a pos in high sec.. then wardec them and then bring out the max dps ships and take out the tower

7/1/2011,"oh god yes, i was thinking this yesterday while salvaging.need either a module, skill, bonus to ship. but we need it! a noctis is a ship made for this purpose, as much i love having one, and thanks ccp in finally getting round to making it, it feels like it isnt finished without such an option."
7/1/2011,"you would still have to go fetch your noctis and fly to mission area.step currently.1.target each wreck2.tractor each wreck3.loot wreck (involves open a can selecting all and dragging)4.salvage wreck5.repeatsuggestion effect1. target each wreck2. tractor each wreck3. salvage each wreck4. repeat.it only cuts out the open wreck, select all, drag drop section.if there is huge botting exploit i am missing sorry (explain). if you love open 40 wrecks and select all drag and drop don't support it the suggestion.now if you have constructive criticism i'll listen but driving down salvage prices is bull*,i don't have to loot to salvage so won't affect salvage. the only thing it will affect is sub tech ii module prices perhaps and perhaps mineral market which could use a shot in the arm after ccp clamp down on bots.cheerslowkey"
7/1/2011,"an even better solution, imo, would be if it was possible to assign keyboard hotkeys for quickly opening a wreck/container and moving the contents to your ship's cargo hold. select the wreck, press your ""loot all"" hotkey, and then your salvager hotkey."
7/1/2011,"(1) yer lazy... i hope they take away the f keys so you have to actually click on each wreck from now on.(2) my 2nd fav pastime in eve (1st bein' tryin to learn how to better asplode people) is noctisising...it should take some work to do... or do you wanna bot like all those effing miners who afk mine??(3) actually i do hope they make your noctis... but only yours, do as you ask... so one day you start in on some wrecks and a few what don't belong to you are there... and pop you get concordokkened... lemme know where ya are and i'll pop over and salv yer wreck.why do so many want to make things so easy they are no longer fun and worth doing???? lazy lazy lazy...i love the new turret effects on the noccy btw!!!"
7/1/2011,ah... something i fer got to add....i want combat drones on my noctis!!!!but what i really want is salvager drones and tractor drones!!instead of worryin about three little clicks... how about a l4 or sleeper wreck field that extends for over 100km? squat yer noccy down in the middle and as you start in on the one you can reach you send yer tractor drones to the ones out of range to drag in all those yummy wrecks... and salvager bots to salvage the wrecks as don't have any loot but are out of range... like mining drones they bring back the salvage and drop it in your hold.now that i'll back!!
7/1/2011,wow...... paying extra for content... i thought that was what the $15 a month per account was for.......you sir need to have your posting license revoked.... i am sure however you would probably be willing to buy it back with some aur...
7/1/2011,"that sir will make eve a bling game. no way i will support that. go play wow or lineage. facebook's ""no end game"" games have content to buy. go ahead."
7/1/2011,"i wouldn't totally be against it, were it implemented. since the big null-sec corps have huge isk wallets they'll have a considerable influence over the game should they choose to leverage it, which concerns me slightly."
7/1/2011,"read the article. failing to find a single thing i didn't agree with. you have my vote.if anything, im votting on this hoping that it will show ccp how much people are unhappy with the changes recently made, and the changes people have been asking to be made for the last god knows how long."
7/1/2011,"hi!world of eve is becoming older and older each day. almost everybody i know are now flying at least on battleships, some are on caps already. in 00 i see not so much diversity, for instance, in battleship class it is an abbadon or tempest as a pvp machines. i want to propose a game mechanics concept to make our space and world of eve more diverse.we all know that players have sp. you can reach it only by lifetime in eve (passive or active). this is actually a pilot sp, not so much connected to a certain ship this pilot flies.in real life we all get quite adopted to cars as drivers. in time we get so familiar with the car that we drive faster, park faster, strafe better and our way of driving can become much more agressive or safe.this is not so much working in eve, though. if a titan pilot is changing his ship to a t1 frigate, even after 1 year of not flying frigate he is actually quite same level at shooting things as he was 1 year ago. if we go further and compare one guy who flew a frigate 5 years and a guy with just same skills as the first one there would be a draw if they fight each other (if modules, frigs and timing of 1st shoot and lock is same).now, i propose to add up new mechanics - experience in a ship flewn where pilot will have an experience table for each and all ships in eve.for instance:pilot bob has sp 40 000.flewn ships experience:1. crow 1200 hours2. heron 300 hours3. raven 200 hours4. badger 190 hoursetc.what's the point?each flewn hour (or several hours, days etc.) should have some influence on the ship and pilot stats with the particular ship he flies. the more pilot flies in his favourite badger the more experienced and familier he becomes with that ship and the more ship becomes efficient.consequences:a frigate lover will be a pain in the ass to a dreadnaught newbie or a battleship newbie.i never proposed here actual stats change and even stats itself that should be affected by pilot experience with the ship. i leave this for open discussion here and to devs.i would like to have feedback on my proposal."
7/1/2011,"all that needs to be done is an introduction of ship crews that gain ""experience"" as the ship they are ""bound"" to is used."
7/1/2011,people will totally not farm experience 23/7 by just sitting in a pos as day.
7/1/2011,"already implemented at player level.you know a ship and how it works and how you can use it by actually using it. simple as that.to give you a clearer idea of what i mean : a new player who purchased an old char will never understand all mechanics behind what defensive, ofensive capabilities, e-war of the ships he can use with his newly purchased avatar without experience. experience of the player gives you an edge or a handicap over same sp player who has a similar character in skill points and chosen skills. eve is all about hard work, ships already perform alot by how much a player understands them."
7/1/2011,flewn is not a word.
7/1/2011,good for rp +1
7/1/2011,"a long overdue change.could possibly call it ""graduation date"""
7/1/2011,"long overdue, really."
7/1/2011,i like it.
7/1/2011,makes sense
7/1/2011,"re: 'bathroom', as i said, just for fun... not a serious request... =]and yes, there are text cues fr what ship... but it's just not the same nor anywhere near as satisfying...i do hope the watchin holov in the cq gets added... but i ain't holding my breath.and i still hope ccp hasn't gone off the rails greedwise... we'll see. they intro pay-to-win, and thereby let in hordes of children, and i will unsub faster than you can rage quit in jita for 1 isk!tura =/|)="
7/1/2011,anything like what i proposed would be a great help to ceos & directors
7/1/2011,"+1 i'm aggree and support this proposal. incarna can be the death of eve online but with intelligence, we can assure a better future, can't they? no aurum, no free to play methods but an incarna we all need. that's it."
7/1/2011,it would be very exiting if we were able to control joint movement on our avatars so we can choreograph a dance and also be able to sell to other characters for isk so they can inject the information to their desired character like a skill book and other things like designing how you walk on station with stile
7/1/2011,are they adding fences with gates?
7/1/2011,so i can have my character walk like this rather than his current excessive swagger?
7/1/2011,"no one click cargo.no drag ship outside box to make it active.game results being taking longer to do basic tasks.firstly we need to know if this is a bug or the idea. personally, i think its done on purpose, either because they haven't gotten round to doing it or do not intend to. which is silly. why should the same action not only take longer, but be more complicated.this needs to be looked into."
7/1/2011,yes. going from two clicks to three has accentuated the click-fest nature of this task.
7/1/2011,"we should be able to allow anyone into our fleets from fleet finder. yes people might think this is silly, but thats surely our choice, even if we let reds join. i might want to let ppl in my system, help fight some hostiles that have entered, they have no standings but just want to kill something. i might want to set up a roam with anyone whos interested.yes i know they might shoot us and something like that but still its my choice."
7/1/2011,"no, i don't want to open my fleet finder and see hundreds of fleets from people i don't know, as it is i often see fleets for mining ops - which i may have once used to get a target for suicide ganking...."
7/1/2011,"capitals should look likem capitals, and not been dwarfed by a bs."
7/1/2011,i couldn't agree more. make them much larger.
7/1/2011,let me see if i understand you correctly... you want banned players assets being put on the market? how will that create a larger isk sink than the assets being frozen?
7/1/2011,"it would be more of an isk sink because the npc auction would take the isk from players bidding on the items, and throw it into the void. the money would leave the game completely, which creates a true isk sink."
7/1/2011,"assets on banned accounts are effectively removed from the economy, thus your proposal is less of on isk/asset sink and thus bad."
7/1/2011,you've exchanged isk for something of equal value which can still be traded. that's not an isk sink.
7/1/2011,"not quite correct. it would be an isk sink, but perhaps not a wealth sink. the isk indeed gets tossed into the void, but additional value, wealth, the 'stuff' from the banned account, is added into the sandbox.i neither support or oppose this. just clarification of what is being proposed."
7/1/2011,"sounds reasonable, perhaps adding an additional moniker would help avoid typos, such as ""10 m"" or ""10|m"" and not ""10m"", the ""|"" (pipe) or a space seem a bit more deliberate on the part of the user."
7/1/2011,this sums it up pretty damn well.
7/1/2011,"i don't mind the neural remaps either - as a noob i messed mine up. :p very keen to get plex out of the game too, since it's a way to buy ingame military benefit and pretrained high faction characters with real world cash. ugh!is there any chance of them selling small run clothing blueprints or cq furniture blueprints in the exchange?sapph"
7/1/2011,because... ya know.finding faction poses and stuff that're offline is annoyin'.i want free iskies :(
7/1/2011,agreed with turrets.
7/1/2011,"these issue were already brought up several weeks before launch, after players tested it on sisi/duality... nothing happened there. these are still changes that need to go through, though."
7/1/2011,i just assumed they needed to pick one or the other in order to afford the marketing push new shooters have to have.
7/1/2011,more evidence csm is a joke.
7/1/2011,"this csm sucks, but they kinda ran on a platform of 'we suck but we have enough alliance members' votes so **** off kthxbye' anyway, so no surprise there.their buying into the ccp meme that this was all a big 'miscommunication' is where they reveal their ignorance/naivet<U+FFFD> the most. we've had more clear, direct, transparent (if involuntary) communication from ccp in the last 2 weeks than we've had in the last 2.5 years that i've been playing. that's what precipitated the outrage.ccp doesn't care how ****ty they make eve or what commitments they've made in the past, they see their customers as a golden goose and will do everything and anything to squeeze every last cent out of us.this csm is ok with that as long as ccp works on stuff that benefits their alliances. fair enough. but they don't speak for the players, they speak for their respective alliances."
7/1/2011,"ccp must not have gotten through that fable to learn the moral. odd, seeing how short the book was."
7/1/2011,"do you find yourself as a pvp/combat pilot with default mining or industry skills? or perhaps you are a miner with default gunnery & turret skills? i propose that a simple and slight change be made to the skill system that allows players to not only ""inject"" skills but to ""un-inject"" skills as well. once the ""un-inject"" tab is selected, a ""caution"" window should pop up to inform the player that the skill will be ""un-injected"". once the skill is deleted off the player's skill sheet, it will remain in a stand-by window for 24 hrs. after 24 hrs, the player can finalize the deletion (similiar to character deletions). players would not get back sp. this would not change game play or affect the main game. it would slim down jumbled skill sheets and decrease clone costs. please comment."
7/1/2011,"can you, as a person, un-learn how to ride a bike? drive a car? how about make a sandwich? clones don't cost that much, and you shoulda planned better while training your character"
7/1/2011,"welcome to eve, you must be new here.because this topic has been beaten to death harder than a fatman running into a brick wall."
7/1/2011,"i'd like to make the point that some of us are excited about what we have right now. you have to see the potential and not what it is right now. i feel alot more connected to my character then i was before and i know alot of new people looking at the game will like it much better. like before incarna how many people have you told about eve online and once you told them that you never leave your ship did they lose interest? right now it's small but soon you will see the whole grand experience. just be patient it will come. i'm not sure what the ""need"" (besides just the role-playing aspect) will be in leaving your ship. but i would highly suggest ccp to really brainstorm some ideas."
7/1/2011,"seriously?if you feel like that, why not just stop playing eve and go on with your life....i dont see why people emo-rage over things that they dont need to get involved in if they dont want to.i agree that the minute ccp makes it so that game mechanics get changed becouse of micro-transactions its gonna kill the game, but we are not there yet...so why not put your virtual torches away for now and use them when and if they are needed.seriously people ccp is a company, and if they can increase their earnings ofcourse they will try and milk as much out of the playerbase as they can, why wouldnt they?its not like they are holding a gun to your head and forcing you to throw your money at them.chillmy 2 cents*edit: typos, just to tired to type correct ."
7/1/2011,ccp's hands. we've been done for a while now :)
7/1/2011,"care to put down a date when you all finally finished and handed it to ccp? it would also be nice to know who did what, when they started those minutes and when they finished them.seems like you all ignored them for a couple weeks after the summit before starting on them. procrastination is bad didn't you know? just think, if you guys had did them right after the summit like you should have, the players would be more informed about the current situation perhaps.am i wrong?"
7/1/2011,"it looks like some of the csm don't have time to mess around with this communication thing with the community. too boring and beneath them i guess. if it is a too big a chore or you don't want to dirty yourselves with communicating to the unwashed masses, then resign and let an alternate csm member give it a try.yes we want minutes and a couple of weeks after the meeting not a couple of months."
7/1/2011,a few weeks?if the community doesn't get something concrete within a day or two of the meeting there will be riots! i don't think most people realize just how precarious the situation is.
7/1/2011,how many months from now before we can expect them? maybe we will be into the next expansion? can you tell us time in the measurement of monocle? you know like for every 3.8 months equals a monocle. so we can expect to see these minutes in four or five monocles?
7/1/2011,"with all the recent events, i'm even more interested in seeing what is being discussed. the csm meeting minutes ceased with the end of the previous csm. the iceland summit was a month and a half ago and still no minutes. it seems we get more information from kugu than the eve website these days. i can't imagine ccp is okay with this."
7/1/2011,"as soon the csm member return home, maybe this sunday night, is possible to organize a new fireside chat to discuss/clarify the recent eve issues?thanks, regards."
7/1/2011,"sunday might be tough, we will certainly have one at the *latest* by next weekend."
7/1/2011,and can we get a text transcript of it please?i'm getting a bit irked that no-one from csm seems able to at least respond to the request from a deaf player to get the fireside chats in a format that i can use!do they not check the forum?oh wait.. no. they'd rather 'communicate' through other channels!
7/1/2011,screw the fireside chat - post to jita park
7/1/2011,"i like the concept of fire side chat.maybe it would have to be after ccp's press conference on tuesday, though ?"
7/1/2011,bring bak ship spinning cq should be optional.
7/1/2011,"i think it's pretty clear what the player base wants the csm to attempt in their upcoming meeting with ccp. i won't add any more to that list.i will add this viewpoint to the csm members: although you have no real power with ccp, you still wield a rather heavy club (if you are brave enough to swing it.) if you are not given satisfying responses from ccp, you can yell loudly about it to the community. ccp may ban you from the game for doing so, but that's where the bravery part comes in. stay strong. the community is counting on your not taking any crap.slightly off topic:i don't know if anyone else has noticed the flaw in the logic of worn vanity items being destroyed when the character is podded. before we undock, our clones climb naked into a goo-filled pod. these clothes and other worn vanity items are left in our quarters.just saying.i do agree that ship skins would be destroyed."
7/1/2011,"how long have yuo been playing? this is eve, causing the game server to lag because of protest against mt is the wrong way to vent.get it in some forum threads that 2% of the community read... lololo....."
7/1/2011,handlebar mustaches are overrated if you can't make a monochrome avatar.
7/2/2011,this post is more relevant than ever to be honest.
7/2/2011,even if we have to pay more.
7/2/2011,"1. buff gallente (enough said on the topic for years now)2. nerf autocannons. autocannons are not only the weapon of choice on minmatar ships, but also on most cal/gal turret hulls. moreover, they are preferrable on any amarr ship lacking a rof/damage/range bonus on lasers (punisher, maller, prophecy) - same base damage, no cap usage at all compared to a laserfit (tremendous advantage - even with controlled bursts v & maxed cap use bonuson the hull) easier to fit, better tracking, free choice of damage type...op autocannons are also the reason behind the rifter being the most powerful frigate, the rupture being completely out of line with any other t1 cruiser, lowsec being cane/vaga-land and all angel ships being ridiculously overpowered.- blasters should receive better tracking than ac's because they simply can't track any of their supposed targets in their own optimal - not even megathrons with their tracking bonus. due to their very limited range, they should maintain the highest overall dps.- pulse lasers should do far more dps than ac's - enormous pg requirements, no choice in damage types, insane cap usage which makes a cap consumption bonus on laserboats mandatory, whereas minmatar ships have something useful like a rof/speed bonus instead. wasn't it for scorch on zealots and abaddons the entire weponclass would be just as useless as blasters compared to acs (hell - and even on abaddons you find projectiles just as often as lasers).hint: have a look at the area under the curve in eft dps charts at different transversals whilst keeping all other ac advantages in mind.3. nerf tier 2 bcs - they are dirt cheap (especially after the introduction of different rig sizes) and can be fitted to hold as much tank as some bs - moreover, their effective dps often is better than that done by a bs due to better sig-res and tracking on guns, whilst being tremendously far mobile. even losing the rigs on a bs costs more than losing two entirely fit bcs. similary, they pull even with most hacs at a fraction of the price.4. buff large weapons (see 3.) - outside of blob fights, bs are hardly viable anymore. especially after sniperfleets became obsolete since the introduction of easy insta-probing.5. shorten siege cycle time on dreads to 5 mins, increase scan res, #of locked targets and tracking whilst sieged."
7/2/2011,"boost caldari capitals, or make caldari viable in more than just drake-blobs and mission *****s. seriously, anyone who is competitive in null knows you're either amarr, erebus, or dead. there is a reason that amarr is over-represented in the nullsec community.caldari carriers suck at life, and making them cap stable is a sacrificial trick.caldari dreadnaughts...(lol)...do low comparitive dps, require ammo, have less ehp, and generally suck in most aspects, even compared to the other dread""nots"".caldari sc...is there actually a reason anyone would choose this over its counterparts? seriously...caldari titan - useless b/c shield gangs are just drake blobs.seriously though, lower overall resists on shields, lower pg capacity, cap stability issues, missiles (lol), lower total shield amount compared to armor, and the lack of ability to tank and use mid slots make caldari lultastic for anything but missions.fvck, even gallante have a head up on caldari in bs/cap area."
7/2/2011,"proposal: dedicate an entire patch to scrapping all the old ship statistics, (all of them) and redoing everything, from the ground up.keep the basics (minmatar fast, caldari slow, use racial weapons already in use, same with tanking), but change everything, armor/shield hp, speed, agility, sig radius, bonus's, everything, all the way down to slots and pg/cpu and balance it all. do the same with the modules.make it so that it's combat only. i'm tired of seeing the destroyers used as nothing but a beginners salvage boat."
7/2/2011,"i'm sure the major issues have been repeated enough, but i like to discuss ""effectiveness for price"".meaning if you are paying a certain amount of isk for a ship, the result you get from that purchase should be relatively close to its counter parts. only minor varying differences in style and module differentiation should be acceptable.i mean, whether in pve or pvp, eve combat isn't as exactly reaction based when compared to other games like wow's arena. it is more planning, knowledge, and proper execution. knowledge being the most effective. so to balance each ship and module, player skills (non-sp wise) shouldn't be as much of a factor, relatively.which brings on the ultimate point. why don't everyone just rack money up and buy the ""best"" ship in it's class for the highest isk. well, there's your balance issue right there. what's the point of having crappier stuff no one is ever going to undock with? how are you going to hard is ccp trying to balance diversity in the same class?i don't know. i sometimes fly a ship for the love of it. decision to fly it regardless of what the chart or stats say. i love the legion as much as man can love his internet space ship and hope to see it balanced with other tech 3s (as a selfish point)."
7/2/2011,prices are market driven and have nothing to do with performance most of the time but with availability and lps.prime example for that are those faction shuttles and a lot of those navy ships.i got myself a widow just because i love the paintjob on the new scorp hull and no other reason.balancing stuff on a pricetag would make ship sales through the npc corps necessary and im dmn sure none of the ship builders (especially t2) will ever want that.
7/2/2011,"i presume you're all aware that:1) this thread is over 7 months old.2) the op has sold his character and semi-ragequit in protest.3) ccp doesn't give a crap about your words, only your actions count.right?"
7/2/2011,nullno
7/2/2011,no.
7/2/2011,"nolike one of ccp said: ""it's more important to look what people do instead of listening to what they're saying"" (or similar): **** that, if 50 people buy monocles and 5000 slap you in the face for doing ****, this statement is absolutely stupid.ccp can earn more money by making the game more attractive for more players. so they have no reason to be greedy. and microtransactions are just cheap and nothing else. you can buy yourself a flipping awesome computer in the real world and play the most advanced games on it. but you can use a really bad computer with really advanced skills of your own to write a piece of software which could empower you do conquer the world."
7/2/2011,no.
7/2/2011,"cosmetic onlywho knows, one day i may want to paint my ship... at least after ccp gives raven a new, really awesome hull."

7/2/2011,"+1 maybe have a fee of 1 aur each time you decide to leave the pod, so ccp is happy."
7/2/2011,yes!
7/2/2011,i fully support thisone should be able to choose between old hangar screen and the new cq(for those who like it the door can be included as well... )
7/2/2011,"yeah, only makes sense to have the station hanger and then exit to cq. otherwise a big waste of time for a pilot in war or doing quick dock drop/pickup type operations which is most times the way we are. i can see in the future of incarna the likelihood of spending more time in stations (bars, dancing girls, games, etc...) but even then the day to day functions are quick docking and undocking for mission, ammo, market drops, and other quick business. maybe, i go to the cq while a blob sits outside, have a drink, and play the pac-man table game, heheh.seriously, the way it should be! +1edit: just realizing they said the hangar view will be put back in the new dev blog after csm meeting, makes me happy :) hopefully it will be done similar to what you say with the cutscenes though."
7/2/2011,hopefully ccp will consider this.
7/2/2011,+1i was talking about it somewhere myself.
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,a bigass +1 on this
7/2/2011,"this was one of the biggest issues i had with incarna and something that annoyed me immediately when i tried it on sisi.the old hangar view needs to be returned. not replaced with something of ""similar functionality""."
7/2/2011,"all for it, both for the sake of immersion and that it was hell of a lot faster."
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,"i dont want and have never wanted to use incarna/station barbie crap.i want a client like the one from 3 weeks ago, a client that actually worksyou said it woudl be optional and now your ****ing about implementing something that could be easily sorted with a button to enter qc in the old station view.why didnt you add a button in the first place?are you really that dumb?"
7/2/2011,"+1there is nothing to do in cq right now. they should just revert to pre-incarna, until they fix cq."
7/2/2011,"+1 (with amendment)i've argued elsewhere that forced decanting to change ammo is stupid. as for ""old hanger back"", frankly i don't really want it back if an even faster-loading alternative with the same basic functionality can be created. ""ship spinning""?"
7/2/2011,"just sick and tired of things added which make this game too much like hard work. docking, session timer, switching ships, session timer, undocking, session timer, was frustrating enough without this new crapolla station environment that adds more time to doing anything with your ship. what's next? geting dressed, brushing teeth, and eating breakfast before undocking?"
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,"yup, immersion should be at the core of everything."
7/2/2011,supported
7/2/2011,the op makes an awful lot of sense and points out blazingly obvious flaws in ccps behaviour. which is why it will never be fixed unless ccp is properly medicated :-(
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,"they don't care, and they won't do anything that benefits the players. they will only work on stuff from now on that they think will bring ccp more money. but, sure, have a +1 for the sake of what eve could be if ccp cared about it or us."
7/2/2011,"+1 definately. finding names not already taken is hard enough, make it easier. remove the dead accounts :)"
7/2/2011,just logged on the profile page of an old mmo i played and my char was still alive after 6 years...
7/2/2011,"yes, trials only."
7/2/2011,actually seems like a win/win situation. freed up resources for ccp (small as it may be) and increased immersion of the player base into eve.
7/2/2011,"hello!attribute implants in slot 1-5 are the tools pretty much all of us use to maximize our training speed. they are available in different pricings, all from a couple of thousand up to 100mil isk each. since your attributes are the only thing that affect your training speed, alot of people want to use as good implants as they can.however, i think there is a flaw to this system that can be changed to improve gameplay to the better. as it is now, alot of people living in empire will buy the expensive +5 implants to maximize their training speed. since living in empire tends to be relatively safe for your pod, even though someone might bait or suicide your ship. on the other side of the world you have the people living in 0.0/w-space constantly risking getting stuck in a bubble where chanses of escaping with your pod intact is close to nill. people living in 0.0 tend to avoid buying these +5 implants since the risk vs reward makes them a bad choise.this is to me an unfortunate situation for both the empire dwellers and the people living in nullsec. the people in nullsec will not train at full speed, while the people in empire is very unlikely to explore nullsec for a roam since ""it's not worth jumpcloning out of my +5's for a 1 hour roam"". this leads to a situation where said players are very likely to never end up trying out pvp, since the cost is too great.i however have an idea in an early form that could tackle this! please consider the following:- remove attribute enhancing implants completely! -that's right! this would however leave a void that would need to be filled. imagine that instead of having an implant, use a temporary booster that increase said attribute instead. said consumable would give an effect just as an implant with effects ranging from +1 to +5, but is persistant through death. however, said consumable would be temporary and last e.g 1 week or 1 month (i haven't given duration much thought). if a new consumable of the same type is used while time remains on the current one, the extra time will be added to the total time.this will create an opportunity to implement another proffesion to eve. see it as the legal side of the drug market. one idea is to actually make these attribute enhancers use the same materials as boosters, which will suddenly make this branch of manufacturing alot more interresting as demand would increase, and gas harvesting might not be something even miners laugh at.but what should we do with implant slot 1-5? they are only there for the pirate implants baby! said implant sets would lose their attribute bonus, but players that previously wanted to own a low grade set but choosed not to due to the weak +2 attribute bonus are very likely to invest in these. heck i will probably get a slave, crystal and snake set if this was the case!so where does this leave us? we will end up with a situation where the market is stimulated while attribute enhancers becomes a commodity built by players, sold to players instead of being seeded into the game as mission rewards or sold in lp stores. but ultimately, it will let the nullsec dwellers train skills at max speed without having to worry about paying the cost multiple times compared to a person living in high sec. at the same time the people living in high sec might be alot more willing to explore the universe and try pvp when they don't have to worry about losing implants worth several times more than the ship the fly. and should they have expensive hardwirings in their main clone, they are likely to be more willing to jump clone out of it, as long as their skills won't train any slower."
7/2/2011,"i rather like this idea. it would be nice to finally not have to worry about losing my +4's so i can go on a roam whenever i want. although, more frequent jumpcloning would probably be easier. still, a thumbs up."
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,"spice, mentat and mentats. why not?"
7/2/2011,"i like this idea. only problem i could see is compensating people with implants already plugged in, especially the people who spent billions on pirate implants.+1"
7/2/2011,"pirate implants could stay, just remove the learning attribute function.+1"
7/2/2011,"probably a good idea, this stuff is just barrier to pvp and encourages ship spinning (lately avatar spinning and doll dressing)."
7/2/2011,"i like the idea, so it must be terrible."
7/2/2011,totally like the idea.
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,i like it
7/2/2011,"ideally, players should be able to build all in-game items. if we can't have the op's idea, give us bpos for all implants except the fancy crystal / omega / what have you ones."
7/2/2011,ppl living in jita will crash this idea
7/2/2011,"i love this idea! i havnt used my expensive clone in months cause of pew pewing often! the only downside i can see is just ""remembering"" when you need to update your weekly/monthly attribute enhancer injection. but thats just lazy people!maybe keep the permanent implants and just implament these attribute enhancers also! this will get the game back to being more pew pew orientated!"
7/2/2011,love it +1 support
7/2/2011,"totally agree, since they nerfed the jb system we have to jump through gates. yup, startgates. sometimes there's even a bubble with some dudes on it and they kill me and my implants.. wtf!+1 out in null, safe as in high!"
7/2/2011,"i don't personaly live in nullsec, fact is my character logs off in jita, even though i spend most of my active time roaming arround the world. and if you cared about reading my entire post instead of breaking out pieces of it you would notice that i don't want to make eve no-risk at all. personally i would probably risk even more isk if this is implemented than i do now, the only thing i want is that your characters progression should not be decided by where you choose to live."
7/2/2011,"you could maybe ask to ccp to create boddy salvagers...whith those salvagers you could ""salvage"" implant-parts from a dead body in station with special jove-facilities, and then... recreate new implants with the appropriate bpo + materials you salvaged, coupled with some pi items, to make pi even more used.+1 implants bpos: 15mio isk.+2 implants bpos: 30mio isk.+3 implants bpos: 45mio isk.+4 implants bpos: 60mio isk.+5 implants bpos: 75mio isk.so, you could make a cheap set of bpos and make implants easier to generate, and by then... more implants on the market, prices goes down.mike aka psy."
7/2/2011,"no longer will i have to stick with a cheap +3 set to go pewpew, more isk to buy ships that dont suck +1"
7/2/2011,"you can't force all the empire carebears out to null sec. quite a few of them simply avoid it on principle. at the same time, i quite like the fact that when destroying someone's pod, i could potentially be wiping out billions of isk. yes, carebears may have their skills train faster than 0.0 pilots - however null sec ratting and null sec mining pull in isk vastly faster than running level 4 missions in empire space, and mining in empire space.because of this, most empire carebears never will actually get a full set of +5's, because the cost is simply out of the question."
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,"why not have both a consumable and implants? none stacking of course in the end ( at least for highsec) it be cheaper to live in +5s but nullsec can take consumables i like the idea, but i think both would be better, variety is good, implants will be cheaper in the long run but if ur ganked ur sunk, like now, except with consumable option you get pvpers the ability to train at max speed without risking to much everytime they log in"
7/2/2011,"i never said i wanted to force anyone into null, i said that i wanted people to feel like they can do it if they want to, without losing out on 24h of boosted training. personally i go out anyway, but i have several friends that will not do it because of this.one of my friends gave me a number, stating that he pushed 100mil/h doing high sec lvl 4 missions. this was before the buff where all agents were considered quality 20, and combat agents only giving combat missions. i have personally ran high sec incursions scoring 100mil pure isk per hour, not even counting the lp.to beat these numbers in 0.0 you will need to run as pimped ships as you do in high sec. but the risk is far greater, and the majority will not do this. claiming high sec dwellers not being able to afford +5's is pure bogus. no one in eve, no matter if he live in high, low or null sec should have any problem affording a set of +5's if he actually tried to get them. the difference as i have said several times is that the risk/reward is not worth it. to be perfectly honest, a player who don't know how to come up with 400 mil for a set of +5s (who wants charisma anyway?) no matter where he live is doing something seriously wrong.edit: and before someone points it out let me make it clear. anyone can afford _one_ +5 set. keep buying them as you lose them, not very likely."
7/2/2011,that's a pretty good idea !nice for confort of cloning and nice for the market
7/2/2011,"this would be nice. i'm tired of looking at this nice colored zero every time i open my wallet. really, if they brought back my station view and got rid of me having to see aurum everywhere, i'd have no real problems with incarna."
7/2/2011,do this. do this now.
7/2/2011,"got my vote. i have no idea why ccp doesn't at least place the aur amount to the left of the isk amount (or better yet isk on the left, aur on the right) so it doesn't take up a whole new horizontal line of blank space at the top of the wallet. just another sign of chronic ui design failure at ccp *shakes head* uggg!"
7/2/2011,"+1, and another option that says 'check this to show old ship hangar instead of door'."
7/2/2011,"i don't see a means of voting so i will simply say, no to aurum we have a currency and it is isk, no to the noble exchange, no to the introduction of micro-transactions that offer any item that has a buy to win effect ie:gold ammo etc... the game has already been tained by being able to buy gtc's/plex for cash that can be converted to isk, do not proceed any further down this game killing slope."
7/2/2011,no to aurum and no mt
7/2/2011,yes
7/2/2011,"basically my idea is simple - institute a process whereby people who post here asking to buy skillpoints, 'i win' mode ships, non-vanity mt items, and any other request for an easy mode that bypasses having to actually play the bloody game, are identified, and then gently assisted into another game that is more suitable for them, e.g. hello kitty online island aventures.it's strange that the necessity for such a process even comes to mind, but bizarrely there are actually people who persist in playing games they clearly do not have the time, commitment or ability to play. since these people seem unwilling to move on themselves, realise their easy mode requests would ruin eve, or are simply too selfish to care about the consequences, i submit there needs to be a process by which they are helped to find another game better suited for them.they would be happier in a more suitable game, and we will be happier without them whining constantly about 'eve being too hard' and 'not being able to buy their way to flying a supercarrier on a new toon'. it's win - win.as for the process itself, perhaps a special subset of well trained isds could be created who are familiar with other games and able to provide quality advice to these people. understanding that these people often won't move on peacefully, it would also be good if gms have the power to forcibly hasten their departure from eve, after they post threads asking for an 'i win' button in eve more than... say three times?"
7/2/2011,"something you do with frequency.translation: i contradict my self regularly, so as to sound reasonable, however if i think you do, because i am too ignorant to know what you are talkng about, i will accuse you of it and call you a ""politician""in other words, your time matters more than someone else's time simply because it is yours. selfish much?which is exactly what you do.not at the expense of turning eve into a theme park for dopamine junkies.in other words, you don't know what you are talking about."
7/2/2011,"obviously my time matters more to me than your time, it would be utterly crazy to even suggest anything to the contrary. now all you need to do is to explain how that fact relates to the discussion at hand."
7/2/2011,"hello. time to present you with a kickass analogy courtesy of ben ""yahtzee"" crosshaw:""in minecraft, you have to find your own entertainment, whether that be skipping through the wilderness picking flowers or building an eighty-foot golden **** and balls. (...) but then again part of the appeal of minecraft is the effort involved in gathering the materials. that eighty-foot **** and balls wouldn't be so satisfyingly turgid if it weren't for the entire continent you had to turn over to find the ore. (...) minecraft is a responsible parent; it knows that you'll swiftly get bored of your golden **** and balls if it just ''gives'' you one, so it pays you five dollars a week to wash its car so you can save up and gain an appreciation for value so when you finally have your golden **** and balls, you'll love it all the more. until minecraft sends the suicide shrubs to demolish it because you also need to learn that sometimes life will just **** on you. as it will when your boss finds out what you spent your entire workday on.""that sums up my view on the issue quite succinctly."
7/2/2011,"let's, as a purely academic exercise, assume that some readers don't get how the active gathering of resources in minecraft, the dangers of doing so, the risk of 100% loss of those resources, is a valid analogy to the completely passive task of gaining sp in eve.how would you explain to those readers that in your opinion actively playing minecraft is the same as logging into eve once every week to set some skill training?"
7/2/2011,"you're the one that brought it up, you answer it."
7/2/2011,"quite simple. the means of generation in this case is irrelevant (though it may be relevant to the concept of non-vanity mt, and yes, plex, but that's not the topic now.) i will post the most important excerpt of the piece:isk and sp, summed up quite nicely if you ask me. a big part of eve is learning to make do with what you have while you're waiting to get something better. if you automatically have the something that's better, where is the deire towards it? a large part of the satisfaction of skill training is the journey. as such, i wouldn't be against a means to speed up your training a little through active participation, but direct cash to sp will do more harm than good, no matter what you might think now."
7/2/2011,"a big part of eve currently is forcing you to make do and go get another hobby while you pay subscription fee's and wait years for your toon to level so you can fly a new ship or use module. i gotta tell you most people don't have the patience for that. i sure as hell didn't. i hated eve's restrictions and quit twice because there was no options to grow faster. as soon as i bought a 100mill sp toon the game opened up i went to 0.0 joined a pvp corp and am engrossed in the game loving every minute of it with big plans for the future of one day owning a super or running a corp of my own. i didn't want to wait years to achieve this i'm a successful business owner in rl and i want to get ahead fast and achieve my goals not have some stupid time rule put on me that says ""go play another game cause your actions nolonger have any impact on your characters level""really think about it, your playing a game that says ""you can't level any further by playing this game anymore or less, just go away and come back in a week/months time.""give me a break, you can't say thats a good thing for the game."
7/2/2011,"i'm for selling skill points as a microtransaction, would make entering the game the game so much easier for new players."
7/2/2011,"i didn't compare my time with your time, you did.i compared money with my time. if i by means of spending money can save my time then i will gladly spend money, as would most professional adults who value their time and who have disposable income available to them.here's a simple example to illustrate the concept;if one needs 380 mil then one can grind them, or one can buy a plex for rl cash and sell it in game. if one can make $15 irl faster than one can make 380 mil in game, and if one does not find entertainment value in the grind, then a reasonable person who has the resources available will pay the $15 instead.the same ""i value my time"" concept applies to sp for rl cash. if one finds no entertainment value in playing this game in the low sp range and one has the resources available to shorten the wait, then it's reasonable to do so.the answer to that question should be left up to the individual to decide and chances are fairly good that there are any number of reasonable answers to it.just because you would not enjoy such a circumstances does not mean that others wouldn't and more importantly your personal preference should not become the mandate for everyone. don't want to shorten the wait and buy sp? then don't. no one would be forcing you to buy in, you can play the game any way you like.however, i do want to drive the point home that waiting is never part of any learning curve because waiting is inherently passive. before someone jumps in and says that waiting teaches patience and builds character let me stop you right there and mention that it is not the responsibility of the entertainment industry to teach me patience when i am paying for entertainment."
7/2/2011,"there are any number of ""reasonable"" answers, but only a few that are best for the playerbase. direct purchasing of sp via plex is not one of them.here's the kicker: i don't like waiting at all. it's annoying as hell. however, i do see the need for it. even though i can see what happens because of it, i'll still make use of it because we are ultimately an instant gratification species. this isn't a matter of self control or elitism, it's a matter of basic human nature: why wait for something when you can get it faster? and yet we come to another section of my quote:""so when you finally have your golden **** and balls, you'll love it all the more.""that is to say, things only remain desirable as long as they are out of our reach. once we have obtained them, they become mundane and you quickly get bored of them. thus, once everything in eve is within your reach, why bother playing anymore?i won't say that because it's *******s. as i mentioned earlier in this thread, i'd like noobs to get a small present of 50-100k sp to start them off getting all the modules they need. once they have all they need, they are stuck with the long training queue. what does our noob do then? he either ragequits because he wants instant gratification, or he finds something to do with the abilities he does have, (nothing is a thing, but it's a choice. just because you can't get the high-end content doesn't mean everything else is worthless.) and in doing so shows that he has the right mindset for the game.if you think the mindset needs to be changed, then you misunderstand the values which set eve apart from generic mmo games. hint: it's not the game itself, the game sucks if it's viewed as a traditional game."
7/2/2011,"why do people think they have to have high skill points to do stuff? if they have such a massive hard-on for [insert high level skill here] let them buy a character trained to use it - that they can already do.also - your reasoning that ""vets ... didn't ""work"" for their skillpoints either, they merely paid for them and waited for the training to be completed"" is utterly moronic. you really think longtime eve players will accept fools like you with more money than brains or willingness to go the distance, buying their way to high levels skills they took months or years gaining? really?and what if you do cry and buy your way to flying a supercarrier, for example? do you really think longtime players will be impressed or trust you'll you to know wtf you're doing, or believe you're willing to stick through the bad times as well as the good? do you really think you'll get any respect? because we'll all seen fools who obviously bought their way to high levels, and we know better than to fly with them.but sill - the biggest flaw in your reasoning remains that new players can be in useful ships to any fleet within days. yes, you might be 'only' scouting, tackling, hauling, etc, but if you don't know the value of good scouts for example, you're even more ignorant that you just made yourself sound."
7/2/2011,"it is not reasonable to do so at the expense of everyone else. they have also invested their time, their time is as valuable to them as yours is to you.here's your statement, ""i don't want to buy status. i want to give money to receive time because time is my most valuable and very finite asset.""soon as you say ""my"", you're making a distinction between your self and everyone else, you did indeed bring it up, deal with it. there are lots of other people that have invested ""their"" time. you are not concerned about ""their"" time, much less how skill training time, for sp in eve, fits into the structure of eve and impacts ""everyone's"" time.the larger impacts have been expressed to you, but you continue to remain selfishly fixed on your goal and not eve at large. ""time"" is very important in eve. it limits the rate at which wealth enters the game, the sandbox. isk it self is an expression of time and effort, an abstraction of labor. purchasing isk with plex is a purchase of time as expressed by isk, but that isk was paid for (earned, time and effort spent) in the past with someone's time. by injecting more time into the sandbox with short cuts, such as buying sp for $cash, or non-vanity micro-transactions, imbalances will be created. you don't care about the imbalances you will create for everyone else, only about capitalizing upon the imbalance for your self.in this thread, any time someone has shown you how the idea of selling sps outright will create imbalances, you have attempted to dismiss it with irrelevant minutia, and when you are pointed out as incorrect, you start getting all emotional.eve may not be the game for you."
7/2/2011,do you think you can't do anything when you're new? because i could do an awful lot of things with minimal skill point investment. why can't you?
7/2/2011,"it has nothing to do with work, it's a videogame. it is about growing a character becoming meaningless. skill points are the definition of a character's strength. if players can purchase skill points, then isk can purchase skill points, then isk becomes the definition of a character's strength and the focus of eve will shift.nice way to ask ccp to destroy the core of the game. just because you can't tackle on day 1."
7/2/2011,the irony here is you can actually tackle on day one. the op is clearly an awful player and thinks being in a supercarrier will somehow stop him getting blown up.
7/2/2011,"you all forget that there are people out there who are succesfull and dont want to wait many years to fly all ships and use all modules. ccp only offers a character bazaar where they can buy toons. but buying a alien toon with 100b sp is not the same as have one created. why not let those who are willing to pay to pay for this ? most of those who are against plex for sp would also prohibit all special services like 5 star hotels, porsche cars and hunt. yes let us all live in soviet union and nordkorea . wait , what about freedom ? what about individual purpose ? the right to do what i want to do ? why i should i drive a vw golf if i can afford a porsche ? why should i sleep in a hostel if i can book a suite in a hilton ? just because the 80 % of people do it ? a clever businessman always see a possibility to maximise the profit - its the only true reason why we have all those special services in rl - because there are people who are ready to pay for it. so wake up from your idealistic world view."
7/2/2011,"how about this then... what about you buy the skill points, but must also purchase enough plex to purchase the skill books to train up said purchased skills. shoot! some books are hundreds of millions of isk each. so, instead of $15 for the 10 mil sp or whatever... you have to pay $50 for the plex to get the isk to buy the books to validate the skills.people with patients who have played the game as it was meant to be, payed for the skills, not just in time but with isk as well to be able to learn those skills.another... any skills acquired through mt, upon being podded, a percentage are lost (just like t3 skills when losing a ship) as a penalty for your eager quick to win ways.just an idea... not that it matters."
7/2/2011,"this can be best summed up as too f***ing bad. characters specialize, they are not gods, they shouldn't know everything. using one bad mechanic to justify another isn't a good argument. keep an eye on your strawman, lest it blow away. seriously, you are either a troll or a moron. i can't decide which would be more favourable in this case.in context of the game, you don't have the experience needed to fly it. it's not something you can realistically pay for. a better analogy would be paying to be fast-tracked into flying a jet-fighter without doing all the prerequisites properly. it just isn't going to happen. your freedom is irrelevant. you are free to fly whatever you want, but you aren't going to be able to fly it if you don't know how.so just because we're willing to pay to spoil the game for ourselves and others, we should be allowed to? i'd definitely pay to get sp, hypothetically, and everyone else would too. what would that do to the game?"
7/2/2011,"freedom? individual purpose? the right to do what you want to do? those are just fine things, but what you propose gives you those things at the expense of someone else. there is no liberty in that."
7/2/2011,"as it was said above the skillpoints dont make you a superior in game. you just have more opportunities. if you want to skill in a actual way its your decision, let others skill faster if they want. do you loose somehow if a small percentage of eve playerbase will skill faster ? let them be - or are you afraid that some ""bums"" will loose their ""empty bottles"" or ""mushrooms"" they collect and grow to sell on black market? those are the real evil in the game. rmt and ebay traders, bums who destroy the nice partyclub meeting. but wait, did you see someone protesting against it althought everybody knows that this is happening ? i dont. in a simple way if ccp implements sp for plex it would hammer toon growers. they sell either toons on ebay for cash or for isk and then sell this isk to ebay.one root of eve destuction would have gone. the other, bigger evil - isk farmers and bands of greed players who give systems for rent would also soon loose their profit as the plex price in the game rises their profits fall."
7/2/2011,"empty bottles and mushrooms? i don't understand the metaphors you're using, sorry. english is apparently not your first language, so i suppose i am misunderstanding.what i get out of your two recent posts is that, ccp should allow players to buy sp for rl money/plex because that is ""fair"". but is it ""fair"" to everyone else? it will cheapen the experience for the majority so that a few can have this ""freedom"".freedom for some at the expense of others is not freedom, it is subjugation. we will all be subjected to entering into the sp race. veterans in the game will spring ahead of new players. is it now fair to all those come behind us to be forced into a position where they must also buy skill points to be competitive?you will counter that they have the choice to not buy skill points, and although that may be true on the surface, the necessity will be there nagging at them, just like you feel there is a necessity to have the ability to purchase sp so that you can catch up.as for all the red herrings, keep them. i've already had my breakfast."
7/2/2011,"what on earth do you or other individuals lose by me gaining a few skill points for real money on a new toon? whatever logic your trying to muster is just overrun by emotion about all those people who have more than you in real life buying what they want. and your one claim to fame in life is a high level toon in eve by the sounds of things.i'm wealthy and i bought my way into a higher level character than you own (most probably 103mill sp). so what? can i fly most ships yes, but not all, can i fly them well nope i suck no big deal i'm learning but i'm not taking anything away from other characters who leveled their toons slowly or from others who bought characters. skill points are just restrictions on what you can fly not what you do. i'm flying around in 0.0 and there are 1000's of high level toons all flying battleships/t3's or whatever, whats so bad with a few more? will you nolonger feel special?one thing i wouldn't do is buy more sp as i was happy with my toon and happy having the massive restrictions taken off me so i can fly the ships i want and now enjoy the eve i want to play. as in fly t2 cruisers in pvp one day and tengu's the next running exploration sites behind enemy lines. i had to dump a lot of money to get this toon and people can do this already so why is it a major issue if a few newer players to get the 'option' to buy their way out of noob boredom instead of rage quiting and going to play a game that lets them control their own progression? like every other game on the market.looking forward to your failed logic reply filled with emotion of why it would destory eve."
7/2/2011,"awesome argumentation.of course it completely ignores the fact that games are fun because they enforce certain rules and every player is playing by those rules.only a complete moron would argue that a game of chess becomes more fun if you can replace all your pawns with queens by paying 15$. i mean, after all the queen is in the game already, so where could the harm be!? omfg stop limiting my game experience!!!"
7/2/2011,"lol, that's it, go in for the personal attack. in fact, assume you know to whom you are speaking and their station in the real world. ""they must be poor rl because they do not agree with my position of being able to spend real money on internet space ships!"" hehehe. yeah, i'm emotional all right, lmfao.as for what people loose, i, and others have expressed their views to you a number of times in this thread. that you reject them or fail to comprehend them isn't really my problem. if you have specific questions about what i have written, feel free to ask, but i feel no need to repeat myself.i don't care if you are wealthy, if you are poor, or what color you are, or your political party of if you can fly around the moon. ok well if you could fly around the moon i may care about that. i don't give a damn if you have 5000 sp or two hundred million. but as for the rest of it, no one gives a crap but you. any jack off can come on the internet and claim any damn thing, and even if it is true, it makes no difference to the discussion at hand. i see that this is making you quite upset and that you are forced to hide, but do be careful, someone might see your alt.eve isn't like every other game on the market. if you like them so much, go play them, as for explanations, i have done it more than once in this thread. feel free to go look them up. in fact, have your personal assistant do it for you, and have them study economics, so they can give you a brief run down with regards to the matters at hand. you do have a personal assistant, don't you? and next time you need to be emotional, feel free to do it with your main."
7/2/2011,"sabre tek is right, it happens everyday by selling and buying of toons in character bazaar. does it bother anyone ? no. so why the hell sp for plex bother you adunh slavy ? let the players have their freedom. in fact sp for plex is more friendly than a bazaar method. why ? in bazaar you have to pay the whole price and cannot be creative ( choose name, etc). purchasing sp you pay lesser price, you can buy exactly you want. its like a hire purchase - ie. you can pay 1 additional plex per month or 5 additional plex its your decision.in bazaar you cannot buy a toon ""hire purchasing"" and pay each month 3 plex a whole year. but for those who cannot pay the whole price for a toon in a bazaar but want to participate early - for them it would be the best thing in game."
7/2/2011,"well of course he is, no one wouldn't expect supporting statements from your um, group.those past characters, those in the bazaar were in the game. they contributed to the sandbox with their time and their efforts. as they gained sp, they gained the ability to have a larger impact upon the sandbox by their character's abilities. the slow steady gain of sp acts as a governor upon the economy of the game. this does not limit abilities of their rl controllers. that is what makes the sandbox come alive, make it breath, feel and think. your rl impatience is your problem, you wish to impose the unintended consequences upon everyone else.the purchase of sp for plex will create short cuts across the sandbox in order to overcome the rl impatience of some at the expense of everyone else. you are free to choose to be impatient or not, that however does not give you the right to impose your desires on everyone else. if sp can be purchased for plex, everyone will purchase sp for plex, most everyone will be required to purchase sp for plex to maintain their position in the pecking order that is society. the weights upon the governor will have been removed.as for the consequences, you do not care. that is not freedom. that is greed."
7/2/2011,"if you play chess you should know that the forces in the beginning of the game are equal and change only if a player makes a mistake. comparing chess to eve would mean that every player should start with the same material conditions and those conditions could only vanish if you make a mistake. playing chess you gain experience to think many turns forward and see combinations, but your ability to use the figures dont change. your king always can move only 1 square. in eve you also get to know how to react to the enemies strategy but your skill ""operating the figures"" also change. you can use t2 guns, special modules atc. in chess it would mean that by acquiring some master grade you are able to move your figures in other way that a chess amateur can ."
7/2/2011,"i've a radical idea here, so maybe sit down for it: how about playing the bloody game instead of whinging to get an easy mode implemented? it's just a thought. i'm out there i know, but i think playing the game could actually work."
7/2/2011,"this is a real good argument, i must admit. purchasing sp for plex will create a mass of high-skilled characters who werent there before. but how it will ruin the gameplay ? the strategy and cunning still come with game experience. i can start as a tackler with 1m sp or i can start as a tackler with 50m sp. in second variant i will be able to fly t2 ships and use t2 modules, i can try more combinations and have more fun. so the 2 variant has more ""comfort""."
7/2/2011,"have to hand it to you, it's awesome how you can formulate an answer and violently ignore the argument at hand. i'd say you're trolling, but it's just not smart enough for that.the argument is:games have rules. players ought to play these games by these same rules.as with chess, every character in eve starts out on equal footing - and you can develop it from there. using the same set of rules as everyone else.now you argue you want to pay 15$ to break those rules, and pull assumptions out of your ass for why this is not detrimental to gameplay.you are using the fact you are already allowed to bend the rules for a price as an argument for why you should be allowed to break them altogether. instead of thankfully accepting the options laid out before you, you violently argue the game should be broken to suit your personal preferences.so yeah.. go and play the effing game."
7/2/2011,"i'm imagining these people who ask for an 'i win button' in eve were the same who as small children upended board games when they started to lose. the other kids back then would stand for them cheating, and we adults still won't stand for it today. yet they keep on trying, having tantrums, and trolling when they can't get an easy mode and things don't go their way."
7/2/2011,"let's separate two things first:1. paying money for skill points but being unable to purchase them by any means in-game.2. paying money for skill points in a way that can convert to isk, such as by using plex or aur.if you think the latter is a good idea and believe that allowing any means of trading sp for isk wouldn't significantly rewrite the game, you're really not thinking it through. let's put this idea down to a bad joke and leave it out. it doesn't really need to be explained because ccp surely already know it's a terrible idea.<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>focusing on the point 1 then, like i said in my original post, the issue is that a grown character has meaning and the op is suggesting selling out that meaning. no, you don't make a game better by letting players buy the important parts of the game. skill points, and the way they grow and the way we compare our sp to the sp of every single other character in the game, are a core part of eve's gameplay. yes you can buy isk, and thus ships, guns and what have you. but in terms of growth, what is the one thing that has real meaning in eve, that every character is fairly bound to? skill points. you want to take that away just because you're impatient? that is the game. skill points are the same battle that everyone competes in. if you don't like it, don't play it. that's a better idea than suggesting we break it for everyone just so some can trade money for personal advantage in the one thing that means most.the whole reason a concept such as ""gameplay"" exists is due to deliberate restrictions of freedom. pretending freedom is an argument is nothing but typing it out for the buzzword that it is.<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>yes you can buy characters. meanwhile, if a 100 million sp character is bought, a 100 million sp character is also sold. no difference occurs in eve at all. that character, all his skill points, and all the meaning of those skill points was already there and thus no player is going to begrudge that because no character is getting ahead for money. the player does, yes, but no-one cares about that because their eve hasn't been dampened by it.<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>a final point is just to kind of say, wake up. if you make any mmo game and allow the defining measurement of a character of that game to be sourced by real life cash, it reduces the experience for everyone who doesn't pay cash. i understand that some games are like this and they do work, but in those games the problem is still there; the experience is still being reduced. the important point here is to ask yourself what does a player do then if they don't like the concept? they don't play. those games were that way from the start. the players of those games knew how it worked when they started, and if they didn't like the idea, they accepted that the game was not for them. same with eve only the other way around, because hundreds of thousands of people have accepted and signed up for eve as one of those games where they can compete with all other players, not their credit cards. that is a big deal to me. and if you don't like the idea, don't play it."
7/2/2011,"the entitlement is really thick in this thread.""i'm rich and successful, therefore the world owes me what i want!""how about this: skill points being trained over time is two fold. first, it makes money for ccp when you decide you want to train to fly a widow, because it takes months to do so, and you have to pay the subscription fees. ccp is a company that needs to make money, this is how they have chosen to do it, and so far it works. don't like it? don't play eve.second, and this is the part the ""i deserve"" crowd can't get through their coddled brains, skill points level the playing field among all rl financial situations. whether someone can afford a single account, or 30 accounts, everyone is limited by this one factor. it gives the guy in a crappy apartment looking for a way to escape his dead end life the same advantage as the 22yr old inheritance brat.if you can't deal with those two points, eve is simply not for you. just because a person is rich, doesn't mean they have a ""right"" to demand that every company they come into contact with bend over backwards and change their product to make their life easier.i wouldn't be against giving newbies a preset amount of un-alocated skill points. not enough to fly a battlecruiser, but maybe enough to get them started on the career path they choose.anything else just sounds like people want gank-insurance. again, if you can't deal with a 12 year old podding you in low sec and then talking smack in local about it, then don't play eve. being rich doesn't give you the right to any more entitlements than anyone else.the argument that your time is valuable is flat as well. skill training happens on a 24/7 basis. log in for a minute a day (or in higher skill cases, once a week) and adjust your skill queue. you people are an embarrassment to those of us who are successful and understand the idea that success doesn't equal entitlement."
7/2/2011,"it will create imbalances in the sandbox, and those imbalances will be particularly hard on newer players who are unable to as yet afford to purchase sp via the plex method. fewer people will produce the ships and modules new players need. fewer people will be able to help noobies or even care about them. the gap between new players and older players will become even more wide. the purchase of sp will become a necessity and not an option, just like learning skills used to be.as for your t1/t2 tackler example, that's a rather subjective argument, comfort and fun. i am sure there is some new player in eve right now that is having more fun than a lot of other people. i am sure there is a new player out there is who very unhappy and not having fun. just as there is some older player out there with 60 billion isk and unhappy because he does not have 500 billion isk. fun is what one chooses is fun. in eve, there is a lot of room for not only making your own fun, but how to even measure it. by creating an sp race to the top, a lot of that choice is removed because a new necessity is created. removing choices, removes freedoms."
7/2/2011,"what imho needs to be stated, or restated, is that ultimately everyone who continues to gives ccp $15/mo wants the same thing: eve should remain successful for years to come.many, if not most, people realize that this success can only come true if players who currently do not play eve have the ability to enter the game.by that logic, those pilots who have 100+ mil sp would all be quitting eve because it's not worth playing anymore since they can fly all there is to fly.i'll answer your question; because eve players do not play the game for sp. gaining sp is not an in-game goal, it's merely an attribute of the character. i think that we can all agree that most players play the game for the social aspect of the game. wait, don't hit quote yet, i know what you and others are going to say: ""you can be social from day 1 as is!""yes, you can be social from day 1 as is no one ever denied that.what you can't do from day 1 is have the option to participate on a more equal footing while maintaining your individuality as player by creating your avatar (which now matters more than it ever did), picking your own name, and allocating your own skillpoints.to all those who say ""omg the sandbox balance will be upset"" tell me how do you feel about a character sale coming with the ability to change your name, appearance, and reset all your skillpoints so they can be reallocated? nothing new would be introduced into the sandbox, the balance would remain, right? riiiiight?this is a very valid point, i applaud you for thinking about actual implications of sp purchases rather than just hop on the anti-sp-purchase bandwagon and ride along. ;)one way to address this would be that you simply cannot train certain skills with purchased sp at all. similar functionality already exists in the game preventing trial accounts from training certain skills.alternatively, and perhaps even easier to implement and more meaningful in terms on in-game economy would be to simply prevent sp to be allocated to train level 1 of any skill. that way a player has to purchase all skillbooks he or she wants.in addition it could be a combination of the two where a player has to purchase the skillbooks and can not allocate sp to certain skills.the predominant attitude of the opponents of this idea is that players should not be able to purchase skills because the opponents had to wait for them. as opinion that is perfectly valid, but when it comes to decision making it's irrational.what would be much more valuable to the discussion is to think about tangible, rather than assumed, drawbacks of allowing sp purchases and ways to address those, just like heroltior did."
7/2/2011,are you arguing for something other than buying sps now?
7/2/2011,negative.nice way to avoid answering the question though. you are one of the most vocal people in this thread about not adding things to the sandbox because it upsets the balance. the above doesn't upset the balance. so do go ahead and answer the question.
7/2/2011,"what i see is you changing the subject. why? if you are not arguing something different, what is the intent of the question? are we supposed to waste time chasing your straw men and your red herrings around?are you arguing for something other than buying sps now?"
7/2/2011,so have non-voting shares.
7/2/2011,"to avoid this, only 49% of the shares are sold on the stock market. the ceo retains 51% of the shares since they are the ones who started the corporation."
7/2/2011,"i propose a ""rank list"". this list would determine the value of a corporations shares. points would be awarded for a corporations assets as well as they war victories. if they gained enough points, they could move up in the ""rank list"" say from #10 corp. to #9 corp. this would then affect the value of their shares. (by the way i meant to quote you and i hit the report button by mistake. my bad bro.) but i like your ideas so feel free to add to my suggestion."
7/2/2011,i support this idea.a good thing would be to sell stock-options in contracts: for those who dont know : options are a kind of security against market risk but holds also a risk for speculants. for example im a miner so i need to sell minerals. i say in a contract at xx xx xx date i sell x ore for 10 isk per unit. if the price on this date is higher the buyer make more profit. if not i make profit but the main thing is i can be sure that i will be able to sell my ore.normal players could build kind of fund-corporation to collect isk and invest it in this buisness. also it would be possible to construct capital-ships this way much easier. if 1000 players give each 100m to a fund then the fund is 100b big. for this sum the foundation builds a titan or aeon and sells it on the market. every member get a profit of the investment. maybe its exist also now but it consist all on trust - with implemeting this in contract system would be much better.
7/2/2011,i forgot about shares.i'd totally get into a new purposeful corp share system.
7/2/2011,"yes for shares. can be a new class of shares if this current system can not be adapted. current ones are ""class a"", have some voting rights etc, and new ones can be ""class b"" and get listed on some exchange. maybe charge 10,000,000 isk for the listing so that not every rinky dink corp (like mine) goes up there.p.s. bond system too! (working on proposal for that btw)"
7/2/2011,"you need to make a log in bait , log out 20 ships and then get a guy to pretend be afk and then bam all log in ****ing ownage"
7/2/2011,"ccp's devs answer every question threadi have been patient due to tournaments, incarna patch and other stuff going on - but it seems ccp is letting their own thread die. it went great for a few days and some people got into it later - but then they just let it die with tons of questions not answered...but can we plz have ccp live up to their claims about players being important?"
7/2/2011,i guess you really have no idea how much work answering these questions is along with how busy ccp is. they will answer when they have the time to work on it. this issue does not require csm intervention imo.
7/2/2011,"i should probably have said modified clicks. every time i tried to bind ctrl+left click to lock targets the game only recognized control and refused to accept control+click.i just tried it again and found that to not only be true but that there are also other issues. for example, when binding control+click to target or target toggle not only does only control get bound but target toggle doesn't toggle. worse, when binding mouse4 to either target lock or target lock toggle it gets stuck in the toggle mode and stays there finally, when using mouse4 for either command binding i can also use mouse4 to untarget an object. when i use control, however, i cannot unlock a target.annoying either way you slice it with not being able to use the old combination and having both shortcuts being functionally identical with the only difference in function being based on the key bound and not the intent of the shortcut."
7/2/2011,"that's why i changed target to 'f'. has a bump i can recognize without looking at at, reasonably close for f1~f4 and qweasd, not bound to shift/alt. of course, it's more like a workaround and the fact that the hotkey is a bit bugged doesn't go away."
7/2/2011,"they did not do there jobs they did not give old hanger back or say yes or no to rmt they only hide behind legal terms ie (it is ccps plan that the noble exchange (nex store) will be used for the sale of vanity items only. there are no plans, and have been no plans, as per previous communication and csm meetings, to introduce the sale of game breaking items or enhancements in the nex store) that is not a no but not as of now all says"
7/2/2011,"you know, i agree. we don't need these ccp-influenced yes-men telling our gaming company our views on things. we should just play the game and ignore what ccp does to it. [/sarcasm]i realize this may be hard to understand, but the people in the csm do love this game and try to represent it as best as possible. they sacrifice a great deal of time and effort into coming to a consensus on various issues, and all they get out of it is a chance to see the ccp offices, which is nice but nowhere near the vacation a lot of people make it out to be.i'm definitely not a 'goon-friend' and disagree with a lot of their tactics and gameplay methodology, but i appreciate mittani for what he's done. even when i was on the csm board, i disagreed with the goon candidate quite a bit, but the csm works together despite disagreements and crushed feelings, with few rare exceptions (pattern, et al)if you don't like what the csm have been doing, then in the eve vocabulary, ""gb2wow"". not supported."
7/2/2011,i never played wow but might try it some day. i respect your point view but i just feel that csm sold out and did not do there job. show me one thang that they sayed that not a mabby or in time to many qualifier in i been in eve 8 years and i never seen it sink so low
7/2/2011,can you guys have a real look at the statement issued by ccp and find anything of any real substance in it?i can't find anything.absolutely nothing has changed since last week. unfortunately hope has blinded too many players to the smoke & mirrors used here.what about the famous goon lawyers?
7/2/2011,what is it that your looking to hear exactly?
7/2/2011,"are you serious?! holy crap a lot of you guys are whining about things like you have no intelligence. there are some basic, very basic requests from the player base....1. allow us not to take part in the incarna (walking in stations) immersion until they've resolved the effects it has. ie higher resources uses, lack of content and lack of usability vs the original hanger we had.2. do not allow for micro-transactions to make eve another ""pay to win"" game where those that can simply dump rl money into the game can become the dominating power. do not replace time/experience/commitment for rl money.3. better communicate your (ccp's) intent to the player base, and respect the fact that our voices and opinions do in fact matter. so much so that if disregarded eve may not continue to exist.between the video and the dev blog, i think we can safely say those points were greatly discussed and ccp has openly stated they will adjust to meet our requests in those areas."
7/2/2011,so right now you anchor the egg and then fill it up and then build it. you do this 10mins before downtime for no risk.how about a 6 hour build period and then it goes invincible and the egg needs to be invincible before it can switch over during downtime.during that 6 hour build period however... there's global alert factor like cynos. everyone can see the eggs in the map.
7/2/2011,you want less development of 0.0? not supported.
7/2/2011,yes i do believe people are complaining about too many stations?
7/2/2011,"this is a good idea. in similar note looting could be improved in general with a simple hot-key much like autotargeting with ctrl click. this would not at all benefit bots because you still have to clear level 4 or anom in order to get a screen full of wreaks to salvage, if a bot is used to do the former then that needs to be addressed directly, and not make the game extra cumbersome for human players (many other mmo's have autoloot functions, ones btw that you don't have to deal with as much stuff to loot)."
7/2/2011,this would enable a subcap counter to capitals and supercapitals. these torpedoes would do very little against subcaps keeping it balanced. it would also help solve the issues of smashing high sec poses.
7/2/2011,"yes its possible that null sec alliances and the super rich could skew this. however you'd hope that the csm and ccp developers would take this into account when composing the list.to the point of ""but i pay my subscription - no way will i pay for feature xyz - and why am i paying to develop dust514 and emo online anyway?!"", unfortunatly as eve is ccp's only product any funding that they use for emo or dust must inevitably come from eve subscriptions. but thats another topic of discusion.by implimenting this functionality players who want to (and can afford it) have the opertunity to fund functionality they want - above and beyond what they would get from development funded only by subscription.it offers a more constructive outlet for players feedback, rather than ""do this or i'll biomass my character and quit"" (although thats a valid form of protest), it gives the option of ""feature x for eve - how much is it going to cost""."
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,"amen!speaking as a dis-satisfied customer (i'm not a protestor or one of the raging special people on the forum), the buck stops with the ceo for the exceptional execution of a brilliant pr campaign that is highly likely to result in far more income from new customers than is going to be lost from the 7 people who actually go through with cancelling their accounts. even if the alleged 5,836 accounts in this thread have actually been cancelled, they'll still make far more than they lose.from the point of view of the directors and investors, the ceo needs a bonus, not firing."
7/2/2011,1
7/2/2011,hi have not been playing eve that long about 4-5 months now and i was leavign a station the other day to get shot at losing my ship and many othere items costing me a small fortune to replace so here is my question if you set up a bounty contract on some one do they know who set the contract up cos last thing i want to happen is for the person i am thinking to put on the wanted list to come back after me cos i do not have the skills to have a battle with the said person in question think there is about 3 and a half year diffrence in playing time thanks for the help yankoff69
7/2/2011,"don't bother with bounties, it's a broken system. if you must have revenge, hire a mercenary corp to hunt him down. as always, however. the best way to take revenge is to take it personally."
7/2/2011,"not supported - already introduced at player level. also, people would just afk sit in [ship of choice] in highsec or pos shields all day long."
7/2/2011,"this.your paragraph was painful to read.also, i would only see this as entrenching which ships people would fly, not diversify new eden."
7/2/2011,"as said already, people will just afk all day."
7/2/2011,this :-)
7/2/2011,"but ccp can't sell it for aur so not a **** show in hell.still, supported."
7/2/2011,"it does seem odd that people would be flying ships at birth. either make this change or, make everyone an infant when they start playing the game."
7/2/2011,makes perfect sense to me. you don't start flying a spaceship at age 0.
7/2/2011,and you did a bangup job too. it makes me long for the days of pos warfare.don't suppose you want to take credit for supercaps as well while you're there.
7/2/2011,"i am not ready to give up on csm, especially white tree seems like he is serious. communication could be better, even if its a have patience post.i am very curious as to their ability to get thru to ccp, i dont think they will, as ccp is very convinced they found a winning formula (and they have, new content equals $$$). that they screw over player in the process matteres less. fix the hybrids for example. what the fck am a guy to do when both rail and blasters fail. train minnie....?"
7/2/2011,lol 'fatman running'
7/2/2011,roll back to pre-dominion
7/2/2011,"if you really want to boycott ccp - just don't log into eve and unsubscribe your accounts. it's really that simple.i saw nothing in the joint statement that convinced me that eve is where i want to spend my money in the forseeable future, so i have no reason to do other than let my accounts expire. for a 2 day meeting, they sure accomplished a lotta nothing. even if one wants to take their word regarding ""no game affecting nex crap"" - was anything said even dealing with the future of eve the game? not a single thing. at the very best, eve is no better than it was prior to the most anticipated expansion ever."
7/2/2011,"i don't get the nda business.i mean, if they tell the csm anything, then that should be passed along to the players. that's kind of the whole point of the csm, i thought: player communication.the chewbacca defense comes to mind as that does not make sense!"
7/2/2011,on the other hand ... how can they discuss about something ... with this kind of infos ...nda not signed ...
7/2/2011,"i say, has anyone seen the minutes of the csm6 summit held a couple of months ago? i don't seem to be able to find them."
7/2/2011,"vile, if it's done, then you folks need to hold ccp by the nose and kick 'em in the ass to get it out the door. make 'em understand they are doing no one - least of all themselves - any favors by sitting on it and figuring ways to weasel-word stuff.enough is enough. release the damn minutes; release the damn results of the last couple days. no more prevarication or delays."
7/2/2011,"what a ****-and-bull line. the whole purpose of having unedited minutes is so we can make up our own minds as to each person's stance. we don't need anyone's crappy ""sanitizing"", we've had quite enough of that, thank you.also, no update at all on your blog since thursday, when you know the playerbase is anxious, is fail. get a hold of yourselves, jerk off, and get it over with, so you can release your ""version of events"" to the unwashed masses. thanks.edit: ""jerk off"" being used as a verb here, not referring to a person."
7/2/2011,soon tm
7/2/2011,"i would really appreciate an unedited version as well. if this ends up being a publicity stunt where every controversial statement was removed and/or altered by ccp to serve as a damage control measure, rather than open communication, it is utterly useless to me."
7/2/2011,"the purpose of minutes is not to record events, but to protect people. don't expect anything to be presented in a way that could be unflattering to ccp."
7/2/2011,"just a wild idea.when a ship is down to structure the aggressor could have the option to launch a boarding party. at this point the ship becomes invulnerable. it is then queued into the ""dust alt"" game where people can either join to attack or join to defend the ship. the setting would be the inside of the ship with its miles of walkways and rooms and the gameplay similar to call of duty. the final outcome would either give the pilot 30 mins immunity or turn the ship over to the aggressors with the same immunity.i know it's a bit far fetched but from a sales and marketing point of view i should think that most pvp corps would also purchase this game too just so that they didn't have to rely soley on mercs to save their ship.it would also give a much closer relationship between eve and dust."
7/2/2011,"dear csm, first off, thank you for your efforts in talking to ccp and helping fix the incarna-mess. while i never shared the sense of doom most people seemed to have, it is certainly reassuring to see things in print.while reading the dev blog, one thing struck me again that has been irking me for quite a while. ccp must understand that dev blogs are not press releases. because, sorry to say, at least some dev blogs read like press releases, at least in those cases when ccp wants to make double sure the ""message is not diluted"" and to express a ""clear position"".take the recent dev blog. what prevented them from simply saying, ""we realize we made some heavy mistakes, we're sorry for the grief it caused on both sides."" instead we get hogwash like ""ccp acknowledges that communication surrounding the launch of the virtual goods store should have been better."" yes, i know that's nothing less than pr for ""shucks, we done messed up bad."" but that's the point. particularly when we are concerned that ccp (upper levels) have lost touch with their playerbase, a healthy dose of ""talking like the people helps make you one of the people (at least to some extent)"" could prove very beneficial. and i do not mean they should get a gm to do translate their pr into common, i mean it in the sense of if they stop making things sound good, they may see they're not good.tl;dr: ccp, please talk less like politicians and more like honest people. pr verbiage was created by and large for the purpose of making it look less like you're admitting a mistake when you admit you made a mistake.discuss.

7/2/2011,please do not feed them any more before releasing the may notes.
7/3/2011,"i understand the need to redo and update aura's original 'basic training' tutorial known as 'crash course'. i think the aura npe (new player experience) is much better and a step in the right direction compared to the old 'basic training'. however, the mission series 'the endless battle' was completely different even though the agents offering it were known as 'tutorial agents'. there was no need to 'retire' those agents.the way it used to be for a new player entering the game.'crash course'(basic training)players could repeat this at any time in 1 of 12 (3 per faction) specific solar systems. aura would train players in ship and station controls in 2 different locations within that solar system. in space, players were sent to a specific training site to destroy a single npc in simulated combat (no damage to player). after that while still in the training site, players were instructed to do some mining where a couple more training npc's would attack. after destroying them and mining some ore, players would then return to station for instruction about the various station services.no corporation or faction standing incurred for completing that. aura would then refer players to 1 of 60 (15 per faction) event agents known as 'tutorial agents' who offered the 2-part mission series 'the endless battle'.'the endless battle'(2-part mission)this was the new players very first 'real' mission which could only be completed once per agent in the life of the character. part 1 was a simple encounter mission against a single npc which when destroyed, would drop a small specific item to be returned to agent. part 2 was a simple courier mission to transport a small specific item to a nearby solar system.a small amount of corporation and faction standing incurred for completing that. the agent would then refer players to 1 of 60 (15 per faction) career agents for more advanced training on the various careers available.basically, the incorrectly named 'tutorial agents' didn't give any instruction or information to new players other than refer them to the career (advanced tutorial) agents. the old 'tutorial agents' were actually political liaisons for their specific faction. those 60 agents were a good source for gaining a 1 time faction standing increase.i propose 2 different options for the 60 tutorial agents (15 per faction) and their mission 'the endless battle', 1 simple and 1 complex.option 1 (simple):bring the old 'tutorial agents' back out of retirement and change their title to 'political agents'. have them continue offering 'the endless battle' mission with a slight change to their ending dialog so they don't refer players to the career agents (currently done by aura npe).option 2 (complex):have the new 'political agents' (15 per faction) split up into 5 different agent levels, 3 agents per level from level 1 to level 5. have them all offer 'the endless battle' mission series but have the mission difficultly and reward increased to match the higher agent levels.these new 'political agents' and their mission offers can only be completed once per agent in the life of the player's character, just like the old 'tutorial agents'.the code is already written and with some slight programming, option 1 could be implemented very easily. option 2 would of course take more time and work to implement but is still doable.thank you all for taking the time to read this proposal.dmc"
7/3/2011,guess i could support my own proposal.dmc
7/3/2011,i support this as well. it's well thought out and doesn't appear to have any game-ending standing balance issues. i like it.dx
7/3/2011,"currently living in sov null convected to npc null, i am now aware of a major problem to any industry in sov (player owned-run) null-sec.is the huge lack of decent stations, or multiples of them. even if mineral yields and productivity improves for making items, and lower taxes it still will not work because the lack of decent stations to produce things or do much of anything. for player owned stations you have a choice between production, reprocessing, science, and offices. compared with npc stations that can do just as much (and more in different areas at the same station). having to reprocess minerals in one station, and then haul it to another is butts, and makes for a horrible factory. add to that, the hard and arbitrary limit of one station per system.one npc system can have 3 factory stations, all with reprocessing capability's in addition to plenty of slots for each one. that can sustain a small alliances needs. stations in null sec should be just as good as any in high sec, to start with, and upgraded even better. and multiple in the same system.if ccp is serious, it can't be the same old same old for stations. in the near future we can walk in stations but the whole issue of them sucking in null will remain the same. stop nerfing and making the end game content suck, and well it will be more livalbe."

7/3/2011,"on first reading this i thought erk, but after some consideration this is acctually a good idea. for the reasons outlined by the op, and for alot of the same reasons as removing learning skills.the idea of learning boosters is excellent (especially if, the better ones at least, are player manufactured).i'm not convinced that you can leave slot 1-5 only to the faction sets. its possible that you might need to consider new task based implants for these slots. pi, s&i, manufactureing, incarna, more combat implants are just some of possible alternate uses for these slotsalso support the idea of implant bpo/bpc's.more combat is good, and the loss of a pod will still sting from the clone fee - and whatever combat implants you have in, and the boosters floating in your pod goo."

7/3/2011,good luck.
7/3/2011,i would like this feature back asap.
7/3/2011,"these remedials can endlessly infer whatever they want in regards to your proposal humpink. fwiw, very well said. you don't need to defend it, it's a logical step in the right direction for increasing revenue for ccp (without breaking the game) which is really what this thread is about. trolls will troll, regardless of if they even understand what they are trolling about.your correct in your assumption that indifference and/or non-response to a heated topic is essentially acceptance. older character players won't like it, but too bad really.this gets my vote. +1"
7/3/2011,"no, i am not, i am merely establishing that your reason for opposing sp purchases is different from your stated reason, which affects the credibility of your argument.it would have been trivial for you to answer the question, yet you are dancing round and round to avoid answering it because you know exactly that either answer would pin you down into taking a position that you do not want to take.i am in full support of in principal being able to purchase sp for cash straight from ccp with the understanding that details and limitations need to be worked out.you made the argument that such sales would upset the sandbox while at the same time stating that character sales through the bazaar are sandbox neutral. i am asking whether you would support character renaming, ability to change appearance, and reset of skillpoints every time a character is sold on the bazaar since according to you all those things would be sandbox neutral."
7/3/2011,its actually about 1mill sp per 17th day.
7/3/2011,"ok, let's put this in perspective. so, i have to work at my job making widget ""x"" for 4 years in order to be ""better"" at making widget ""t""? last i checked, practice made perfect; not linear time[wait] irrespective of effort. not meaning to cause insult here; think about it in the context of just what you state here. the more you do something at your job, the better you get at it (yes, time[effort]). an example comes to mind. i can imagine very few folks played swg here? anyway, i played a year or so at first release, and they had a multi tiered ""if player fires the pistol"" and the code looked and saw ""if you have 0 points in it, then you have a 1% chance to increase a point; at 20 points, a 10% chance"", etc, on until you got full pistol, then you could go work on rifle, and gain in that proficiency, etc. that is closer to real life, if we are to use real life examples to compare against. if i played more, then i got more proficient at something quicker than someone else. no, that does not equal purchasing sp. that wasn't the point. just pointing out that waiting x time for a sp pool to fill is not really anything but a game mechanic to give a player a means of having something to look forward to. that put everyone on the same playing field of ""everyone has to wait the same time to get x skill"". problem isn't on a 1:1 basis. the problem more relates to how ccp gets more players interested in the game. like it or lump it (me included), ccp has to do things that we aren't going to always agree with in order to attract more business. there is always fall out, and negative response; but those margins don't (hopefully) compare to the positives. that is the gamble that ccp has to take, and make.as an aside, fwiw, swg finally closes it's doors this dec for making a catastrophic game mechanics change. they lost all the major guilds/player base of the old-timers over the last 2 years, and didn't manage to attract new players. they tried to compete with wow.or, perhaps vets have given this some serious thoughts, and are trying to look at both sides of the argument, and find too many pros, and not enough cons. we talk it out, and if some good rationale shows up to support how the negatives would be permanent in nature, rather than temporary influx of balance changes, then sure, i'd be persuaded more to the negative view.harsh, and emotional response. some of us like the concept of sp sales, but not outright ""here, buy bazillions of sp for $1"" kinda thing. i am talking about severely regulated, limited in scope means of jump-starting n00bs into a drake, at most sort of thing. then, charge them an arm and a leg to do it. give them something that closes the gap a little so my buds aren't so annoyed as to walk away. but, give them more than just enough to hobble in a cheap t1 frig. give them a chance to spend serious major bucks (years worth of sp, costs a years worth of dollars; limit on ""can't spend purchased sp on /this/ skill regulations)i can imagine in some folks eyes, your statement then applies to everyone who buys plex for isk infusions? or, the bazaar high sp char purchases? they cheated the system by having a high sp toon insta-grat for play, or whatever."
7/3/2011,except buying sp gives you 100% control of where it goes. you also get the benifits of choosing how the characters name and looks. buying sp outright is the superior choice.
7/3/2011,slap in the face of long time vets? hardly. they are too busy busting balls in null making tons of isk and are playing for free.anyway the whole time based skilling(the biggest reason for lack of sub retention) is just to milk as much money as possible out of the game. in the grand sceme of things they would have made more money if they sped up the time to catch up to 6+month players like every other mmo does.
7/3/2011,"arguing on the internet may be like the special olympics, but it's still pretty fun.ok, let's do this! *psyched*it takes several decades to learn all there is to learn and fly all there is to fly. it doesn't matter how long you play, there's always something else to train for and try. many people are so rich in isk that they could very likely max out every skill before they run out of cash, and those that aren't that rich can still get all the important ones they want. but again, why should we let them skip to exactly what they want without properly experiencing the game first? this game requires a specific mindset, and the players have to fit the game, not the other way around. that's the way it always has been, and that's why i supported giving them a reasonable pool of skillpoints to spend to get started rather than being able to pay your way past the oldest vet. such a pool would decrease the barrier of entry while at the same time determining if the player has the correct mindset. eve is a niche game, altering it to cater specifically for mainstream players will just alienate a lot of the old playerbase. cosmetically it's not as dramatic as the swg nge, but they made big changes to the foundations of the sandbox too, and look where that got them.this is irrelevant to the argument, but i'll address it anyway: another reason why the playerbase as a whole accepts character transfers is that you often can't get exactly what you want with them, so there is a price for taking a shortcut, namely that you may be able to have another face, but you're always branded by your name and the choice of sp that came before."
7/3/2011,"dear humpink omaristos.you have outright dismissed the general attitude of the player base, and circumvented any argument made against your idea by simply calling them ""shortsighted"" or telling the people they are lying to themselves.so allow me to present my side of the argument:you are a stupid man and this is a stupid idea.hope i've helped, no need to reply, because much like you there is nothing that can be said to change my mind.fortunately, my mind doesn't have to be changed, this isn't in the game, it hasn't been in the game, and it won't be in the game (no i don't care what you say, sales of alts don't count, we're back to the part where you are stupid, shut up, no one cares).perhaps theres another game you're looking for, since this one doesn't suit your tastes."
7/3/2011,"correct me if i am wrong. now your argument is that those who play the game for pvp and have maxxed their skills for the ships they want to fly get some sort of sense of accomplishment from continuing to train industry skills?why don't you just go ahead and admit that your reasoning that having high sp removes the sense of playing eve doesn't follow. people play the game for whatever their reasons are but the passive feature of unattended gaining of skillpoints isn't close to the a reason for many if not most.you say waiting for a few years is proper, i say that it isn't. see where we are at with that? the term ""proper"" has no real meaning because it is 100% subjective.my answer to your question is 1) because if implemented sensibly it will result in a larger player base hence more people to play with and more monthly income for ccp and 2) because they will pay for it (also more one time income for ccp).you cared enough to reply. looks like i got a rise out of you without even trying. thanks for bumping this thread."
7/3/2011,"yes.no.never said it was a reason, if anything it is a moderator to stop people from experiencing all the content there is to experience at one time.the term ""proper"" is also irrelevant to the argument. removed, the argument still has the same overall impact.for how long?i agree with grath. you are the shortsighted, deluded one."
7/3/2011,"oh i see, you were trying to play little games, and now you're going to try and tell me what my arguments were, aren't you?yep, pretty much as suspected. i didn't take any position because your little gambit was transparent. moving the goal posts around is against the rules. do try to keep up.oh ... you're doing a fine job of establishing a lack of credibility, it just happens to be your self to whom you do it.i'm against it, there are no details to be worked out.and i refused to answer you and i still refuse to answer you. your behavior in this thread has marked you as anything other than a honest debtor. do not now be upset that your behavior haunts you."
7/3/2011,"it's just that you don't get to tell someone who pays for entertainment which way that person is supposed to enjoy that entertainment. that makes no sense any which way one would look at it.in terms of income for ccp that's irrelevant since they pay up front for the skills at a premium over those who acquired them over time.stats read elsewhere have shown that new players tend to not make it past 6 months and i will go out on a limb by saying that it has nothing to do with the monthly subscription or the community but everything with the fact that a player who starts today is bound to be frustrated between the two choices she has, pay to wait or pay to buy second hand.of course you do, no answer necessary, it's obvious what's going on. if anything i find this amusing because here you were with your pseudo intellectual think of the children ... erm ... sandbox attitude when in reality you are just like most everyone else in here who is opposed because they don't want someone else to have something instantly that they had to wait for. i almost feel bad for having you called out like that, but oh well, life goes on.in ccp's latest pr stunt they said the following:notice how it says that they will not introduce anything but vanity items for the nex store? crafty, isn't it. that paragraph is specific to the nex store, not to eve in general.the second part is even more telling. given that plex are already being sold ccp clearly does not define the cash for isk as an unfair advantage. when i read that dev blog my smile was bigger than jokers. it obviously is an advantage that one can pay cash to get isk but ccp doesn't find it unfair because the opportunity presented applies to all players equally. you can buy isk or you can grind it.sp won't be sold via the nex store, they will just put it into account management to get around contradicting their own statement. then they will come out and say that sp for cash won't be an unfair advantage because everyone has the option to pay for sp, wait for sp, or spend isk for sp via bazaar.the latest dev blog is bringing us one step closer to sp for cash. ;)"
7/3/2011,no on skill points for $$$. it is an exploit which will break the game.
7/3/2011,"i never gave you my answer one way or the other. you have no idea what it is. you are making assumptions because it fits your preconceived notions. you just want to insult, tell people what they think and play your little straw man games. sorry kiddo, but is you who are getting called out. nice try though.btw, when did you stop beating your wife?as for your assumption about sp for cash because of the wording, you must really be quite desperate for some emotional points for your little ego to try that. feel free to get your hopes and dreams all stirred up, the sooner you are frustrated and back to whatever theme park you came from, the happier you'll be."
7/3/2011,"*harvest brain*- biomasses a character and making half of the sp availible to your other characters.this way no sp is created out of thin air. for example:i buy a 120million sp character, i harvest his brain and the character is destroyed. i then get 60m sp to distribute on my other characters on that account."
7/3/2011,new and old players buy characters of the bazaar already. buying sp outright gives you better control of it and other stuff. so your point is irrelevant.
7/3/2011,"so, humpink omaristos, i take it you're too much of a coward to make this suggestion by posting with your main character? figures.let's face it, this is a laughably stupid idea. for the umpteenth time, if you feel entitled to an advantage in this game because you have piles of money, then buy plex, sell it, buy a character like everybody else. there is a deliberate, well thought out reason for this - ccp makes money from the plex you buy, the guy who buys the plex from you for isk benefits, and the guy whose character you buy benefits. do you know what massively multiplayer means?i agree with grath - you're an idiot for suggesting this."
7/3/2011,"it's the plex vs. aurum argument. in the case of selling a character, no extra sp is being injected into the eve economy (in the broadest sense of the term). a character's ownership (= license to use, to be precise) is basically the only thing that changes hands. in the case of buying sp, however, you create sp from thin air; essentially -- just like running a money printing press -- causing inflation (of the value of sp, in this case). and it will mean a great disturbance in the force, game-balance wise.so, a big resounding no to this proposal."
7/3/2011,the game is already badly unbalanced due to general ship issues and a large portion of players with loads of sp. if anything it would slightly balance it.
7/3/2011,"you're implying that players with loads of sp are an imbalance to the game and have it accepted without thought, get it under the radar, so to speak. not gonna work."
7/3/2011,"technically they are. two equally skilled pilots with the same ship fight each other, the only difference is 1 has 6 months worth of sp and the other a year. who wins? with no cap it takes a long time to reduce the impact of that other players 6 month head start and obviously much longer vs a 1+ year head start. that causes imbalance."
7/3/2011,"anyone selfish, lazy and stupid enough to support this p2w crap, needs to be removed from eve, as i would scuff off dogsh!t from my boots, after being unfortunate enough to tread in it."
7/3/2011,"we already have pay to win, pay ccp money for plex buy toon = win? no it equals pay for freedom from limited sp and years of boring limited gameplay.we already have this, the only reason we're suggesting it as a good thing as it will help the new player base get involved in eve more instead of rage quiting cause eve sucks for new players, which it does!"
7/3/2011,"all i'm hearing from you is ""i ignore reality, and want easy mode regardless of the consequences! wah! wahhhhh! i don't want to have to play the game! wahhhhhhh! i want to cheat! wahhhhhhhhhhhh!""sorry, no - you don't get to have your way with everything. you're going to have to play the game just like everyone else. you are not a special snowflake and you will not be accorded special treatment.*sighs* this is what happens when you raise a generation without being told no, and given honest answers about their limitations. they think they can have their way whenever they like, and when things don't go their way, they don't try to adapt or learn from their experiences. instead they blame everyone and everything else but themselves.talk about massive entitlement issues... uggg! *disgusted look*"
7/3/2011,"don't have our way with ""everything""? what else are you referring to? or are you talking about some rl issue you are facing and you can't stop yourself from bringing it into the game.it's not ""special"" treatment when it is available to every player. that should really be obvious."
7/3/2011,"it's special treatment when you think you have the right to ruin eve just because you're too lazy, selfish or inept to play it. as for your lame attempt at turnabout... wellll... it was just lame. i guess laziness infects all aspects of your life, if you couldn't be arsed to think up a better counter.so i'm sorry (i'm not actually - it's only a polite saying), but no. no, no, no. you may not have easy mode. go play an ultra-casual mmo if you can't hack it in eve.only a spoilt brat with massive entitlement issues would think destroying everyone else's game instead of moving on to something more suitable for them, is acceptable behaviour."
7/3/2011,"originally by: toovhonall i'm hearing from you is ""i ignore reality, and want easy mode regardless of the consequences! wah! wahhhhh! i don't want to have to play the game! wahhhhhhh! i want to cheat! wahhhhhhhhhhhh!""sorry, no - you don't get to have your way with everything. you're going to have to play the game just like everyone else. you are not a special snowflake and you will not be accorded special treatment.*sighs* this is what happens when you raise a generation without being told no, and given honest answers about their limitations. they think they can have their way whenever they like, and when things don't go their way, they don't try to adapt or learn from their experiences. instead they blame everyone and everything else but themselves.talk about massive entitlement issues... uggg! *disgusted look*you want me to adapt and learn to live within the limits of a system i don't like? you suggest i accept when someone says ""no"" to me and just live with the rules i'm given? wow you just told me a lot about yourself right there.you just do what your told in life uh? do what your boss says, i know you don't have a business, don't question authority and believe everything your government and the news says is the 100% truth. and just be happy with the rules/limits people put on you. make sure you don't try to break out and be something different you might achieve something! well done your a sheep.i as a snowflake as you say, do feel i'm special, if being special means i'm a person who doesn't want to play a game over half a decade of my life just to play the endgame content. i didn't want to play your waiting game and so i spent a couple of days income on a buying a 100mill sp toon (tax deductible business research). so no i don't have to wait, yes i did get special treatment and yes this is already part of the game mechanics and rules. my efforts in the real world were a far better investment of my time than spending years waiting in eve and running low level repetitive game content or checking on my skill training daily and going and playing some other game while my ingame character levels by itself without my interaction. (which when you think about it is absolutely stupid).just ask any of the 10 million players in world of warcraft if blizzard put in the rules that their ingame grinding had zero benefit to their level growth as a character and that to use that new sword or shield they simply had to wait 2.5 months in the real world even though they could afford it now. do you really think blizzard would have as many players? blizzard cater to the new players with a wonderful advancement system whereby gamers can advance at a pace they are happy with based on their efforts/knowledge & skill. they do not have endless limitations on their game play like eve does. hence why they have so many gamers. sure eve's a different game but the basic game play concept is the same, if blizzard put endless restrictions on new players of wow and new players were stuck in 1-10 level game play for 1 year the average new player would hate the fact they can't advance their character in any meaningful way and quit! as happens with 100's of new players quitting eve daily/weekly for this very reason."
7/3/2011,"man, so many people seem to be behind your idea.oh wait...its funny that you talk about how only a tiny portion of the community use the forums, and an even tinier portion (like less than 10) support your idea.glad this one will never make it on the csm list.have a nice day!"
7/3/2011,"here's a tissue so you can wipe the foam off of your mouth.it's pretty clear that to you this isn't about sp for cash. there's an underlying issue that gets you so riled up. you are the less favored sibling, aren't you? your parent handed everything to your brother but made you work for it and whatever you did was never enough while he didn't even have to ask and they just gave him everything!man, that's quite some baggage to carry around but there's no point in bringing it into the game. yes, you are probably the smarter one between the two of you, but he's not socially awkward and that's why they favor him over you. then there's the emo rage issue which really isn't an appealing character trait so you really can't be too harsh on your parents for loving your brother more.anyway, ineptitude doesn't apply since it doesn't take expertise to train skillpoints. lazyness doesn't apply either because it takes no active action to train skillpoints. selfishness? sure, wanting a character which will fit one's preferences for name, looks, and skillpoint distribution is selfish, you will not find me arguing otherwise.ruining the game? all the evidence the opponents of sp for cash have is some magic 8 ball.here's some evidence the supporters have that demonstrates that the sandbox easily deals with anything thrown at it:t2 bpo nerf, or if you are ccp you call invention a feature of an expansion. how many people took to the forums and predicted the complete collapse of the economy if everyone had the ability to build t2? we are still here, years later.sov 4 nerf + titan dd, or if you are ccp you call the changes a feature of an expansion.recall the rage about the inability to build titans in absolute safety? eve was supposed to be doomed, yet there are more titans than ever and players are still in 0.0 en mass.pi, or if you are ccp you call players making pos fuel a feature of an expansion.it was doom and gloom on the forums, depopulating of 0.0 was predicted, mass unsubs, the fall of eve. obviously none of it happened.this isn't 2003, lots of other activities compete for one's limited leisure time. the current sp for money & time business model is no longer viable. anyone who is able to rationally look at it with long term sustainability in mind recognizes that."
7/3/2011,"wow, this thread is 7 pages deep and the thread starter is still here arguing his point... cudos to you sir, cudos indeed.personally i am not entirely decided on this issue, but i also lean heavily towards selling sp for cash at least to some extent, most of all for the reason that the real-time learning is quite a detriment to bringing new players to the game.but obviously, an all-out sale of sp could prove harmful. still, i think there are ways to do this without bringing down armageddon.say, sp are not sold directly, but rather as a buff to sp gain per hour. that way, even the uber-rich person with a house full of cash that everyone is afraid of won't be able to jump into his titan right away. (well yes he can, he can just buy a character. but anyway.) and the new players can decide to shell out some extra cash or isk and get a little sooner into the more interesting gear.also, say sp are not sold infinitely, but only to a certain limit. that could be either only to characters below a certain level of sp, or it could simply mean only a limited number of sp can ever be bought by any one character (or account?). whether that's 1 mil, or 5 or 10 or whatever is a matter of fine tuning.finally, say, sp are not cheap. i really don't know how to balance this properly, but i think the op has a good suggestion by offering sp for the same money they'd have cost when learned during a month of subscription. mind you, i think when buying sp directly you get less for your money than when investing the same money into a subscription and training the slow way, because you miss out on the gameplay that accompanies growing into better ships and gear. and of course, if a noob were to shell out $10.000 just because he can and buy a titan and a pilot to boot, that only means one thing usually: a titan wreck, a podkill and lots of ridicule in local and on the forums. and a lot of salvage and loot for the market."
7/3/2011,yea this is pretty much the reason i really dont care is sp is sold or not. experienced and proven pilots will always fly the big ships over some one who bought the sp. as we both have already stated it doesnt solve the real reason more people dont play this game.
7/3/2011,this idea will definitely add another dimension to the market and as such i support this
7/3/2011,i appreciate the thought that's gone into this and would add that extra missing dimension to the game that corporations have been lacking.
7/3/2011,+1 it be nice have stock market
7/3/2011,very nice.
7/3/2011,i have wanted this for a long time.
7/3/2011,"as it stands, you receive gcc for rr'ing corp mates, alliance mates, and fleet mates who are pirates (-5.00 or lower) even though they are not gcc. now that is a problem considering this makes gate guns shoot you even though the pirates are innocent at that time. this is a big factor for low sec players bc it adds wasted time having to wait out gcc for repping your tank ship after a fight or a mission. that is 15mins everytime you have to spend at a load waiting 15mins just to move on without gate guns shooting you everytime you enter a new system. not to mention, if you're moving to the next fight that happens 5 jumps over and you're gcc bc you repped an innocent pirate; starting at half armor or shields as a logi jumping into a fight is just plain stupid.what needs to change:remote repping mechanics need to change so that you only receive gcc, and therefore gate/station/concord aggro, when you rr someone who is currently gcc."
7/3/2011,"does remote sensor boosting also give agro? i ask because if the same mechanic applies, it may impact more than just friendly reps."
7/3/2011,all assisting modules put on an outlaw player will give you gcc in high/low sec.
7/3/2011,"as an anti-pirate i am running out of the small gang pirates that my small gang can handle. i have many friends who are full blown -10 pirates and they of course would like more prey as well.the problem: we need to get more people into low sec.the classic suggestion: nerf rewards in high sec or buff rewards in low sec. people talk about removing ice from high sec or removing level 4's. that won't work by itself. as a parts time carebear i won't take a pith x-type fitted faction bs or maurader into low sec. i won't mine in my defenseless hulk in low sec. that is just asking for a gank. however, i would, as a carebear, get into low sec safely and undock from a station safely i surely would bring a t2 fitted bs or maybe even a faction geared one. hell, some people will still bring some nice stuff in as they see the risk/reward.we need to buff gate guns to the point they will wtfpwn anything that goes gcc at the gate or station. inluding cap ships. maybe even concord only at the gates and stations for uber nuets and ecm. these concord will not scram but will web. you are allowed to get away and it is not an exploit. you might warp off and dock (if your ship can survive the few seconds before you dock) or you can hide at a safespot until your gcc runs out)this sounds like a pirate nerf. it isn't. lazy incompetant pirates camp gates and no one likes station games. everyone wants more quality pvp. if more bears will haul thier goods into low sec because they can get in the markets will be populated more for mission runners and miners and whomever to actually live and risk thier ships in low sec. miners still wont go to static belts in low sec thats dumb, but i would scan down a gniess site and take my hulk and just watch for probes. (now that they are on overview) and as a combat scanner i know i can still sneak my probes in and catch someone who is slippin and get my probes off directional before they even knew i scanned them down.then you can remove level 4's from high sec. and make comets scanable and you mine ice from them. scanning will be something pirates will have to do but at least they can kill stuff. and i can set traps. :)more targets, more pirates, more anti pies, better eve.discuss"
7/3/2011,definetly low sec needs a buff. i find low sec the most ricky part of eve. still this needs a good brainstorming.
7/3/2011,"i like this approach to increasing the population of low sec. also note it would increase the number of carebear types moving through low sec, on their way to somwhere else. an interdictor along a gate-gate axis would be a very interesting trap."
7/3/2011,"+1gate guns should also web, scram and ecm, as well as one-shot titans."
7/3/2011,"yes. the bigger part of the ""crisis"" is over. give them a chance to find their feet again, so to speak. remember that whatever you think of the mittani and the other reps, they're not stupid. they wouldn't have been elected if they were."
7/3/2011,i would start using hotkeys if this was implemented.
7/3/2011,this^^+1
7/3/2011,supported.it's bad programming practice not to have hotkeys working both ways.
7/3/2011,this is the formalized proposal of the thread from eve general discussion board:
7/3/2011,"you, sir, are an idiot. not supported."
7/3/2011,"this is crazy... you, sir, are misinformed and just raging."
7/3/2011,"captain's quarters: we discussed the hardware and lighting issues within the cq and we were satisfied that they were being addressed. we were pleased when torfi announced that the current ""disabled incarna door"" will be replaced with an environment that will provide similar functionality and performance to the pre-incarna hangar, and this environment will be available until incarna performance is similar to pre-incarna performance. while the final details and timelines have not been worked out, ships will once again spin all over new eden.source"
7/3/2011,was drunk at the time i posted this after solbering up and rereading dev blog i close this.note self stay off fourms when drinking
7/3/2011,"hello,i havent contacted csm before and was wondering what might be the best way of reaching out to you privately about an eve concern. the issue involves and exploit that ccp seems to be ignoring or condoning. several pilots report having been given the run around or straight blown off when filing petitions. we have also recieved multiple, varying, and conflicting responses about the exploit, and about when or if it will be resolved. we as a community don't want to bring this onto the public forums as we think it will inflame the abuse of the exploit. can i talk privately to a csm member to explain the situation? in game eve-mail will suffice. thanks!!"
7/3/2011,"evemail them, look for contact info on their blogs, or dm them on twitter"
7/3/2011,has the csm had any meetings with ccp (other than the emergency one last week) as there are no minutes for meetings for this year as the last were in 2010. in the past 3 years by mid year there have been 2 sets of minutes already. is the csm not actually communicating the results of meetings or are the csm too busy to write the meetings up? or has ccp just not had any meetings with the csm?just curious
7/3/2011,"well, it's very safe to say that, in my opinion at least, that csm have been slammed against the wall so hard with what's been going on that it's just too much to keep up with right now. rest assured, though, those minutes will be released :)"
7/3/2011,"we have expressed our deep concern about potential grey areas that the introduction of virtual goods permits, and ccp has made a commitment to discuss any proposals that might fall into these grey areas in detail with csm at the earliest possible stage.after the cq ccp wil introduce community area's aka bars:how much aur do we need to spend to even think about ""enjoying"" that iteration ?"
7/3/2011,i thought you said something else.
7/3/2011,not gay bars
7/3/2011,"before i even think about getting some new hardware and possibly renewing my subs (which is doubtful), i was wondering if anyone could clarify or link me up to the answers to the following questions:1. are extra fittings (or any other 'grey area' items) being considered as 'vanity' items. could vanity items have a clear and concrete definition from ccp?2. why should the word of ccp be trusted now when just last year we were told no microtransactions whatsoever? or as another poster aptly put it, what's the expiration date on that promise? a year from now?3. you formerly charged a subscription fee to access all the content of the game. now you're charging a subscription fee, but limiting access to certain portions of the game (i don't care if you call them vanity) unless people pay extra on top of that subscription fee. how can you do that and not feel like total bastards? how did you expect people to react to it? i expect that sort of thing from a f2p game, not from eve. not from the eve i used to play.not paying another cent until questions are answered in more detail. and no, you can't have my pixels."
7/3/2011,methinks you're just mad you wasted so much ammo protesting nothing.ccp said no on pay-to-win items. they said they'll address the performance concerns with cq. they said they'd bring back ship-spinning somehow.the only thing you're right about is that nothing has changed since last week.
7/3/2011,"as per csm thread awhile back, the opposite is the direction ccp wants. specifically, they want more industrial/economic self-sufficiency in nullsec, which in the current system, will mean more outposts. on the other side, people want nullsec to be a barren frontier where you can go days between meeting other pilots.you can't have both with the way the game works now, although i've got a reform package up that should make both the pro-industrialization and pro-frontier perspectives happy."
7/3/2011,"i propose that ccp allow shares to be bought and sold on the market instead of only given away. this would allow for the creation of an actual in-game stock market along with the items market we have now. if shares could be bought and sold with isk, players could invest in corporations. the players could also directly affect the price of a corporation's shares by their own actions. this would include corporate wars, monopolies on resources, etc. to determine the value of a corporation's shares, there could be a ""rankings list"". where a corporation was ranked on this list would be determined by points. a corporation would be awarded points for their assets along with their war victories. however, only 49% of the corporations shares would be sold on the market. the other 51% would remain in the ceo's possession. overall, i believe this will allow for a more dynamic and real stock market in the eve universe."
7/3/2011,"you see if this was posted in 2003 you would had tons of replies. problem is all these people are gone and there only monoclers and 2007's and these are not hardcore sci-fiers mostly.somehow eve is not ""the game"" anymore. part of what made eve ""the game"" for me was the anticipation that someday eve would expand to become the space game we all wanted.it's not going to happen. not with ccp on the helm."
7/4/2011,put money into eve and not elsewhere.
7/4/2011,"supported.i'd like a client that works, not something shiny that i can't play the game on."
7/4/2011,"when you think about what you wrote for a moment you will come to realize that it has to be incorrect. unless current users miraculously expand their circle of people they know current users simply don't have anyone else to tell about the game anymore. it has already been done and the word of mouth resource is largely exhausted.totally new players don't stick around because frankly the game sucks for them in part due to mechanics in part due to the ""community"".shiny new stuff attracts new customers who were previously outside of the area of influence of existing customers. it is inevitable that in order to maintain growth eve has to move further from the niche and close to mainstream because mainstream is where the money is. it doesn't matter if they lose your $15/mo if they pick up $150 mainstream dollars a month instead. that should really be obvious."
7/4/2011,this topic was startet @2011.04.18.did something happens after that ?no. it's like i told you.
7/4/2011,this is thread is still going here is my idea for the thorax.
7/4/2011,thanks.
7/4/2011,no
7/4/2011,no.
7/4/2011,no
7/4/2011,"no !!!from a rather new player, don't bring in that stupidness."
7/4/2011,1
7/4/2011,"i feel very strongly for these points. for me it has nothing to do with computer power as many people are emphasizing, it's just the integrity of the game that matters. i actually really like cq! i just don't like how trivial it is for the capsuleer."
7/4/2011,1
7/4/2011,i support this
7/4/2011,"i support this. i don't need the cutscenes, even though they would be nice as long as you could skip through them. to bad that the recent csm meetting has revealed that even if they put some sort of hanger/spinning view back in a couple months, which we may have to access from the cq for all we know. it and this is the big part will only be temporary until they fine tune the preformance issues. ccp's view on this point of forced cq kinda tells me all i need to know about where they're heading and how they feel about us :("
7/4/2011,eve is a sandbox world that needs constant and focused development.it's not a scripted game that you can leave to go develop other things.
7/4/2011,"well i read through most of the posts in detail, and scanned all of them and didn't see any mention of this, so forgive me if this ends up being a rehash because i missed something.i've been playing for about 2 months now, have set up an alt account, and have to date purchased half a dozen plex, and the main factor that's got me ready to quit is the quite obviously broken suicide ganking mechanic.i've read hundreds of posts on here and on other forums about it, so i know this has been an issue for at least 4 years, yet it still continues, and my experience today is a perfect example of how this long-known issue is a deal breaker for a relatively new player...so i'm out mining in highsec in my retriever, which i set up a paid alt account to train up the mining and industrial skills to be able to use while continuing the training of my primary account, which is more focused on combat. i know quite well by now that i lack the skill points and finances to survive in pvp against seasoned players, so i'm trying to bide my time in highsec while i train up to at least have a prayer of surviving.i also know that at my current skill level, i can barely survive a pair of npc rats long enough for my small compliment of drones to dispatch them, so i'm dual-boxing with my primary character flying a bs armed with 4 large blasters, remote shield booster, and 5 heavy assault drones, and we're fleeted.so along comes some opportunistic a**hat, who steals from one of our gsc's, on which i'd foolishly neglected to set the password, and ejects my ore in his own container, which i recognize as an attempt at can flipping, so i simply call it a noobish loss and go about setting my passwords.well first off, i'm fleeted, and i have an asset on station more than capable of dispatching this threat, but unfortunately the gsc's in question were the property of my mining alt, who's flying the retriever. she gets kill rights immediately, but i don't dare attack with just the 3 drones equipped on the retriever, and alas my fleeted and heavily armed escort has no kill rights.so once the aforementioned a**hat realizes that i'm not going to be foolish enough to shoot first in my paper-skinned retriever, his buddy/alt comes along in a thrasher, suicide ganks me, gets promptly concorded, and the original a**hat scoops up the dropped loot, and persists to try to goad me into attacking with my bs and getting it concorded so he can scoop up the actually valuable loot.and now i'm left sitting there in my battleship, completely unable to take any action against this f**ktard who just blew up my 10m isk ship/fitting without getting my much more valuable bs concorded.now whether or not highsec thieves/gankers are ever made fair game for any players inclined to blast their a**es into oblivion or not (which they absolutely should be), this is a shining example of why kill rights at a bare minimum should extend to all players who are fleeted with the recipient of those kill rights at the time of the offense. quite simply, without this mechanic, fleets are completely useless in highsec.it's all well and good to be considerate of how the ui and the tutorials affect the npe, but it is unfathomably short-sighted to not also consider how allowing such a long-standing and well-documented abuse of the game mechanics turns off players who have made it past the introductory stages, and are paying to toil long enough at pve in highsec to stand any chance at all in pvp or lowsec.if you suicide gank an almost completely defenseless player who refrains from engaging you in a fight they know they cannot win, but won't engage their obviously armed and fleeted escort who already has you targeted, there is no denying that you're a bully and a coward. and it is precisely eve's tendency to tolerate and even cater to such a mentality that i believe is unquestionably the most detrimental aspect of the game to the npe. this very forum is full of examples of exactly this."
7/4/2011,"1. a real useable ui,or just open your api and let us make it2. text large enough to be read3. something like 500k skillpoints free to distribute(with shorter trail time or more resctriction on skills)these alone will help a lot4. and maybe a more involved aura with a 3d model like they have in starcraft,who can say""incoming transmission/mail/transaction"" or play chess with me?"
7/4/2011,"eve is 11 years old. clean up the god damn skill books and streamline them(package them), then go back to cluttering up the skill book section. then reduce the time multipliers. dont give me that ""learning patience and wanting every thing quickly"" crap unless you live just like your grandparents didthen a bunch of what every one eles have said.edit-basically noob t1 skills should train faily quick(nothing over 8 hours) then easing the player into the real time grind."
7/4/2011,"make lv5 skills optional: means no equipments or ships (no matter t2 or t3)should require skill level higher than lv4 as prerequisite. make lv5 skills totally optional proficient, they just make noobs desperate."
7/4/2011,supported~
7/4/2011,supported for changing the stagnant one-time-pay system of attribute implants into a continuous investment.and for the possibility of creating a new legal profession: pharmacist.
7/4/2011,"good thoughts, but i don't see a problem in the current system. you can have the consumables for your no implant 0.0 clone, and +5s for your emp clone. where is the flaw in that system?one thing you failed to consider is that if you did away with the implants though you will make 0.0 clones more equivalent to empire clones, you just removed all differentiation between the rich and the poor (beginners) who cannot afford +5s. i think that is a far worse game balance ruiner. as you know the skilltree is not linear, and a lot of the higher skills really require implants to be able to train in reasonable time. it would really suck if i had to keep 'feeding consumables' to my clone as i train for my carrier."
7/4/2011,"it would affect pve as well by helping convince some of the more adventurous carebears to consider going into low-sec/null-sec to do missions, ratting, and/or mining."
7/4/2011,1
7/4/2011,what? how the hell do you think now? really explain to me.
7/4/2011,"i think a better solution would be to make jump cloning a 12 hourly cooldown or even less. no new system needs to be enacted and it provides most of the benefits to your proposal. right now, the 24 hour cooldown is overly restrictive without doing much, if anything for gameplay."
7/4/2011,"the more i think about this idea, the more i like it. while it may be simpler just to shorten jc times, shortening does not also create more opportunities for new jobs nor does it really protect implant investment (just circumvents the problem).this idea solves quite a few problems, with extra opportunities to boot. not to mention an isk sink of a sort, which has to get ccp's approval.supported."
7/4/2011,they actually have a similar system in place already for new players that buy the boxed version of the game. they get a booster that increase their attributes and some combat stats that have a 10 day duration if my memory serves me right.i love this idea!
7/4/2011,i completely support anything that encourages pvp.
7/4/2011,"supported. after all i suggested something similar a few years ago. the best way, i feel, would be to keep both systems, 24 hours stat boosters for people doing dangerous things and implants for people doing less dangerous activities. the components for the stat boosters should come from gas harvesting (most or all of it done in low sec/0.0) and they should be balanced so that 3 months of continuous use of the boosters would be roughly equivalent to the cost of a implant of the same strength. the boosters should cease functioning if you get killed (to keep them working the same way of the implants), but as the single pill will be fairly inexpensive it shouldn't be a big problem."
7/4/2011,"i think they announced that they are adding this back, so i think this topic can be closed. guess the csm works afterall :)"
7/4/2011,"ok i think i have an idea on how you can have both the hanger and captain's quarters. it a simple system, where in the client settings you have a ""default station view"", it both a ""check mark"" and a ""drop down"". allowing for neither or your choice of loading by default either the ""captain's quarters"" or ""hanger"". also another button that allow a player to jump between the two without undocking."
7/4/2011,i don't wanna play space sims or spaceship barbie
7/4/2011,"while you're at it, please allow an option to disable the industry button on the neocom. i never use it. /sarcasm :)this whole proposal just sounds like a passive aggressive way of folks to protest the nex. honestly, let's move on, the topic is getting a little tiresome. i really think that ccp has better things to do (like add back a ship spin option)."
7/4/2011,"it's pretty tacky actually, agree check box option."
7/4/2011,"okay, this is meant as a discussion only, so i ask that you please refrain from trolling or flaming.the topic is no doubt going to be contentious and going to cause a lot of heated opinions, and perhaps maybe against the current eula, but that's why i would like to put it up for discussion.premise:allow 'market' bots.orcompletely enforce the no-bot policy now that i have your attention, let me present to you both sides of this.currently i do not think that the enforcement of no-bot policy can be achieved 100%. its an uphill battle for ccp to track down botters, and it makes market trading unfair to those who aren't using bots. (any visit to jita will illustrate how impossible it is to keep up with a standing order on the market in an environment where your order will be beat every 5min with one that is .01 isk higher.)so, what is the downside of allowing market bots? in fact, that is exactly how rl markets work. live broker markets are a thing of the past and the world runs on trading algorithms nowadays. banks and hedge funds have their own proprietary market trading algorithms, which compete with live traders all the time. trading algo's have pros and cons, pros being that they can react faster than humans, cons being that they are static strategies which can be exploited by smart human traders. i do not see a downside to allowing both to live in harmony.the current trading skill progression system is geared towards bulk order watching, which is not really feasible for humans to handle. if you max out your skills, you can have 305 open orders. at that level, checking all your orders systematically is very time consuming, and a live human can no longer compete with someone with less orders to check (let's assume that both are continuously checking and updating orders, as fast as they can). if we assume a conservative 15sec it takes to check and update an order, it will take a human 1 hour 15min to go through all their orders. now that means that they no longer can compete with somebody who has say, only 5 open orders to watch. this creates a obstacle and disadvantage to those with more orders open, which creates an artificial barrier to improving your trading skills (why bother, when you cannot gain any advantage to do so). instead traders will stay to a low number of higher margin orders, instead of more orders with lower margin. this completely makes these trading skills useless. you may argue then that this high skilled trader should just put their standing orders closer to the mid (taking less profit) in order to dissuade the .01 iskers from beating them. that will work, but then their orders will fill a lot faster, thereby negating the need for skills that increase their open order count in the first place.so what if we allowed bots to make the electronic market? opponents would be quick to point out that it would edge out all those casual traders. yes it would. but, what if we only allowed it at one exchange? say jita. in the real world each exchange sets its own rules. you can trade electronically in certain exchanges and others not. at jita, let's say we allow bots to create the most efficient market for order takers (that's you, the consumers) perhaps at amarr as well and the other trade hubs in the empire. this is where you will get the best price as a buyer/seller (as bots will continually update orders at the fastest speeds) other places, bot's will not be allowed, so manual trading will still be possible, for those traders who do hauling and inter-regional trades.let's discuss, please list out any pro's and con's that you can think of.summary:pros:- make current higher trading skills not useless, and actually worth something, for order placers- make a more efficient market for order takers at trade hubs, - make managing 305 open orders actually possible.- take away the advantage of the .01 isk order bumperscons:- tricky to enforce no-bots at non-hubs"
7/4/2011,"you will be hard pressed to learn that there are capsuleers who will refuse to allow botting of any form to flurish in new eden.of course, you are correct to assume that the war on bots is an uphill battle. but regardless of the odds, we, the hard-working capsuleers, chose to become the check and balance against bots. we spy on them, petition them, and (if possible) gank them.i commend you, of course, for bring up this topic just to debate the pros and cons.oh and by the way...fixed it for you."
7/4/2011,why do you think this?
7/4/2011,"you have a point, and eve's economy has grown to the point where sophisticated traders would want to use bots.ccp should not ever allow people to run 3rd party mods with eve.but if it designed an interface where people could program market bots, that would work.one problem with designated exchanges is that it would fix trade hubs. ccp didn't make jita the biggest trade hub, the player economy did. it's possible that at some point in the future, jita won't be the big trade hub, and possibly not a trade hub at all. i can't imagine how, but it's possible. if you fix exchanges for market bots, then you make these places permanent trade hubs."
7/4/2011,"not supported.i do understand where you are coming from since i also have to invest a reasonable amount of time maintaining a large buy/sell order portfolio with my trade alt but i cannot support this proposal. allowing any trader (including myself) an unfair advantage through the use of bots is only opening the door for the eventual legal use of mining, hauling and ratting bots. let us not forget that the time spent trading is part of the investment you make in this game, as is that mining, hauling and ratting. if any activity is something a player finds boring then they should do something different not ""have their cake and eat it"" by automating the process."
7/4/2011,"fixed it for you.i'd like to addrees these...the first may well be true, if careful safe guards are not put in place. i do not want to encourage mining bots or missioning bots. they do not suffer the same problem as trading as trading involves a strategy, even if bots are used (what level to match the price, etc etc. trader still needs to decide what to trade and how far to chase an order. bots are just executing the instructions. this is exactly how equity trading algos in the real world work, you set the participation rate, or the slippage from vwap that you are willing to accept before taking the market etc etc.the second statement needs some supporting evidence. i do not believe it will take away any player driven-ness of the market at all. for all the arguments above. what it does take away is the tedious nature of order matching. tasks that even real world traders do not do.... we pay brokers to do this. why is the brokers in eve useless in this regard? in real life, i can ask my broker to match any order up to 10% of my limit. and nobody will argue that the equity markets are any less driven by real players."
7/4/2011,"well i have to say that i agree with your statements. i do believe that it is something you need to do. but do you not agree then that the higher trading skills are useless? why bother upping your open order count if there is no way anyone would want to maintain 300 open orders? and to do so will actually hinder your profit margins. better to just open up another trader alt instead. seems to me like the system is a little broken. if i was a business tycoon, i think that i would want to delegate some of the order watching to junior traders in my corp. but the system does not allow me to 'delegate' an order to another will it? if it could, then i think that i would be happy with that solution. as it stands i don't see any good reason to train up trade skills higher that 50 or so orders."
7/4/2011,"very good points. we would want these hubs to have their trading rules stated plainly so that everyone would know. perhaps have public votes or whatever. as it stands it seems pretty close to impossible, short of some cataclysmic game mechanic or event that jita will be dethroned as where people go to buy/sell most of the time. its own popularity is what ensures its continued popularity. jita is also special already in that it has its own node server. so yes, there will have to be some sort of vetted process by which 'electronic exchange' markets are allowed, and i agree with the sentiment that there should be an in-game client to do so, or a well published api for those who want to design their own algos. (perhaps ones that will trigger on technical signals etc).yes, its quite a radical change, but the markets are creaking under its own weight now and manual order editing is not really that feasible for 'tycoon' level traders. so either allowed for a controlled access to market algos/bots via api or client, or allow us to delegate open orders for other corp mates to watch for us."
7/4/2011,"no botsthis is a game for humans not afk humans running bots, which is exactly what would happen. a player that puts in the extra time, to watch his orders, to make the little adjustments and profit from playing the 0.01 isk game should be allowed to profit from the extra effort. allowing bots takes away the competitive advantage of being willing to do the extra work.i myself am a lazy trader, i predict trends and let my orders sit and adjust them every few days as markets shift. i am at a competitive disadvantage to the person that puts in the extra effort. if i can hook up some bot, then we're on even footing and i gain at someone else's expense.ccp we would hope also isn't going to start to say this kind of bot is ok and this kind isn't. it would end up a big huge mess of conflicting positions and rules with which i doubt anyone wants to deal.i do understand the perspective of the proposal, but it would lead to unfair advantage for some and remove opportunities for many, not to mention it is a huge can of worms."
7/4/2011,"modifying orders cost something like 0.1% of the total price, that will solve everything. price competition at 0.01 isk on a million level order is just ridiculus."
7/4/2011,the things that make bots so effective are also what makes them so easy to find... ccp isn't lacking tools or ability to find and eliminate bots. they either lack manpower or the will to do it in the first place.
7/4/2011,"botters pay for accounts same as you do. ccp has no incentive to remove them from the game.also, botting is trivial even without fancy memory injection and whatnot. just load up auto it, deploy eve to a virtual machine, and have at it. it's so easy a caveman could do it. parsing market data is the only thing that requires minimal thought but even that can be done by anyone who's reasonably intelligent."
7/4/2011,"when looking to give corp mates the ability do manufacture in your corp, you have to give them a role called "" factory manager""without this role, they cannot install jobs for the corp using corp materials inside hangers. however, this role also will give them the ability to cancel any job installed by someone else in the corp. if that happens, the entire bill of material is lost forever. someone could easily abuse this role, however there is no work around for allowing corps to let members produce items and keep a good security system in place.please reference the eve wiki on station service pos roles."
7/4/2011,"yes it is dengerus and not secure for corp you cant check every member and trust every member in corp, and eve not gives eny mechenics how to check members if hee is trustull or no or hee is red spy or tief or wath ever.i tink that factory manger need to have simply ting that you cant cancel job that instaled by that manager or anoder member off corp if only that job its finisched, canceling jobs can do only ceo or dierctor. that role no nedto request a full wallet acces to the to make manufucturing jobs. he cant take out iot transfer money form corp wallet but can use money to make manufucturing job only try that windows hee can acces the weallet to creat a job but not transfer or do enyting els.eve need to have more mehanics to protect corporation property how its now in game."
7/4/2011,"bump, i really believe ccp needs to fix this..."
7/4/2011,"the only workaround at present is to do all your high-value manufacturing jobs on alts in a separate corp. this is far from ideal, especially for w-space dwellers, who have to do a lot of manufacturing at starbases (i.e. via corp jobs).this can only be done as part of a much wider revision of the corp roles system, but the sooner the better."
7/4/2011,"agreed. a number of the roles have dual purposes, the whole thing lacks granularity. factory manager is one of the troublesome ones. i know it's a big job for ccp to do a security overhaul, that does not remove the need for improvements.soon with establishments, possibly captain's quarters open to visitors, corp wis offices, dust contracts and who knows what else from dust ... more and more is going to be put on the old system. a system already overburdened with more than intended. it's going to get worse before it gets better.decent corp security granularity may very well help with younger player retention as well. corps may be more welcoming to new players if some of the roles were not so 'dangerous' and more gruanular control were available."
7/4/2011,as an anti-pie even i think the current mechanic is ridiculous.
7/4/2011,this needs to be fixed.
7/4/2011,gcc should only apply if the target you are repping actually has gcc flagged him/herself. supported.
7/4/2011,"let us train multiple characters on the same account. yes, i know it's been suggested before -- but it's just as relevant today as it was then. ccp is suffering a budget shortfall, and this is a service that players have been requesting for a long time.yes, we can purchase multiple accounts. no, not all of us wish to do that. a second account means either a long-term investment, doubling subscription fees, or a two-plex transfer fee.with aurum, we now have a level of granularity for our purchases. we could sell a month of training time for the full 3500 aurum, or perhaps offer decreased times at higher rates -- such as 900 aurum for one week's training.as a person with two accounts already, i could use this service to train a cyno alt on each account without delaying the progression of the primary characters on that account. i'm sure i'm not the only one that would take advantage of this service.it works within the existing plex system. it doesn't let us sidestep the training mechanic like plex for sp would. and it's additional revenue.surely this would put a nice spin on the past week? i know i'd feel a lot better about the nex store if it offered a few helpful services."
7/4/2011,yes please! i like secrets and surprises and all that but it's just most of us would like to know what to expect in the next few months.+1 for me

7/4/2011,supported
7/4/2011,"i would like to support this, but first does anyone know why it was taken away in the first place? was it being exploited?"
7/4/2011,"sooo, we are waiting :)"
7/4/2011,"there is a bunch of reasons why doing something like this could imbalance the game, say for example sp could be bought and most people would want to buy sp, all the npe content for the game would become pretty much unused as people would buy their way out of having to play it for little isk reward.there would likely be a decrease in market demand for noobships i.e frigates, destroyers, t1 cruisers, meta 4 modules and an increase in demand for higher end goods, t2 bs , capital ships, supercapitals etc.this would also most likely bring about less diversity in ships that people choose to fly as people generally conform to certain fleet docterines when flying ships, therefore fleets would likely end up pretty bland as a result of this. (this can allready be seen in alliances that are strict with pvp reimbursements)any sp for isk program would inflate the market price of plex making plex harder to aquire for those that buy them, if plex prices get to high ccp will lose subscribers as people start to shut down alt accounts etc.. there is also a lot of subscribers that aren't really that active ingame (e.g. players in military in rl) and only keep themselves subbed in order to keep skill queues going while away.it would close the skillgap (sp wise not skillwise) of carebear alliances vs veteren pvp alliances, not a bad idea in itself but could possibly bring about a new form of elitism with in certain corp/alliance circles where recruits are required to have lvl5 skills in all requested disiplines to join.the character bizarre prices would collapse as people could custom create theyre own. this would **** off many of the high sp vets who can currently get 40 bil + for some of the top end toons. better way of buying sp without adding widespread rl money for sp would be something along the lines of this topic:"
7/4/2011,bad idea. this will make eve into something no better than farmville. or those other sleazy mmos that advertise on the sidebar of facebook sites.
7/4/2011,"it also may mean a titangoonswarm fleet running rampant. this suggestion is about as silly as the government subsidizing underperforming mortgages in the effort to 'allow every american to own a home'. yeah, great idea!"
7/4/2011,"how do you figure?the above could be a concern if the main purpose of people buying plex for rl cash is to sell the plex for isk to buy characters. based on my experience over the years people on average buy plex for rl cash to get isk to finance their pvp losses or market activity. if that is true then the impact on the in-game plex price will be marginal.one could even argue that plex would become less expensive in-game since all those people who bought sp for isk don't have the long time experience in how to create isk in game and would thus resort to selling plex for isk to buy the ships/fittings they are now able to fly.pro tip: when going for a rl analogy make sure it fits before posting.in the sp for cash scheme no one would be subsidizing anything, on the contrary, those who buy sp would have to pay a premium. so yeah, it's nothing like what you wrote, feel free to try again though."
7/4/2011,"the analogy is meant to illustrate the stupidity of the premise primarily, and secondarily as both inflate and add volatility to the market. (adding a new way for noobs to pilot a titan without putting in the 'time') so, it fits pretty well, i think.the 'mortgage crash' would be when all the noobs get blown to bits because they do not have the actualy skill in playing the game, and all that was achieved was to artificially inflate market prices for all these rl rich noobs who wanna go pewpew immediately."
7/4/2011,"except that it has been stated numerous times in this thread that there would be mechanics in place to not allow players who buy sp to progress instantly to a titan. it's also been stated a couple of times that there are plenty of titan pilots, what limits the amount of deployed titans is the number of actually available ships.what does ""inflate the market"" mean from where you are looking? same question for volatility. it's pretty easy to make those broad claims but when you take a minute to think it through and truly consider all reasonable outcomes, especially in comparison to what the sandbox has already seen in terms of changes, then there's no other way than to come to the conclusion that the sky isn't falling.buying sp is about getting new players into a place where they can choose from a range of ships and be able to fit them well. it's about allowing you to roll a trade alt if you want it and willing to pay for it. it's about giving every single existing pilot the ability to just pay up and get those armor and shield resists to 5 that they have been putting of for so long.skipping a couple of years of skilltraining does not create an ""i win!"" button. anyone who's at the very least halfway reasonable will see that, especially if there are sensible restrictions on how many sp can be purchased, when, and on what they can be allocated."
7/4/2011,"skill systems do suck and an average player won't like a game without any hope of being equal to vets. but the game is simply not well made enough to make players stay without hijacking them with skill system. ccp need to keep players in illusion like ""this will turn fun only after i can fly xxx"". if you give players all skills lv5 instantly, many of they will realize within a month and shout out ""oh god the game does sucks!"" and leave.anyway still a good idea for ccp because those who leave already paid the same amount they supposed to, instantly."
7/4/2011,"fact is most of you ignore the fact that rich players can come in buy 120 mill sp toons and titans already, heck someone can buy 10 of em if they want to drump $50,000 down big deal? its not happening and its allowed already in the character bizzar.your all saying everyone would have super elite pilots. no they wouldn't. people would play at a rate that let them level and enjoy their game play experience. i wouldn't buy more sp if i could for my current pilots as i don't desperately need to fly a minimatar battleship i'll fly a caldari tengu till my skills train up naturally ingame. and most will not buy mega toons and dump $500-1000 because they already have that option and most do not do this only a small percentage of the eve population buy characters. so your whole ""would ruin eve cause everyone has high sp toons"" is just wrong. people can buy them now they don't want them, they do want to get over 3-4 week humps in their gameplay where they feel restricted and then quit. if you give them a small option to get over that hump to that new ship and new ingame content they will play for longer."

7/4/2011,not supported.having to wait for something that you trained for makes it more worth while. this would destroy that and much of what makes eve worth playing.
7/4/2011,"absolutely not supported. this whole thing about a small, vocal minority of players not liking micro-transactions is absolute rubbish. it's absolutely true that most players don't participate in the forums, the same as most players don't participate in the csm. but hardly anyone wants to see micro-transactions that allow real money to be a substitute for effort and time in the game."
7/4/2011,"going to echo again the complete ludicrous nature of this proposal, which seems to be posted by impatient players from wow.earn your isk, rmt is a bannable offense from ccp, and essentially your proposal is exchanging real usd/eur for implants. the amount of game inbalance that this meta-game leak will cause are numerous. as isk flows already have leaks (in plex) the last bastion of exploit free mechanics is the sp system. now proponents want that exploitable as well. why not turn eve into a rts while we are at it, then we can get some starcraft gamers to join too. :)"
7/4/2011,hell no
7/4/2011,"hell no...i could probably support an improved sp acquisition for newbies to a degree, but certainly nothing beyond cutting off the difficulty of the first 6 months. and certainly not for older players."
7/4/2011,the learning skills were removed to help the newbie already. no need to add to that.
7/4/2011,"let me preface what i am about to say with that i didn't say that vets vs noobs is unbalanced, someone else did, however;honestly, you fail at analogies, for the second time and all on page 7. comparing vets and noobs to sixth-graders and first-graders makes no sense at all because unlike eve players they are not limited to being stuck on the same playground.so your argument is that because a small number of players compared to the overall number of players spoke up against mt it's clear that ""hardly anyone"" is in support? my argument is that those who were opposed spoke up, the rest didn't care one way or another or are in favor. if a person isn't happy with something, a service, a purchase, whatever, they speak up. they don't continue to pay a company for a service if they don't agree with the way it is performed. i have logic and reality on my side, what do you have?thanks for being the first csm to actually post here. kudos for that.however, csm action on this issue isn't required, nor would csm action either in support or in opposition have any effect on ccp's decision to implement this feature, or any other feature.i realize that you are spending your time on what you perceive to be the betterment of eve, and for that i notion i do thank you. i'll leave it at that because this isn't the place to discuss the value of the csm as a whole."
7/4/2011,"lollll you're a ****ing idiotccp isn't implementing this game breaking nonsense, get real"
7/4/2011,sage
7/4/2011,"brilliant. because of the 50% conversion rate it avoids fotm remapping concerns. instead of hurting the character bazaar is will actually increase demand. no sp inflation, in fact it reduces the outstanding amount. people get to maintain attachment to their character. i would love this."
7/4/2011,"okay, i support this thread in principle, but your proposal needs more work. the idea above won't work. i don't put money into apple because they are 'cooler'. i put money into them because i can make a profit on their shares. artificially creating a price for shares of a corp on something as fuzzy and not related to asset value like 'acheivements' is going to end in market crash, or people to game the achievements model. example off the top of my head. corp is formed, isk is moved from a parent corp. everyone ganks for a week or whatever, makes a ranking, dumps the shares, makes a profit for all members and disbands corp. rinse repeat. do it once and people stop trusting the price of the shares on the market and the whole ranking thing becomes a joke.in fact, we've hit on the fundamental reason why this proposal has been proposed countless times in the past, but has never materialized. it's because most people overlook the fundamental foundation of a equity market. a credit system. without a credit/bankruptcy system and accountability laws, anyone can make a corp, pump and dump the stock, and make off like corp thieves with the public's money, hey you americans should know how that feels like now. you would think the financial crisis would have taught you a lesson or 2. you need a banking system to value companies, and a system to hold companies and banks accountable for their actions.without this, stock prices will be manipulated. (hey we have a free isk/item transfer system in eve, with no accountability)see my past proposal about adding money laundering laws (the first step in installing accountability to the financial system)money launderingmost of the responders are clueless when it comes to the real workings of the financial system, so it didn't get too favourable a response, but some actually did point out some good game mechanics reasons why this would fundamentally be difficult to implement in eve. but i do think that they can be worked around."
7/4/2011,this is a necessary idea. and keep national pilitics out of this. it is a game. that is very tacky. it does need work. that is why it has been proposed. to be talked about and have the kinks worked out.
7/4/2011,"to solve your little problem, their would be a ""time in business"" requirement necessary to make the ""rankings list"". to move up in the ranks would be determined by assets, time in business, and the number of with corporate membership. this would solve the issue of trust since only long standing massive membership corporations would have the public's trust. see problem solved. wasn't that easy? next."
7/4/2011,"a computer decides the stock value of real life companies. it wouldn't have to be any different in eve.anyway, the corporation would have to decide to go ipo to be publicly traded. the percentage of the shares in the ipo should be customizable, up to and including 100%. a new corporate function for publicly traded corps with more than 40% shares on the public market would be to have a board of directors that consists entirely of the top 5, 7, 9, or 11 shareholders including the chairman. the ceo cannot be on the board. the board is essentially the representative body for shareholder interests.nobody can gain more shares after ipo without paying for them, including the ceo and directors, unless there is a split or a compensation plan that awards shares for performance.the stock exchange would be a submarket similar to the current market, but separated from it entirely.publicly traded corporations would have to run the books like a real corporation to remain tradeable. a given corp would have to retain 50% of the public share value in the wallet at all times."
7/4/2011,"since when? i'm not stock expert, but as far as i know there are rating agencies that calculates the value of company when it goes publick with its shares. and after that the price is only buy/sell orders like our eve market, so no computing of value or anything like this. the price of a single share is what you can buy/sell it for. now it is true that once someone calculates that the company iis no longer worth 1b but lets say 500m than this gets published in a yearly/queterly report or some press article so it affect prices if shareholders will panic and start to sell dramatically.just my 2 cents"
7/4/2011,"which is done with complex formulae that are left to be crunched by computers.the value of the shares are calculated to be the price at which they are trading currently. not necessarily the actual value of the company. eve market is not currently designed to handle a fluid price system like a stock market.daytraders are what really affects stock prices since they are constantly jockeying for position on the market. the vast majority of stockholders are not that infused with adhd, and any significant activity by them as a whole will affect the price the stock trades at more.all of which is handled by a computerized system running complex formulations."
7/4/2011,"currently drone sec while able to make money in, does not have the money making potential of other null sec zones. via a test the other day, i did two hours in each area. total value of the sanctums i ran in drone null sec equated to about 40 mill, this included salvage and the drops from the drones.doing the same level of sanctums in wicked creek region for the same amount of time, total value was 130 mill counting salvage and bounties.sadly at 40 mill for 2 hours of work, i could stay in high sec and run level 4 missions and make more then that value in the same amount of time. this needs to be changed and updated to allow folks that take the time and effort to move into drone null sec to make a profit.the disparity here is way to large, i am not saying that drone sec should be as profitable as those other zones but to have such a large disparity is wrong. the value of what i get from the sanctums should be close to equal. right now drone sec is dying slowly but surly. while indys may stay in the area i am watching more and more folks move out of the areas due to being able to make more money in high sec then in drone space for the amount of time put in.due to this i propose the following changes.increase the amount of mineral drop from the drones.add a small bounty to the drone kills, nothing to compare with the value of serpentis bounties but a small bounty will go a long way to balancing the value of the kills. amounts as a suggestion: frigate class 10,000 isk, cruiser class: 20,000 isk battle cruiser: 50,000 isk battle ship: 80,000 isk. or a bit lower.just by adding in about 10% more minerals to the drops and the addition of a small bounty drone sec will become more balanced with the other null sec zones and be more profitable then high sec."
7/4/2011,the cause of this issue is not an intrinsic imbalance in drone space but the nerf of drone compounds and the inflation of minerals in highsec due to rampant botting
7/4/2011,"i have to ask a fundamental question...why should all null sec regions be balanced?wealth disparity is what causes demand to be in other regions. it's what causes population distribution variance and variety. it's what causes wars in the end. war is good, as it fuels the economy.for instance, a potential good thing about a low paying null sec region may be that it is a strategic deadzone, which is relatively safe from alliance battles all the time."
7/4/2011,"booting in fdrone lands havekly drops down mineral prices in high sec. drone need to be nerfed not boosted, need to change the way that drones ntio droping mineras biot that drone poo you can sell to the npc how its is with sleeper data liberys etc. thet will stabilize abit market and wil give normal non boter miners agein soem job to do, ader ways mi9ning itsl ong time regiculus ting to ern isk."
7/4/2011,"when thinking drone regions you have to look at more than isk in pocket, look at the lifecycle of minerals.whereas everyone else take their isk and go shopping for minerals in high-sec which then have to be hauled back out in the form of compresses blocks or carriers (""lol"").drone denizens only really need extra tritanium and can thus skip a large part of the hauling and even make isk by exporting excess mid-high ends to high-sec.drone regions are not well suited for groups made up of lots of individuals as the area very much encourages/favours planning and a collective mindset .. one might say it was meant to be ruled by russians as they are far more collective oriented than their ego-centric western brothers (myself included, but then i really am all that so its justified! )"

7/4/2011,+1...-9000.no.
7/4/2011,"i think your measures are a little too extreme, but i support this discussion in general.gate guns should not be instapopping pirates. it won't make much sense (storywise) that guns in lowsec gates would be more powerful than those in highsec ones.what you are trying to achieve is just to make gate camping lowsec gates less appealing for pirates right? well then what about this...what if we just made the sec aggro policy more harsh in lowsec? no buffing guns, no adding police forces. but make gate guns activate for lowsec rating pirates just like they do in highsec. i'm sure most pirates will avoid camping if they were continually under fire.currently, gate guns (and police forces) will aggro pirates on the following scale:--here is a brief list of your travelling options according to security status: players with -2.0 or worse will be attacked in 1.0 systems players with -2.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.9 systems players with -3.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.8 systems players with -3.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.7 systems players with -4.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.6 systems players with -4.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.5 systems -- it would be simple to extend this in a balanced way to+ players with -5 or worse will be attacked in 0.4 systems+ players with -5.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.3+ players with -6.0 or worse will be attacked in 0.2+ players with -6.5 or worse will be attacked in 0.1+ players with -7.0 or worse will be attacked in empire 0.0"
7/4/2011,"of course, we will need some mechanic so that pirates who are loyal and high standing with the prevailing faction sov in the lowsec system not to be attacked by them. (for instance, you are -6.0 sec status, but +4 with the syndicate. you should not be shot at by the gate guns in syndicate lowsec gates.)of course, this implies that some penalties be dealt out to those who blow up ships of players who are also loyal to serpentis. (by affecting their standing, exactly what happens when you blow up npc rats of a faction) this way, a lowsec pirate loyal to a faction should be able to operate freely in this factions lowsec, and also have a dis-incentive to gank other players loyal to this faction, as it will affect their standing, and if they do it too much, they won't be able to avoid the gate and station guns in the factions lowsec anymore.how does that sound? any loopholes that anyone can find?"
7/4/2011,"i believe in the concept and principal, though i don't necessarily believe in the solution. i don't particularly have one myself, so i'll listen until i hear something reasonably to what i personally would consider a more apt and accurate solution before i voice a further opinion."
7/4/2011,"even ""pwn"" capitals .. you serious? sentry issues are related to them not having been buffed in ages even when ship ehp has doubled or tripled in the meantime so you can now use buffer cruisers with light rr on gates.gates are 'choke-points' and should remain as such strategic elements, but is should not be as easy (i have managed to gank a bomber in a slicer and make it out in hull!).- double damage to account for ehp increases and give sentries sleeper ai so they don't cycle repeatedly, ignore drones and go after logistics more. will need some tweaks to how to handle threatlists but shouldn't be too difficult.stations are owned by states within the states, eve corporations are immensely powerful but allow miscreants to run rampant on their front porch. upping station guns could be argued to threaten normal traffic due to 'glitches' so instead:- reduce docking ranges to a easily identifiable/common range of 2.5km in all directions. extend this outside dock point, should be just enough to allow a ""stop ship"" command to work in high lag scenarios.- designate the docking range as a pos bubble (perhaps with a new graphical indicator like perimeter space buoys) .. removes interaction within/with docking range thus eliminating station camping all together (blockades in null still possible due to bubbles).in short: getting people to ls requires much more than making entrances less hazardous. it could/should be part of a bigger revamp though."
7/4/2011,"hmm, i think the super powerful gate guns that can wtfpwn a capital is going too far, but i like this idea of concorde or some type of npc showing up to keep the peace. i think these npcs should scram, sometimes, based on the security level of the system and the aggressor's security status. they should also ecm and web, or anything that might help, but only sometimes. so that you can't predict what you'll face. and of course they would be destroyable, at a huge cost to your sec status.traveling through gates in low sec generally doesn't bother me because i'm either in a fast frigate, and i breeze past gate camps, or i'm with a big enough escort that gate camps run. but undocking in stations can be worrisome. once in space, it's up to me to be vigilant to keep myself safe and i accept that, i have some control over the situation. if i get jumped, there were things i could have done to stop that, so it's totally my fault."
7/4/2011,i still like the idea of having a different approach to low sec! we need a way to increase its population even though not necesaraly make it safer.
7/4/2011,"low-sec already has the best stuff: the best ice, the best minirals, the best rats, the best pi, the best looking stations, etc. if anything, high-sec needs a buff."
7/4/2011,my humble take on the matter (pimpin' mah threads!)
7/4/2011,"thank you for starting this discussion. as a admitted newbie and carebear i am a little confused what the purpose of low sec is. 1. empire = pve except for consensual (=wardec, duels and so on)2. 0.0 = fights for sovereignty and serious resources3. wh = kind of like 0.0 but manageable for smaller / focused corpslow sec? it neither allows sovereignty (and with it the security to mine) nor does it allow safe pve environment. it is hence pirate land only and as such - imho - oversized. wrt harvesting - i believe that only serious groups of well-organized teams can harvest in low sec with a pvp escort, haulers and so on. whilst fun (i assume), this is limiting the space to few players who work in this environment. also confusing to the newbie is the security rating system. if i understand it right, i can be shot down by anyone for any reason in 0.4 and lower. the only difference between 0.4 and 0.3 is the quality of the rats / ore. that seems needlessly complicated and confusing. maybe i don't have this right - please let me know - but i fail to see the real reason for having low sec at all. why not roll low sec into 0.0 and be done with that? make it so that sovereignty can not be gained (or gained only for a limited time or subset of space, e.g. a belt). comments and edification most welcome"
7/4/2011,get rid of the gates! :)
7/4/2011,"i'd rather just get rid of the gate guns entirely.though given the choice, i'd much rather have ""guns"" that ecm'd, rather than did actual damage. give the guys getting jumped a chance to get away, or make the campers fit eccm....and as a pirate, i wouldn't have the hassle of repping myself up every time i changed systems. win"
7/4/2011,+1 nerf pirates
7/4/2011,"gate guns need to have 15au range and be able to shoot down pesky pirates as they warp in on anyone with a higher sec rating than said pirate.also they should be able to auto deploy drag bubbles, should be able to multiply their numbers by at least 4 times enemy fleet + have remote shield transfer and or armor repair available to repair the attacked vessel(s).also cq needs to have a ""plot safe course through lowsec"" button that allows careb.. people with high sec standing to auto-spawn concord vessels along their route, and the option to pay aurum to autopilot through lowsec @0 distance.so...i'm sure one of my ideas is at least as stupid as yours."
7/4/2011,gate guns are not the problem with low sec. gates are. starjump replacing gate travel would immensely improve the game overall.

7/4/2011,"add a top hat to the noble exchange store.it should probably be a bit cheaper than the monocle, but not too much. in conjunction with the monocle, it will help to truly separate the real life crappy poor players of eve-online from those who are not horrible at being successful."
7/4/2011,"i have to say, that's one store item i would buy, along with a real monocle and a gold-plated ebony walking cane."
7/4/2011,"all we know is that there is a rumor of smuggling be changed and that players them selves may become the enforcers. so far all we have is the rumors. it could be fun or it could be completely useless depending on how the changes are implemented.one thing i would not like to see is, smugglers take an immediate security penalty and/or faction standings, or isk fines, when they are discovered, penalties should come upon being destroyed or ""stopped"", not on ""suspicion"". ""innocent until proven guilty!"" - if some joe cop wannabe can't stop me, then what proof does he have, some faulty craptastic scanner he got from a dead rat? i think not, your honor!frankly being blown up and loosing your ship should be enough. what we don't know is how all of this will be done. maybe soon as you undock you're a red blinker, or at first jump or something so that no one has to scan. that's all fine too. i'd just like to avoid the silly standings/security and isk fines just because someone got off a lucky scan, no better than the current customs agents. the point of getting something smuggled is to do it secretly. so if you can deliver it, then some amount of ""secrecy"" was achieved.any other thoughts?"
7/4/2011,as long i know they will get answered eventually i'm happy.i know it takes time and resources and i for sure did not call anyone stupid (you guys are incredible tbh). i'm not asking for anyone to ask anyone else to do it now. it's just important to make sure ccp won't forget about it...
7/4/2011,"these answers are just pathetic anyway. check out my sig for the reference.they could have been running this initiative every month, but given the quality of answers i doubt that it would be of any good for most us."
7/4/2011,"ok i think i have an idea on how you can have both the hanger and captain's quarters. it a simple system, where in the client settings you have a ""default station view"", it both a ""check mark"" and a ""drop down"". allowing for neither or your choice of loading by default either the ""captain's quarters"" or ""hanger"". also another button that allow a player to jump between the two without undocking.yes, i didn't post this on another forum threat but i think it should be it own."
7/4/2011,it's already done and we call it pos
7/4/2011,"most people here are missing the important issues in this response:- on difficulties of multiboxing clients with the new incarna environment: all they have said they will do is alter the stated minimum hardware spec on the website.- on incarna environment always being optional: ccp seem set on forcing you to load it. their current position is that once they have reintroduced ship spinning, the option not to load station environment will be removed.csm could you please work to improve this situation? i'm sure lot's of things were resolved during the summit, but now it is over it is time to call ccp to account on these unresolved issues."
7/4/2011,"i hammered the first point during the meeting, the upcoming alternative hangar is, in part, a response to that performance concern.the 2nd point depends on performance, if ccp wants to make incarna/cq mandatory, my condition is that the performance is what it was before. i'd rather not have to use the avatar, but ccp thinks it an integral part of eve and fighting against it is a lost battle."
7/4/2011,"can we get clarification as to why ccp thinks that using the avatar and wandering the cq is an integral part to the game? i actually played a few years ago on a trial, and then came back recently to give this game another go, there's some newer stuff i noticed, and that cq was one that i didn't really like or feel was necessary. i found it more time consuming for no reason than good."
7/4/2011,"this is actually a fascinating prospect, and it seems almost void of insider trading, so cheating it would be a lot more difficult than it could be, and also could be another form of obtaining isk."
7/4/2011,agreed. if eve had a stock market it could add an intresting layer to the economy. i support this motion wholeheartedly.
7/4/2011,"csm-6 should announce a public ultimatum towards ccp concerning the nda check on their minutes in order to get them published.when fail, csm-6 should step down.(personally i love ccp and am i not a fan of csm-6) /extreme, csm-2"
7/4/2011,"i feel he is totally right with this statement. i think that would be a sweet idea, and a load of fun, but i don't see it happening sadly, especially if the ship is a randomly chosen map where nobody sees the layout before everyone spawns. unfortunately the forums aren't as populated as they should be with a game this popular, i'm seeing."
7/4/2011,"actually boarding parties may be a intresting change to the way we fight. having a specific troop transport ship that launches boarding torpedos, and considering specific ship classes probably have the same internal layout, it would be easy to make maps to fight inside them. then you could either destroy the ship or take it. also this type of ship could be used for supporting other dust related functions, and possibly other types of planet to space interaction. i support this."
7/4/2011,"i understand and agree.however, when issues arise such as this one that are very serious, the friendlier type of communication that allows for jokes and tongue in cheek comments has to leave place to a drier type of communication that addresses the issues, lest people think ccp dismisses their concern.this is something even the csm part of that devblog suffers from to a degree, because anything less than ""serious business"" tone would be poorly received by many.the video published with a devblog should mitigate that feeling you have. other than that, you can also feel free to contact your favourite representative csm member in-game or through eve-mail for a more chatty type of statement."

7/5/2011,"why can't pos modules be part of a single structure and fitted similarly to a ship? also centralized hardpoints for clusters of turrets or modules, again fitted similarly to the way a ship is fitted."
7/5/2011,"a lot of amazing ideas here. but one thing i have been frustrated over fo some time is the issue with off line poses. i know a few have mentioned it already, there have been many threads about it in the past. the most recent one i read seemed like it was on the table to fix but never got done. off line poses are getting to be a big problem. especially in high sec and wormhole space where you can not bring in dreads to pop them. of line poses lose the bubble but still have full shields? this makes no sense. if the tower has run out of fuel and has no power, then where is the power for the shield coming from. it makes no sense for an off line pos to take the same dps and total damage to kill as a fully operational pos. i would be nice for off line poses to degrade with each down time. say after a week the shields are completely gone, another week later security goes off line to the point where someone with maxed hacking skills and possibly a new pos hacking skill with hacking 5 as prerequisite can hack into it and any anchored modules to steal any loot left behind. a week after that a hacker can unanchor it. a week later it unanchores itself. and a week later it degrades and self-destructs. make it worthwhile for experienced players to hunt down off line poses and make them much easier to kill for players that just want the spot. currently you need the same fire power to take down an off line pos as you do to take down a fully functional but undefended pos. i have wanted to put up a pos for some time, but all the area's i have checked have no open moons. yet there are many offline poses that are doing nothing but taking a spot where someone else could set up a pos. i currently run my own high sec corp. but even with all 4 of my accounts in battle ships it takes hours to kill a small off line tower. i would be fine with spending 4-6 hours to take down an active small tower, but to have an off line tower take the same amount of work just does not seem right. i might as well find a small online tower with good modules anchored and attack them. same time investment but a chance of some good loot. even a advanced lab that i can scoop after popping the tower is worth a few hundred mil. off line poses are generally one of three situations;1. some one forgot to fuel it, or can't afford to fuel it yet. but will either take it down or refuel it soon. give them at least a week to do so. other wise they never should have set it up. they were unprepared and deserve to lose it.2. players have abandoned them and do not consider the cost of the tower to be worth taking it down and selling or storing it. it is wasted space and there needs to be a way of eliminating them that does not require the same effort as taking down an active pos. 3. it is just a place holder pos. some corps anchor poses(ussually a small tower) with no intention of ever bringing them online. they do this just to keep others from being able to use that moon, or to claim the moon to sell to someone wantint to put a pos there. ""give me 500 mil and i will unanchor the tower for you."" this should be considered an exploit. it would be tolerable if off line poses were easy to kill, but as they have the same ehp as an online pos. e every high sec moon i have checked has at least a small off line tower anchored there. i can not do enough dps with only 4 accounts to take down even a small tower. this should not be the case. make off line poses much easier to kill than online poses. at the very least make them lose there shields. a small tower is managabel for 3-4 battle ships if it only has its armor and structure (about 1 mil hp each if i recall correctly) and not the huge shield buffer. make them degrade slowly to give the owner a chance to get it back online within a resonable time. but if they do not, let it die. if any work is going to be put into poses then this needs to be addressed along with any of the updates that are equally needed."
7/5/2011,nocosmetic items should be free content unless the game goes f2p.
7/5/2011,"that's no from meand no from him (my 2nd account).kinda moot point atm. ever since the 'upgrade' i can't even launch eve. i know get a new computer ... well i can't, i'm saving up for a bloody monacle."

7/5/2011,"rich can afford to keep +5s in. poor cannot. rich presently can have clones with both implants and boosters.poor may only have +2 and boosters.do away with the implants, and you have both rich and poor with boosters. the non-linearity comes from the fact that implants cost go up a lot from +1 to +5. boosters, or any consumables, won't be as expensive as any perma boosting implant. flattening the divide between rich/poor."
7/5/2011,"if you define ""the rich"" as someone who simply consumes +5 booster spices or uses +5 implants, then you're scope on this subject is pitiful. (more so because ""the rich"" pvpers would want slaves, halos and snakes, not +5s.)want a divide between the rich/poor? then become a supplier, explore the virgin spice market, expand the spice business and exploit the poor masses that will rely on the new spice, namely by force or marketeering. it's for the latinum baby!"
7/5/2011,"the empiredwellers have a nice income (if they care enough to read up on how to run missions) with practically no risk, i dont see a problem with that. it is way to easy to make isk in empire as it is, noone should be able to complain about being poor and living in empire. those that want to reduce the jc timer need to rethink that, it would create more problems than solutions."

7/5/2011,"+1, theres no need at all to know how much aurum you have in your wallet tab. display it on the next store, the same way as loyalty points are. no need to force **** on us we dont want."
7/5/2011,"pretty sure you guys are making a mountain out of a mole hill. the current location is just fine. if having a zero aurum balance staring you in the face is that offensive, maybe it's time to stop being cry babies and put some aurum in your wallet. by your mentality, because i don't do industry stuff the industry button on the the left of my screen should be removed? get a grip already."
7/5/2011,"i see what you are getting at, but you are missing out or some much better alternatives ways to go about this. real life markets have lots of interesting ways to deal with changing prices. stops and options and futures and even buy orders that can be programmed a bit more advanced than the current ones the exist in eve. so in one sense i think we should add into eve some bot-like capability. which would be available to everyone in the game and quickly put an end to botters on the market. when everyone can have their market orders update automatically and beat each other by .01 isk up to their per set stop point you will be a much more competitive market. the auto updating will run the sell price right down to the buy price very quickly and virtually eliminate the entire point of trader bots in the first place."
7/5/2011,agreed. i would be happy with this.
7/5/2011,"i respect what you are saying, but the problem is that for non-lazy traders, managing 300 orders essentially makes us 'lazy traders' because no human can update that many orders fast enough. 1 update/hour!so did ccp just make a mistake in adding those skills that seem to have no practical use in the game?or are they saying (by way of game mechanics) that they don't want any non-lazy traders with many orders out there?i don't mind it as long as i can either:1) delegate some orders with precise instructions to a bot.2) delegate some orders with precise instructions to a human friend.3) able to set precise instructions to update orders in the existing market interface so that i can update orders faster that once per hour!"
7/5/2011,"you say that someone with 305 open orders is at a disadvantage because he can't update his orders fast enough to compete with some who has 5 orders open. that he needs to be able to update near instantly with a bot.i say someone with 300+ orders open is at a tremendous advantage over someone with only 5 open. sure the guy with 5 may sneak some buying/selling in while yo update your 300 orders. but you have 295 orders that he doesn't.you're making your isk on sheer volume at that level. and like a **** ton more of it then someone with 5 buy orders up.all allowing boting would do imo is make it so already very well established traders have even more capability to drive out smaller competition, and corner regional markets 23/7.that's the other thing about bots. they don't sleep. someone with enough capital and a bot could very easily lock down some of the small regional markets 365/23/7. the only thing holding them back at present being the fact they can't be loged in all the time.so no, no bots. it's just a bad idea."
7/5/2011,"honestly, ccp should just build more market tools that are opened by skill training that will take over the functions people are currently using market bots to do. evens the playing field. what are the downsides to that? it definitely makes the game more realistic. people can buy automated order/ship/etc software in modern times, i can't imagine my serious business spaceship pilot wouldn't have access to such software."
7/5/2011,"right, but what you are saying is that the more orders you have, the less able to stay on top of them you should be. but that's okay, you have more orders out, therefore you make more money. all that is true, save the last part. more orders do not mean more money generally speaking. you have have 10 orders of 1 unit or 1 order of 10, would be the same.i would be happy with a bot that only worked while i was online and not afk. (if you figure out a way to ensure this).or just let me delegate to a person.to spice up the discussion, i belive that most overlook the negatives (to the user) of a market bot. almost always people think that bots are one way boosts for their users, therefore is a 'cheat'. yes, mining and missioning bots are. but, market bots have both good and bad sides for the trader using them. they are simplistic, and therefore can be gamed and manipulated by a human. you can push prices up or down, have them follow, then dump onto them. etc etc.what i'm saying is that the users of trading bots will be burned sometimes as a downside, along with the upsides. it's not an ""i win"" button for traders."
7/5/2011,"while i agree that it's not an iwin button by any means, i also fear that it would become something of a requirement to compete on a large scale, even between higher volume traders. since two people with 300 orders to update, one with a bot one without engaging in .01 games. well obviously the bot will win that every time.i do rather like the idea of being able to game a bot through driving the prices and then dumping on them though. brings to mind ideas of buying low in one region, hauling in, slowly driving the price the bot is buying for up, then dumping hard on him.after rexamining what you've said, i have to say i'm not 100% sure it would be a bad thing. the only real misgiving i still have is 365/23/7 bots. if they found a way around that (which i find doubtful) it might not be all that bad."
7/5/2011,"lol, i can't argue with that, for me though, that does not justify the introduction of bots.ccp gives us tools, we decide how to use them. suppose you did have a full rack of 305 orders, you don't have to update all 305. you could be lazy on 290 and only focus on the 15 moment to moment.some of mine take months to cycle, some i turn in 24 hours. depends on my mood and if there is a spread that can be exploited at the moment.1) i think we can be pretty sure ccp isn't going to allow market bots.2) sadly this doesn't work, and even if it did, i wouldn't trust most people not to screw up anyway. 3) yes ...a different type of order, call it a ""move order"" that automatically shifted along with the high buy or the low sell, as the case may be, would eliminate the need you describe. it would also have the effect of squashing spreads. that may or may not be a bad thing. as a lazy trend trader it would be good for me, but would end up as bad for the people that do not mind updating all their orders.maybe shift your strategy, just focus on the things with a decent spread and good volume. chances are that opportunity will shift around anyway."
7/5/2011,"i agree with your opinion against botting, but you are missing one key point. jita is already dominated by bots. it is currently against the eula but marketing bots are almost impossible to catch. and if they do catch them they need solid proof before they ban the account or they will risk banning someone who does not use a bot but is just very intelligent and dedicated. however, the botting is bad enough now. if they made in acceptable then it would be 100 times worse. i say leave it as it is, and keep trying to eliminate the bots. i do like the idea though of making the market more complex, with more skills allowing more detailed market orders and trending. make the market more interesting and more challenging, the true traders will love it even more."

7/5/2011,"the ops suggestion is actually very useful for alot of reasons. let's say you need a cyno or hauler alt that don't really require alot of skillpoints. it might not be worth to keep plexing a new account for this simple use, but paying a one time fee on a plex for a 2nd temporary training slot would.i actually like this."

7/5/2011,"oh yeah, sorry i forgot that instead of 1,200 players in jita on a normal day there were 2,000 players total, some of which were protesting against mt, yet mt has been implemented and it's here to stay, unlike the protests which fizzled as soon as it wasn't fashionable to shoot the monument anymore. so yes, you are right, i don't care that some people are opposed to mt, which is the same attitude you have for not caring about the people who are in support of mt. got anything other than that to hit me with?ccp has merely said that they will not sell items that give you an unfair advantage in the nex store. the fact that ccp is selling plex already proves that ccp doesn't consider spending rl cash on in-game currency which is then used to purchase characters as an unfair advantage. do you know why that is? because for every 20 bil character that was bought with plex ccp made $900 in cold hard cash, twice! once for the original subscription to get the character to the sp and once from the guy who bought 60 plexes to pay for it.in addition this thread isn't about in-game items like ships, ammo, bpos, etc., it's about skillpoints and someone who obtains skillpoints via cash (which is already possible today) does not have an unfair advantage over someone who's been gaining skillpoints at a normal rate.simple economics are that according to the qen q4 2010 plex is the item with the highest trade value on any given day and the trade volume of plex is growing constantly. let me put it into simpler terms for you; lots of people want to dump money into eve, and ccp wants that money. those are some pretty simple economics and i do care about them.what i did do is thank meissa for his service even though it is meaningless. that the csm is irrelevant isn't meissa's fault. the csm is a marketing tool to manipulate customers into believing that they have a stake in what decisions are made but the reality is that ccp does what ccp wants to do, whether the csm agrees or not."
7/5/2011,"so you ignore that the protests were against non-vanity mt being even considered by ccp? do you think anyone here missed your lame attempt to try and ignore that?if it isn't clear to you that people being able to buy their way to whatever high level skills they want is harmful to eve, then you don't understand the whole point of games and why things are high level in the first place... *disbelief* do you not understand what games are? the whole point of games? i'll give you a clue - it's about overcoming challenges and the reward that brings - not buying your way to everything with zero effort.i have no idea what on earth you're trying to say about plex above, but the reason plex is not harmful to eve is (and i repeat myself here as so many have you already you arrogant moron) a) plex required the original buyer to pay ccp with rl money, so ccp still gets paid for the sub, and b) plex bought in-game requires in-game player effort and time to earn.uhhh... yes, they do. duh. how exactly is buying your way to what others had to spent time and effort on not an unfair advantage????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? how? please use logic and reason to explain why. because no one here with any brains can work that one out... not players, not csm, not other notable players, not the press, not ccp.simple economics are that according to the qen q4 2010 plex is the item with the highest trade value on any given day and the trade volume of plex is growing constantly. let me put it into simpler terms for you; lots of people want to dump money into eve, and ccp wants that money. those are some pretty simple economics and i do care about them."
7/5/2011,"let me lay out some mistaken assumptions that many of then proponents of this thread seem to have.i am going to avoid quoting any specific response, as it seems some people on the thread have a penchant for going off topic into personal attacks or irrelevant arguments, so hopefully a generic response will avoid triggering any testosterone knee-jerk reactions. misconceptions:1) a new player in eve, you should be allowed to 'catch up' with vet players who have been playing a long time. this is sometimes called the 'rubber banding' ai cheat in racing games. the basic premise is that people (or ai cars) who fall far behind the leader gets game mechanic boosts, in order to level the playing field, allowing them to catch up.- this is neither a desired feature, nor a necessary one in eve. not desirable:eve is a complete economic sandbox. it tries to be a mirror to rl where it can. you don't get a boost when you start working at mcdonald's because you started 3 years later. it would be unfair to the people who started 3 years earlier and are already managers. best you should do is make some manager friends.not necessary:rich players or vet players are not competing with beginning players. they are not ratting in highsec or mining veldspar. they are busy building their empires, running their alliance, or strategizing about which null sec sector to move into. as you move up the corporate ladder, you do bigger and better things. your life doesn't necessarily get easier, mind you. a beginner may not be able to match the skills of a vet, but skills don't mean everything. they only are important in a fair toe to toe fight. (and if you find yourself in one, you did something wrong) you can always outsmart or get the jump on someone with higher skills.2) it's a just a vocal minority against mt etc etc...- all the arguments in this bucket are irrelevant, as they point to either # people in jita, number of users who actually read these forums etc etc.both sides are guilty of fallacy if you are making any argument based on this premise. instead think of it as a have-not's vs have's discussion. what this proposal amounts to, is a meta-game method by which you can improve your game.in the real world, this is called corruption. using a friend of the family to get you that promotion, bribing politicians to get your bills passed... insider trading etc. (using means outside the boundaries of the system, in order gain an advantage in the system). now, i have pointed out many times already that yes, these meta-game loopholes already exist, (in plex->isk) but a) why justify making another loophole? b) plex prices are at least governed by some other supply/demand factors. selling sp for $ at a fixed rate is a level of magnitude worse as it is direct and at a fixed price.having both an isk 'cheat' and an sp 'cheat' is so detrimental to the game community, it should be obvious any rationally minded person.3) what's the harm in this change? what if we did allow beginners to jump ahead in skill points... it will be good!- for the myopic, yes. sure, we all want more beginners to enjoy eve, but you have to remember that any beginner only boost will either be grievously unfair to those who came before that did not have the option to speed up their learning, or it will be used and abused by everyone. just because it can be used for 'good' for noobs doesn't mean that isk rich players won't use it as well, and like an arms race, if you can fly that carrier before your enemies, then you win, so everyone (who can afford it) will start buying sp like pancakes on shrove tuesday. who loses? all the casual players who don't want to spend $50usd a month just to 'keep up'. congratulations, that probably is mostly the beginners and noobs that this proposal was supposed to help.you have effectively made 'game balance' a meta-game controlled contest going to whoever wants to spend the most usd. bribery."
7/5/2011,"continued...lmao - so you treat csm with contempt, and it's all a conspiracy against players like you who if only allowed to buy your way into easy cheat mode, you'd be fulfilled and would have won against us nasty players who like to force effort and challenge onto you in games.how tragic you're forced to play games that are competitive, with other players willing to abide by the rules and succeed. it must be awful to finally be in a situation where everybody doesn't automatically 'win', as with al past 'games' in your life where your parents made sure little humpink was never exposed to challenge or the possibility of failure. it must be extremely disturbing to you to discover you actually have to work hard to achieve, and even then you may not succeed or be able to manage everything under the sun. how appalling you're now forced to realise you and life has limitations, and you can't do and be anything you want.really - i feel for you. it must be so horrible to deal with what games actually are. you poor, poor thing. it totally excuses your extreme arrogance, laziness, selfishness and condescension.there there. there there."
7/5/2011,"you have a misconception about the misconception. ;)perhaps others in this thread have but personally i am not advocating that a new player can catch up to any old player. the comment about cash allowing one to buy an advantage in my first post was merely to get the discussion going.i do think that any player, new or old, should have the ability to create a new character which allows the player to experience a larger portion of the game from day 1.sorry to say that your analogy with rl employment fails, that's three for three on the analogy side. the comparison to mcdonalds fails because skill training is completely passive, all vets had to do was pay and wait.skillpoints determine which parts of the game one can experience to what degree. new players, or alts, or younger existing players are denied access to aspects of the game simply because they, due to no fault of their own, haven't been playing the game for as long as others.the flaw in eve is that skillpoints can not be gained through effort. the rate at which they are gained is fairly constant within a range. in other mmos you can progress faster if you put in more active playtime, in eve you can not. this is by design but it's just to illustrate that players are powerless when it comes to gaining sp beyond the 2,400 sp/hr or whatever the max is.sorry, again the comparison just doesn't work because buying sp for cash is nothing like corruption irl.it's much more fitting to compare an eve character to a nice 2,600 sqft house with a double wide detached garage and a pool in back. you can build the house on your own time, a few hours a day after work and on your days off, and it will take you a few years to get it done. alternatively you can pay a contractor to build it for you and have it ready in just one summer. it's more expensive to have someone else build it but to the buyer that expense is worth it.it's not a loophole, it's an intended and highly profitable feature. it wasn't introduced by accident and it's not something that till be ""fixed"". it was created with purpose in mind to address the needs of the consumer. that's what businesses do, they find out what consumers want and then come up with ways to make that happen and make profit.let's just give the proponents the benefit of a doubt and assume that they aren't all total ******s. i don't see how it would be detrimental. yes there would be some emo rage but apart from that actual reasonable detriment still needs to be pointed out. it wouldn't be unfair since the option will be available to everyone. times past are ""sunk cost"" if you will, they have no bearing on the current or the future."
7/5/2011,"you fail to realize that gaining skillpoints is not competitive. skillpoints are gained at the same rate for everyone (allowing minor variations in sp/hr depending on attributes and implants). player skill has no impact on gaining skillpoints, all a player does is pay for the skillpoints and wait.if you want to make an argument against buying sp for cash then make one that at the very least makes some sense because describing skillpoint gain as a competitive activity makes no sense at all."
7/5/2011,"look at wow. every player there is at the level cap, or is desperately grinding towards the level cap so they can start playing the actual game. people below the level cap? bah, they're useless in everything! nobody wants them at all for what they are, excepting as level caps in the making. so, wow, despite being an rpg with levels, actually has very little to do with experience and levels at the real meat of the game. this is what we'd face here.""what's that? you haven't ground to level 5 in amarr supercarrier yet? you haven't maxed out all your skills? you're useless, p1ss off!""once more it would come down to equipment, but there's not enough variety in pve or even the selection of equipment available to make that worthwhile. an exaggerated example? maybe, but my bet is we'd start seeing this kind of thing within weeks of the ability to grind sp coming in."
7/5/2011,"indeed. also for the umpteenth time i point out that one of the great things about eve is that even a very new player in a low level ship can be useful as part of a team (e.g. scouts, tacklers, haulers), or solo. it is not necessary to be flying an [insert very high level ship and fit here]. in most roles it's not even desirable!those with massive entitlement issues in this thread need to get over their hard on for high level skills, and just play the bloody game (or better yet just move on). everyone else is playing the game, and the vast majority are getting by just fine without years of skills under their belts.cry me a river you can't do xyz high level thing in eve yet. diddums. you've still an entire sandbox of options, the vast majority of which are open to anyone with a couple months training time under their belts. if that's too hard for you, then you need to either harden the !@#$ up, or !@#$ off. stop !@#$ing whinging here."
7/5/2011,"you know what - you're 100% right and make total sense. skill training time is utterly without value! there is nothing competative about the effort required to gather the resorces and build the infrastructure to utilise those high level skills in the highest levels of industry and combat!thus i propose every player be given 10,000,000,000 skill points upon account activation. it's not right they should have to do anything but fly the very highest level ships, equip the very highest level mods, and run the highest level iundustry and research jobs from day one. ignoring how useful all those other ships and jobs are, and the sense of value players get from having taken the time to train high skills, i think every player should get every single skill handed to them on a silver platter! awesome idea.my name is toovhon, and i endorse this grand idiocy :-)"
7/5/2011,"maybe you should stick to console games then.maybe you should stop wasting time trying to figure out the problems with my analogies and more on figuring out why your proposal is ridiculous.you say 'flaw' i say 'by design'. really? your analogy relies on you using money to get the house built. money that you earn in rl to use on something in rl. that is *not* the same as using rl money to get you something in eve economy. please look up the definition of ""meta-gaming"" before you continue with any analogies."
7/5/2011,"so what you are arguing is that you start wow, and you should be able to buy that super +10 armor and vorpal sword +20 just because you are a rich brat who's daddy gives you $100 a month allowance. what a horrible world new eden will become if every rich brat could get whatever they wanted when they wanted. i think it is sufficient to say that the argument has been made and proven beyond any doubt here. i don't think i need to say anything else on the matter."
7/5/2011,"ow, dude, friendly fire!try reading it properly and look at the inflections and word choices and then see whether i support this idea."
7/5/2011,"oops sorry! i'm neither dude nor american, so sorry if i missed sarcasm."
7/5/2011,"i'm also australian, not american if that's what you are implying."
7/5/2011,"outside of tacklers and ewar ships its t2 or gtfo if you want to have a successful roam. so yea its basically ""what's that? you haven't ground to level 5 in amarr supercarrier yet? you haven't maxed out all your skills? you're useless, p1ss off!"" already."
7/5/2011,"au contraire. sixth-graders and first-graders are both on the same playground (namely, school); the former just happens to be way further ahead of the latter. yes, the sixth-grader has a clear edge, but it's not an any unfair advantage: his advantage just stems from having been in school longer. in terms of eve, the sixth-grader is simply in a different league: he's dealing with sovereignty and supercaps, while the newbie just lost his first destroyer in a lv 1 mission. yet each player has to go thru the exact same motions of completing skills, without the ability to buy himself into a super-training pack for aur. that's what makes it all balanced.add to this, that the difference between a vet and a newer player is mitigated by game mechanics that are available to the newer player as well: if you can fly a scorpion, and you can ecm a bit, you can jam the vet: nothing he can do about it (except use his brains and experience to prevent such an encounter, perhaps).so, i reiterate that some people having (considerably) more sp than others does not in any way, shape, or form make the game unbalanced. and no aur-for-sp should ever be introduced for the purpose of 'rebalancing' said sp differences."
7/5/2011,"sp means nothing and vets are so afraid of being catched up, they call it cheat if other's bullet cause the same damage as theirs do. really sad.vets have advantage in real life? they also get old and die so the young eventually catch up, do you want that happen to your character? so stop talking about rl, it's just game design. and i must say that as a game design, sp is a terrible failure, it's nothing about justice or necessity or any theory, it is a failure because that as a game design, it does drive newbies away. newbies have so many better choices than getting bored out waiting or playing vulnerable prey for someone they can never catch up to have the chance to fight back.an average player does start a game with some competive mind no matter it is correct or not to you. and they do leave as soon as they realize that there is no chance of equality. what will be your choice if your only choice is either play constricted content or get blowed up and trolled, in a video game? i prefer real life where at least robbers don't get insurance pay and sixth-grades are not free to beat up the younger. this problem is so predictable as i wonder how could ccp made this mistake at first if they intended to run the game in long-term."
7/5/2011,"newbies as you say can only be useful for scouts/ haulers/ tacklers and then after 3 months maybe a really crappy drake pilot.wow are you guys dense to see the hold back new player skill limitations are? and why it makes most newbies quit?i could care less about skill points for people over 50 million sp. what i'm saying is new players are lost daily to having no options open to them to progress upto a level where they can really be useful and enjoy eve in pvp and enjoying high level missions.sure skill points are an incredibly useful part of the game that builds growth and things to look forward too, but new players really should be cut some slack so the new player quit ratio is lower. amazed ccp's let it go on this long. how many people joined and quit after they hit some 3 week brick wall in training and didn't want to run low level super repetivie level 3 missions???? 100,000's thats how many.say what you want, you can't deny the new player experience sucks and loses the eve universe a huge amount of new players because its too harsh and too freaking limiting and boring"
7/5/2011,"then you're joining the wrong roams. i regularly fly in fun roams in ships not requiring more than a couple months to get into suitably decent fits. i've also seen many corps and groups of friends running roams that include month old characters. yes - their choice of roles is limited at that point, but so is what you can do at the beginning of any rpg, mmo or not. i don't recall running molten core on a level 10 druid in vanilla wow either.more likely your use of ""you haven't ground to level 5 in amarr supercarrier yet?"" simply shows you have no idea of the variety most roaming gangs fly or fit, if you think that's the only suitable option. i'm sorry you have such a low opinion of any other role but dpsing supercap, but all that says to me is eve is really not the game for you."
7/5/2011,"althought im for sp for plex there is a very good argument against it : in opposite to bazaar method the amount of high skilled toons could explode. if this happens it could force a ""skill race"". ccp has to fall a decision : freedom of individual purpose vs. less freedom and more or less equality like we have it now. you can find good arguments in this discussion for both proposals. this decision is more of a moral kind. its like ""is greed good"" ? if you seek personal freedom you say yes, if not no. i choose yes."
7/5/2011,"yes, there is equality, among their peers: people with a comparable sp count. and they can level the playing field, and even win skirmishes, when using superior numbers and/or smart tactics.and, btw, what do you think vets are? there have all been noobs too, at some point. and yet they didn't run away either, did they? so, if you mean that eve is not for the instant-gratification crowd that wants to play in the major league today, then you're right: it isn't.so, all a new player really can't do is fly a supercap yet. but within his own league he can be every bit as competitive as the vet in his nyx. that's the charm of eve."
7/5/2011,"good on ya for totally ignoring everything you can do and everywhere you can go as a new low sp player. gosh it's such a closed off universe, isn't it? well at least it is when you see anything less than flying a supercap as having fun... :-dit didn't drive me away. but then i didn't foolishly see doing something requiring high level skills as the the only thing worth doing. stuff i did in my first month:level iv missions as part of a fleet (during my first couple days in-game in fact) - great fun :-) my ceo taught me how to play and handle myself so i didn't die too often, and knew how to handle basic fleet mechanics.solo missioning up to level iis (which also meant getting my first cruiser - a vexor - and drones! love pet classes *grins* ).mining.my first venture into lowsec guided by a more experienced mate i made in my rookie corp - scary, but fun!salvaging other people's mission - the isk was rolling in now :-)some low level exploration - thank the powers for the youtube video on how to probe, heh.none of which required high level skills (unless you count the ability communicate and meet people willing to game together), and all of which were great fun!maybe you should stop worrying about what others are doing, and start enjoying what you're capable of right now. if you take the attitude that nothing but [insert very high level skill] is worth a damn, of course you're not going to have fun in eve! or if you associate with people who only ever say that - same result.i've never stopped having fun in eve, right from day one to now when i'm flying a typhoon fleet issue (the most skill intensive t1 non-cap ship in eve) in missions, various navy frigates and stealth bombers in roams, t2 mining barges for ore and ice, run research operations spanning minmatar and gallente space, etc, etc.i still can't fly a cap ship. i don't care that i can't fly a capital. i haven't even bothered training towards flying a cap.instead i took my first ceo's advice and took a shorter term view towards having fun in eve: i first worked on training up battlecruisers, as the bc is the easiest way to start running harder content - even wormholes in a gang. later i built on those skills to get into battleships, but only after i'd spent a couple months getting my bc skills up to a decent level, which helped a lot when it came time to run my new bs (as a lot of the skill bonuses applied to my bses fit too.i also spent a lot of time building up my mining, industry and science skills, as those were areas of interest as well.but the point..."
7/5/2011,"...is that i didn't try to train to fly a capital or any other high level skill immediately. i didn't even try to fly a bs till i was several months into eve. was i making less isk than cap pilots in 0.0? was i taking part in smaller less important operations? yes, and yes. was i still having a bunch of fun and earning more than enough isk to fund my new ventures? yes again.you've got a massive hard on for high level skills and/or you're associating with eve players who either don't want more low level players, or foolishly look down upon them. well i'm sorry if this sounds harsh - but that's your fault. take some personal responsibility and get rid of the idea you need to fly a capital or be earning 100's of mil per day to be having fun, and stop associating with people who belittle you (though frankly i'm inclined to believe this is a mental issue of your own making...).i'm telling you and heaps of other players will tell you the same: there are plenty of opportunities for new players in eve, and players more than willing to group with and help them out.for that matter - i'm really rather curious: would you mind telling me why in your case you think lower level skill activities in eve are not fun for you? i really want to know. perhaps i can help you see there are other fun options that don't involve ******ing eve for everyone.finally: accept you will not succeed in ******ing eve. the vast majority of players wouldn't stand for it. ccp wouldn't stand for it. it. is. not. going. to. happen. so deal with it, please. stop whinging, and start being proactive with your own experience."
7/5/2011,"and thank you, toovhon, for putting into words what i could only descrive as a feeling of horror at the concepts being expressed in this thread."
7/5/2011,"ha, thanks zephy, it's a rant that's been building up since the mt riots brought every forum troll, crank, fool and whinger to the surface a couple weeks ago. i'm just glad it turned out semi-readable :-)though realistically i doubt it will have much effect. these cranks and whingers seem more interested in whinging, than being proactive in their own play. still, i feel a bit better having said it all, heh.see ya starside!"
7/5/2011,"hi,i hope the op still reads this thread. in a nutshell; the massive difference between plex for isk and then isk for characters/in-game items and plex for items or skillpoints is injection.ccp have plex being sold to players for in-game currency because the currency is generated at a normal pace. the same goes for selling characters; they were trained at a regular pace.to sell skillpoints or items that were not created by 'normal' means (time investment, looting, etc) is the fastest way to break an economy like eve's. it will also quickly change the dynamic of the game if thousands of people can quickly buy their way into a particular type of ship.i hope that explains why your idea, while theoretically fine, is fundamentally game breaking."
7/5/2011,"didnt read whole thread but imo they should sell partial respecs instead of sp. like 1m sp respec (of skills of choice), 2m 5m max or so. one/two months delay between respecs. no full respec though."
7/5/2011,"i agree with humpink that skillpoint (sp) should be allowed to be brought with rl cash. even if one buys sp one still needs the isk to buy the skillbooks, ship and etc.the reason i support buying of sp is purely personal. i was unable to play eve due to rl issues. these issues have are gone now and i am back playing but i am a full two years behind on sp training. i would love a game mechanic so i could catch up on those skill point training."
7/5/2011,"well you don't really need to worry about me that much or try that hard to argue with me. the game didn't bother me that much: i subbed and moved on, just enjoying some last whine while dying out.i understand your point: although there are many unplesant in the game, you chose to overcome(or enjoy) it with your patience and optimism etc. that's good personality of you you r a life enjoyer, and i chose to simply unsub. it is not saying that i don't have the good personality as you do, it is just i don't see the point of using my patience and optimism in a video game. i pay ccp, not the opposite; and i pay for some simple entertainment of flying spaceship, not for some harsh lesson to learn. you see a game as the best place to use your good personality, while i don't. so when i realized that it is 3 years ahead of flying the ship i like and one can never have a revenge to the sixth-graders, i blame ccp rather than quited players--to newbies it is simply not 15 dollar per month worth entertainment.actually i personally, as a player, can go with the skill stuff, i quited more because the game has too many broken stuff to be merely called finished. as somewhat a designer myself, i will be very shamed to sell these crap ui and flawed system to the customer, and i see skill system as one big money disperser too, that's why i reply here."
7/5/2011,"respecs only make sense to me in games with a fixed skill point allocation, e.g. wow.if you train as a miner in eve, and then decide to train as a missioner, or researcher for example, your mining skills have not become useless, nor are they stopping you from training something else. you're simply not using them right now.tradeoffs and choices are a key part of gaming, and life in general. do i go left or right in this fps level? do i bring my exploding cherries or walnuts in this plants vs. zombies level? do i train to fly a freighter, or a stealth bomber in eve? i have to make a choice which to prioritise. if i could respec i wouldn't have to make these choices or tradeoffs. i could just throw my sps into one skill, and bump up it's relevant attributes to maximise training time. then later i could put those sps into whatever i feel like at the time.no having to make difficult choices. no having to live with your choices. that smacks of easy mode to me, and i don't play eve to have no choices or challenges. and i say again it's unnecessary given you can can switch your training any time, and once more - you don't need to have skills at a high level to enjoy eve."
7/5/2011,little humpink is far too impressed with wealth to have actually grown up with it.
7/5/2011,this is not a flaw in eve. it is one of the selling points of eve. it is also one of the selling points of dust according to one of the blurbs. it's a flaw to you because you can't use your welfare check to pay for sps.
7/5/2011,"well i still think you're overlooking an awful lot of fun that can be had with lower level ships. it's not just an optimistic attitude on my part. truth be told i'm actually quite a cynical person! :-d certainly i was highly critical and downcast about ccp during the recent protests over mt and incarna's shoddiness and focus on fluff and new features over fixing and improving current features.but anyway - some of the best fun i've had in eve was flying the smallest ships. big ships in big fleets are not actually that exciting most of the time. seriously. small gang roams in smaller ships have been some of the most heart pounding frenetic fun i've ever had in eve :-)i agree 100% about ccp's general crappiness when it comes to buggy code, testing, listening to testers, and feature and commitment adhd. i myself am taking a break when my current sub runs out in about 40 days as protest against this, as well as recent attitudes towards customers that were revealed in leaks leading up to the riots.i am pleased by the results of the recent emergency csm summit, but i'd like to see some action from ccp before i start trusting them again.i also admit a break from eve is a great excuse to play some of the other games that have piled up unplayed while my mmo addiction runs rampant :-) not to mention some rl projects that have gone neglected too for long, heh.anyway, go well and i hope you find an mmo that better suits you!

7/5/2011,"not sure what game you are playing but if you are talking 0.0 alliances that's what is largely already happening. if you can't fly/fit a fleet fit bs then you are in many cases not allowed to join. less than 10/15/20/25 mil sp? nope, sorry go back to empire noob!unless you never leave empire you will run into discrimination based on skillpoints all over. don't make me link recruitment threads to illustrate the point, just have a look at it yourself.the bottom line is that it should be up to the player to decide which ship he or she finds necessary or desirable to fly, preferably without having to wait a couple of years to do so.the thing to consider is that it isn't 2003 anymore. back in the day there was very little true competition for good games. today things are vastly different. ndp released their 2011 gaming report stating that over 40% of all game purchases were made from mobile devices. the gaming population is extremely fractured between pc, consoles, and mobile devices. in addition people tend to simply have less time. in 2007 ccp released some stats saying the average age of the eve player was 27 years old. that's working adults, people who have to think about how to spend their very limited entertainment time to their maximum entertainment benefit (those selfish bastards!!!). when looking at it from that perspective then eve is simply not a good choice. while some vets may have their head in the sand ccp is well aware that eve holds very little appeal to the casual gamer. selling sp for cash in some controlled fashion would raise the appeal and the profits."
7/5/2011,not sure want blurbs you are reading but dust will be 100% mt based. want a better gun or better ammo? pay for it.
7/5/2011,blurbs such as the ones you ignore. you do have this habit of ignoring whatever it is you do not like.
7/5/2011,"first of all i wouldn't want a new player in a serious 0.0 fleet fighting over sov. even if they could easy cheat mode their way into a decently fit bs right off the bat, i doubt they could fly it for more than five minutes without it turning into a pretty ball of plasma, and/or ****ing off the fc by not knowing wtf to do.secondly once again you treat anything that isn't 0.0 fleet warfare in big ships as some kind of lesser activity lacking fun. not ime. not in most player's experiences. i repeat - i've had some of my best moments in eve in small fleets of frigate to bc size ships in lowsec, highsec and wh space. my times in 0.0 by contrast have not been as exciting, so far. if you really think massive fleet warfare is some kind of crazy nonstop joyride... well, i'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but by and large it isn't for most pilots involved. it's enjoyable, yes. but hardly edge of the seat like the small gang warfare i've taken part in.thirdly - if you're not having fun yet, it's no one's fault but yourself. you can try and blame it on not being a big ship in big fleets, but sorry - that's not really why. see my earlier posts in this thread for more on that subject.once more with the dismissive attitude towards ships and activities requiring less sps, and the bizarre idea that letting every noob immediately fly bses and caps is going to work out well. if nothing else instant gratification in mmos works against the very idea behind mmos - the whole point of progression is to give players something to always work towards. without goals and rewards over time, mmos die a quick death as players burn through everything in a flash, then leave bored.this is not a game that lasts two days and then you've done it all. it's a game where you can play two years and still not have scratched the surface - which is as it should be. *sighs* you really don't get what an mmo is, do you?"
7/5/2011,"if ""eve holds very little appeal to the casual gamer"" then wtf are you still doing here? despite it being spelt out to you by ccp just a few days ago in the devblog on the recent summit, you still seem to think they're going to start selling non-vanity stuff like sps in eve. i'm sorry, but it's beginning to come across as a rather pathetic delusion at this point.the playerbase is against your absurd game-breaking ideas. ccp is against them. csm is against it. simple logic dictates your ideas are utterly wrong for a game like eve. but nothing seems to register for you. what exactly would it take for sense to register for you?because so far you've tried to portray the vast anti-mt majority in eve as a minority (lmao), csm as irrelevant (who do you think elected them and made clear what issues matter to them? :-d well??), and you speak like you think you know what ccp really believes, even when your words fly directly in the face of what ccp has said multiple times, most recently under great pressure from a very annoyed playerbase, an exasperated and more than a little frustrated csm, a pr disaster, and a stream of unflattering media coverage.but still - none of it registers for you...you're either a super annoying troll, or seriously in need of therapy. because you sir are badly, badly out of touch with reality."
7/5/2011,"noob, frigate, point, mwd.....fcking hero. you do not need to be in a bs to be of use to a fleet or gang. all you need to do is listen, and learn by doing."
7/5/2011,"ccp tagline: eve is realq: what is real about instantly being good at whatever you want to learn? a: nothingin real life things take time to learn, and become good at. i can't instantly buy zomg brilliance at astrophysics. it takes years of study(learning/training), hard work, and research.so if ccp wants eve to be real, training time stays."
7/5/2011,"on this sub-thread of corporation worth. does it even need to be that complicated?suppose the shares, when you checked on the info, market graph/etc also showed a dividend history. if you see a corp not paying dividends, then don't buy it. we can calculate pe, heck the graph or a new graph could show historical pe along with market history.nice data to have would be price, dividend history, outstanding shares, shares owned by the corp, largest ten holders, how widely held, total capitalization. leave it up to players to decide if the offering is worth anything or not.this sort of information should be enough to allow wise people to see if a stock is worth its price. and in eve, since its so easy to scam and shift assets around, will having a calculated net worth of a corp be of any real use anyway? i wouldn't trust it with your ten foot pole, assuming anyone here has a ten foot pole, gutter minds.the information i listed, could not be faked but still leaves lots of room for the evil games people like to play."
7/5/2011,"adding another artificial 'solution' to the problem doesn't fix anything. it just proves that we can go on and on finding loopholes, and you coming up with 'patches' for them. :)i really don't think that this line of argument will be fruitful, but just to show you that we 'can' go on forever...so i start up a holding corp. leave it running for 3 years. day 1, i issue stock to my friends of this corp. day 2 i put all the money made from my wh alliance into it, the whole bank, this includes the treasuries of many corps in my alliance. stock price shoots through the roof because stock price is determined by some fixed formula *shakes head*. day 3+ we sell our stock, make lots of isk.suck out all the money out of the holding corp put back into alliance. price drops, we don't care, we sold all shares already.stock prices (heck any commodity) cannot be set by a formula. it doesn't work. if you managed to figure out a way that this would work, then you would have invented communism."
7/5/2011,"a step in the right direction, but still the problem is that a corp can liquidate all its assets without any say from the shareholders. thereby making shareholders essentially powerless.a good start would be to allow shareholders to vote on important corp decisions and having a periodic financial report. but this is a sisyphean task, as long as directors can pull money out/in at will, and as long as money moves without regulation in the galaxy, there can never be enough 'trust' in the system for people to buy any equity shares.as much as i would love to see this, it just won't happen in eve without some big regulatory changes to install trust in the market in credit, both personal credit and corporate credit."
7/5/2011,"one of the problems is that money should not be able to flow into and out of a corporate wallet on a whim. there has to be a legitimate transaction of business. an investment of capital, a product purchase or sale, or a compensation plan for 'employees'. it isn't realistic that a ceo has total control of a corporation without any sort of checks or balances in place.the power should be in the shares, not the position. if you are a ceo with 100% ownership, than that is fine. but any corporation trying to sell itself, needs to have some sort of accountability in place... and i don't mean the honor system kind."
7/5/2011,"even at 100% ownership, there are legal restriction on how corporate assets can be used. to the people talking about rating agencies... lulwut? are you talking about bonds? there are news companies that specialize in giving people insight into what corporations are doing so they can make mildly educated purchasing decisions when it comes to their stock portfolio. but, as far as price goes, it is based on the going rate. the going rate is a supply/demand thing. people use many different metrics to determine their own valuation of a stock. current ratio, price/book, debt/equity, peg ratio, short/float, short ratio, roe, and many others to get an idea what direction the stock price will be going in the x time-frame they plan on holding an investment. some will forecast future value based on these metrics, then run their favorite npv calculation to determine which stock to purchase. the calculations are often automated. buy orders and sell orders based on changes to these numbers, and of course, the actual list price. the reason we do not have a stock market in eve is because there are no regulations, or inter-corporate checks and balances (such as the locking of assets that can be verified by stock holders), and there are no trusted external audits of corporate finances. most importantly, there are no exchanges (would require fairly heavy api traffic if they were player-made and would require a financial incentive to build such a thing)."
7/5/2011,as it stands there's just too many ways for an investor to get screwed with little to no repercussions for corporations or individuals. if they do implement a stockmarket it would have to be locked down pretty tight with a pretty transparent money trail.
7/5/2011,"i focus on the data and not on the ""rules"" for the stock thing. the more ""rules"" we request ccp to code, the less likely they are to do it. setting up data views of things as i suggested is easy, setting up some votes to allow the taking down of a pos or moving some cash between wallet divisions is asking more than we can reasonably expect. point being, the less we request, the more we're likely to achieve.i often make this error in my suggestions too :)i'd love to see full stocks, bonds etc myself. what is the minimal needed that can ccp can reasonably deliver."
7/5/2011,"so many threads going on now about the acrid new players experience in eve has gotten me pondering on this topic. though many of the solutions suggested in the other threads are not viable nor effective (the ones that basically amount to 'cheat' boosts for noobs) i believe the problem is a valid one. what if the game (as in npcs) were to award players with medals for achievements? carebear stuff for faction empires, kills and pvp achievements from pirate factions. something like the medal system in fw. make these medals visible to all. what this addresses is that newbies lack direction, or a 'goal' in the beginning. they may be coming from linear progression games like wow or other simple mmos. they aren't used to the sandbox. they are overwhelmed with all the choices. the career agents go a long way, but the sense of achievement is still a little lacking. give them trophies for mission grinding, for being a good miner... etc. i think may go a long way to give beginners something to strive for, at least until they get their sealegs and venture out on their own.some medal ideas:missions done (by department)standing level achievedtypes of asteroids minedamount of asteroids minedfaction loyalty, x mission for a faction etc.kills achieved. (by enemy npc, capsuleer)courier contracts completedopen to any other ideas, comments.this is very much an idea only... any constructive criticism appreciated."
7/5/2011,i agree wholeheartedly.
7/5/2011,"yes please! while they look great as detail in space, as icons they are just ""blobs""."
7/5/2011,"ffs, yeah!"

7/5/2011,"i doubt it will happen, but supported."
7/5/2011,"(edit: changed the title so it doesn't dance around the topic, it gets right to it)i actually had an idea somewhat recently for plex to do more without actually deviating from it's original purpose: game time. the idea actually banked on game time, but in a different way than it has. i was thinking of how you can't train more than one character on an account; what would be the reaction to the idea of allowing a plex to unlock the ability to train a second character on the same account for a limited amount of time? not only would this be invaluable for certain players, but it keeps with the idea of plex for game time, and ultimately isn't game-breaking or -altering or whatever, from what i can tell, but i'd let my fellow pilots be the judge.not to mention it means another way to consume plexes besides just extending your account's play time that doesn't involve a secondary currency. i figure it could allow anything around a full month (adjusted if needed) worth of dual-character training time per plex, especially since it's more restricting than having two accounts (only one can be active at a time, of course), but ultimately you'd be 'paying' the same amount. i imagine the amount of time it affords would have to be fine-tuned for said balance, against both dual-boxing subscriptions and maybe even character transfers.but, suffice to say, i prefer to use one account and essentially 'pay' (this would only be appealing to those who can afford plex in isk, since dual-boxing would probably be more cost-effective with real money) for a second to allow parallel character development.also, in-lore/-universe, for those who are rp-concerned, it would be as if the other character was 'renewing' his pilot's license.what say my fellow capsuleers? sensible? already suggested and trounced?edit:(pulled from one of my later posts) i personally like the idea of training a secondary character on the same account for not necessarily all the time- just often enough to get a few useful skills for a secondary character, but still being able to use it even if i haven't given him extra training time, which i couldn't do with a proper alt account. admittedly, it has selective use, but it could be a useful feature to ease someone into wanting to use a proper alt, or it could result in people consolidating accounts if they have a vastly large number that they just can't reasonably multibox....besides, i can't imagine this taking that much work to implement... but maybe it's just that hard-wired into the account system?(i also reworded the part talking about the amount of time dual-training - suffice to say, the system would need to be balanced in such a way as to be considered useful even when compared to multi-boxing, as i also stated in the original post, and have now added emphasis to)"
7/5/2011,"i think it's a great idea alejan. clearly, as you say, the cost to training benefit ratio would have to be worked out. if the cost were the same as running a second account then one might as well run that second account and then have the benefit of accessing that character in a dual box situation. however, if the cost were less than running a second account then you would essentially be achieving accelerated training per isk for the alt characters over a normal subscription cost. so logically there would have to be a penalty applied to make it only worthwhile for those seriously wanting to drag their alt characters up.perhaps ccp could create a 'place' for alts to train, (like a mobile laboratory but for brain cramming). then they could sell another piece of equipment plus the cost of entering said crammer.or perhaps, keeping it simpler, a plex for a fixed period (20 days maybe), but you can't access your alt during that 20 day period.but i think the concept is a great idea.(edit after having read the later posts than my original ...)i totally agree with the practice of getting multiple accounts running to enable the training of your alts concurrently. if i were to be starting the game from scratch with that information i would probably consider it ... although if i were starting from scratch being new to eve then i'd probably not see the benefit of the multiple characters at that point in time anyway. (i can't imagine too many new players opting to buy three accounts straight up when there are three character slots to fill in the first account).being one of those 'new to eve' players once, i fell into the trap of populating all three character slots on my shiny new account, then found the shortcoming of only being able to train one at a time, so within a few weeks opened a second account to be able to train two at once. now though, with the original 'sub' alts sitting there on my original account, with their meagre skillsets it would be good to drag them up too.for others like me who jumped in feet first creating characters without letting some eve experience sink in (idiots maybe, but not alone i would think), the idea raised in this thread by alejan, of perhaps paying some fee to enable multi training seems like a good idea.but with the commonsense comments made by others, (and being against the 'pay for skills' ideas being floated in other places, which conflict with this suggestion), i will seriously consider buying another account and transferring one of my 'subs' over so they can train up 'legitimately'. interesting debate. once the money is spent, on a 'legitimate' account, or a ccp invention to enable multi-training one account, the bottom line is reached. we pay to train. i personally don't have the mental capacity to multi box more than two characters so there'd be no other benefit (for me) to a third account other than paying for extra training.mh"
7/5/2011,"i don't get the point. you can already use plex to fund an alt, and why wouldn't you want that alt to be able to login at the same time, even if you don't use it for multi-boxing yet? but even if the alt is never ever used for multi-boxing (e.g. a research agent alt), it's still simple to logout and login to another account, and to fund that other account with plex earned from any other account.so yeah - i'm failing see any reason why ccp should spend time adding functionality that duplicates existing functionality, only in a more limited form."
7/5/2011,"as unlikely as this may seem, i'd have to agree with toovhon on this.if you are willing to spend plex for sp then you may as well do it on a second account and participate in the lively discussion over in this thread: it's time for ccp to sell skillpoints for rl cash!"
7/5/2011,the thread where humpink continually asserts he wants to buy his way past having to play the game to achieve anything. no playing games for him! he demands easy mode :-d
7/5/2011,"its a good idea, but as others have said. you can do this by starting a second account. as an added benefit of starting a second account rather than training a second character on the same account, if you use the buddy system to start the second account you actually get 20 days free game time from the buddy trial on the new account plus a free month on the account that offered the buddy invite. if you use the option to convert existing game time to plex than use that plex to activate the second account getting a free month on the first account you basically get 1 month 20 days for free on the new account before you need to start paying for it.you can always pay the 10 bucks later to get that new character transferred to your main account after they are trained. after all the training didn't cost you anything, so 10 bucks to add a character with almost 2 months skill points, enough for a cyno or research alt, to your main account is far cheaper than what you are purposing. buying two plex to train two months on a second character would cost about $40. this almost sounds like a exploit but as far as i know it is legal. it only uses intended game mechanics."
7/5/2011,"i support this, although would like to see some more respec-like solution with some kind of sp reimbursement (even if with huge penalty).anyway, some type of skills deletion is must in this game. no point in punishing ppl for their 'newby' mistakes of past."
7/5/2011,there could be permanent ecm bursts from gate whenever someone aggro
7/5/2011,"gate guns be able to warp anywhere to hunt you down in high, low, 0.0 or whs, then proceed to hunt down everyone else in your corp, anyone you've ever private chatted with, and then the gate gun should use advanced language ai to hire a rl hitman to take out your mom.only then will you be able to traverse lowsec without thinking and keeping your eyes open."
7/5/2011,"low sec is where pirates still get a sec penalty for aggro. there is a place for it. but until drug trade starts up, the part it plays is muted. sov should not be transferrable in lowsec. it is owned by empire or pirate factions after all, its not and shouldn't be player claimable space."
7/5/2011,cyno's?
7/5/2011,"do what you like to gate guns, we'll still see you in rancer."
7/5/2011,"ohh, thats a good idea, you should send that idea into ccp"
7/5/2011,what about them?
7/5/2011,so... you want low sec to be high sec on gates and at stations? i don't see any benefit from this. i see this as carebear land extending without any consequences for lazy carebearing.
7/5/2011,"i like the idea, but we need to keep in mind that low sec is owned by empires but is contested. this means the owning empire does not have full control.i like the idea of boosting gate guns, but do not link it to security status like in high sec. there is no concord in low sec and never should be. it is low sec. but it would be cool if the navy of the occupying empire did police low sec. not uber powerful, invulnerable ships like concord has, but just normal ships comparable to what players fly. if you get attacked at a gate, or station, in low sec and have a high enough faction standing with the occupying empire, they will come to your aid.with the current mechanics, low sec is far more dangerous than null sec, and that does not seem right to me. in player owned space there is no concord but the player corps and alliances that control the space do there own policing. making some null sec area's very safe if you have good standing with the players controlling it. low sec should be the same, but policed by the empires navy. this would not only add some security to carebears and other players just passing through, but could also add a huge amount of depth to the game. this can be done by putting a lot of faction npc ships into low sec. these ships would represent the navy of that faction that is there fighting to control the system. if there is no empire fighting for control how can it be contested space? these ships can then be farmed for tags, and to increase your faction with that empires enemies. at the same time they will come to the aid of players that have high standing with that faction. if you think about it, does it not make sense to see empire ships in low sec? this is supposed to be a contested area, so this should be where two factions are fighting each other for control. this is where the wars between the empires is supposed to be happening. a huge potential here for missions and players participating in said wars. if this was done it would make low sec safer for those that have good standing with the controlling faction. not near as safe as high sec. but safer than null sec. as i understand low sec should be. the faction ships would give pirates something to shoot while waiting for their next victim. yes it would put an end to low sec gate camps, but as some one else already said, these camps could just be moved to somewhere along a gate to gate warp path and set up a camp with a interdictor there. you can pull them right out of the warp tunnel and into a trap. this would be a risk for the pirates if they trapped someone with high standing to the controlling empire, the empire navy will warp in to assist, just like concord in high sec. however the local navy will not be near as effective as concord, just normal ships. the pirates will just have a few extra ships to kill. add to this a chance of faction loot dropping and the pirates should be happy with it. maybe even make it so the number and size of ships that come to help scales with faction standings. it would be cool on both sides for someone with +9 faction to get ganked and have a dread or officer class ship with escort warp in to help. gives a good defense to the player with the high standing, maybe they can get away while the help keeps the pirates occupied. the pirates still get the benefit of popping the faction ships if there intended prey get away. and a huge bonus to the pirates if they kill the player and the faction ships and get officer loot from the elite navy or dread ships. i think this could really bring some life and activity to low sec. for all sides involved."
7/5/2011,"i support the idea of significantly tougher fire support in low sec.a bs, bc, hac, caps will pretty much laugh off the those guns. i pirate sometimes in low sec at gates but they are really nothing to worry about for even a semi-serious pirate.gate / station security needs a serious boost in damage, about 500% more and should be able to attack 3-4 ships simultaneously."
7/5/2011,how about gate dmg depending on sec status?-10 pirates get instant death +5 chars get the dmg nowadayseveryone happy except for the regular low-sec campers.
7/5/2011,"i would like to know why there is no difference in the price of the cost/month in euro or us dollars.currently 1.00 = 1.44210usd which means that when europeans pay for let's say 1 month they pay 14.95 while americans pay for that same month 14.95usd = 10.3665now for 1 month this only bothers me a little cause this means that americans pay 4.5835 less, but if you look at this on a 1 year basis that comes down to a difference of 55.002.now i don't know about other people but i'd like to spend that 55.002 on something other than discrimination.i hope this gets looked at because it is outrageous and insulting."
7/5/2011,"also, canadians forced to pay more than americans to play eve online.u.s currency is so weak right now it's not much of an issue"
7/5/2011,buy gtcs for usd and use those
7/5/2011,its called controlling your game. better known as america f yea!
7/5/2011,"the only one problem is, in a situation where one system is lagged due to a huge battle, those in the battle can call for reinforcements who might be able to play at normal speed until they join the battle, giving them a timing advantage they would not have otherwise.but then again, weighing this con against an unplayable game makes it a worthwhile alternative. the metagaming ability to slow down a battle to ensure reinforcements is a worthwhile tradeoff, plus it might encourage even bigger, more epic battles. and they will be playable!"
7/5/2011,supported.
7/5/2011,then give a thumbs up please.
7/5/2011,idea approved. will be in next patch.
7/5/2011,"at the moment the corp finder doesn't let you filter by ""rp"", which i believe you could do before (i might be wrong, though). having that filter would make it a lot more useful, at least for me, since finding the few corps that have rp among all the others from picking one of the other filters takes a lot of time and effort. as is, the corp finder isn't useful for anyone wanting a roleplay corporation.not sure if there are other filters people feel like should be there, but i'm pretty sure that the more specific you can be, the better the finder becomes."
7/5/2011,"its a good idea, but as others have said. you can do this by starting a second account. as an added benefit of starting a second account rather than training a second character on the same account, if you use the buddy system to start the second account you actually get 20 days free game time from the buddy trial on the new account plus a free month on the account that offered the buddy invite. if you use the option to convert existing game time to plex than use that plex to activate the second account getting a free month on the first account you basically get 1 month 20 days for free on the new account before you need to start paying for it. this almost sounds like a exploit but as far as i know it is legal."
7/5/2011,reply to topicthat would be a better subject line imo.
7/5/2011,"incarna is a tremendous step backwards in giving the game more functionality. the entire content release has been about making things look pretty. when i first learned of the option to disable the station environment i was overjoyed. every single person i've told about this felt the same way. the station environment adds no functionality to the game, and in fact detracts from the functionality of the existing game (extra load time).so my plea to the csm and ccp, is to realize that us players, us loyal customers, play this game not because we can see flashy ****, but because we can build, we can kill, and we can conquer. you're trying to make eve like other games ccp, but that won't be good for you; you don't have a subscriber base because you beat other mmos at what they do best, you have a subscriber base because you do something completely different from those mmos. say no to peer pressure."
7/5/2011,posting in a troll thread yo!
7/5/2011,"exactly, i dont see how its so integral to be made to walk around, if i was a capsuleer, i would just sit in my pod and take a nap in-between runs, i would personally feel no need to get out, and if they think ship spinning is bad because it breaks immersion, cant we just say the capsuleer is using the station security cameras to monitor their own ship? taht would make sense to me."
7/5/2011,"it's not an integral part of the game, it's an integral part of making more money. if you can see your avatar, you become more emotionally attached to it, making you more likely to spend money on it. that's why they released the cq along with the store. people won't spend money on monacles they can't see."
7/5/2011,"honestly, the whole idea that we elect csms that are then subject to a complete media blackout due to a non-disclosure agreement is ridiculous.release the videos. release the minutes. in the video where something is discussed that can't be revealed to the general public, black it out with no sound or tell us how many minutes of the video are missing. let us see our csms in action. let the players see and hear they are fighting for their electors or be revealed if they are not. not letting us see actual discussion has lead most players to believe our csms are straw men.ccp could have two people dedicate a day each to watching the videos and editing them like this as well as check for nda issues. for the cost of a couple monacles this could be done. ccp has delayed this way too long. we don't want sound bites. we don't want colorful, media-friendly quotes. we don't want minutes so edited and sterilized they bear no resemblance to the meeting they are from. we. want. to. know. wtf. is. going. on.now.2 subscriptions cancelled until the last 2 meetings are posted in full."
7/5/2011,edited minutes of meeting. your almost as bad as ccp at politics.
7/5/2011,"i too make the request for all minutes and recordings to be made available to the public, with no edits.ccp shouldn't have to approve the minutes to be released. the csms are our elected representatives. political meetings behind closed doors = voters getting screwed."

7/6/2011,"+1 deftcrow, you're spot-on with this statement!it's such a simple thing really, for three reasons:1. players that want to experience wis can and generally won't be the impatient type, whereas players that don't want to aren't forced to, just like wormhol"
7/6/2011,"agreed, i've always found attribute implants to be nearly as silly and irritating as learning skills were, no matter what clone you're in you feel like you're getting screwed because of your choice."
7/6/2011,"i was illustrating a point, but sure, if the use of snakes or other more expensive implants pleases you, then feel free to substitute.so in a long winded way then, you will agree with me that this change will flatten the rich/poor divide.that is game balance altering, and although not all game balance altering changes are a bad thing. they need to be well thought out in a pro/con basis. i see nobody on this forum considering the cons.let me throw one out just off the top of my head.... do this... then what happens to all the storyline missions which give out juicy implants? you gimp them to give out temp boosters instead? booster blueprints? not exactly the same...what about everyone who currently have implants? do they instantly disappear? do people get 'paid back' for them? if yes, then at what price? what about the people who in the game who are training for super caps and are happy to just leave their character dormant and training for 3 months? are you not rudely imposing upon their freedom to do that? now they must log in every 2 weeks to ""freshen up"" their booster? i support this discussion going on, but i encourage more people to think about the unforeseen/negative consequences, instead of just basking in the glow of the positives."
7/6/2011,"if there's an option to use boosters that last a whole month (think of people on vacation, but leaving their character training?), i might stand by this. but also a daily solution would be invaluable for null-sec pilots... they would just have to keep a stockpile.ultimately, though, i think i like the idea of having both in place, and making it so the boosters are incompatible with the implants that give the same bonuses, to counteract the 'boosters and implants' advantage some posters have expressed concern about - if it is deemed necessary, at least. or just have a maximum attribute boost hard-coded in, so that someone using +4s, for instance, could maybe take +1 boosters only.i still support the classic implants because they're a solid investment- you pay the premiums, you get consistent, no-maintenance training boost. but i also wholeheartedly agree on an alternative, especially if it makes good use of an underutilized market."
7/6/2011,"considering that skills train based on the attributes that existed when they started training, this is a nonissue really.even if the booster expired once you started the skill, the entire train time for that skill would still evidence the boosted effect."
7/6/2011,"ah, that helps. so that means when remapping, your current skill won't be slowed down if you are remapping away from its primary or secondary? if so, this greatly simplifies my issues around remapping time.i still think attribute implants can stay in for those willing to risk it for the convenience of not having to keep using the boosters... but, as i said, they either shouldn't be able to use boosters, or only gain up to the current maximum bonus."
7/6/2011,"well, i haven't personally tested it, but i think remapping forces your skill to stop progressing. you also have to stop your skill progress to add implants. but jump cloning out of your +5s while carrier 5 is ticking down for the next 3 weeks, will not result in an increase of training time."

7/6/2011,"apart from raising this from the dros of cq and the leaked emailanything to balance the playing field and make invention worthwhile in a lot of fields would be a step forward.rather than carrying pe/me forward from t1 wouldn't it be more logical to allow me/pe research on t2 bpc's derived from a successful invention, but limit the increase to say 6 steps.this means that a -6 me/pe bpc could be raised to me0/pe0 and a me-3/pe-1 could be raised to me3/pe5.this wouldn't affect those with t2 bpos as they can research them as much as they like.it would also mean that people inventing t2 industrials could build them and compete in the market place as opposed to not botheing as those with t2 bpos just set their price to the max the market is prepared to pay and reap 300% profit."
7/6/2011,t2 bpo's need to be removed or an in game way of getting one needs to be added. this will at least be a bandaid.
7/6/2011,"i support the legalization of market bots.it would allow the trader to get rid off purely mechanical tasks and instead focus on actual strategies.it would create a new and intellectually highly challenging minigame around algo trading.it would probably improve the over-all efficiency of the market and help to bring down buy/ask spreads.(before you contest the last point with rl examples consider that we are trading in commodities, that there is very few information to process on your average trading day in eve and that we already have time limits on updating orders;if some price changes rapidly the bot author would almost always be right in the assumption that it will return near the old equilibrium soon:there is little information that could justify a rapid price change, the occurrence of events that could generate this information is extremely rare (patch notes, sisi changes, ...), a large part of the market is driven by consumption which should stabilize things considerably and we don't have institutional investors who are forced by policy to cut losses at arbitrary points.i don't see any real danger of having a ""flash crash"" in eve on anything but the most obscure items.)"
7/6/2011,"exactly my views as well. that last point i would go as far to say ""definitively"" bring down bid/ask spreads and make a more efficient market for buyers.i play eve just to trade, the fact that its one of the only virtual markets in existence is a unique thing. we should leverage this. on a similar but slightly parallel vein, i would love to see a commodities futures exchange open up in eve. with pi and manufacturing putting real economic risk on producers wrt spot prices, futures contracts would be popular. i seem to have forgotten to support my own thread. fixed."
7/6/2011,"this would give to much advantage to traders with many skills and isk to invest, effectively maing the rich much richer (for a whole lot less effort) and blocking out new players from the market.its a very bad idea but i can understand why it would be appealing for some."
7/6/2011,"this seems like a really silly idea..first of i have approx 250 orders out at occasion i have maxed out my orders. even if i haven't had the opportunity to update all of them at 5 min intervals. i can say that most of them was set up with a profit margin for me.with a bot i wouldent have to choose what order i want to really compete in and i would be just as effective across all of my goods. hence i and a few others would cut the profit margin to a minimum and effectively closing the market for others to operate in. as it is now i cant control all of my orders and some can come in between and make a profit. thats why we have the market pvp.if i had a bot doing most of the dirty work for me i would probably accept margins so low as 1 - 0.5%. how many new traders with a few hundreds million isk would think it would be reasonable to invests their earnings for such a low roi?alot of the playerbase would be cut of from the market. sure the mission runners might be able to buy their goods at optimal price levels, but is that really why we want to trade?i have several accounts, i can assure you i would have market bots on everyone of them, being able to update 1000+ orders would be to good to be part of actual gameplay. all i had to do was log on and stay online while i am at work or sleeping, that would be the least of my problems. we can discuss advantages given to player in different tz as being able to log in after dt and start your bots would be a huge advantage.don't think for a second that i would be the only one operating like this. to bad for those of you who dont have the isk reserves to be able to hold on to goods for several billions, but are dependent on selling stock as fast as you get it more or less :-)"
7/6/2011,"i'm with this guy.if everyone were allowed to use market bots, then eventually everyone would use market bots. result would be all buy and sell prices converging and new/small time traders would have no chance at all. it would be a buyers market.what i could possibly accept is a hybrid solution with a built in function in the client where you get 1 automatic update per 24 or 48 hours to ""keep you in the price range"". if you want to compete more aggressively than that you'd have to update your orders manually.(also the automatic update should not renew the order timeout time, so after 3 months on automatic, without any manual intervention, it should be removed from the market)edit: come to think of it, the automatic update should probably cost money to use. the longer you use it and the more costly the order, it gets exponentially more expensive. so running on automatic for a week perhaps would be reasonably worth it, but if you let it run for 3 months it would be extremely expensive.or, allow fully automatic updates, but with a much higher broker cost when it changes the price.all of this of course means the mechanic must be added to the client.tl;dr: automatic updates of orders are allowed, but much more costly than manual updates.the longer you have an automatic order, and the higher update frequency it has the more expensive it gets."

7/6/2011,"indeed. the most useful experience of my first month in eve was being taken under my first ceo's wing and given some guidance on how to handle myself in a fleet, and common firefights, so i didn't !@#$ up too badly once real ops began.and as baaldor says - give a noob a tackling frigate, some decent instruction, and they've all the potential to be the hero of an encounter. young players in cheap ships can and do make a difference :-)"
7/6/2011,"i've never understood this argument. perhaps you don't realize it but it implies that eve isn't hard at all. it just takes a long time. just because something takes a long time doesn't make it hard.this is a point i've seen people argue in every mmo i've played. in this case its quite amusing because to consider training sp in this game to be ""hard"" is laughable."
7/6/2011,"i have been keeping an eye on this thread and it's amusing to see how various folks are trying to insult the op and he just doesn't take the bait and instead sticks to his message. for a forum warrior that's pretty unusual as they tend to be easy to set off. loli have been playing the game since the day the first retail copy made it onto the store shelves. i am currently down to four accounts with the lowest character at 71mil and the highest at 119mil. i would appreciate being able to buy sp because while i don't need a titan pilot i could use a few more jf alts and a few skilled covert cyno alts. i would probably buy a couple more trade alts as well. i don't have enough room on my existing accounts so i would likely pay for 2 more accounts to hold those characters. yes, i can buy characters on the bazaar, and i have already done that on numerous occasions. my issue with the bazaar is that i don't want to pay for skills i don't need. call me frugal. it's not that i can't afford the asking price, it's that it just rubs me the wrong way to pay a couple bil extra for something i will never ever use. i can't stand that.the injection argument is valid. selling limitless sp would break the game for sure, but i don't see how limited controlled sp sales would break the game. the eve economy has already shown that it can survive controlled injection just fine. invention is that controlled injection and it didn't break the game. all invention did is lower my profits and i was sore about that but i dealt with it. i can see how some people will be sore that others just buy sp, but just the same they will deal with their emotional issues and move on. the game will be fine."
7/6/2011,"good job ignoring how mmos work with progression and keeping players interested and inspired to play by slowly unlocking new content and kit. don't worry - nobody noticed you skipping over this. i promise. giant flaw in your argument: unnoticed. totally.also - if waiting isn't hard, why can't you?"
7/6/2011,"yes, i was also impressed how the op totally rejected all sense time after time. way to go op! you're a winner (only not in logic and reason it seems...).then why don't you undersand how mmos work after all these years? hint: it has to do with keeping players interested.your case where apparently you have to keep buying character after character and gosh darn it, isn't that a hassle, is a bit out of the ordinary, to say the least. i'm not sure what you're doing, but perhaps you're in the wrong corp (or game *gestures at sp games over there*) if you're having to do everything yourself."
7/6/2011,"i really do understand how mmos work. i just think that eve is totally unlike other mmos. for example, in wow once you hit the level cap there is nothing else to do. you are limited to raiding the same zone over and over to eventually receive marginally better gear. in eve reaching the skillpoint cap does not result in the same outcome. the way i see it is that in eve the relationship is inverse to that in wow. in wow the higher your level is the less content is available to you because you cannot go back and have a meaningful low level experience. in eve you can easily fly that rifter even if you have 600mil sp. wow -> more skillpoints = fewer options. eve -> more skillpoints = more options.there is no harm in having high sp. i believe that people will be more likely to play the game and stick with the game if more content is available to them earlier.i agree that my case is not the norm.i want to be self-sufficient and i want to keep making that isk. to me eve isn't as much about pvp as it is to see really big isk numbers. it's about making profit where everyone else said that it can't be done or that it is too complicated. it's about being able to just pay for an outpost when my corp is considering to build one but is unsure how to pay for it or being able to reliably run the alliance ship replacement program or any other number of logistics tasks that need to be done. i make a lot of isk and i also spend a lot of it on things that don't necessarily benefit me personally. being able to do that is what eve is about to me it is were i get my kicks and fun.i could easily get help hauling or with cynos or even with trades, but i don't want that help, i want to put in the effort and do it myself. i never had anything handed to me in game. i paid for my t2 bpos instead of winning them and i never bought a plex for rl cash. i know how to make isk and if sp sales would come through i would buy plex with isk and apply those to get aur to buy sp.the reason i posted here is to point out that there are people other than ""spoiled brats with daddy's credit card"" who would have reasons to buy sp for cash if that option were to exist."
7/6/2011,"then you've not been reading very carefully, or you are reading selectively, and you vote for the proposal, so we can draw our own conclusions."
7/6/2011,"it would still be an unfair advantage between the have and have nots. think of that poor bastard that can barely pay for condoms.but yeah, it is unbalanced, it directly affects the game, it becomes a race to see who can get something faster better etc etc. and you still have no fcking clue how to play the game.most peeps who buy characters to avoid the progression of the game, don't know **** about how to play the game, and then later rage quit because they get pwned by someone with half the sp, but twice the game experience."
7/6/2011,"you say you know how mmos work, but then you go right ahead and suggest giving players access to anything right off the bat is fine. so i don't think you really do know how mmos work.if you really think there's such limited content in eve for new players, then i have to say i think we're playing two vastly different games. as a new player i could have done something different every day of the week. i didn't need high level skills for that."
7/6/2011,"the only reason i as a player tolerate plex sales is because in the end i am able to pay for my game with isk. introducing a new sp faucet, subject to some fortunate individuals' income (which i don't care how they obtained, or how much time they spent obtaining), letting them rapidly build super characters in a spaceship game where i and many of my fellow pilots feel ""spaceship skill"" and long-term decisions should be key elements in building your ingame persona, would ruin something important in the rules of the game for us. many have spent 6, 7, 8+ years meticulously plotting their training paths, adapting to changes and events. what you have or are willing to do irl is irrelevant to me.i would rather see plex and character sales removed, than direct sp purchasing introduced. i would even like to see new proposals for sp accumulation that might solve the lack of interesting or useful stuff for vets to train. and most importantly, i would rather stick to the status-quo than move in your direction.i fully support giving nubs more sp to start though; it used to be 100k, then it was 900k to help noobs catch up, and now it's 50k, which is complete bull."

7/6/2011,"exactly what i said. lack of regulatory body. a real scc. lack of any form of fiscal prudency, money transfers are 'free' and unrestricted.bonds are a good point. there is no bond market in eve (read 'in'), same problem. it's risky, but at least a bond has a coupon, and 'some' form of rating (though not in game). if bonds, which are less risky than equity cannot manage to get traded in the game, then equity cannot. oh, they can do this simple enough i think, but this will be what will happen:1) stocks all go into the market... the prices explode upwards2) prices crash and new companies join continuously3) people who are screwed by the corporate manipulation of share prices give up4) stock exchange becomes a dead unused feature, no better than a gambling game called 'tossing a coin'"
7/6/2011,"those are certainly risks and could happen, could happen no matter what safe guards are put in place. the more data, and relevant data exposed, the more informed a choice can be. as with most scams in eve, there is always some little detail that doesn't add up. i suspect you're right, many stocks would just be scams. the exchange would have a rough start. i'm also of the opinion that, over time well behaved equities would stand out. eve would get its own collection of blue chips.btw, here is the bond discussion i was 'hosting'"
7/6/2011,"there is a stock market, y kno"
7/6/2011,"thanks for the link. a good read.one thing that is the problem though is that in real life, think about what equity means. it means that you have a share of the company. what is the fundamental worth of this share? sure you can use 'indicators' like eps ebitda etc... but these are just markers, indicators. what is the fundamental worth of a share of stock?1) the dividend income stream the company chooses to issue2) the worth of the share when the company is bought out by another. (mergers and acquisitions)#1 we have in eve#2 we don't there is no mechanic by which a company can have wholly owned subsidiaries, and have those sub companies balance sheets all roll back up into a parent company. also, why do companies acquire others in the real world in the first place? they want to take their assets. their systems, their people.in eve assets and people move freely, and without cost. companies have no assets which are not instantly transferable, like official bond ownerships, debt, computers... perhaps the only thing would be poss and outposts, and office rental contracts.of course, the biggest elephant in the room is in the real world, if your company is going to be taken over, you would think twice about stealing company assets and making off with them in the chaos. you would be found out and thrown in jail. eve has no working judicial system, so people would just tear a corps assets away and run for the hills if they were going to be taken over.thus, take overs would not be done.therefore the price of shares will have no fundamental worth, besides dividends payout.shaky, but i suppose it may work, but it will be no more trustworthy than the current off market bonds that are sold."
7/6/2011,"all good points, and i am sure there are many other unknowns as well. reasonably ccp isn't going to code all that, and if they did, with all due respect, something about it would be less than ideal. so if it is a simpler system to start, let players figure out how to use it and abuse it, then fix or enhance those things.if it is a second class of shares as well, then ccp doesn't have to potentially break the existing system either."

7/6/2011,"actually, it is somewhat different... i personally like the idea of training a secondary character on the same account for not necessarily all the time- just often enough to get a few useful skills for a secondary character, but still being able to use it even if i haven't given him extra training time, which i couldn't do with a proper alt account. admittedly, it has selective use, but it could be a useful feature to ease someone into wanting to use a proper alt, or it could result in people consolidating accounts if they have a vastly large number that they just can't reasonably multibox.as for the 'buy sp' ... i still argue against this method, personally. but i'll leave that to those who know the reasons not to implement it better and can make their case better. suffice to say, don't troll my idea with yours.edit: besides, i can't imagine this taking that much work to implement... but maybe it's just that hard-wired into the account system?"
7/6/2011,"curious... i could have sworn you don't get the plex reward for the 'buddy' unless the 'buddy' converts the account from a trial into a paid account. so you'd need another plex beforehand anyway, essentially paying $20 right away for this endeavour, and then the transfer fee... which isn't it $20, itself? so it's ultimately not more cost-effective, from what i see. unless they changed the transfer cost down to $10 since last i checked?edit: yep... it's $20. though i suppose you do still get the free plex to apply to the alt character. or you can just get multiple free plexes for inviting friends and getting them to pay (or helping them get a plex of their own), and apply the plex gift to a same-account alt using the proposed mechanic.admittedly, this is partly because i have an alt already generated- i like his bloodline, name, etc... and would rather not have to re-generate him on a new account (i've had him so long, he's actually gotten a decent amount of reimbursed sp from the learning skills removal, since he started with decent learning skills, with how early i generated him), nor do i want to stop training my main just to make him more useful. he may even have more than enough sp by default to counteract the benefit of a brand-new character with 20 days... but i suppose that's rather unlikely."
7/6/2011,thanks for the vote of confidence in text. mind editing or re-posting and checking the 'support this topic' checkbox so it's more than just in-text? it's under the 'preview' checkbox and above the character drop-down.nobody else willing to add their input to this? any of the people i've responded to in the thread-proper want to give further feedback?
7/6/2011,"you are correct,you don't get the plex until the account is activated. but you can convert existing game time on an account into a plex. you do not need to buy one. i pay in 3 month increments so this works for me. even if you spent $20 to buy a plex for this you would still get 1 month 20 days training time rather than just one month, so it is still worth it.and that plex you bought will add a month game time to your main account when used to activate the buddy account. so really $15 of that $20 you would have been spending next month anyway. my bad the character transfer is 20 bucks i though it was $10.here are the steps;1-on my main account i will convert game time already paid for, into a plex.(i'm sure i saw this option in a conversion menu available in the in game options menu.(esc key))2-i then send a buddy invite from my main account to myself via e-mail.3-i accept the buddy invite and start another account with it that gets 20 day trial.4-i then transfer the converted plex to the trial account.5- i use the plex to activate the trial account making it a paid account.6- i receive 1 month free game time from the buddy system on my main account basically restoring the game time i used to generate the plex.when activating a trial account the paid game time is added to the remaining days in the trial but the account is instantly changed from a trial to an active account without losing the 20 day trial time. so you basically get a free active account for 1 month 20 days. this is enough time to train a cyno alt, or researcher. if you transfer enough isk to the new character to buy a full set of implants and use you remap wisely you can almost get a character into a hulk, or train a great marketing alt in that time. then on the last day of that account pay the 20 bucks to transfer that character to an account you actively pay for. or if you want, after having the extra account for almost 2 months you may want to keep it and just start paying for it. i have 3 active accounts, but may use this to get a few mil skill points on the alts on my main account without losing training time on my main.the op's idea is still a good idea i think. it is far less hassle then my way. i think a lot of players would use it. my way just gets an extra 20 days training and a temporary additional account that can be muti-boxed. you have to activate the account right away though. you can not mutibox a trial with an active account. i have tried it does not work."
7/6/2011,do you somehow imagine repeatedly bumping your own thread somehow makes your pointless idea better?
7/6/2011,"i got it. you were part of eve uni, you got one of every skill book under 1 mil isk (they have some free skillbook policy) because you are an ex wow player and like to 'take it to the max'. you injected all the books and now have a character with every possible skill attainable for level 1. you realized after you started playing eve, that this was a little premature, as you realized that having a skill for say, mining lasers is not going to make you any better at your now chosen profession, and you want to clean up all the extended skill paths in your character sheet, and the silly certificates that clutter up your bio, as you are a rper.was i close?:)"
7/6/2011,"this is a very good suggestion, and well thought out. and as a bonus it fits into the storyline and makes sense.though i still like the idea of gate guns working on sec status like highsec. just because concord isn't here, doesn't mean that a global 'criminal' label need to be ignored by the local navy faction. i mean, its a global rating given by the global police, it means something. and, as i already mentioned, this sec status will be altered dependant on your standing with the local faction, so that angle is factored in. (a global criminal who is friends with amarr, will not be shot at by gate guns in amarr lowsec)is just a little extra drop in the bucket from your (good) suggestion of having faction navies patrol. and as gate guns aren't that powerful as they are, its not a big deal to add this."
7/6/2011,so long as outlaws get dmg boosts against +5 characters to compensate.
7/6/2011,"no to wtfpwn gate guns. low sec already sucks beyond belief (among other reasons) because it severely restrict the type of ship you can use in sight of gate / station guns: let's not forget that, unless traditional ship guns, these sentry guns have perfect tracking and deal full damage even to small drones or a quick moving frigate.make them even more powerful, and the only ships pirates will be able to use will be super-buffered bs and capitals. stupid idea."
7/6/2011,"bs used to be the only viable ship choice for anything other than a quick gank on gates/stations. then we had the blanket ehp buff, logistics revamp followed by rigs, and suddenly you can sit in cruisers/hacs+ almost indefinitely with 1-2 logis present.not only does it make camps a lot more effective as locks are faster, but they are cheap as hell to establish and hard as hell to kill because the sub-bs hulls can run that much faster than the fat bs.otherwise you are correct, they do indeed have infini-tracking and omni-damage"

7/6/2011,"hello, ladies and gentlemen of the stellar council chambers! i do not currently and have never frequented this place, though i found myself talking to some alliance-mates about a somewhat bothersome issue, an issue which has bothered me for some amount of time, but for which i never thought to bring up here. now i am here, though, and hopefully this proposal finds some support!the local chat tab is a very handy tool. not only is it handy for allowing you to chat with the locals, but even more importantly it allows you to see who is present in your current solar system. this is especially important if you're involved in a declaration of war, are the recipient of a war declaration, or just happen to be roaming around in low/null security space. i imagine that pilots of null security alliances might also be able to relate, once i explain the issue.as it stands, you can only see who is in your local area by having the local chat open. unfortunately there is a minimum width of the local chat, which is rather wide if you are one using it as an observational tool and not as a means of communication. if you want to have the maximum viewing capacity of local persons at once, you also have to make it fairly tall. this is very nice and almost completely necessary if you happen to be in systems of over hundreds of pilots. unfortunately, having a very tall local tab, with the restraints of the minimum width, tend to create a giant block that clutters your interface.this is how i organize my interface currently. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i was thinking of ways to get around this issue, and came up with another layout. while it takes less space and gives more viewing capacity, it has the limitation of being unable to grab the slider bar to scroll up and down the list quickly, meaning you have to click a portrait and then use your mousewheel to slide up and down and view everybody in local. an added bonus is the inability to be baited into smacktalk!please visit your user settings to re-enable images.what i propose is something to make this very painless and simple. i photoshopped (more like microsoft painted) this image to demonstrate what i am proposing. although i expect the finished product would look a little better, it should at least get the idea across.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.my proposal: allow an option to completely remove the chat from local chat tab. only display portraits with their standing icons and have a slider bar which allows the player to scroll up and down swiftly. in this way, people can ignore local chat while still viewing pilots in their system, thus minimizing the amount of space used on the interface!"
7/6/2011,"pretty straightforward, thanks to the crappy font, it is sometimes quite hard to say if some system name has an o (letter) or 0 (number), make numbers show in green or red or something like that in overview. and make it optional.(of course with custom fonts that would not be an issue but let's not go there.)"
7/6/2011,great idea m8!
7/6/2011,"or change font so o and 0 actually look different enough. i like the ""old"" style zeros which had that line in middle to tell the difference.just supporting because this needs fixing."
7/6/2011,"simply put, the font is terrible. i've had a bit of education on typefaces, and it may look 'cool', but it ultimately has poor usability as a typeface.what is the name of this accursed font, anyway? i think futura would be a better choice, or one of the gothic sans.i can read it, most of the time, but i must admit it probably took my brain a bit to work out how to differentiate. a better font would probably save me the trouble of correcting fellow corpmates.how about this one: zekton free 3.000 - the 0s are just a bit thinner than the os, as is proper with a font, and the 1 is clearly distinguishable from the l and i. the l and i are the only trouble-spots, from what i can tell.the most important aspect in a font for readability is telling these pairs of characters apart: 0o 5s 2z li 8bthat site seems like a good repository- this thread's got me scanning through it for good 'techno/futuristic' fonts that actually have such readability- however, a good number of them don't even distinguish between capitals and lower-case."
7/6/2011,"well they certainly don't want to charge europeans less, and are too afraid to charge anyone else more to equalize the costs (and probably rightfully so)... so you're most likely stuck with it. on the other hand if you find it to be of great concern you can probally work a small bit of money magic and pay with usd instead, thus paying the lower rate, but i'd venture the guess that'd probably be too much bother."
7/6/2011,"when the subscription rates were set the american currency was still worth something. that changed, the subscription price didnt."
7/6/2011,europeans earn more too.in terms of ratio it's the same isn't it?
7/6/2011,"short answer?ccp is a game developer, not a currency market speculator. they do not care to re-adjust the prices every time there is a shift in exchange rates.itunes store does the same, as do most electronics global companies. hey, you say, what about mcdonald's! they adjust their prices to suit the local economy!!! they also have most of the cost of running the shop paid in the local currency, and that's the diff."
7/6/2011,"exactly! op is missing the point that the extra...what 55eur, is not money that he can cash in. any more than he can 'cash in' the fact that he should be getting more salary now because eur/usd rate has moved. you can only cash in the difference caused by exchange rates by either playing in the xccy market, or travelling to another country, and using your eur to buy things (in essence, the two are the same).so no, the 55 eur is not your money. if it makes you feel any better, its not ccp's money either. ccp actually is losing that money. i think iceland is using isk, and the 55 eur they gain from the increase in value of eur to usd is lost by losing exactly the same value from the usd side, as they have to change both in isk.so long story, the 55 eur diff is meaningless, in fact, doesn't even exist."
7/6/2011,"yep, when your average income and cost of living drop to what north america's is, we can talk.till then, the prices are fair."
7/6/2011,"europe > america in every way that matters.better, more affordable education.better, more affordable healthcare.better consumer protection.better judicial system.better legislative system.better economic system.actual history (ie. no need for ""worlds biggest ball of yarn"" to foster a national identity).etc. etc. i kind of feel sorry for the poor wayward colonists sometimes, they are living real life like it was a game of risk where only military might matters .. kind of sad me'thinks.so lower subscription fees are the worlds/ccps way of saying ""keep on trucking, there is light at the end of the tunnel!"""
7/6/2011,"this should only bother you if you are living in europe but get paid in us dollars. that is unlikely, but if this is the case then you need to sit down with your employer.furthermore, even though the us dollar tanked in value as an american i still get paid in us dollars. it's not like my employer will magically decide to pay me in something else. that means on average american's make less money. so even though the value is less it is the same ratio of my income as yours."
7/6/2011,lol @ everyone else. the eu really needs to work on making a couple more greece's if they want to be as monetarily awesome as the u.s. even absorbing iceland won't save your currency. muhahaha!
7/6/2011,"ironically they are trying their best to avoid being as monetarily awesome as the us, i.e. national bankruptcy."
7/6/2011,"totally true. you know, just 72 years ago europeans started the largest war mankind has ever seen. don't be so short sighted."
7/6/2011,"the captain's quarters are awesome, i love sitting on my space sofa watching my space tv. but take a moment to spare a thought for all our space buddies who are stuck in supercapital ships and unable to enjoy such things. they will never know the joy of the long walk down the disembarkment ramp, never stop to admire their olympian pyhsique in the mirror, never see the timely notifications that a new pilot has started their career.this is why i would like to propose the supercaptain's quarters. instead of seeing the boring old space view when they log in, supercapital pilots should be presented with the bridge of their ship. should they wish to navigate in space they can walk over to the navigation display and send commands from a floating holographic representation of nearby space. want to target those pesky low skillpoint scrubs rattling their impotent lasers off the hull of your almighty behemoth? just saunter over to the targeting computer and pick your foe, then another brief walk to the gunnery controls to open fire.but what if those irritating proles actually pose a threat to your fine spaceship? well then you can just take the lift down to engineering where you will be presented with similar consoles for activating your defensive modules all within mere minutes walk. not to mention a nanite paste vending machine that dispenses small portions in return for a small amount of aurum.now obviously by this point you're thinking that its not fair to restrict such wonders to supercapital pilots when everyone could enjoy walking in spaceships. but you have to understand, they are more important than you. their dedication to eve online entitles them to a standard of game not available to mere battleship pilots. this is why they truely deserve to be the frontrunners in mandatory incarna integration."
7/6/2011,troll thread of the week. right here.
7/6/2011,"supported, as long as they dont forget the most important thing for supercapital combat, the logoffski control panel."
7/6/2011,excelent and usefull idea like others qcs features!!!100% support.
7/6/2011,yyyeeeesssss!!!!!!!one1111!!!11!1!that is all.
7/6/2011,"about me i will always love low sec pvp more than anything in this game however it lack luster right now and i've retreated to 0.0. i've never done faction warfare as such i'm not 100 percent certain of its mechanics and i'm just throwing this out there as my idea revolves around faction warfare.tl;dr milita pays out members isk based on pvp kills. amount of isk paid is determined by rank and how long militia captures and holds bunkers.ok lets get to it the militia which you choose to fight for will award you isk based on your rank with in that militia. your rank is determined by how many pvp kills you get - not npc kills. your rank earns you a pay out once a week which is a percentage of what the militia made in profits for the week. the militia's profits can be increased or decreased by controlling/loosing bunkers. the longer you claim a bunker the more resources your militia obtains(and does some npc role playing stuff with it). npc's in the militia will pay out members of the militia based on their rank.what this hopes to achievenew players when i bring friends to this game they do not end up playing simply because there is no sense of direction. i would hope new comers to eve will see this as an opportunity to be a part of something, make friends, pvp, and actually make isk doing it! war = money increasing fw player base will increase player interaction which will increase ship explosions which will increase things to loot and salvage which will increase trading opportunity' which will increase logistics moving in and out of lowsec/highsec which will increase pirate activity... and now the wheel starts over.exploits problem: big alliances/corps joining a faction in attempts to ""powerhouse"" some isk.solution: good increased activity, players hate bigger alliance/corp and band together to crush them! on a side note make payouts similar to that of planetary interaction. for those just getting into the game it is a mild source of income - maybe 10-20 mill a week. for those more serious there is some what of a cap before they start having to get a lot of alts and it becoming very tedious making it not worth while for bigger groups to try to grief the system.problem: rank farming each other with alts (killing each other repeatedly to gain rank) solution: assign value to the ships you kill - like killboard points. so to gain rank effectively you need to kill bigger ships then noobships. which cost more money which become less desirable to kill each other with. which becomes tedious after doing it with low cost ships. you see where i'm going with this?problem: faction win trading - letting each faction cap the bunkers for x amount of time and then handing it over to generate isk.solution: this is eve carnage will always overpower greed. and as i said before make the isk pay outs similar to that of pi. the higher ranked players who earn more isk might like this and want to win trade - but the lower ranked players will fight! they want that isk!well let me know what you think. post anything you can see happening as an exploit so i can think of something to counter act it.i didnt proof read this. sorry for any grammar ill edit things as i see them."

7/6/2011,how about letting alliances that deploy stations pick a station model in the same racial line as the one being deployed from the various ones available in eve and pay for the customisation in aur. this has no effect other than cosmetic and it breaks the boring line of player deployed stations.
7/6/2011,"definetly yes, dont care much about the monocle, but this could be cool.would also want the option to resize it, if i wanted a mini-top hat instead if full size, and maybe later on a ring-master's circus uniform...it is vanity for a reason no? rich people can afford to be ecclectic and ridiculous."
7/6/2011,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.edited for support.
7/6/2011,"not if the user experience is anything like i had using cq. admitted i am one of the awkward squad running under linux but if the framerate is down, laggy and takes an age to load then an alternative of, say ship spinning should be available. after all, we are the paymasters and if ccp gives a damn about keeping their user base then it would, i suggest, be a good idea to give the players a choice of an agreeable alternative to cq, not the dreary static picture currently on offer."
7/6/2011,your question is roughly tantamount to asking what can be done to an empty plate to make it a better meal.
7/6/2011,this.
7/6/2011,"i agree with calyp5o, spinning the proceedings is *not* serving the primary purpose of csm. you are,for better or worse, our representatives with ccp. get a grip and let us know what really was said and agreed, otherwise you are just shills working to ccp's agenda.slightly off-topic i know, but related, is this business of ndas. now as our representatives you should be in a position to fully inform us of everything said and done at meetings with ccp. if there are things and topics that ccp decide should not be divulged to the peons then you have no business finding out what these topics are. put simply if we are not allowed to know then you have no business finding out. only ask about things deemed open to all. as a commited linux user i am, i suppose, more averse to ndas and their like than some but this has really rankled and lowered my opinion of the whole csm exercise. oh, as to the time taken to publish the minutes; as a former secretary to a large voluntary association if i had procrastinated for as long i would expect to have been on the end of a very vigorous rocket from the members."
7/6/2011,"i was going to post a big serious post.now, all i want to say is that any minutes will be edited but recording should be considered... i want to know how many times us subscribers are discussed in a bad way and the general feeling towards the eve community when it comes to planning and/or decision making.are we cattle or comrades?i have to stop typing or i'll textwall this topic with my views. restraint 101."
7/6/2011,yes! about time the stock market was started. this proposal has my full support. would love to see the value of the goons!
7/6/2011,"yeah, in aurum value :d"
7/6/2011,"hello to everyone!first , i apologise for any english error.now to the point. lately i noticed frequent eve cluster disconnections. i must precise my location is in europe , and i didnt have any internet problems during the time i speak of. so why ccp doesn't inform players about service disconnections? can csm members ask for an aditional site in eve web-sites with news or info about these interruptions (i mean no info that can damage confidentiallity but something like : ""eve servers are in trouble and will be back soon"" or ""service will be back in 30 minutes..."".i'm asking this cause i loose some time to gather info about this issue, and i asure you its not entertaining, like calling my isp support, checking internet connection, waiting something to happen, or check reykjavik newspaper web-sites for possible disasters (like the last hacker attack).briefly can ccp use a little corner of eveonline.com to broadcast this kind of info to the players?thanks. fly safe"
7/6/2011,"lol, tell it like it is"
7/6/2011,oh yeah? well csm-6 isn't a fan of 'extreme'. what a terrible band.
7/7/2011,"looking at the bs lineup for the four races, i noticed that amarr and caldari ships are set up for ranged slugfests. they have large shield/armor tanks and can use their weapons at longer ranges. however, they are slow.on the other hand, minmatar and gallente ships generally have shorter engagement ranges and less protection, so balance that with greater base speed and smaller signature.if gallente ships can't match amarr ships with armor ehp then that needs to be balanced out with a smaller sig. if their weapons have smaller engagement ranges, then the ships need to be faster to compensate. same goes for minmatar vs. caldari regarding shields, but i don't think it's as glaring a discrepancy."
7/7/2011,1
7/7/2011,"two months ago i would have said cosmetic only, but now that i no longer trust ccp to keep it that way, i say none at all."
7/7/2011,no
7/7/2011,supported !
7/7/2011,i'm one of those filthy rpers that insists on the immersion of the game being immersive. no jarring transitions from flying spaceships to walking in stations please!
7/7/2011,"i'm with you on the roleplaying thing. immersion is important. right now it feels disjointed and broken. it does not feel ""seamless"" as they try to describe it.+1 for this. i support this thread."
7/7/2011,do it right the first time.
7/7/2011,"i'd add: option for first person perspective. if you wanna know what the very definition of an immersion breaker is for me, just read back: ""wasd controlled puppets"".i want to see the world through my eyes, not some micro camera whirling about the back of a cartoon's head, ala wow, evercrack, etc., etc. ad nauseum, infinitum.the camera view while in pod...gotcha', and it even makes sense from the pod-lore. the camera view out of pod...give me an everloving 'gamey' break. if i want to look at ""me"", i'll find a mirror.my 2 cents."
7/7/2011,"fully supported, it never made sense to me that iw ould go out of my pod every time i docked in a station.to give a idea from the last eve book the capsuleer that had to go out of hit pod hated it. it made him feel weak very weak because he no longer had access to his ship all the data you name it."
7/7/2011,"i was about to make a topic about just this.personally, i feel eve is an extremely fast paced game. but it can also be very very slow.a few things i have noticed (as i am certain most of you have as well) you cannot drag and drop a ship to change active ships, nor can you simply double click the 'hangar area' to open your cargo bay. this is extremely detrimental to piracy, and other forms of fast paced action. i'm sure there's other things that have also affected the speed of combat, but i have not discovered them yet.i would personally love it if we automatically loaded the original station environment, with an added option to enter cq. i mean, the ship has to dock somehow. as the op stated, there is also a deep emotional attachment to 'ship spinning', but chillin' on a couch could also gain an emotional attachment when nothing else is going on.personally, i just want to be able to enjoy fast paced combat without having to load cq, and focus on combat when i want to. eve is, after all, a sandbox."
7/7/2011,1
7/7/2011,"lets get some more votes, keep it bumped.we need an answer from ccp"
7/7/2011,+1 gallente have only been getting the stick since i started playing back in 04 / 05 with my 2 gallente main accounts. i now only fly gallente in level 4 missions when i have a couple of others along to make up for my total lack of dps. coz my drake out t
7/7/2011,millions of useless sp in galente :( wtb trade in for laser or projectile skills and minmatar/amarr ship skills
7/7/2011,rails too
7/7/2011,"it's not that i'd never want to go into cq or station, but not everytime i dock my ship for every little thing. it takes longer to load and it just seems illogical.just add a disembark button. i bet more people will enter the cq instead of outright disabling this feature."
7/7/2011,1
7/7/2011,i'll chime in.
7/7/2011,no. and why do all these male characters thumb up this topic? it's not as if you can enter someone else's quarters anyway. man boobs?
7/7/2011,"this would be very nice to put into the game since it would make female characters, more realistic when you'll be able to mingle in the npc stations see jiggly breasts. and whenever they do unlock the station, you'll be able to see everyone i think in the dust 514 trailer i think they added breast physics.. lol"
7/7/2011,"that's why it would only be allowed at major hubs like jita.at these places, the little guy has no chance anyway."
7/7/2011,"your imagination seems a little stifled if you cannot imagine a bot which would allow you to select which orders to 'watch' and which ones not to.your point of timezones is moot because everyone can use these bots. there is no exclusivity here. from the billionaire to the smallest trader. with this auto order watching, then the ones with more open order count can truely make / or lose more isk. (as bots can be gamed, as i already mentioned)"
7/7/2011,"but what you forget is that real life currency and commodity markets have both bots and live traders, and traders beat bots all the time (well, i can't assume this will always hold, but the current state of the art algos cannot keep up with traders*). none of the apocalyptic fears that you mentioned occurs. i don't see any fundamental difference in the eve market that would indicate it would be different. especially since the bots which are being proposed here are simple order matching algos (to call them algos is a little of an insult even) which is nothing more than an instruction to 'beat the order as long as it is in this profit range'.i real life, banks use much more complex trending algos etc etc, and still traders have the bots for lunch.and besides, i proposed that these bots will only be available at hubs like jita. places where the small time trader is already swamped with illegal 3rd party 0.01 isk bots. best to make a sanctioned one to even the playing field.*in so far as bots can be gamed easily by live people."
7/7/2011,"a few things...first of before you going after my imagination. i havent seen anywhere that you said you wanted bots with order limitations. in a market run by boots that constantly 0.01 isking each other why would you want to limit your bots to just a few orders as long as they are in your price range you would still want to be the lowest seller or the highest bidder.how can my tz point be moot? not everyone will be at home or awake after dt to start up your bot, so those people who are, will have maybe hours of botting making isk compared to others, and this is regardless if they are actively trading or not. they just have to turn on the computer..i belive that those traders that just have gone to work when dt start will disagree with you, they are effectivly missing 10 hours of trading compared to the guy who live in a tz just an hour away.your comparison to rl market is a bit far fetch i think. that traders beat boots isn't an argument for implementing them in eve. first of eve is a closed system. we have very little effect on goods from famine, natural disasters, civil unrest. we cant invest long termed in r/d and hope for future patents. there is no creative destruction, only destruction! there is very little secondary market effects such as the bank crisis in eve. the market isn't very innovative in eve. it is much more about buying high and selling low. thats what boot are doing very well. analysing the market going after personal interaction or processing real life event that happens in the world is something a trader are better suited for.you can probably win a prize or two if you could come up with a bot that understands the effect of home bias, and can correctly come to conclusions how to act on it's orders on the market.no matter what happen in eve the real effect on goods aren't that affected, you can manipulate to get an affect but nc losing soverginity in space don't affect the price of cargo expander much.when demand and supply evens out (something that will go much faster with bots adjusting prices 23/7) there are people that are ready to have the smallest roi who will be left on the market. other people will move up in the food chain (tech ii) and the same thing will happen there. it is just a matter of time before everything gets bought and sold at a smallest % profit.you also trying to devalue the bots impact by claiming they can be manipulated. yes they can but as the number of boots increase and so the amount of goods they are trading in total, it will most likely become harder (very limited experience with boots i can admit).if they are so easily manipulated, why are people using them? do you think they help them earn isk? and why in gods name would you want something that is so easily beaten by a trader in jita where you will constantly be competing to rl traders, who will flock to jita in order to so easily beat your bot and take your isk?"
7/7/2011,"dear mr tom hagan,if you carefully read all the previous posts, you will see that one of the suggestions was to make an in game 'auto-match' order. this order matcher can presumably work even when you are not logged on, thereby making your dt arguement moot. as this is a discussion, not a proposal, it's just a matter of using your imagination to think of something that will work.so the point here that is worth discussion farther, is where you mentioned that the eve market is closed and not this same as real life. i contend that it is closer than you think. sure it won't have famines etc, but we aren't trading in wheat here are we? the 'commodities' that we are trading in eve are weapons and materials of war. these can indeed hit famine and surplus cycles as alliance wars ebb and flow. the arguement for 'bots' (and i use the word in quotes as to dissuade you from unnecessarily attacking some perceived flaw in one inferred implementation of it), is that the market as it is has room for more sophistication in trading *strategies* not continually butting its head against the ceiling of mechanical limitations. the trading game now is 50% brains 50% hovering over the ""update order"" button like a well trained monkey. i would like to think that if we all had such a monkey to use, then we can concentrate on the part of trading that requires a human brain to excel at.so am i arguing that well trained monkeys should be edged out of the market at the big hubs, well i guess i am. :)"
7/7/2011,i would like to see a faction miner hulk/mack just add to it a little bit like they do with the other faction ships.
7/7/2011,+1never understood that
7/7/2011,"first off, i don't care if this happens or not. with that said, i don't see this ever happening...1. second accounts cost the same as main accounts. currently you have to have a second account to do this. why on earth would ccp create one smaller revenue stream to to kill a much larger revenue stream? 2. some players train up alts and then transfer them to their main accounts when the training goal is reached. both the training up and the act of transfer cost money which nets ccp profit. take in to account that a lot of these people pay for the 2nd account with plex, so in reality that second plexed account nets ccp even more money than the main. the only way i see ccp doing this is to make it cost the same as having a second account. which would be silly on ccp's part because it would cost them development time and money to create a system with 0 chance of company profits."
7/7/2011,its sad to see this on the last page. good topic i would love to see somthing come of this.
7/7/2011,"my experience was not that skill points were a limiting factor at all. however if that is true for new players then selling sp is not an answer. fixing the game mechanics that keep them interested is the answer. one thing i noted as i began playing eve was that time at the keyboard had zero effect on my game progression other than earning isk. i also noted there was an extreme amount of repetitive grinding. and that everyone was trying to kill me. cpp should consider creating a 'playpen' inside the sidebox. an area that new players can compete against themselves without interference. once their sp and accomplishments reach a certain level they are removed from the playpen. this area should have lots of 'kids toys' such as competitions for battle, industry etc. sp accrues but can not be used until they 'graduate' from the playpen. once they are out in the real eve world they can now spend their sp on the path they decided on. one reward in the playpen could be isk another could be sp for winning competitions. the playpen should of course be named something more user friendly like 'eve school' or 'new eden university'. people quit any game because they feel they are losing. in real life we are losing all the time so we go to games to escape that. to find a place where we can win. in eve it is very hard to win anything and keep it for the first year. i often feel like i'm playing against every single player in eve except my corporation and playing against cpp. right now my home tew is having its second incursion in a month. i don't have the skills to play in the incursion which means i have to leave the system until its over if i want to do anything meaningful in eve. i will lose about 200m isk just like i did the last incursion last month. partly because of my own choices. i will likely log on for just an hour a day to maintain the basics of my personal economy. maybe log on for a couple of hours to mine at my backup base. get bored, curse my luck for having picked a system that sufferes an incurion a month and wonder if i really want to play this game after all. as a note i'll be playing a lot more wow this week until the incursion is over. i have no interest in buying plex i pay for my subscription annually. i want to 'win' eve by at least feeling that i am progressing. if that feeling goes away then i'll quit playing and won't renew my subscription. it's that simple. and though i wouldn't bat an eye at paying out $10,000 us for anything it must meet one criteria - value. for a game (value = fun), fullfilment, escape an even playing field. if i can just buy my sp like anyone else and it gave me game satisfation i would. but as i've found buying your way to the middle or top gives zero satisfaction. you are left with ""whats next?"". i believe cpp's challenge is to provide that 'whats next' from day one until they want to go out of business. selling sp is not a solution. playable content for all the players is the solution."
7/7/2011,"the older a game becomes, any game, the less relevant long term decisions become. eve will not be around in 6 years, counting on being able to do something after learning skills for 6 years from today is misguided.before you go all ape on my saying that eve will not be around in 6 years, look at the current vets, many are jaded to a degree that they only play eve on the forums anymore. anyone who has spent any amount of time shooting at sov structures pre and post dominion knows that basically sov is irrelevant. sov is merely a proxy for purpose except that there is no purpose. it doesn't matter whether you hold or lose sov, that has no bearing on the actual goal of the game which is to provide entertainment value. more an more people whine that there is no pvp to be had outside of blobs either. yadda yadda yadda, the bottom line is that eve absolutely needs new players and lots of them."
7/7/2011,"a few hours, you mean? or minutes - t1 frigate, propulsion jamming -> tackle frigate. after that they can train a few weeks to keep getting better at doing that same thing. level 5 in frigate, propulsion jamming, engineering, electronics, mechanic, hull upgrades, energy management, etc: these support skills will make them better tacklers but they won't add more ability to activate a warp scrambler or disruptor (just the ability to do so more efficiently/longer). why sell sp for cash directly?i would like to see items sold through nex being ingredients or bpcs, not the final items. this way every mt purchase benefits a greater number of players and improves the game for everyone.why not tie in sp gains with a new booster type. the booster requires certain ingredients only sold through the nex (thus providing the real money sink). the booster needs certain materials (nullsec, w-space gases), and a hefty production chain.different grades of booster will increase your sp gains by 50% to 200% for a period of time (such as 30 days), then hit you with a drawback of e.g.: 25% sp ******ation for another month. having a decent drawback means the users will be tempted to use more/better boosters, or just accept that they got to their goal of minmatar frigate 5 and assault ships 4 so they can now fly that jaguar they've been lusting after, a month early, but get slower sp gain for another month.so for one game mechanic we've introduced a nex component, industry components, targets for military action (the production chain such as reactors in poses), targets for vigilante action (boosters are contraband), and something to do off-grid in stations.selling sp for cash directly would only provide benefits to one pilot."
7/7/2011,"having played this game for 4 years and being able to fly most ships i took a break and have started with a new toon. now i can see from a new players perspective that 50k sp and 5,000 isk in the bank isn't very much of an incentive to carry on playing and the thought of taking another year before i can fly a ship proficiently is a long term investment. personally i quite like eve but for the newcomer they don't know what eve has to offer in the long term so they wont stick around. luckily i have pals that will help me get back up and running otherwise it would be a long hard slog and i doubt i would want to do that on my own.i think new players should at least start with a few more mil to get going. maybe a training boost for the first year just so they can enjoy the game abit more, as we all want more people to shoot right? ;)"
7/7/2011,"no read what those against this idea say. we must teach these new players patience and to realize they can't fly most ships in the game unless they play the game for many many years of their life.we must drill into them that they should feel lucky that t1 frigates for tackling don't take too long to train and they can have ""fun"" in pvp by flying tackling t1 frigates for the first year of playing eve. watching while others fly real ships.we must teach these new players that they must accept their lot in the game as a permanent noob who has no control over speeding up their own development. and to just accept being a pleb with no freedom, except to look at all the fun ships in jita market they cant fly and the multiple year training required to train them.we don't want new players unless they are willing to write up multiple year toon training plans.are you mediocre in real life great we have a game that forces you to be mediocre in game watching others fly elite ships while all you can fly is crap."
7/7/2011,"a bit of an over exaggeration, you think? or are you just a bit emo because you are unable to pay someone to hold your own **** for you?"
7/7/2011,"the use is very limited, but it's there.for example, being able to train 2 chars on the same account for a month would allow you to get 2 decent cyno chars without having to train them on a different account and pay transfer fees or pause training on the main char, or if you notice there's some skills you want to add after getting that char on the account one way or the other."
7/7/2011,"for quite some time now, i have been extremely interested in user-side modifications. look at, dare i get burned alive for saying this; the user side customizations for wor... worrrr... worrrrrrrr.... i can't say it. i vomit a little when i attempt to.anyway, user mods are a huge part of a successful community. even though it's not a mmo, look at oblivion. hell, look at morrowind. 6/12 (respectively) years old and still getting modified.if i recall correctly, the eve client uses python. if ccp were to separate the user interface from within the client (if that would even be required), they would protect their system-specific information, yet allow for 3rd party customizations.for example, custom text. custom target box's. custom button locations. custom window sizes. the possibilities are endless, and none of them are truly 'game breaking'. most of the stuff we see in the client is already client side with server connections. you would not be able to 'delete' a required window with a custom modification to the interface however. sorry, no sneaky local-delete mods will be produced."
7/7/2011,reserved space for idea picture links.post links to possible ideas that could spawn because of open-customization to the user-side client interface.
7/7/2011,read this before going any further with your idea.
7/7/2011,"i believe you are horribly mistaken at what i am suggesting. the link you referenced is for 3rd party apps. i am talking specifically about ui customization from the local side. which would, of course, require modification of local client files for the most part."
7/7/2011,that would potentially open up eve to exploits and bots.
7/7/2011,local modification of ui would require the use of an api or it would make the client hilariously easy to manipulate for the creation of bots and hacks.
7/7/2011,"if by buff you mean reduce damage, then yes.otherwiseplease visit your user settings to re-enable images."
7/7/2011,"i believe that op has really good approach to the issue. i would improve the original idea by tweaking gate gun/station gun pwnage with the systen sec level. 0.4 should have very powerfull guns and 0.1 very weak guns.0.4 stations would get plenty more supply and pirates would get easier access to modestly priced gear. more trafic would eventually bring more cannon fodder to pirates also and lowsec would stop trying to be ""nosec""."
7/7/2011,what about the sentry guns in 0.0 systems? no damage at all?
7/7/2011,the game would be better without sentry guns.
7/7/2011,i agree. remove gate guns from low sec. also remove local from 0.0! buffing gate guns would only provide safer gates and less fights.
7/7/2011,"make lp tokens that can be bought for lp (e.g. a 10.000 lp chip that costs 11.000 lp), traded on market and redeemed for lp again. getting lp and trading them (observing the market for niches, updating the orders, adjusting prices in +0.01-isk-increase-games etc.) are 2 different professions."
7/7/2011,boooooooo
7/7/2011,yes something needs to be done about thisccp needs better quality control?
7/7/2011,agreed
7/7/2011,"there is a proper process to do this rather than whine on the forums.file a petition via the website, and request that the petition be escalated to a senior gm or dev for the investigation.please include the name of the gm who removed the isk from your wallet and the reasons why, and why there was no evidence.but whining on the forums will not accomplish anything."
7/7/2011,this is outrageous and unacceptable. we expect ccp to treat their customers with respect and openness. this looks like that is not the case here.
7/7/2011,"exactly.now go away and cry somewhere else because every time i see these posts i always think ""oh look he got caught and now is crying about it""please...cliches are getting old around here."
7/7/2011,"i like the idea, but removing the ""chat"" portion of a chat window defeats the purpose of having it as a chat window in the first place. separating the character portraits alone from the chat channel is a nice idea, but on a functional level it makes more sense to keep them together.there's also the problem of implementing it in wormhole space and (i can dream) in 0.0 at some point.its a good idea and something i'd normally support, but it seems like something that ccp would be loathe to implement.ps: aedun sole is terrible."
7/7/2011,hmm maybe but chat in local is useful though but i do like the idea of noone turning up in local but i think that will never be done.ps: aedun sole is terrible.
7/7/2011,what about names? this would be a decent user-side option only if it also displayed names.
7/7/2011,"the overall gist of the change, at least from my comprehension, would be that you're able to use the local character pane to show whether people are blue/neut/red without the bulk of the chat interface.standings are linked into the character portrait system (you get the nice little indicators above the character portrait). linking that instead to just the names would seem silly in comparison.p.s.: aedun sole is still terrible."
7/7/2011,"i think that local could display a summary of the total numbers of reds, blues, and neuts that are present in system. if that info was displayed at the top of the list then local could be minimised and still be useful without using up lots of screen space.in null sec i'd suggest that local only displays that summary, but not the identities of the actual pilots present (that is important if you operate around the same areas regularly and get to know who else is about). i think that would be a nice half way house between the current system showing you everything and the hardcore option of removing local entirely. there would be less certainty of what you're facing without scouting but not severe enough to scare half the 0.0 population back to empire."
7/7/2011,"i would like to be able to minimize it a bit with smaller player photos and sort option of red at top instead of alphabetical. if i really want to see their picture, i'll click on them. being able to see 30 or a even more at once would be better than the current large portrait setup."
7/7/2011,"i was having a browse through evelopedia today, checking out the history of the csm and so on and so forth.now for the previous 5 csm's there have been a good deal of resources added to the wiki, for example:5th csm candidacyhowever the sixth candidacy, at present, is rather bare:6th csm candidacyit may be that not a significant enough time has passed for information to become available.however i emplore the csm to keep this resource up to date, and do make sure that this resource is then made prominent to the eve playerbase by the csm.it would be a great benefit to both the csm's reputation and for the knowledge of the eve playerbase.kind regardslaice(p.s can we get tshirts designed saying ""i survived monoclegate 2011!""?)"
7/7/2011,"the dearth of communication is due to the csm chair trying to run csm like a secret squirrel nullsec alliance. their communications are entirely through a skype chat channel, since wikis and the forum are apparently too hard."
7/7/2011,"then you know why ccp doesnt give a damn about the csm, and with a perfectly valid reason. but hey, nothing of value was lost so who cares.thinking about it, i nearly lost a merlin to gateguns tonight, that would have been a tragedy."
7/7/2011,"oh look, its this thread again.this thread had popped up every so often for the past 4 years or so. the best suggestion has been to use the russian client text-type.i dont have an actual link at this moment. russians post a link to your superior eve client font-type."

7/7/2011,after installing a recent client update on winxp config.sys was corrupted easilly fixed problem for myslef thought youmight not already know but best to post anyway ;)
7/7/2011,"there latest csm/ccp devblog adressed the problem with much higher cpu/gpu usage of current client compared to pre-incarna client. it also stated that new hangar with pre-incarna client cpu/gpu levels would be implemented to the game soontm.now. this is of course really nice and will remove the actual problem for those who like to keep their client open most of the times for chatting, occassional market pvp, setting skills or industry jobs and so on...however it would also be great to keep station enviroment enabled most of the time. for this reason i wish that any from following solutions could be implemented:1. dock -> enter low cpu/gpu hangar -> choise to leave ship and enter cq.2. dock -> cq -> choise to leave cq and enter low cpu/gpu hangar.3. some kind of low cpu/gpu terminal what can be accessed from cq.also unrelated to this, try to stop screen rendering and most unneccessary functions while client is minimized (and when pilot is in station)."
7/7/2011,"ok ther is a few things that need to be changed more than somelocal chat window should have the option to alter who is shown like nuetrals/blues/reds etc when you have like 1000 ppl in local and your trying to fine 1 person its rather difficult (maybe you could set to current overview settings idk)refining in 0.0 is beyond stupid it needs to be changed the intesive refining array has no use unless in a wormhole even then id rather not use it - the cycle time is stupid - you can only do one type of ore (even tho you have 3 types of one ore you can only do 1 of those). refining in stations the stats are pretty crap i mean all the isk involved and hard work into holding space in 0.0 you should be able to have decent stuff like good refining stats in stations and most defitnatly the refining arrays need tweeking alotwhat is the point in having level 5 infrastructure upgrades ppl see the level and go camp the area in cloakys now im a pvper that has done this but the upgrades should have some privacy before incarna if i turned off station enviroment on my alts and left it on my main character it would stay like that and i never needed to change it again - but now with this super shiny station stuff i either have to have it on or off for all of my characters, its rather anooying!please fix these =dregards orange offspring"
7/7/2011,your throwing a fit over your currency and your calling us short sighted?scuse me? last i checked... people usually go to their governments for things like this.short sighted is right... starting with you.
7/7/2011,"you do realise that eu citizens have to pay vat on every online transaction? so you indeed have to pay more, but the money does not go to ccp, it goes to the government.if you are in a europe country that is not part of eu, you can petition paying in  and ccp will switch you to $. i know, cause i did exactly that."
7/7/2011,and perhaps the only way to interface with your ship is via monocle?
7/7/2011,"qftthis first step, the cq, is only to test the technology and to iron out bugs. i'm pretty confident ccp already has a lot of content ready to be deployed. we just have to be patient. (once again)"
7/7/2011,or just take a look at
7/8/2011,"i like ccp to re-instate their idea to sell neural remaps for plex.*insert ****storm here*rationale a: eve online exists, what, 8 years now? much as no one likes to hear it, chances that it will exist another 8 years are slim. ccp zulu has recently stated again that selling remaps for plex makes sense; and i think he is right. we're not talking about a game-breaking mechanic here: just a way to train a little more efficiently, in deference to the realization that there are less years ahead of us than there are behind us (and that this will become increasingly more true with each following year).rationale b: 1x neural remap a year is too little. there are many learning tracks, like leadership skills, that you don't really can justify an entire yearly remap for. now, ideally ccp would just give us 2 remaps a year, for free. since they're into money these days, they're obviously not gonna do that. so, might as well pay them for it.edit: this proposal now includes: no more than max 4 remaps a year, and no less than 2 (obviously)."
7/8/2011,forever decline!
7/8/2011,i thought this old chestnut was well dead and buried.not supported.pass the shovel.
7/8/2011,"when i first heard this suggestion i liked it. i still do. supported.can someone who is opposed explain the rationale in opposing? this wouldn't be abused too often. for myself, i'd like to do a quick remap to int / mem, work on some electronics / engineering / scanning skills and then get back to per / will. it's noy buying skill points, you still have to wait. it's not an extreme shortcut, it's like train 5 skills, get the 6th one at half price."
7/8/2011,"i dont think payign for remaps is the way to go but i would definatly like to see them more often, maybe once every 4 months, so thats 3 a year. that would make a lot of sense to me anyway."
7/8/2011,"a well thought out proposal, so supported."
7/8/2011,supported
7/8/2011,nothat last line sums it up.
7/8/2011,"a small bump on my part.so far, there are a total number of 175 posts that clearly supports my suggestion (including my shameless support). once again, thank you for spending your time providing both your support and constructive criticism.one thing i'm worried about is how the design team of incarna was disembodied from the rest of the player base and the content team within ccp. it is entirely possible that incarna would have stayed in this current incarnation if it were not for the uproar from the player base. check out nyphur's interview with ccp zulu(arnar gylafson):--start--nyphur: ccp has made it clear that its current strategy involves forcing player to dock into the captain's quarters (performance permitting). can you explain the reason behind that strategy? more specifically, would incarna-only gameplay and incentives not be enough to get people to use it?arnar: forcing players to dock at the captain's quarters is a form of what we actually wanted to get through, which is making incarna a seamless part of the eve online experience. it's not so much about forcing people to dock into the captain's quarters or forcing people to use features, it's more about making it a fully integrated seamless part of the world.--end--i am truly disappointed to see arnar using the word ""seamless"" as a mere buzz word. by definition, the word ""seamless"" means being consistent and coherent to preexisting surroundings, laws and ideas. for a new feature to become a ""fully integrated seamless part of the world,"" it must follow the fundamental laws that dictate that world (i.e. ""all eve online users are pod pilots""), and produce outputs that fit in within the laws of the established world (i.e. ""i am a pod pilot, but sometimes i want to stretch my feet for a while""). otherwise, it will neither be ""consistent"" nor ""coherent."" simply put, for a new feature to seamlessly integrate, it has to make sense to the average user who knows the rules of the world.it especially worries me that ccp seems to have given little thought about how the introduction of cq would affect the general populace, more so considering the effort it put during the last four years to lay the technological foundation for cq and walking in stations. to see ccp making mistakes that single handedly lashes out to the three foundations of mmorpgs, the core concept, technological foundations and the user community, does not make things much better.i sincerely hope this whole mess be a lesson to ccp's future endeavors."
7/8/2011,"whoa, there have been a lot of supporting posts since i last cheched in! excellent.i'm digging this trend too!now back to the top of the list!"
7/8/2011,"no, their was a posting about this not to long ago from ccp and why. and im still strongly against such an idea."
7/8/2011,"@op: obviously you were drunk one night; and, thinking of spending your money on eve, instead of paying child support, you thought spendingyourchildsupport would be a hopelessly cool name.well, live with it, mate. if you felt it was in error, you could ha"
7/8/2011,"""we all know"" that drones will keep attacking their assigned target. they only attack aggressors when there are no assigned targets. even given the assumption that fighters and drones are set to attack the ecm boats, a scorpion can effectively ecm from ~100km, providing ample opportunity to warp in, jam, warp elsewhere on grid, continue jamming. tactics can be devised to accomplish the task once the ewar immunity is removed.it will take far less than 100 dedicated ecm boats (what's a ""dedicated"" ecm boat?) to interrupt the repping chain of a supercarrier fleet. given the sensor strength of an aeon for example - 150 radar. using a scorpion with a nominal 10 sensor strength on each jammer, that's 1/15 chance of jamming, each cycle of each jammer. thus it is highly likely that a fleet of 8 or so scorpions operating at maximum range could interrupt the lock of a supercarrier on each attempt. combine that with some heavy sensor damping (1 module per battleship in the attacking fleet, for example) to slow down the relock, and the ***** in the armour is revealed.supercarriers with their current statistics will still be phenomenally powerful, but they will have *****s* in their armour which can be exploited. your argument about titans being able to single-shot an ecm boat every 15 seconds is pointless, since the titans will have plenty of targets to choose from - why would they pick ecm specifically, instead of the heavy interdictors, the bhaalgorns, the recons, or the other capitals and supercapitals?in addition to removing ewar immunity, moving the +2 fighters bonus from the hull to the high slot modules will force supercarriers to choose between fleet boosting, logistics or dps.* a crack, cleft or fissure, also a slang perjorative term for vherokior & jin mei."
7/8/2011,i wonder if these small posts even get a consideration by csm and ccp
7/8/2011,"was about to rage about this idea when i noticed it was for trial accounts, maybe amend the header? providing as has been stated previously ""as soon as a trial account goes active even for a month that account cannot get binned"" . i should think that the flag check for trial is inherently inbuilt into eve and a clean up could be done on an expansion by expansion basis. as i suspect this would be a significant db hit to do unless it was built into the auto clean up script for items in space. only drawback with that is it calls a different table and flag, and has no method of calling if the account has been contacted prior to purging with a delay count in order to action the request.not a trivial request and potentialy a very high risk proposal but worth doing in the long term given the number of trial accounts that must have existed since eve started."
7/8/2011,i support the cleaning out of old trial accounts.
7/8/2011,aye for trial accounts i would say 8 to 10 months old

7/8/2011,"i like them, they appear just fine on my screen but then again i use a different layout and design then the default. station environment though can be burnt at the stake."
7/8/2011,+
7/8/2011,"i'd also like to see a +dps drone module. i don't get why every other weapon system allows you to boost dps, but not drones."
7/8/2011,i want drone implants and i want fighter and bomber implants . i'm not sure they should overlap as this mite make things a little unbalanced. with most of the e war drones considered to be junk this mite be a easy fix.
7/8/2011,seriously how hard can this be to put in the game.
7/8/2011,"this is the reason why the eve playbase is stagnating.back in 2004 there were very few mmo games, and eve was one of, if not the only mmo, that was subscriber based and worth playing.now, there are so many offerings, that eve has been left to languish.unless your a government, you dont hold onto traditions, just because they are traditions.... ibm/ge/gm/etc once had the 'job for life' tradition, but if they stayed that way, they'd have folded by now.ccp does need to start looking at the skill system and see if there is room to move.people dont play games/entertainment to be taught a lesson, they play for entertainment valueif you have a large choice of entertainment, your going to make that choice on getting the best value for your time and your $$$'s.the world has changed, but eve hasn't... and perhaps the eve universe does need an anema, ccp definetly dont need the money, maybe they would be better off in the long run with a complete flush out. if rl $'s for sp achieves that, then maybe that will be good for the game in the long run."
7/8/2011,"exaggeration maybe, but really not that far off the truth.fact is i already paid for my toon and am loving eve with 170 mill sp across 2 toons now. it didn't ruin the game for others and just allowed me the freedom to play how i want. i tried playing as a new player noob and i'm too driven to succeed in the things i do to be put under those stupid sp restrictions. most new players can't handle the endless boring useless multi month long waiting and quit cause most of eve is locked out from them. i only support this because i know how stupidly frustrating being a new player is and all these vets need to go start a new account, play as a new player does and see why 100,000's of them have quit many for this reason.other games give you freedom, control over your characters development based on time in game and what you do in game. eve is one of the very few that limits everything you do to time. i mean sure lock out some of the higher end content and ships but give the noobs 20-30 mill sp they can grind up to in game or sell it to them for instant ccp profit. once they have that much they can fly some decent ships and keep training slowly from there. this game needs new players. not vets who pay ccp in isk for their monthly subscriptions."
7/8/2011,no bro this game needs you to get out !never stop probing your intentions ccp !what a lovely survey this is...ccp=fail=check
7/8/2011,"what do you think will happen if you open every possibility up to players with cash, instead of making them train for it? think now. what will happen? it's not hard to work out if you understand how mmos work and the most elementary player psychology..."
7/8/2011,"a player with cash already has every option available to them, they just buy a 50-100mill sp toon for $500-1000 and then train normally the other skills while they enjoy all that eve has to offer. not many do this so your worried about a few new players buying some sp instead of quiting eve worried about what? a few more 20-40 sp pilots. most do not have money to throw at a game like this or their would be massive bidding wars on all high end pilots now.most people would just use it to jump past some mind numbing part of the training cycle that's stopping their in game enjoyment. like they want to fly a tengu they have trained many support skills for it and now see they are 3 weeks away from flying it. but are impatient and want to fly it today. instead of telling them, nope your screwed go play another game you see you in 3 weeks or grind those level 3 missions till your iq points drop 10 points. why not let them keep playing the game they want to play and let them pay ccp at the same time? once they are in tengu's they play their own game enjoying eve and training normally till maybe they find another hump they just can't wait for.really the logic behind forcing a harsh and unenjoyable gameplay experience on noobs is beyond me. not everyone is the same and happy to be patient and grow things slowly. doesn't make them wrong or you right people are different."
7/8/2011,forever decline!
7/8/2011,"why do you need a t3 to enjoy yourself in eve? i think you've convinced yourself unless you're flying the very highest level ships, you're not having fun.well, i hate to be the one to tell you this - but i've enjoyed my time flying t1 and faction ships, many players continue flying and specialising in t1 or faction ships for years or even all their eve career, and myself and a great many others have enjoyed the early levels of many other mmos too - often more that whatever someone else thinks is the 'endgame'.having to train with only very pricy character transfers as a faster option gives players slowly expanding options, so new possibilities present themselves even years after beginning play. you want to **** all over that. i'm sorry - it has been made made clear to you time and time again - even very recently - by the player majority, csm, the most powerful and/or respected players and alliances in eve, and last but not least - ccp themselves - that they will not stand for the eve sandbox experience being ******ed in the manner you so glibly suggest.if you don't like it, and are too screwed up in your head to enjoy anything but what you perceive as the 'best', eve is not for you. and that's ok. life will go on. so please, please - deal with it."
7/8/2011,"you know, most people that do buy those 50 to 100 mil ""characters""(""toons"" ) struggle because they have no idea actually how to play the game, they get frustrated and shortly quit because they got their ass handed to them by someone who played twice long but with only half the sp. with the current manner of skilling your character, you learn how to play the game as a steady progression into the o'shiny type ships. and when you actually get there, the reward of learning the how to play pays out in huge dividends. i have had scores of players in a rush to get to the next biggest thing, buy characters to get there, and end up raging because they can not fit or fly any of the ships they have been :fapping: over. and end up wondering why they even play this game.the only other folk that don't really care about any of that are usually the botters and the station spinners that are too afraid to even undock and play the game."
7/8/2011,"actually, ""let them keep playing the game"" is just what ccp doesn't want. what they want is ""let them keep paying for the game without playing online"" to max the profit at the minimized server cost. so they made the endless skill system to make you always pay for something in future even if you don't like what you can play now. you will not be able to know if it was worth it until you already paid enough to get it, which you will probably find not. then you make yourself another illusion like""i already went to much to give up, the game will become fun if i just do this more"". this is how eve works.if the game was charged by hours or server resource is free to use, skills would be long gone."
7/8/2011,careful baaldor - you'll be branded elitest :-d you want to hold back these poor whinging lazy dumb-effing noobs from flying a shiny t3 or supercap! you're just a nasty wasty bitter vet!
7/8/2011,"meh, if the public safety message brands me an elitist grumpy old ***got, then so be it. tears and hate mail works for me too, it motivates me to log in."
7/8/2011,"they already do, its called buy a few plexs with your real life cash and buy a toon from somebody else that has all the skills you want."
7/8/2011,"so, why don't you just leave?it's not like drone space had a major change since its creation. it's always been dropping minerals. and aside from small bits of border regions it isn't a pvp zone either, it's practically a safe haven.the people who should live in that space are the ones who can capitalize on what it has to offer, and that is vast amount of minerals, which coincidentally are needed for capitals. it has never been an isk making zone (even though you can make proper isk there, too)."
7/8/2011,"move to new space, problem solved."
7/8/2011,"yeah i like the new turrets, but not the new icons.please give the old icons back, they where awesome for the job they where doing."
7/8/2011,1
7/8/2011,whine much? i love the new icons. i'm against.
7/8/2011,got my support. the new turret icons are a travesty of ui design and art direction. how utter sh!te like this makes it's way into the final release is beyond me. no professionalism...
7/8/2011,"while yes eve is a harsh world, it is sad that a person can fly into a system. go to a moon or a planet and cloak up and walk away from his or her computer with zero risk then the risk of coming threw a gate camp.while i am not saying that cloaks should be easy to find by any means, should a person want to come in and disrupt operations in a system without getting into combat then they should have to stay at the computer watching and keeping them selves safe by warping around and changing spots on a regular basis.at no time should they just be able to camp out in a system all day long cloaked while they head off to school work ect.we need to have an option to find cloaked ships, target them, and blow them up and get them out of our space. making probes able to find them and break there cloak would allow this. yet it would allow your covert ops folks to still be able to jump into a system and scout and do there job ect.what that option would be to find these afk cloaks is up to debate but we need something."
7/8/2011,"thread number 657583while ever you have your 100%, risk free, instant intel tool called local, afk cloaking should remain a somewhat viable counter to subvert it's use.what you are asking for, is more power on top of what local already provides to you. that is not a balanced approach."
7/8/2011,"really so its balanced that somebody that is not at there computer can cause operations in a system to grind to a halt while he is no where at his computer in perfect safety. sorry that's not balanced nor is it right. if your at your computer warping around and playing the game the odds of you getting caught are still slim to none.what i am asking for is to be able to find that person who just comes into the system parks, cloaks up and walks away and only goes offline when the downtime hits.all local does is tell us he is there not where he is. it wont allow us to target them and it wont allow us to find him.any player that is sitting there cloaked paying attention to his d-scan will still be perfectly safe as he will be able to see trouble coming, avoid being probed, and be able to warp to a safe spot long before anybody can get there to kill him. this still disrupts activities in a system, you just would not be able to do it afk anymore. you would ohh my god actually have to play the game if you dint want to loose your ship."
7/8/2011,"you know, it would save us a lot of time and effort if you just searched this topic, and read the responses. that way we can focus other hot topics like, top hats, barbie accessories and sp for cash programs."
7/8/2011,"this is all mental. ships are only dangerous if they are attacking you and you could counter afk cloakers by not doing everything solo in gimped for pvp ships.sure it's irritating and i totally get that, but that's the whole point of the tactic."
7/8/2011,"and while he is cloaked, what exactly is he doing to you?no you're asking for even more power, on top of the already powerful local intel tool.no, but it tells you he is there while he is cloaked. so he already has his covert module bypassed, with instant intel given to you by local.any player watching local and the overview, will have a chance of warping out. especially if they are 76% speed aligned."
7/8/2011,"i don't have an issue with the fact that folks come in and disrupt the system. even if they are cloaked, that's part of the game and honestly breaks up the task of mining. my issue is that they do it while not even at there keyboards. there at school, work, where ever and are able to sit there and do it with zero risk to them selves.them being there disrupting and being irritating while not even there and being 100% safe is what i have an issue with. not the fact that they are being irritating or in my system, that can actually be a lot of fun to try and hunt somebody down that is taunting you and such. it also provides a choice for me to make when we are doing corp ops and such, do i risk mining that ice belt today with zero protection so i can get more or do i go ahead and set up protection, warp bubbles, the whole works, and take the productivity loss. do i stage the pvp op i was planning in this system and risk him being a spy for the alliance i am about to attack or no. do i try to online the pos i was planning on building today or wait for him to leave, just by his mere presence he adds a bit of excitement and danger to my plans. that's not what i want to change. i just want him to actually have to be there in order to do that disruption.mag's you made my point for me with your last statement any player that is paying attention to his d-scan and local and taking steps like making sure he is aligned to a safe spot is pretty much safe there is a slim chance of catching him and killing him. however to be safe like that he actually has to be paying attention to the game and playing. no player regardless of how they fit there ship is safe if they get up and walk away from the computer to go to work or school or even to go to the bathroom specially in null sec with the sole exception of anybody that has a cloaking device. that's the issue that needs to be resolved. not that fact that they are cloaked, i honestly could care less if i can find them or not, i just don't want them come into a system and have zero risk of loosing there ship or having something happen to them.probing yes would not be balanced, but we need to have something done to present some risk to the afk cloaker. i would go for something that gives the cloak a random chance to fail and if you don't turn it back on quickly enough your no longer cloaked. something like instead of auto cycling you have to click it back on each time to stay cloaked, or every 7 to 10 mins you have to type in a random word displayed on your hud to keep the cloak active. rp wise it could be explained as having to adjust the frequency of the cloak to maintain it due to radiation interference from the planets and such. honestly something or anything to add an element of danger to the operation of cloaking up in a system to disrupt activities and prevent them from being able to do so while afk. if your paying attention and playing you would still be 100% safe and be irritating and annoying, yet it adds in that element of risk that means you have to play the game in order to pull of said tactic.mag's i see what your saying about the local channel now, and while i can see your point, i must say that it is a needed thing or no one would ever mine in null or low sec."

7/8/2011,"alternatively, give up your obsession with having giant lists of mostly pointless information to stare at that take up large portions of screen space. you could perhaps propose a simple, functional, less screen intensive, and overall better 'standings and status counter' (for people in local) of some sort instead. how many wts in local? 5/483. how many blues? 11/483. np. if you wanted to go completely crazy with such sane interface design, you could even get expanded lists with names/tags for each element simply by clicking on the appropriate indicator.that however would have far too much function/ease of use and way too little clutter. regardless, nothing is likely to be implemented considering ccp generally dislikes the use of local as an all-seeing intel tool and probably intends to eventually remove such capability along with vague 'other nullsec changes'."

7/8/2011,i raised this in one of my first posts on the forums.the corp share system in its current form is just redundant. ccp should just remove the code or actually do something useful with it.
7/8/2011,"sounds good.. i dont neccessarily agree on the 51% ceo control.. if the ceo wants to hold a minority holding it should be fine. perhaps shareholders could have voting rights similar to the corp ones.. ie vote to install new ceo, vote to merge into another entity, etc.. the added dynamic would add play content for all players in eve.. highsec industrial groups may vie with each other to attempt hostile takeovers. 0.0 entities ciould be defeated by economic victory instead of just brute force attacks, etc.. food for thought and this could actually be new content that might add tot he game.. ie instead of spending all that time and r&d on a room a hallway and a balcony.. none of which have any additional gae play."
7/9/2011,"well, the thing is, ccp isn't into freebies any more. so i don't think a proposal to simply give us more remaps a year will make it. offer them a little money, however, and they might.p.s. i do think the amount of remaps per year should be capped, though; to max 4, or max 2 even, if need be."
7/9/2011,"i like the idea (and did when it was first proposed). it should be limited to a remap every 2 or 3 months, so that you still have to make long-term decisions. just not to the point when you nerf your character for half a year just so that you can train faster during the other half."

7/9/2011,too much load with >1 client; makes market operations (more) tedious.
7/9/2011,"the first thing to keep in mind is the following:this proposal in no way is intended to be some golden bullet that fixes super carriers solely, but a change that would help enhance other changes to how capital warfare works.now on to the proposal.in order for this idea to have any hope of a positive impact, two key changes have to happen.increase all eas effective hit points by at least 25%drone bays on super carriers are restricted to only allow fighters and fighter bombers to be loaded.with those changes in mind, let's go over the initial idea from a recent idea that inspired me to.refine it.currently super carriers are immune to all forms of electronic warfare. it was recently suggested that, along with the 'only fighters and fighter bombers', that electronic attack ships be able to use their ew on them. granted they were including titans and the tracking and super point stuff, my idea is only about super carriers and the eas.at first it sounded great but then i thought about it for a few minutes. the kitsune could ecm it. even though i think ecm is a dumb ****ing mechanic, at least that was something. the keres could warp.disrupt the super carrier, thus making it a cheap super point? feels like it is stepping on the toes of the hic. it could dampen it some but to what? kinda meh. so what about the other ew from the hyena and sentinel?? target painting something the size of a small moon would be pointless. web you say? so you make it go 25 or so meters slower? super carriers are not exactly known for their blistering speed. ok so sentinel time. tracking disrupt what turrets?so basically only two out of the four eass would be even worth using. i concluded that a simple, ""not immune to electronic attack ship ew!"" would work well enough.here is how i envisioned that idea refined:electronic attack ships can activate the ew that the ship gets a bonus to on a super carrier, but the affect is transfered to all fighters and fighter bombers under its control.all effects mentioned below apply to bother fighters and fighter bombers. here is the break down:kitsune - based on the sensor strength of each individual fighter and fighter bomber, it has a chance to be jammed. so out of say twenty fighter bombers ten or so might becomes jammed for twenty seconds. of course racial jammers would have a better chance at jamming the appropriate fighter, just like a normal ship. a kitsune with great skills, gang bonuses and one of each racial has a good chance of jamming the entire swarm from that super carrier.keres - with a warp disruptor, all fighters would not be able to follow targets into warp and engage them. warp.scramble would mean the same thing and all fighters would not be able to activate their microwarp drive. thus taking much longer to get to their targets and engage. sensor dampener depending on how they are scripted would force longer lock times and smaller orbit ranges increasing the odds of being in smartbombing range.hyena - activating webs on a super carrier would cause all fighters to slow down. target painters increase their signature radius. for anti-fighter/fighter bomber, the combination would make easy targets to blast out of the skies.sentinel - tracking disrupting depending on the drips would cause shorter optimal ranges for fighters and make it harder for their guns to track smaller non-capital ships. fighter bombers are harder to figure out so i will go with this; shorter firing range for the micro-citadel torpedoes, forcing the bombers to get much closer before shooting. also increasing their explosion velosity dramatically enough that they will not be doing full damage, not even to capital ships.granted stats and such would need to be looked into. electronic attac"
7/9/2011,but the ships can still use their ewar on the fighters and fighter bombers anyway.so there's no need to change anything.
7/9/2011,and here i thought highlighting things in yellow would help...
7/9/2011,"*rubs eye* holy ****! an actual reason to train eas lvl 5!cliffy, what he/she is saying is the ew signal would transfer to every fighter and fighter bomber under the motherships control. basically, ""you can't stop the signal.""thumbs up for not stopping the signal!"
7/9/2011,"that is actually a pretty decent idea.for the people who complain that a small ship can then completely shut down a supercarrier (that kitsune might be kinda too strong compared to the others tbh, it can completely shut down the fighters while the others dont come close to that), bigger should not always be better, supercaps need a weekness they now lack.and for those who are afraid it makes them useless, we are talking eafs here, get a freaking support fleet and they blow up so fast you dont even notice they warped in.or lvl 2"

7/9/2011,"i'm of the opinion that any character of less than a year should just be started over. on the other hand, if you've gone an entire year without realizing you've got a stupid name, well then tough bananas."
7/9/2011,"ill add that to the pile. but honestly, is there any in-game reason (immersion) why there should be a loss of skill points? just sounds vindictive to mehmm, could you elaborate on what you define as legit and how it would be abused?black and white arguments rarely fully meet the needs of anyoneits ok, i do read your posts, thanks for bumping this thread again"
7/9/2011,"legit would be ccp sanctioned character trade threw the bazaar.how it could be abused simple. player a is a known ganker and spy, no corp will take him, any corp that does he steals from and suicide ganks new players ect you name it. basically this player is a real scum bag on this toon. he grows weary of not being able to get into corps to steal from them and his reputation has grown to the point that everybody leaves what ever system he enters. he then makes another account and ""sells"" his toon to that account. using a different email address and different name one of his kids names or his girl friends or what ever to avoid any chance of ccp tracking it back to him. he gets a name change as part of the deal and now removes the reputation that he had. he now can go back to being a scum bag with a new rep and other players have no warning.that is the whole reason behind not being able to change the name of a toon currently, you should not be able to loose a reputation that you have built on a toon without hard work and dedication to actually changing your ways or changing the rep.there are honorable pirates in the game both high sec and low that have excellent reputations for killing other players but being professional about it and always taking the time to give that player some tips and tricks to survive the next fight. there are also players that have developed a reputation close to what i described above and the only way they should be able to loose that rep is by changing there ways (or appearing to long enough) or making a new toon."
7/9/2011,"excesssiveno. the aka system provides in-game, searchable documentation on name changes in the character info window (new tab). nothing is removed, nothing is escaped. there have been many ideas to supplement the aka system and recently i got bored and posted those on the test forum (while its still up) [proposal] name changing again, that is the whole reason behind the aka system"

7/9/2011,they suck balls . fire the dev team that did them.
7/9/2011,"they are good , not as dark as release day"
7/9/2011,"iam all out dissapointed with this. fire the genius that made up this turreticons, they blend into space, they are ghostly-blurred and they need to be removed!give us back the old ones and stop changing things you obviously shouldnt cause you can not improve them! doh!"
7/9/2011,"icons shouldn't be blurred screenshots of the actual item. they should be representative graphics showing clearly what they are, and giving some sense of what they do.the old tractor beam icon was a good example - you could see it was a turret, and the magnetic looking field out the front suggested a tractor. but the new tractor beam icon... how am i supposed to even guess, much less see this clearly?ccp - will every icon be transitioned from good looking sharply defined icons that suggest their purpose, to lowres blurry-as-hell screenshoots? or will this idiocy be reversed?perhaps you ought to start having csm or a nearby child review your artwork first, if this is what you consider ready for release."
7/9/2011,"all you proponents of this proposal have to realize a simple thing.eve has no levels. no experience point system. the only in-game thing that differentiates an experienced player and a newbie is sp and isk balance. you can already 'buy' isk, if you allowed for buying sp, then you are essentially condoning cheating.if you want to fly an orca but can't it's because sorry, you have to work your way there through mining cruisers and mining barges first. want that faction battleship? need to fly a regular one first. you can't jump levels (without resorting to cheats) in other games, you shouldn't in eve."
7/9/2011,good points kaelie. and people can cheat using multiple accounts to overcome challenges of eve. too many ways to 'cheat' the game already.
7/9/2011,"your argument doesnt hold water. saying that someone would be in business for 3 years and just sell everthing to screw over a few people to make a little money...come on. after about 3 years, if that person hasnt made a billion isk there's somenthing wrong. if they did do it, it would be for fun, not for isk. and thats ok. loop holes are what make this game great. everything can go wrong. so i really dont see the problem. most people would not do that just because they would use the stock market instead of trying to destroy something that was finally implemented. but even if they do..so what."
7/9/2011,"please take a econ 101 class and report back afterwards.(ps, the '3 years' was illustrative. made to show a point. if you think its too long, then make its 2 years, or 1 year, or 6 months. point is the same. besides, how hard would it be to make a corp for your alt, and let it lay fallow for a while, or even better, buy a old corp from someone.)"
7/9/2011,"taken it. but that has nothing to do with this game. like someone mentioned earlier, if you make the economic system too complex, ccp will not bother with it. this is a game and as such it will most likely not be as real as the actual stock market. and if someone is clever enough to find a loop hole and exploit the system...more power to em. however, not everyone will do that. most will use and enjoy the stock market system."
7/9/2011,"please dont hurry to rage out as soon as you see the word sp trade. read the post first and judge for yourself. it is not mt, it is not cheat, it brings no abnomal advantages and it creates nothing from thin air. it is just a system to allow you to actually 'earn' your sp like you always like to say. yes, sp trade is already happening through character bazaar, and this plan only makes it works better for everyone.terrible npe, stagnating and aging playerbase, endless whining and argue on forum, name changing plea now and then...those are problems actually exist. no matter what's your opinion to specific issues, the biggest actual problem is that these problems exist. and a good system that prevent problems coming out at first is always better than telling yourself that you can live with them, shutting others up, or even deceiving yourself that they are the 'good part' and make you 'cool'.back to my plan, orignally derived from the idea of ms cassiopeia andromedae, i made modification to make it feasible and without obvious flaw. the core idea will be:allow player a to sell the sp of specific skill to player b for isk in ingame market at the punishment of losing part of them.lets say a new technology in eden that can extract part of your brain content to some storage media, not sp in general, but sp of specific skill that you trained. others already injected the book can buy the media from you and inject it into their brain and get part of your extracted sp on that skill. convert rate= (primaryattribute(buyer) * 2+secondaryattribute(buyer) * 1) /100 that will be theoretically 51%-89%. so the attribute points remain meaninful, you get punished for buying skills you train slow. and if you sell the skill you train quick and with the money buy those you train slow, you actually lose more time.example: player a have 100 sp on skill on the skill 'amarr industrial' and found it unnecessary. he extracted it and sell the good 'amarr industrial sp' in market. player b injects the book first and then buys the sp from a. the attributes of b are 28p+25w, so he get 100*(28*2+25)/100=81 skill points when he inject 100.of course trail accounts should be forbidden to sell sp. but rather than also forbidding them to buy it, i think a better and more direct solution to all the trail problem is simply forbid them to shoot at other players first.why the plan benefits everyone:newbies will benefit: --they finally have a way to do something to boost the character progress. this mechanism is a must to make any game attractive. --they now have at least hope to eventually catch up with vets, hope itself really means a lot.vets will benefit: --an access to remap your skill distribution, either because you are unsatisfyed with your former dicision or just want to try something new. --immediate alts. --extra free isk everyday if you do not want to train anything new.ccp will benefit: --skill points vanish with every transaction and is not gained any faster overall, this will eventually reach some balance point that you can control the infinite skill bigbang. --when humans get stimulated by positive reward of what they do, they repeat it. when newbies see hope and can do something to help the character grow, they get happy doing the repeat and monotonous lv1, they immerse, they may even stay in your broken game! how amazing!bazaar sellers will benefit: --a bundle of skills,needed and not needed, patched together with an ugly name is currently price discounted. you will surely get more isk with selling skills alone seperately to those need them. just extract all skills of the character, contract them to your main character, biomass the drained zombie, and take your time to sell.everyone will benefit:to be continued"
7/9/2011,"continueeveryone will benefit: --no need to buy characters bad named and with skills you do not need. those characters ugly, bad named and no one likes will be drained out and eventually biomassed! you can stick to the character you actually like and grow him up sooner. --emergency money source. --more noob, more prey, more lively universe. --gallentes finally find a path to escape from their nightmare. --cannot jugde much from the birth date of a pilot, uncertainty is good for pvp, prepare to surprise or be surprised. --all the 3 char slots of your account will become meaningful. you can train one and buy skills for the other 2. --yes, immersion."
7/9/2011,this idea actually has a lot of merit in my book! i'm giving you a thumbs up!
7/9/2011,"supported, as no isk printing presses are involved.+1"
7/9/2011,"hi,i am 6-7 million sp character mainly flying a rifter. i am still using tech 1 guns.and i don't understand why would anyone want to buy extra sp.i personally think all this hunger for more sp is just result of impatience combined with having no clue about real game mechanics. you can do a lot of things without having tons of sp.generally, knowing how easy it is to ""print"" isk from thin air, i'd say any kind of mechanic which allows you to get skillpoints with isk (aside character transfer) will just allow players to create more isk ""printing"" characters fast.and at the end it is difficult to imagine how all this would benefit any real newbie because they need to learn how to fly ships and stuff first. and shouldn't even have isk to buy more sp anyway. as a result this would only mean more advantage for bittervets who have too much isk.only thing i'd really want to ask is ccp promising publicly they will never ever allow sp trading. if we go that road, eventually developing character and paying subs becomes pretty ****ing pointless."
7/9/2011,"'i have basiclly 0 sp and i am happy flying rifter and you all must enjoy what i like! otherwise you r playing the game wrong!'oh not again please! don't get so proud because you know some 'game mechanic' in your world.you are free to have good time forever in your rifter. other have the same freedom to like flying something bigger and it is totally ok whether you understand or not. they have the freedom to fly titan once they paid enough subs and without any knowledge about it, they also have the freedom of turning their titans into space dust on their first flight for not knowing how to operate them. it is their game experience and their own business. and it is not possible this can harm you in any way. i know you are worrying about noobs print as much isk as you do so you have to trade fair and no more cheap plex for you, but this will never happen and you know why if you really understand anything about the 'game mechanic'.there won't be 'no sp trade promise' because it is already happening. don't tell me they bought those character because they falled in love with them. the plan is just a better way to do it."
7/9/2011,not supported.
7/9/2011,how about...... no?
7/9/2011,"sorry. no.you seem to have put more thought into this than the average impatient give me sp now because i wanna fly bigger ships guy. but still, no.good points against: having both isk buyable and sp transferrable is just going to increase character sales. if you can do it, then so can somebody in china and sell a character to you.adding a mechanism to encourage more noobs to join, then use as a justification that more noobs means more of them to shoot and kill. hmm, i think that being shot and killed has a lot more negative effect on someone's desire to continue playing than having to wait to train what skills matter to them.'broken game' how do you figure? because it doesn't have as many players as wow etc? in 2008, eve had 250,000 accounts, now there are over 330,000 that's positive growth. i'd like to think that eve has gamers that are into different things. it's not meant as a mmo for the masses. and as such, i see no problem with the current player base size."
7/9/2011,"no way. one person could game this so that multiple characters are training skills with the intent to sell them all to one character, you are essentially buying skill points with isk. if i have 8 characters, they could all exist for the purpose of 7 of them selling their sp to one. one character could train skills faster than the game design intended, not supported.furthermore, since they are all my characters, i don't even lose money! i just shuffle it around between characters. this was not well thought out, or perhaps that is intentional."
7/9/2011,"recently i found myself with a ninja looter, and frankly i could care less about that, keeps boring missions interesting and half the time i let them have the loot, there's always more loot to be had. in this case the guy nabbed from a can and went red blinky. ok fun time. so i run off and get a crow to come back to play.so i locked up his vigil and before ya know it, in warps an orca and the guy switches ships to a loki. long story short, one dead crow, big whoop, i can make back 12 mil isk in my sleep.what irks me is that the guy is able to escape the consequences of actions with an alt in an orca. suppose he was getting his ship beat up. looking at the guy's profile, chances are he'd have swapped out to his pod and been free of consequences. (this was high sec btw).needing an alt to cheat the challenges of single account play is cheap as it is, but the advantage of being able to escape consequences and play this sort of bait and switch game should be examined.i propose that one can not swap ships at a ship hangar while under aggro.p.s. don't give me your ""cry moar"" crap, this is not a complaint, i enjoyed the fight, so to those sorts, have a sincere preemptive ""psis off"""
7/9/2011,yep nerf lokis
7/9/2011,while i do like your ideaits has some problems. like playing in wh or 0.0 space where people are dependant of such tactics.so if you could find a way (discribe) how this would be inplemented without screwing over other players i would love to read it.
7/9/2011,"where do we define getting ""screwed over"" stops or starts? if you could be more explicit that would be helpful. what i propose is if you're getting red boxed, you should not be able to swap ships. maybe make it dependent on a warp scram being part of the deal or not. under pos shields it should not apply, that's like docking in a station. besides no one is going to chase someone to a gun covered pos.edit: sure you can eject and swap ships, but at least the price is paid for the swap."
7/9/2011,"not being able to swap ships -- wherever it occurs -- just goes totally against the spirit of eve. besides, soon as you saw the orca warp in, you could have warped out. your e-peen prevented that, and you wound up dead. no need to change the game for that, though.not supported; 'working as intended.'"
7/9/2011,feel free to refer to the p.s. in the first post
7/9/2011,"read it, ignored it: saying you're not complaining, whilst complaining, is just a childish, manipulative trick.htfu."
7/9/2011,refer to p.s.
7/9/2011,adapt or die you have chosen death congrats now while he was switching to that loki you had ample time to gtfo and save yourself but you decide to stay and quench your carebear blood-lust and you where stupid enough to shoot a ninja in the first place so whos fault is it that you died.as i said adapt or die (please choose die some more these tears are funny)
7/9/2011,"oh look, some one trying to be original. **** off loser."
7/9/2011,you sound mad are you mad or do you know everything i said is the truth and you have come unstuck you could of gtfo but you decided to fight die and then cry.now you have proven to be so much fun im not going anywhere <3
7/9/2011,"be my guest, we can get down into it. oh btw, post with yuor main, or are you chicken ****?"
7/9/2011,arr yes your mad and i guess this is your main then well i goto say dear chapwho ever posts with there mains these days that would be stupid on my part letting you know whos coming thats like giving you the cake and letting you eat it too oh nono that wont do at all.ps. <3
7/9/2011,"so chicken ****, thanks for proving who's the carebear ya big baby."
7/9/2011,"yup, that's pretty much what happened. he had ample time to make himself scarce. other guy warped in with his orca, had to board his loki, turn on his mods, target... in other words, op had plenty of time to gtfo. he didn't, because he thought he could take him -- the epeen thingy.and then he starts a rather transparent post, saying he doesn't want to complain, only to complain after all. op should just make a note to himself: ""next time bigger fish comes in, just leave.""you know, i usually defend the carebear side, being one myself; but this was just player stupidity, plain and simple."
7/9/2011,"were you there? nope. just being a troll attempting to derail.ccp likes people to commit to fights, this is just a cheap way out. so go whine and bleat your cry more bull **** to someone who gives a ****"
7/9/2011,"that ""carebear"" would be you you dont seem to understand the true nature of eve while it even blessed you with a small window to gtfoyou also dont seem to understand that im not going to make your life easy and give you free intel that wouldn't be in the spirit of eve would it.and you now insult me and call me a coward i do say old bean for a 05 char i expected a little better ohh yesnow please cry more a representative will be with you shortlyas ever <3"
7/9/2011,post with yuor main *****
7/9/2011,you sir seem to give a lot more than a (such foul language you should be ashamed of yourself) otherwise why are you still here crying hopeing for a reassuring shoulder to come along and comfort you.but it will never come dear chap for this is eve not wow you had your chance and you blew it.
7/9/2011,as i said easy intel easy intel is this going through or would you be in need of visual aids.also i believe you where trying to call me a homosexual so i must kindly inform you that there are two gs in that wordall my love my dearest.
7/9/2011,"rofl, i don't feel the need to treat a wimp with much respect, if you don't like it, too ****ing bad.and if you think i am actually upset, you're not very bright. but thanks for helping me keep the thread up top."
7/9/2011,"arr calling me a wimp i believe this is called projecting you are taking your own inadequateness and ""projecting"" them upon me it seems to me old chap you are the one who dosnt like it as your behaviour and language seem to reinforce this as i see no other reason to ""cry"" like this.i do not think your upset as you have demonstrated through your foul tongue and sobbing i know your upset and i seem to be a lot brighter than you if i must say so myself but dont worry i want this thread to be at the top so hopefully someone will help you in a very ""evely"" way.as ever my love"
7/9/2011,"nothing more amusing... get can flipped well in 4x hulk 2x retriever 1x orca fleet, orca ejects a ceptor and a huggin which the 2 retriever pilots jump into, thats one dead canflipper"
7/9/2011,"that's quite different from being red boxed and swapping ships. what you describe is very legitimate imo. getting a ""get out of fight free"" card is the issue."
7/9/2011,but my dear these are one in the same you cannot allow one but scorn the other.
7/9/2011,whatever troll boy
7/9/2011,they are not the same troll boy. if you weren't trying so hard to defend the tactic you'd know better. it's plain that you've a lot invested in this cheap little trick.
7/9/2011,"im afraid my dear this ""cheap little trick"" as you put it is nothing compared to the grandeur of eve but none of less it is in keeping with the spirit of eve and im all for keeping eve in spirit.and troll boy what a lovely little nickname my love i will love you forever too."
7/9/2011,"yeah, the spirit of committing to fights and not having an easy way out."
7/9/2011,my darling ill ask you have you ever been in a large fight in nullsec or even a small fight in highsec finding the easy path is what eve is all about everyone wants to get on that road take this scinario for you aye theres a solo ratting carrier how would you kill it would you a tank the hard approach that shows off your e-peen/e-honour and use sub caps but make life much harder for yourself orb drop several dozen moms on it and rip it to sunder do choose a or b and im afraid choosing neither is invalid
7/9/2011,"not going to play the hypothetical dilemma game. find someone who cares about protecting the get out of fight free card orca trick, you'll get more sympathy."
7/9/2011,"arr you choose not to answer how sweet you seem to care quite a lot otherwise why els would you still be here as ive said eve isnt a nice place and the evey thing to do is use that gtfo free card but due to your own bloodlust you chose not to and you died to a better eve player but you come here and cry then you insult and use foul language because your warped e-honour makes you think that a ""get out of jail free card"" goes against the spirit of eve.i hope one day you will learn the true spirit of eve and start using your own ""dirty tricks"" instead of crying about loosing"
7/9/2011,"awww, poor baby, i didn't go for your hypothetical crap. you keep on defending the cheap trick though with the ""cry more"" business, do that gankbear stereotype proud.you want to maintain a tactic that allows you to wimp out, like not posting with your main. i'll let that speak for it self."
7/9/2011,you still dont understand even though its been explained to you a dozen times my dear im afraid you are beyond hope
7/9/2011,"going to need to do better than that, try again."
7/9/2011,"local is the whole reason for afking. it is the tool they are trying to subvert, when they leave the keyboard. it only goes to show, just how reliant you have become on it's use.while the guy is afk, what exactly does he do to you?"
7/9/2011,irony goon csm posts about cloaking...
7/9/2011,"to my knowledge there's no pvpbots yet. so when afk cloakers are indeed afk they don't do anything. so basically they are just logged in and doing nothing. how is this any different from being afk in a station in the end? apart from you not knowing exactly where they are, and them using a high slot for a cloak.also local."
7/9/2011,no. but thanks for trolling.
7/9/2011,you're very welcome. i just thought that you needed another excuse to support and bump your own thread again.
7/9/2011,you act like bumping is a bad thing.
7/9/2011,"i had industry and mining @ level 1 as default, when i created this char so i too support this."
7/9/2011,i'm really not seeing the need. plus who wants to buy pricy skills again when they later change their minds?
7/9/2011,"has ccp laid off staff? i have had a missing items petition in for over 24 hours and no apparent attention paid to it. i just had another set of items disappear and, again no response from ccp. this is not the kind of service that i am used to with ccp. are other players having these sorts of problems?"
7/9/2011,how does this relate to the csm?
7/9/2011,"i've had petitions unanswered for 24 days now, so i really think you've nothing to complain about."
7/9/2011,"this relates to csm insofar as csm are our advocates with ccp. as to waiting 24 days for a petition answer, you should be highly dissatisfied."
7/9/2011,it's actually 24 days since the last gm message to established petitions that i keep adding new problems too (the oldest unacknowledged addition being a fraction less than 24 days ago). that's what happens when you limit a player to two petitions max... :-(
7/9/2011,"this topic is to enhance player base dialog to csm/ccp about multiple-monitor compatibility fixes that i've found are needed or desired after the introduction of true multiple monitor support since incursion patch.needed (hard to run muli-mon without these fixed):allow players to move the login page so it is not split over a screen bezelallow players to move the character-creation / editing screen so it isn't split over a screen bezeldesired (can do without, but would greatly enhance game play and visual appeal for multi-mon):allow resize of the main game 'space view' window, so as to allow 1 screen to contain only space and the other (1+) screens to allow no space-view and only dialog / menu panes.allow resizing / better docking control of windows. currently most windows are dockable / sizable, but others are not easily moved to allow for control between screen bezels (results in less seamless multi-mon viewability)i know i'm not the only long-term player in the community that would like these revisions done and i'd say in my opinion, it would be nice to see these attended to before further incarna 'features' are brought onboard. carbon ui is great, but it is fairly useless to me with a dual-screen client when everything is split over the bezel."
7/9/2011,"i suggested in my own (abeit now burried assembly hall thread) pretty much what you're suggesting. obviously i'm going to give my support.i know my idea still means you end up getting a new photo every now and then, but it sure as hell beats needing a new one every single time you change anything.edit: shameless self promotion - any support to my own thread is also appreciated (it's more about changes to the nex store than it is about the character creator)."
7/9/2011,"the thing that makes botting possible, is gameplay that doesn't require an actual brain. trying to defend against the problem by keeping the client complicated and private is a massive massive exercise in fail. mining, ratting, missioning are so simplistic with the right ship set up that 90% of it can be performed, not with a dedicated client hack or macro, but a simple keyboard mouse recorder repeating a sequence of actions. people talk about afk missioning as a matter of routine strategy - thats how dumb the game play is in places. really if ccp spent time on making pve game play interesting and having thought requirement, then botting would not be an economically viable strategy. as is stands ccp is far too concerned with incarna, and what little time they spend on spaceships is focussed into pvp and 0.0, that it seems that the defacto model of making isk requires sitting at the computer occasionally pushing buttons, but not, apparently, using your brain, and is allowed to be as afk as you like (so long as you don't use a client hack/macro). the op's suggestion is good, it would lead to a vibrant community of people who could fix ui issues far quicker than ccp's ever so slow snail crawl toward usability. crap gameplay would be quickly identified because you'd see client side mods that highlighted which *tasks* are exploitable by automata. it would be fantastic to be able to download plugins, to replace bits (e.g. overview, hud, market window) with your own. edited to +1 (but only with ccp prepared to put effort in as above)"
7/9/2011,"i think your idea is good, cloora, but i wouldn't go as far as to have concord at gates, just more and better sentry guns. gate camping would still be feasible, only now it should require campers to devote far more resources to their camps, hopefully making them much rarer and more easily spotted on the system map.ideally, it would make high-sec dwellers feel a little safer when venturing into low-sec, perhaps to the point where many would start feeling comfortable ratting or mission running, and, perhaps - dare i dream! - even mining! mmm... juicy miners.essentially, i think, we need to give the 'bears the feeling that they have a chance at surviving in low-sec. once they can travel around without the fear of gatecamps, we'll see them lower their guard. perhaps we can even make belt piracy viable again? we'll need to improve the spawns though."

7/9/2011,"when i was secretary of the csm, meeting minutes making used to be:- take notes during the meeting (was a really really tough job, taking notes and participating in discussions was difficult)- secretary comes back from iceland, puts notes into something that resembles english.- secretary sends notes to ccp, ccp edits, sends back to csm.- csm checks that everything is ok, tells ccp to publish them.after a couple of snafus during csm 5, the revision and back & forth process between csm & ccp has been extended so everyone is happy about what has been said because mischaracterization of ccp's stance on some things occured.in csm 6, we now have the video/audio recording of the sessions made available to make the minutes so the secretary doesn't have to take notes during the meeting (that's a good thing). but it also means said secretary has to spend an additional time listening to it all again and then doing back & forth and all that.i'll poke robert about it and direct him here so he can comment, but as always, it's a learning process and the next ones should go faster."
7/9/2011,"it's not about spinning.the way the meetings are held and the conversations we have with the devs take place in a manner that is not appropriate for public consumption. when we tell ccp they are <insert expletive here> for doing this or that, it takes place within a certain context and an understanding of what is meant.the conversations are also back & forth where people express stances in strong words, play devil's advocate, go to extremes, reach consensus, etc. the community as a whole (as opposed to individuals within that community) has always displayed a very strong ability to take things out of context and, yes, spin it.so these conversations have to be edited to present the arguments made from both sides and the conclusions reached. not provide more venues for people to read what they want to read into what people say.about the nda. it allows us to comment on things ccp do before they do it. like provide feedback on the most recent marketing campaign, have constructive discussions about possibly unpopular upcoming changes (try to have that on a forum). it also gives ccp the ability to change plans (when they chose to do so) when facing a strongly negative reaction from us without having to go through threadnaughts about things they're changing based on our feedback anyway."
7/9/2011,"the current status of minutes:may: done, awaiting final ccp comments. this has pretty much been the status for the last two weeks. if they are not out next week, i would be surprised.peace conference: in preparation; first drafts of day 1 have been completed."
7/10/2011,"thanks everyone, i also like option 2.option 1 can be done very easily and should be reinstated asap, hopefully with plans to incorporate option 2 within the near future."
7/10/2011,this blatant exploit has gone on long enough. players should not be allowed to have a tactical advantage while afk at any point. this defines exploit. everyone knows it is a problem. it has been for a very long time. why has nothing been done?what is being done about this frustrating problem?
7/10/2011,htfu
7/10/2011,"what blatant exploit? i see no blatant exploit.no, this defines exploit.i see no problem here but your inability to adapt.because it isn't a problem.making fun of you, for starters. then another thread complaining that ""afk lol cloakers are ruining my bots"" will appear again next week and we'll make fun of that person as well. lovely cyclical posting."
7/10/2011,"it is tragic that i have to spell this out for you. an enemy's presence in a system causes numerous problems for locals. in general, people will not do anything outside sit in a pvp fleet when neutrals or reds, even just one, is present in a system. this means no isk generating of any kind, including mining and ratting without significant risk. complexes are out of the question for fear that the enemy happens to have probing capabilities. even well tanked ships are potentially at risk because we don't know if the enemy has a cyno. so their mere presence can halt isk production in a system. here comes the exploit: they can have this major tactical ability without even being near their computer. just leaving your character logged in and cloaked while you're at work is exploitation of game mechanics when it can so drastically affect so many people. explain what counter measures you can employ against this."
7/10/2011,so go ****ing carebear in the system next door.
7/10/2011,you are utterly missing the point.
7/10/2011,"the point is simple, if you log into the system, the afk cloaker is there when you log in, you have to decide to take a risk to mine or rat inside that system and you don't know that he is afk. just because he has been there all day doesn't mean that he is afk. therefore in order to keep your industry level stable you have to continue to mine in the system. to keep your military level stable you have to rat in the system. it disrupts the production of ships for cta's and other wars. it directly affects the wallets of those in the system. the presence of the afk cloak lowers the ability to do this activity with zero risk to the cloaker. if the person is there at the computer then hey great its a part of the game. how ever if the person is afk he is gaining a tactical advantage and causing damage to the owners of that systems wallets with zero risk while not being at his computer. this is what we are asking to be fixed not the fact that somebody jumps in system cloaks up and disrupts the system. but the fact that they can walk away from there computer and not play and accomplish the same thing is what needs to be fixed. i have no issues with them pulling the tactic to disrupt operations and cost me and my alliance money but they need to play the game to do so not be able to walk away and go to work or school."
7/10/2011,no one said 0.0 was safe.
7/10/2011,nobody is implying it is.
7/10/2011,i believe it is you who is missing the point.the point that you are poster number 10032473982723 who says the ****ing thing every damn time and everyone else including ccp says the exact same thing.shut up....go away...and adapt or die.this is eve online...you will never....ever...get your wish.grow up...grow a pair...and get used to it.people who are cloaked can't do a damn thing except sit there... its a mind game... and obviously they won since your rage posting.so just keep trolling away...because that's all your doing.
7/10/2011,it shouldn't surprise me that you are too thick to see the issue with this.this statement is so ****ing stupid i can't even decide how to respond.
7/10/2011,"just allow them to be probed.- active vanilla cloak reduces signature in half, fill lowslots and implant slots with eccm to remain gay.- active cloak on ship with bonuses reduces it by 75%. leaves coverts, recons and bo technically still undetectable as intended.- all other stuff as is (cycle times, invisibility, recalibration, etc.).huge nerf to lol-solo capitals which shouldn't be possible anyway so bonus!huge nerf to cloaky ratters so double bonus!"
7/10/2011,"maybe you wouldn't be afraid of 'afk cloakies' if you were not afking in your space. employ a combat air patrol while you mine. have a player constantly watching the overview and scanning as you go about your business. swap players in and out of this as the tedium eventually leads to lapses in concentration. have your own cloaked ships standing by nearby so a cloaked attacker never knows exactly what he faces. etc, etc.my point being there are ways to considerably reduce the risk you face. having to do these things is the price you pay for being inside unsecured space. adapt or die."
7/10/2011,sure....says the alt toon whose too blinded by rage to see past his immaturity.fear the almighty cloaker...who sits in your system making you yell at silence.just keep crying those tears.
7/10/2011,"because whenever someone mentions to just fix that problem and remove local, a gazillion of carebears like you moan about not being able to farm 110% safely anymore.an even more simple solution would be people like you just leaving nullsec, you obviously do not belong there."
7/10/2011,do they now? i didn't know it was a problem for the intelligent and organised player.
7/10/2011,"such mobilization is absurd. why not also have a supercap fleet waiting on standby while you rat too? it is equally ridiculous, considering the effort exerted by the enemy: none. all this just because some dip****, at precisely zero risk to himself, is somehow allowed to continuously apply tactical pressure while he isn't even present at the keyboard. your character should not have an impact on other players while you are absent from your computer. your character should not profit while you are not playing the game; the same reason botting isn't allowed. why is this such a difficult concept for some of you?"
7/10/2011,"it's called using your head... tactically speaking.... amongst other reasons (feel free to use your imagination ladies and gentlemen)you don't need a supercap fleet....just a modest simple pvp fleet of 5 to 8 ships ready to go at a moments notice.... and you keep on your guard and keep your eyes open.if you want to mine in perfect peace and harmony with the carebear gods then go to high sec and stfu.... because everyone already knows this and we all have done it... hell go to whs. no local means you won't know anyway!obviously you haven't... that's for sure.i've been on the receiving end and the giving end of afk cloaking.... its not that big of a bloody deal that you make it out to be.your just crying like a baby because you don't like getting atstop whining... and stop being lazy.answering everyone's arguments with ""you don't understand"", ""your dumb"" isn't going to help either."
7/10/2011,"and the problem is what exactly? the neutral entering system does face exactly the same dilemma, he doesnt know if the people in station are present at the keyboard or not, or if they even are in station or cloaked up somewhere.these people continually apply tactical pressure without being at the keyboard, at precisely zero risk to themselves. i'm afraid your logic does fall flat on its face, too bad."
7/10/2011,"keep crying and failing to adapt (in ways that are not even very hard to manage), or stop whinging and be proactive. the choice is yours. i wish you'd gone with the later myself (if only to get you to shut up), but of well..."
7/10/2011,you made a categorically stupid statement. sorry that bothers you.
7/10/2011,ok...
7/10/2011,"this is the first counter argument in this thread that actually makes some sense. the difference, however, is that the 'blues' in the system have sovereignty. they are there because it is the space they've earned. they aren't afk because it provides a tactical pvp advantage, nor are they specifically afk to put pvp pressure on opponents."
7/10/2011,"because mobilizing a fleet of multiple players just so a single player can do some ratting is a simple and easy solution. especially when the enemy has been cloaked in a system all day and, for all you know, will remain afk till dt. ""hey guys, i feel like making a little isk, how about you all spend the next couple hours sitting in a fleet one system over and doing nothing else, just in case this guy stops being afk. thanks."""
7/10/2011,"if they intend to put tactical pressure on neutrals or not is not important, fact is they do. the same applies to the cloaker, it might not even be his intention.for example, i used to ninja-npc to get my sec status fixed. did this in a populated system, and locals obviously complained. i didnt mean to disrupt their activity at all, it was just them being too chicken to undock with a single neutral in system. the cloak was necessary to be safe in very hostile space.fact is, the problem is not the cloaked neutral being afk, or the docked blues being afk. the problem is they all show up in the local chat.local needs to be removed, and this whole problem goes away. since ccp appears to be on this same page as well, we'll have our solution at some point, hopefully soon."
7/10/2011,"so adapt. group up. work together. start being proactive. there's no reason you can't make a profit while minimising risk. or perhaps you just prefer whinging...seriously - if you're unable to cope with a lone cloaked ship in system, you need to move back to highsec. because you clearly don't have the organisational ability necessary to survive in less secure space.alternatively advise me where your system is, and i'll fly my stealth bomber on over and park it there a couple weeks :-d"
7/10/2011,"if it was just a lone cloaked ship i had to worry about, it would not be a problem for me. the problem is whether or not they have a cyno equipped."
7/10/2011,you don`t seem to understand. 0.0 is supposed to be worthless and cause endless streams of tears from foolish people who hold it. until you wise up and move to npc space you will keep suffering from this wonderful mechanic.
7/10/2011,"yumyum, delicious tears!"
7/10/2011,"if he has a cyno, surely he needs to be active to use it. plus, many cyno situations can be negated with a jammer.the thing is, your problem isn't cloaks, but local intel channel. you're misreading the instant intel it's giving you and making bad judgements based on your misreading.without a change to local, cloaks should remain as they are now."
7/10/2011,"yup, another ""i don't leik cloaks becuz i cannot figure demz out, why this game no easy like wow waa waa waa"" thread reaches its climax.see you all at the next one o/"
7/10/2011,what precisely do i not 'get' about cloaking mechanics?
7/10/2011,everything? that's it's no exploit and you're the one failing? :-d
7/10/2011,wrong. try again.
7/10/2011,"the problem isn't the afk cloaker, he can't do anything to you. the problem is local telling you he is there at all."
7/10/2011,"val, they don't want to hear facts, they simply want risk free pve.inb4 ""but there's no risk in cloaking and going afk for hours"" answering with yes, when cloaked everyone is safe until the cloak is deactivated, then everyone is at risk. but without local, afking is pointless as a psychological weapon."
7/10/2011,the carebear infection is spreading... even ccp has it now.
7/10/2011,"i kind of agree although there is a small chance things may get better, but i'm not holding my breath.edit: just in case you didn't know, that can be found in the dev answers thread here."
7/10/2011,they'll keep crying and whinging unless they feel 100% safe. how are they failing so epically to get that low and null sec is not supposed to be safe? :-d
7/10/2011,"it's cute that you ***gots continuously repeat this, but nobody in this thread has implied that nullsec is supposed to be safe."
7/10/2011,because covops don't exist.
7/10/2011,"to be understood, you should at least make a coherent post that makes sense. then people will understand what you are talking about.you may as well have just replied ""purple monkey socks"" tbh."
7/10/2011,i can think of 3:* htfu;* use d-scan to see if they have probes out;* remove local; fixed. :)
7/10/2011,"for all the fear there is of afk cloakers......i really can't see why people fear them. yes they have a tactical advantage with zero risk being unable to be scanned. but the fact is, you shouldn't be working in lowsec/nullsec without protection anyways.if you see five people in local and can't find any of them, yeah they may be afk but you'd still be holed up because they may be a gang waiting on you.if you see one person in local and can't find them, grab a buddy to watch your back. or five. hell, have two of them use battleships to mine - the guy, if an active enemy, won't actually know what you have equipped and will leave you alone.point is: sorry, afk cloaking causes stress but it's not like they are an invincible hammer of doom waiting to smash on you. local behaves this way for a reason - you can guess what kind of threat there is just by the number of people. it's also a tactical move by enemies: we'll post five or six alts in an enemy industrial system sometimes just to make them think we have unscannable tengus waiting to hit them. they've done the same to us i'm sure.as will all things low and nullsec - buddy system you numbskull - if you're afraid or unsure, bring friends! if local explodes in a frenzy of people, gtfo and hole up, local is nice like that. you people make this a bigger problem than it really is. can you imagine what wh would be like if it had a local? nobody would go out there hardly if they all thought like you! if you're trying to help out your corp/alliance on off hours and solo, welcome to the world of low/null: it's not safe, don't solo it if you're afraid to lose it. rule #1 of eve - don't fly what you can't afford to lose."
7/10/2011,"um i think a lot of people are missing the point. its not that the afk cloaker can do something or not, its because you dont know if he is afk and it makes a huge difference if he is afk. there are lots of things a cloaky can do to you.nobody should have unkillable and un-findable status for days on end without ever needing to leave a system. they are invincible, you cant do **** against them, thats the whole point. and they can keep on being invincible forever and just be a pain in the ass forever and there isnt **** you can do against them...did i say that already?im sorry but having some guy sit in a system for weeks on end, even forever without anyone being able to find him is ****ed up, period. if you guys cannot see how wrong that is, get a ****in lobotomy."
7/10/2011,"well, yes, as things are bound to show up on the market.& i want those ship skins once they come out, getting plexes...what the hell is so bad about mts?if you don't want to spend real money for a in world currency, boohoo grow a pair and wait till someone sells them on the market for 1billion or more.its not like the nex store axe murdered your family and childrensure ccp lied to you, but people and so corporations change, like you never broke a promise.""oh they're greedy, they're hunting for our money, we saw so in the leaked bulletin"" - yeah real mature, ccp does one greedy action, maybe more, and thats enough for hundreds if not thousands of people to unsubscribe? sometimes... i think eve is filled with 13 year olds who got a hold of their parents credit cards and their parents won't allow the purchase of 6 plexesalso micro transactions were always in the game, plexes, you pay for a item in game which can be sold for isk.why are you making such a big deal out of something that already exists? they just expanded it"
7/10/2011,"i'd settle for the old hanger being returned simply because it was highly functional, and ran fast."
7/10/2011,supported
7/10/2011,"i would be also happy with a modified (non- navigatable) model of the ship hanger from the view from the cq. i know many here are adamant on the old ship spin, but i personally would be okay with the cq view with no character model, overlooking the hanger. i personally like the sense of scale of the ships is the cq perspective better.anything is better than the 'door'"
7/10/2011,"*ponder*meh, i wouldn't mind this. it is a bit of a pain to use a jump clone to not risk my implants...*however* i would like it if there were boosts that lasted an entire year so i didn't have to worry about it that often."
7/10/2011,"i like this. i think the barriers the op describes are real, so i'm giving it a +1. however there are alternative changes that would give the same effect. including reducing the price of attribute implants, so that say a +5 is the same price as a current +4removing just +5s from the gamelimiting the legality of implants by sec statusallowing more flexible (balanced) clone jumping (presumably extra jumps per 24hrs for a fee or invalidating your medical clone)"
7/10/2011,"interesting... but how exactly would you 'reduce' the price on something in a completely market driven economy?either it was on oversight, or you misunderstood how prices of things are determined in eve."
7/10/2011,"while i am very interested in where this discussion is going to end up, i am skeptical. the unsaid 'con' of this proposal is that although people would pvp more, each pvp win/loss would be worth less, therefore dulling an otherwise exhilarating (or painful) experience, to something about the excitement level of a chess game. nothing wagered, nothing won, means less of an experience in general. personally, if i blow up an enemy, the experience is made sweet in me knowing that he lost a lot of isk in implants. now if implants were cheap or free, or insured, then that takes a lot of the fun out of the kill.how do you propose to mitigate that side effect?"
7/10/2011,"the side effect will be mitigated by the fact that alot more people will see the use of pirate implants in slot 1-5, especially the low grade ones that are very cost effective for their bonus. what stops alot of people from using them today is the weak +2 attribute bonus."
7/10/2011,if these are so cost effective (i read as meaning cheap) then how exactly does that give me the satisfaction that i just wasted $$$ of my enemies isk?
7/10/2011,"cost effective != cheap. it means that they give a good bonus to your ships considering their price. if you want to feel satisfaction about podding someone you will probably do that more believing someone had pirate implants.this idea is not perfect since i'm not a person working with game balance but as you can see in the thread people like what the idea stands for. character progression is the core of any mmorpg, and the fact that the people experiencing combat and/or explore the world should be penalized is in my oppinion wrong. in eve it's contraproductive to do things that would yeild you more experience in any other game. it seems like you have made it your personal crusade to keep talking down this thread. i'm all open for suggestions on how to improve the concept, but when you just keep trying to grasp at straws to talk it down, please just keep out."
7/10/2011,that should have been done 3 years ago
7/10/2011,/emote supports this!
7/10/2011,"i would humbly suggest that in order to make this vote statistically significant, we need control cases, which is a similar vote to buff say, caldari, amarr, and minmatar ships. just speaking from a scientific point of view :)"
7/10/2011,"i'm having serious doubts about ccp actualy using this forum. i got a feeling they have very special one - their own - very internal. one where only ccp can post and praise and reasure themselves. this one was made for us capsulers to allow us to blow off some steam and live on thinking ccp actualy responds to our opinions. steam gone... for the sake of this post let's assume half of your customers likes cq and the other half don't. i realise it is impossible to please everyone, but doesn't it make sense to at least aim in 100% customers being satisfied? in this case it's very simple - add an ""old hangar"" option for the half that doesn't like cq and not some crappy looking ""door"". why don't you say : hey we have made a mistake treating you in this manner. let us fix it for you capsulers. instead you are trying to convince cq good for us. that's just insulting. how would you feel if half of your customers cancelled their subscriptions? steam gone again...lastly - i fully support the idea of choice in the game. choice is the thing which makes eve a special game. choice makes eve a very personal experience to each one of us. limiting choice will eventualy make it linear. sidescrollers are linear please bring old hangars back - as a default or an option. do not try to improve what doesn't need any improvements. best regards to all eve players"
7/10/2011,"consider yourself extremely blessed to have my seal of approval. i was actually working on something similar and talking it over with some alliance mates. so either this idea of yours is totally coincidence, or you stole it from me. considering how close it is to my idea except a few changes i would say you stole it.in the spirit of not having multiple threads on the same thing i will simply thumbs this one up and walk away like a gentleman.fair warning to you though. if you steal an idea from me again, i will hunt you down and destroy everything you own. you will not have a ship to spin or a two modules to rub together. i will crush you. crystal clear on that?that's what i thought thief."
7/10/2011,"pretty sure that is gonna be pretty damn difficult to implement, if even possible at all without major changes to how ewar modules are applied to targets.i like the idea, its a pretty creative approach to the supercarrier problem and also gives at least some kind of purpose to eafs, but its not gonna fly unfortunately."
7/10/2011,the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible.  arthur c. clarke
7/10/2011,"thats a nice quote, but besides the point. it isnt about impossible or possible, it is about developer resources and feasibility."
7/10/2011,can't stop the signal.
7/10/2011,"obviously for this to make any sense the effects would have to work on regular carriers, titans and triage carriers aswell.the concept of jamming the ship controlling the drones, and thereby jamming the drones makes sense to some extend, but fighters are iirc sposed to be manned.even though the suggestion might help with some much needed ballance on the supercapital warfront, i - personally - would like to see a more logical solution.afterall, if jamming the mothership (meaning the ship controling the drones/fighters) results in potential jam on the drones, every ship with a dronebay ought to be affected.the way i see it, one of the points of an external weaponsystem, such as drones/fighters, is to avoid this.in the same regard i feel the suggestion that limiting scs to only carrying fighters and fighter bombers is illogical, it is supposed to be the biggest, baddest drone carrier out there, why shouldn't it be able to launch the most basic light scout drones?i feel that the main problem with scs, and titans (tracking bs like inties track cruisers aside) for that matter, is the sheer numbers. i would like to see an increase in vulnarabilty (ehp/slot nerf/slave compatability) before changing the mechanics that, from a logical standpoint, should affect almost every ship in the game.--that said; eafs do need love, and supercaps do need a severe battering with the nerfhammer, but i must say i don't think this ""two flies with one swat"" solution, however elegant, is the way to go about it.--gah, hope i ended up making sense :p/smurf"
7/10/2011,"unless you go free to play, content should be accessible to everyone who pays a subscription."
7/10/2011,get rid if them (or allow us to blow them up)
7/10/2011,#NAME?
7/10/2011,one of twenty things that is screwed up about industry
7/10/2011,i disagree. eve should involve you taking a risk on trusting somone.
7/10/2011,"i have about 10,000 or so bookmarks. on occasion, i need to reorganize them into folders due to a reinstall. every click-and-drag to move a set of bookmarks into a folder, however, takes several seconds. (if i try to open the folder as a separate window and drag the bookmarks to the folder window title bar, then it becomes horribly slow.)i suggest that ccp write a devblog about how bookmarks work internally and give some consideration to improving bookmarks.thank you in advance."
7/10/2011,i like the new turrets and the icons. incidentally you've implied one response with your topic and another with your questions in the thread. you're going to get people who do support the turrets not supporting the thread and people who don't support turrets supporting the thread.if you want clear answers then why make a thread worded this way?
7/10/2011,"i like them, but i also agree with others who suggested that they can have some color cues to make them racially distinguishable."
7/10/2011,you like icons that fail basic ui guidelines? which is which turret? please visit your user settings to re-enable images. :-d
7/10/2011,"come now, don't be mean. you asked in this thread, therefore everyone is entitled to their opinion. not fair to bait people to answer just to smear them with it.they could use some improvement yes, and until that happens, we will just have to read the names, yes, is it more of a pain... yes. but still no reason to advocate going backwards, instead of fixing them."
7/10/2011,"sorry, i'm being mean by posting pics like this: please visit your user settings to re-enable images. ?*blink* why would anyone defend ccp for changing from good icons to clearly awful ones? that isn't progress..."
7/10/2011,"i'm just saying that you should have made the subject of your thread ""fix the icons"" instead of trying to tease out people who like them just to berate them. that's just mean."
7/10/2011,"there is nothing wrong with turret iconsthey're awesome dark balls of mess so no one can tell what module they are activating, it's cool! now they're almost as bad as all other icons in game, just look how descriptive those ship icons are on your overview, you can immediately battleship!!!????"
7/10/2011,"the turret icons could use some work, they are rather hard to see (but that's due to their detail in such a small icon). not much you can do with this though - in time people will get used to them, just like the new icons for mwd's, blueprints, etc.the turrets themselves are great, which i don't think anyone disagrees with hardly. i personally wish t2 still had a distinctive look from the t1 turrets, but oh well."
7/10/2011,"upper is tractor beam, lower is salvager. if you can't see that you either need to tweak your monitor's color saturation or something, or go to an optician perhaps for a description and then head to specsavers."
7/10/2011,"i mean its not like every single other software company does manage to push out some kind of a roadmap. i don't see why ccp can't. to me it looks like they don't have one, the features we get are either adhoc on a devs whim, or part of the greater master plan (pi, incarna) of other games. some features are discussed and then silently dropped - the new neocon, bookmarks in overview, t3 frigs - are they on hold or permadeleted? should i retrain from galante because the hulls and guns suck and the drones are bugged, or are they going to address it in the next 12 months?in terms of expectation management, yeah some things don't arrive on time, everyone knows this - no doubt some people would rage, but they probably rage anyway. at least with a roadmap you can see what they are working on, even if its release point is a guestimate...supported"
7/10/2011,"supported. soe is releasing a 3 year roadmap for planetside 2...why can't ccp do that for eve? don't give specific release dates; at most give a rough guesstimate based on quarters. the roadmap could be published as a wiki type blog where things can be added, removed, modified, deleted, and time-frame goals changed as internal expectations change."
7/10/2011,can't have a roadmap if you already went off the cliff.
7/10/2011,"contradict yourself much?i think what has been sufficiently established is that there are proponents and opponents to this suggestion (just like to pretty much every other suggestion ever made, anywhere, about anything).in the end neither side will change their mind based on arguments of the opposing side.we will just have to wait and see whom reality proves right when ccp makes a decision how to deal with sp in the light of a diminishing eve user base. my money is on ... well ... money! at the end of the day ccp is a for-profit business and its decisions will be governed by what creates the most profit for the company. i have no doubts that selling sp in a controlled fashion will generate the most profit and those of you who will quit won't be missed."
7/10/2011,"listen to yourself! lol. yeah, sure - ccp will totally destroy a large part of mmos that keeps people coming back.""diminishing eve user base""??? lmfao - eve has done nothing but grow since day ****ing one :-dyou're so full of **** it's really quite remarkable. you won't even accept that there's a majority of players who don't support eve being ruined, that csm matters (because they won't stand for eve being ruined, so course they are utterly irrelevant to everyone in your deluded mind), and ccp who has repeatedly stated (most recently just a week ago) eve will not be ruined by game changing mt.you're so arrogant.you're so full of ****.you're so delusional.it's just ****ing sad at this point."
7/10/2011,"i bet you 1 plex that we are right, and you are delusionally wrong. :)"
7/10/2011,"i giggle every time somebody (and there always is somebody) shows just how little they know about the real world when they cite 'precedence' as 'justification' (ahem, i mean excuse).so we have black market knock offs of prada bags made in china already... so why not sell them enmasse in bloomingdale?so we have murderers and pickpockets in the world already! so why not make murder sanctioned, and do away with private property?just because you have some people who buy toons already, (akin to over-the-counter bespoke derivative contracts) why not have them securitized and traded on a electronic stock exchange! great idea. hey, the 2 are exactly the same!hey we have a leaky toilet, hey may as well knock out the pipes altogether and poop into a bucket!"
7/10/2011,"eve has grown over the years, but that growth stagnated in recent years as is clearly illustrated by the concurrent player count not surpassing the ""record"" set back in 2009. yes, 2009, that's two years ago. see: 51,675 pilots: 50k pcu barrier smashed since then eve sees upper 40k on a good day and often just in the upper 30k players online at any given time.now, we could believe what you are saying that the game is growing, or we could believe what i am saying that it's growth has halted. i have the concurrent player count to point to, what do you have?incidentally, another niche game managed to set the world record of concurrent players on a single server merely one year after the open beta of the game started. world of tanks recently topped out at 91k players online. see: world of tanks sets world record. that's just the number of players online at any one time, not the total number of customers.what keeps people in any game is the entertainment value the game provides. eve's entertainment value in comparison to other games is not nearly as strong as it once was when there were few other choices. this is especially true for totally new and younger (as in eve age) players.you can stomp your foot and pull your hair out all you want. the writing is on the wall and ccp knows it. the mmo industry has collectively embraced mt because it is profitable, much much more profitable than subscriptions. it's only a matter of time for eve to go f2p and sp being available for cash in some form or another."
7/10/2011,"not sure if serious.if you're that content on skipping the low-skillpoint phase of the game, buy a char.hell, you can even fund it via gtcs.problem solved."
7/10/2011,"your numbers are nice, but doesn't support your argument that there is a problem. so what if the numbers in eve are less than some other mmo? as long as ccp is still making money and those in the game are still enjoying the game, then is it really a bad thing to have less players? i'd like to think that (like my handbag analogy) eve is a luxury brand with quality customers and appeal to a (relatively) niche market of the greater gaming community. we don't care for, nor need the mass appeal of your run of the mill mainstream cash cow glitzy mmos. so unless you can show that this 'elitist' model of the game and its players is going to be end of it all, then i think that this line of argument isn't going to hold any water."
7/10/2011,"yes, stagnated growth is a bad thing.the goal of any business is consistent growth. it's not just a matter of making profit. it's a matter of profit maximization, making the most profit possible. that is what drives businesses, the market, and the economy. ccp is privately held so we don't exactly know how much pressure they are under to meet quarterly expectations but we can reasonably assume that eve profits paid for dust and some of wod development. in fact eve is the wod alpha/beta test when it comes to carbon.so to answer your question; no, just making profit is not enough, it never is.the reason for that is that there's opportunity cost. why commit your resources to a venture that makes less profit than a different venture could when utilizing the same resources?profit is essential, consistent growth is essential, especially in a market that isn't capped out yet. eve could easily have more users if minor changes in how it works were to be implemented."
7/10/2011,"it's people like you who think profit isn't enough, but constant high growth is needed, that has resulted in nearly all mmos becoming braindead casual games. not to mention the growth-all-costs-ideology damage to the real world.regardless, eve's subs have continued to grow since day one, and while it's not fast growth, it has been steady enough to increase the userbase and reach new max concurrent user levels every year, e.g. on january 23, 2011, a new record of 63,170 concurrent players was set"
7/10/2011,"you're all pretty far off track by now, mayby we should just /thread"
7/10/2011,yep.
7/10/2011,"indeed? then i'm going to presume that you either are telling a tall tale for the sake of argument; failed said econ 101 class; or have not played eve longer than 1 year. everyone who has lived in new eden longer than their trial account knows that when there is an exploit, there will be people to exploit it. look at jita, there are still constant scammers in local looking for easy marks. if you really think that people will be honorable mostly, just take a look at the bond market. (there isn't an in-game one... hmmm i wonder if that is significant?) and bonds have real worth. ie the funds that were deposited for debt. if these fail to find a 'market' in game, think about why, and then ask yourself why equities, which are basically worthless, might fair better.if you can't figure it out, then i will support this proposal. i would love an equity market based on fictitious prices that i can manipulate to make money off suckers! :) then i'll start a isk pyramid scheme while i'm at it!"
7/10/2011,"i dont think you read what i said at all. let me post it again. ""and if someone is clever enough to find a loop hole and exploit the system...more power to em."""
7/10/2011,"okay... i don't disagree with you on that one. but the issue then becomes, with so many existing flubs* in the game that need fixing like the fw system, the bounty system, do you really think it wise for ccp to push out another one? after all the threads about ""commitment to quality"" and ""stop rolling out crap"" directed at ccp in this and many forums? i think that sorta sums up this thread. good idea, no practical way to (yet) implement properly, let's wait and fix the core issues first. at least that is my take.*systems that aren't working as intended because people found ways around the mechanisms, breaking them, leaving them pretty much unused."
7/10/2011,"since character trade is already legal. i cannot figure why it becomes bad just because the seller is from china. what's the difference except your prejudice<U+FF1F>not to say that i am right, my opinion is that most noobs don't quit because they get killed--player in everygame get killed and lost something. they quit eve because they see no hope. 2 years before fly the ship they like and free to enjoy the game basiclly implys never in a game. and when they get killed, they found that there will be basically never a chance to revenge. then they really don't see the point to stay. sp from bazaar merchandise will be much cheaper so it is not necessary that he do so, it makes no difference whether the alts are his own or others. and others won't deliberately train alts to sell sp because they must pay more to ccp first and simply selling plex will give them more. anyway people are free to have alts now as long as they pay for them. in this case, they actually pay more for the same actual useable sp though.thank you 2 for seeing the different side and telling it. i will accept it honestly when you find some real flaw. refuting with logic is much much better than repeating the 'happy rifter' crap again and again which is really getting old and disgusting."
7/10/2011,"so you want to provide instant gratification and the ability for people to use alts as sp farms? you want to remove the need to plan, make choices and tradeoffs, and face consequences?i've had fun from day one in eve, and i still fly t1 ships most of the time. what, do you think you're suddenly going to be fulfilled, everything will be wonderful, all your problems will melt away, and you'll start having crazy fun, if only you can fly a very high level ship? ok...eve is what you make of it. it's a player run game in terms of most content. if you're not enjoying yourself now, having a fancy ship isn't going to change that.and making posts that ignore all the serious downsides of selling/trading sp isn't going to change eve."
7/10/2011,intradasting.
7/10/2011,"nor is making posts that ignore the one argument for it; namely, that eve may not really have that long any more. certainly not 8 years; 2 maybe. i therefore support any proposal that allows redistribution of sp that doesn't involve 'printing' sp out of thin air."
7/10/2011,"keep ignoring reality - i.e. that eve is growing and has been since day one, no one who matters supports ruining eve with sp trading/selling, and simple logic tells us removing progression destroys mmos.the delusion is powerful with these fools..."
7/10/2011,"alright, by your own logic, we should remove fleets aswell, because as any whiner knows, fleets are unfair because it makes it more then 1v1, and bringing in an orca to swap ships is the same as if he just swapped out with a buddy in a fleet by moving out of combat range.you really need to learn better, you had a window, and should have known your ship couldnt take it, its a legitamate tactic, shoulda either a) warped out, or b) called in a buddy to either rep or help you out with dps (though with your attitude, i doubt anyone would come). fact is, you did neither, you chose to die."
7/10/2011,"actually, i like the idea. just make it apply to high security only. it's like the 'old west' when two persons agreed to a personal duel know as a 'showdown' which the sheriff would let happen.global criminal countdowns such as shooting a neutral are handled by concord (sheriff) which is done very quickly. getting a personal criminal countdown (stealing) towards another player is asking for combat (showdown).if someone in high security transgresses a neutral player and get's criminally flagged for stealing, they should not be allowed to switch ships during the 15 minute timer. if the neutral player responds and initiates combat, they can not switch ships during that 15 minute timer.the reason is because the player made the decision to transgress a neutral while in that specific ship and was caught 'red' handed (so to speak) and is looking for a 'showdown'. if the neutral player shoots the transgressor, he too becomes locked out of switching ships in that 15 minute timer since he decided to participate in the 'showdown'. however, if the neutral player doesn't shoot or agress the transgressor, that neutral player can switch ships and then enter into the 'showdown'.both players can also run and hide (dock in station) after starting the 'showdown' if they desire.of course both players can also have their corp (gang) members jump in and do remote repair but they can't shoot unless shot at first. this could lead to some very interesting 'showdowns' happening. sorta like 'showdown at the ok corral'. it wouldn't take much to program this into the code mechanics and it wouldn't break the game. actually, i think it would make the game more balanced and also level the playing field.that's my 2 isk worth.dmcedit:adunh slavy, you can edit your original post and add this idea if you like it. also you can post support to this proposal when you post a reply.those that say - you made a choice, bla bla bla, this will break the game mechanics, bla bla bla, etc, are just trolling which i see happening a lot in this thread. just ignore them."
7/10/2011,"it is against the design philosophy of committing to a fight. if you can't tell the difference, then you're not as insightful as you pretend to be."
7/10/2011,"not being able to swap is a bad idea. you just need to be faster to catch him in his original non-threatening ship, and not stick around when another ship warps in."
7/10/2011,"they are attempting to defend the tactic because they use it. the ""cry more"" stuff, the ""carebear"" crap is one of the oldest games on eve forums. just the typical gankbear whine and attempt at intimidation.as for your idea, that sounds as though it may be more complicated that the current flagging system can handle. what i am proposing is quite simple. a player can not switch ships at a ship hangar while they are being red boxed. they can eject, deal with the session timer and then switch ships. but not a direct swap while being red boxed."
7/10/2011,"it's not about me being faster or slower. it's about someone getting a cheap way out of a fight, a way out that goes against a design philosophy that ccp has been promoting for years - having players commit to fights."
7/10/2011,so that excuses you not being smart enough to run away when the odds turn in the other player's favour? as if most can theft isn't a setup anyway :-d
7/10/2011,"i'm going to bookmark this thread on how a op can quickly lose all credibility with the public audience once he gets all riled up and caught up in personal attacks and irrelevant arguments.as for the actual proposal, i don't think this is a good idea. so somebody is aggro'ing me, that means i cannot jump out of my ship to change ships to come back to kill him? sounds like a birthday present for gankers and pirates to me."
7/10/2011,"good for you, just add another personal attack in there while you're at it. the proposal is that you can't swap ships into and out of the hangar array. you can eject, warp off and come back and get another ship once the session timer is up."
7/10/2011,"has nothing to do with me, it has to do with the commit to a fight design philosophy. sorry, but fail, try again."
7/10/2011,it certainly sounds like and behaves like an exploit. ccp just need to identify it as one.
7/10/2011,so you failed to see the situation change and get out? now you come on here complaining and then cry when others point out your failure?i like this thread already. carry on.
7/10/2011,"so not actually denying hangar swaps but rather maintenance array swaps?as long as it applies to high-sec only, i see no problem with it.clean up your post (lifestory is really unnecessary ) and remove the mention of hangar for support."
7/10/2011,"no referral to your background, no referral to your name, race, upbringing or social class or experience, no unfounded assumptions about you, only the evidence of the past posts on this thread.actually sounds to me like i was just stating facts. it seems that the problem may be that you take many statements as personal, thus setting off a derailed argument which is a digression from the actual thread. which, this branch is soon in danger of being, if we were to continue this meta-discussion about how you take things personally."
7/10/2011,"lol. you can play the innocent little lamb game someplace else. if it bugs you that i don't take crap on forums and throw it right back, then feel free to ignore me. other wise deal with it.since you've nothing to add to the topic, you can now be cited as a hypocrite. thanks for playing."
7/10/2011,"has nothing to do with me. it has to do with the cheap little tactic to avoid committing to a fight. thanks for trying the ""cry more"" tactic. refer to the p.s."
7/10/2011,"[x] adunh slavy made the op.[x] adunh slavy talked about himself and his fail.[ ] i said ""cry more"".[x] adunh slavy cries a lot anyway.[ ] cloaks were mentioned.[x] adunh slavy seems to be upset.[ ] profit was had.great thread, will read again."
7/10/2011,"yeah, except he didn't avoid the fight, did he? he switched ships, and you got pwned, b*tch.you moron. you fell for the oldest trick in the book. even 3-weeks old noobs know better than to blindly jump on a can-flipper. and yet you went for it. your choice, your consequences. he could also have called in his corp buddies to warp to 0 on your ass. that is just one of the risks you run for taking the bait.you are pretty shameless, really. most players, when they make a booboo like this, just shake their heads, smile at their own stupidity, and then move on. not you, apparently."
7/10/2011,"not ccp either actually, the idea of unscoutable forces is something they want to get rid off and is one of the main reasons for cyno's probably being changed soon.last i checked/heard the maintenance array trick is complete consequence avoidance, as even if a victim is prepared and beats the crap out of the griefer, he can just store ship leaving an unaggressed pod which brings concord if attacked.it is like playing kick-can and then carrying the can around"
7/10/2011,"[citation needed]then he just shouldn't fire at the pod. doh. :) but that's problem here, isn't it? the op apparently can't control himself very well. and i bet he would petition it too, if he shot the pod. ugh!"
7/10/2011,"this thread is hilarious :-dthe op is dumb enough to attack a bait can thief.the op sees an orca warp in. he keeps trying to kill the no doubt well tanked bait.the bait ship enters the orca. the op does nothing.a t3 pops out of the orca. the op probably tried to attack it :-d certainly the op still didn't run.*cue locking sounds**pop* the op's sad little ship vanishes in a cloud of plasma.in summary the op had every chance to prevent or later disengage from the agression he was clearly beyond being able to cope with.but instead of learning an important lesson in eve, the op decides to get on the forums and start wailing that those nasty wasty pirates won't follow marquess of queensberry rules :-dwhen the op's noob-level mistakes and stupidity are then promptly pointed out to him, he starts pummeling his little fists ineffectively on the ground, cries more, and continues on his epic fail to get that eve is street fighting, not boxing in a ring with rules.my question is: how is someone suffering from near total braindeath able to turn his pc on, much less play eve?"
7/10/2011,"such typical eve tough guy bravodo. this is why i put the p.s. in the first post, because all the internet tough guys come up with the cry more crap. they, some of you, don't care about the issue and that it is against design philosophy.thanks for helping me prove the point of the sorts that defend these lame tactics. of course no matter what i say, the mentality will always retort with ""cry more"" or ""u mad"". it's too difficult to discuss the actual issue. it's too dangerous discuss it for some of you, who wish to divert attention from such a cheap little trick and attempt to place all the blame on the messenger.none of you are objective enough to face up to the fact that this lame tactic goes against the commit to a fight design philosophy. you'd rather whine and waggle your fingers at me. just another lame tactic.keep making my point for me :)"
7/10/2011,"was a flurry of dev activity on null/cyno improvements back in february if i recall. just regular posts in different threads so finding it with the broken search is not something i'll do without being drunk/drugged.(cyno delay, cyno displacement, mobile jammer and so on were the thread topics i think).don't think he shot the pod, but you are missing the point rather badly. the array trick allow us to completely circumvent aggression mechanics .. the very same mechanics that people want made harsher by extending dock aggression and making rr subject to it.there is no reason whatsoever for maintenance arrays to be excluded from the aggression mechanics, but ccp in their infinite ignorance probably don't know how to fix it so hopes it goes away on its own."
7/10/2011,"keep failing to admit you got yourself killed through your own stupidity. you had several chances to avoid your destruction, and then to avoid being mocked here. but you didn't take a single one of them. as i said - this thread is hilarious :-d"
7/10/2011,"there was no pod to shoot. the other player borded the new ship straight away, from vigil to loki with no intermediate pod session change involved."
7/10/2011,"awww look, another lame attempt at attacking the messenger and not the message. thanks for the bump."
7/10/2011,your message is that you should be protected from being stupid. no thanks. your stupidity is too funny :-)
7/10/2011,"actually, i'm quite satisfied at having you prove my point exactly! :)(which was, incidentally if you missed it, if you didn't come across so angry and looking to 'punch' back at any response you may have gotten more supports to this thread.)"
7/10/2011,"during the old scan mechanics the time for a scan was much higher then what is present today.sniping was a possible tactic, but you could never stay on the same spot for longer period of time, due to people getting a spot on you.then the mechanic we have now got implemented, and sniping as a viable tactic kinda disappeared. probes deployed, meant they would have a spot in 5 sec. so there was really no point going sniping since anyone could get on top of you really fast.enter the unprobable setups. this made us and other groups able to use snipers. probes in the water didnt mean you would get 30+ peeps landing on top of your head before you had aligned. that it was impossible to probe out in general was just a pure bonus.my proposal: increase scan time for scanning down player controlled ships. this can be done with increasing the scan time with the combat scanner probes and deep space scanner probes.it makes sniping a viable tactic, even if there are probes in the water. but it makes it a hit and run tactic.alignment time for a average bs is around 12 seconds. that's from a stand still point. then add up the deceleration time from coming out of warp.scan time with combat probes: around 5 seconds.conclusion: sniping with probes in the water is kinda equal to hitting self destruct when you are initiating warp."
7/10/2011,gladly supported. :)+1
7/10/2011,change mininum warp distance to 250+ km.
7/10/2011,"agreed, bring small gang pvp back"
7/10/2011,i can suppport this.
7/10/2011,yep yep yep fix pvp

7/10/2011,"no.make minimum warp distance farther, but do not make it longer to scan someone down. this would have been fine when you couldnt put a filter with probes on your overview. now that any decent pvper or low sec mission runner can see probes on directional it already made probing people down in space that much harder before they leave."

7/10/2011,didn't ccp say in that devblog on the turrets somewhere missiles were on the slate with the other modules like tp and ewar and stuff?
7/10/2011,"i recall them saying that no, we won't get missile launcher animations (like the turrets)."
7/10/2011,"ccp, could you please have your economic adviser read this. thanks.players...before you throw a fit please read the whole thing. this suggestion is not meant to take away your ability to throw away money! it will just prevent you from doing it at other people's expense as well.one would assume that a market should be based on supply and demand of goods and price should increase or decrease according to these laws. not only based on demand and supply but on the intensity of each. after 3 years of observation and extensively playing the eve market, i came to the realization that this is not the case. what actually drives the prices is the people's lack of desire to maximize income and their ability to change the prices arbitrarily, which they do not do in real life because in real life you lose real money. before you jump with objections, im going to give you my reasons why this is not the case.now, please tell me who in their right mind would take a 15% price cut on their shares in the real world and give up 15000 for every 100,000 they sell? answer: nobody.here are the symptons of the irregular and chaotic market:1. people with lots of money who can cause a market price crash because they are willing to take huge losses for the hell of it. who does that in real life? not even the richest billionares.2. ignorance or spite driven enormous price drops kills the ability of real cost conscious manufacturers to make a profit.3. huge price drops in very short amounts of time which are not driven by supply or demand, but rather by 1 person.my point here is not to make things more or less profitable for anything or anyone in particular but to balance the chaos which is the eve market today, which under normal circumstances would be self balanced by fear of loss...which in eve is nowhere near as rl money and must be enforced by rules.here are the main causes of this imbalance:1. first and foremost, eve is treated as a game, and thus prices not regarded as money. consequentially, the eve market cannot and will not behave like a real money market because its not...real money. its isk and treated as such. now ccp's goal is to make the eve market as realistic and balanced as possible, but they have missed a few key controls which are necessary as people dont really care about selling at the highest possible price but just cashing in their loot or production, even at a loss.2. secondly, the price of goods is not dictated by the need for them or the supply, by rather by impulsive individuals. this wiliness to forego income which cannot be controlled at the moment in eve is the reason why the market does not work well. 3. the ability of 1 person to cause an instant price drop on any 1 or more items by any amount and the ability to set an arbitrary price or a market order. what nutcase would sell crude oil for 100 usd / barrel, when the price is 110? nobody in rl would. in eve they do simply because they dont care and can set any price for a sell order.4. supply and demand playing a minor role overall and prices are being driven by the above factors instead of economic ones. the price increase and drops should be governed by the speed of demand and supply, rather than by 1 person deciding to put up 10 megathrons at 2 million below lowest market price. by speed of demand and supply i mean by how active the market is going down, meaning, you have 1000 people dropping their price by 0.01% every 5 minutes...the price will plummet. but its a collective trend driven by supply and demand..not by 1 person, who just screwed the whole market. if supply is tight, this will be unlikely to happen, however it does happen in eve. if you have 12 megathrons for sale at 90 million, and the daily deman is 50 megathrons, you will again have some guy who decides to sell his megas faster at 80 millon each, taking a 10 million opportunity loss on each one. who in their right mind does that in rl? answer: nobody."
7/10/2011,"in a real market economy people go broke and lose their shirt, in eve they dont, they just drop prices below cost without knowing it, messing with the market prices beyond belief.so long as the above conditions exist the eve market will not behave as the real market.my suggestions to place some controls and balance the market a bit would be as follows:1. regulate the amount by which players can drop the prices of an item on the market. i would put a maximum limit price drop of 0.10% of the lowest region price per order. meaning, you cannot set a price lower than 99.90% of the lowest region price. so if the lowest price for some item is 100 isk, you cannot put yours up for sale lower than 99.90 isk. now here one would tread carefully as there are different prices in different regions of regions. so, if you are selling in a system where the lowest region price is farther than 5 jumps away, then your new benchmark price becomes the lowest price within 5 jumps. this would let you match prices that are higher in your particular part of the region. in the case of minerals and other low priced item, the increment will be a maximum of 0.01 isk drop per changed order.so this way, prices would drop only if you have a lot of people willing to change their prices very fast by 0.10% or 0.01 isk, basically a sustained collective trent, instead of giving 1 person the power to screw the market prices. also prices would rise if a lot of buyers are buying up the orders faster than the prices drop....which is what should happen but doesnt. it doesnt happen because people are willing to undercut other people even in very high demand secenarios, thus causing prices to drop even then.2. create a contract type called wholesale where players can set lower prices for multiples of the same item they wish to sell at a discount, instead of selling it on the market and screwing the whole market dynamics. here they may sell only 1 item type per contract and must sell a minium of 2 units. here these people can set any price you want for your items. give them away for free if you want without affecting the market trends.yes, the result of this rule would be consistently higher prices throughout eve. in my opinion, the above rules would:1. prevent 1 person from driving the market prices2. give people who are willing to take a small loss and sell their stuff the tools to do so without screwing everyone else who is willing to play the market game.3. place price controls which only allow drastic price movements if they are genuinely driven by market forces instead of individual preferences4. remove ""price dumping"" from the market...which is illegal in most countries afaik."
7/10/2011,"to quote myself:maybe you wouldn't be afraid of 'afk cloakies' if you were not afking in your space. employ a combat air patrol while you mine. have a player constantly watching the overview and scanning as you go about your business. swap players in and out of this as the tedium eventually leads to lapses in concentration. have your own cloaked ships standing by nearby so a cloaked attacker never knows exactly what he faces. etc, etc.my point being there are ways to considerably reduce the risk you face. having to do these things is the price you pay for being inside unsecured space. adapt or die."
7/10/2011,"well, there are ways to to reduce the risk, right, but the effort of both sides is inbalanced in my eyes. and btw it's not unsecured space, it's player secured space, so it can/should be saver then high sec if people care of it.the afk cloaker jumps in, warps somewhere and activates a module and goes afk.he can come back every time and maybe open up a cyno. that's everything he needs to do.the other side needs to look at d-scan/overview every 2-5 seconds.they need to be aligned (76% speed not possible during mining or uselsess when warp scrambled by npcs).they can have a fleet on standby that needs to react fast, so they have to stay alerted and in range (maybe 1-2 jumps away).i would like to see a way to find cloaked ships in space, cause i think every undocked ship should be killable somehow. but it should take some time to find someone, so cloakies are not completly useless. maybe 2-5 minutes, so if you cloak with a ratting-bs on a moon or so, you have some time to call reinforcements and the others won't have to wait to long to be able to kill you.just my 2 cent's."
7/10/2011,"as cloaking devices are a specialist item, they should require a specific fuel to run. the main aim of this proposal is to move the use of the device to a more tactical basis, rather than ""just another module"". fitting the device would this provide a benefit (hiding), at a small expense (re-fueling periodically).this proposal does not prevent the tactic of shadowing systems as a cloaked afk'er per se, but would require the cloaker to refuel periodically as a tradeoff for the cloaked interdiction of a system.fuel usage can be scaled to the ship that the device is used on, with advantage in fuel usage resting with specialist craft such as covops, then scaling through recon type vessels all the way to capital ships. covops could run cloaks in the hours, whilst capitals could only run it in the minutes."
7/10/2011,"this is a terrible idea. it's already hard enough to evade well manned and well organised gate camps even with a covert ops cloak. it's only because camping a gate is so boring and people getting lax as a result, that cloakies can slip by now.not to mention how this would hurt scouts and spies, as well as blockade runners ferrying good long distance out of dangerous space, etc."
7/10/2011,this has already been proposed and discussed. i don't think we need to hash it out again.
7/10/2011,why?
7/10/2011,lololololol?
7/10/2011,"this change would fix a couple things. the problems right now with balance:1) active tanking is horribad for pvp unless it is 1v1 or some other small gang stuff and even then cap warfare turns it off fast. 2) gallente ships are bonused for active tanking with repper bonuses. they are hardly used and this is a contributor to gallente being underused in pvp.3) buffer fits are extremely popular because they work for logistics and just general staying power. however, buffer armor fits are slow, buffer shield fits don't suffer as much as a larger sig isn't as bad of a penalty to still being quick and having more hp.my proposal is this:active tanking modules add buffer as well. not as much as their extender and plate counterparts, but half as effective. a lar will add as much as an 800mm plate of the same meta lvl. mar = 400mm platesar = 200mm platewith the shields it is a bit more complicated being that there are 4 classes of sub capital shield boosters, and they have some overlap on what size ship they are used on. for instance, xls are used on bses and some bcs but i don't know of any popular armor rep fits were you use a lar on a bc. also the biggest shield extender is a large and micros are rarely used. you use larges on bses down to cruisers and mediums on frigates and maybe smalls but other then that there is some disparity. (this is flavor and shouldnt be changed imo)so i think an xl booster should add hp to one large extendera large booster = medium extendermedium booster = small extendersmall booster = micro extenderi think that active tanking also needs to be reduced in capacitor consumption by 15%. if this makes running missions too easy increase dps in missions accordingly (i know a lot of programming work but imo rats are too easy and i hate the whole ""my super ship ca destroy hundreds of yours! rawr!"")lastly reduce fitting requirments of active tanking modules by 5% so it is easier to run multiple reps or oversized booster. right now the only viable active tanking setups utilize drug boosters with multiple reps for armor or oversized booster for shield along with command ship bonuses. this will also allow gallente to use thier bonuses and speed into range and apply thier blasters which suck right now because the great speed rebalance change and webber change. this would help alleviate that problem."
7/10/2011,i obviously support my own idea.
7/10/2011,neuts will neut
7/10/2011,wow! great contribution to the discussion! yeah so should we nerf nuets? (no) i think that my idea helps alleviate some of the downsides of cap warfare.
7/10/2011,"actually, yeah, i think neuting should be made harder. or have a skill added that makes you more resilient to neuting per lv."
7/10/2011,that is a whole differant topic. and also nuets work well right now. ever try nueting a cap ship? how about now he has your imaginary skill to resist neuting. yeah thought so.nerfing nuets should not be the answer to buffing active tanking. i used to live in the days of noses always being used and no one used nuets until the nosferatus got nerfed. we need buffing not nerfing.
7/10/2011,"i can already tank my active boosting missions cap-stable, thank you; why should i take an increase in dps?"
7/10/2011,"while this is an inconvenience......they're an outlaw and such they (and their friends) live with those consequences. i doubt ccp will change these mechanics - otherwise pirates could be repped in fights against anti-pirates/victims; meaning that they can't fight the logistic ship without taking a (unfair) standings hit and gcc.taken from that perspective, that's why the mechanic works as it does. now the workaround you're looking for is this:1) a criminal player is repped by a non-criminal not engaged in criminal activity (i.e. no gcc present), repper therefore gets no gcc.2) a criminal player is repped by a non-criminal while engaged in criminal activity (i.e. he has gcc), repper therefore gets gcc for aiding criminal activity (note the difference from 'player')in this setup, the pirate can receive neutral aid when he's not under the effect of a gcc, i.e. he hasn't engaged in criminal activity. for lack of better phrases, it's a good samaritan clause - patching the wounds on a murderer isn't bad - patching those wounds that were gained while murdering is bad. this enables pirates to interact with neutrals more easily.i personally don't think they should be able to - being a pirate is all about taking the hard road and carving out whatever the hell you want when you want it and accepting the consequences of doing so. if you benefit a criminal, that is a criminal activity - therefore you gain a gcc. -5.0 players are basically in a state of constant gcc passively. that's my two isk.edit: spelling"
7/10/2011,"it was removed because ccp are trying to shove cq and wis down our throats, and are badly out of touch with what players want."
7/10/2011,"agreed, for me its a simple issue of performance. i use an older laptop to play eve because i am in the military, they dont pay us a whole lot, and i move around a lot. i dont plan on building a new system just to play eve, the new ui does nothing to add to my play style, and in fact detracts. at the very least give us the option of remaining in our pods for basic play. i am a long time player, i now have 2 paying accounts, and simply put, i cant physically play the game at this time. so unless a change comes along soon to make the wis optional, i am going to have to stop paying for my accounts."
7/10/2011,"really? is that what i came across as implying? actually, what i find hilarious is your need to continually bump and plea to everyone to ""support me!"" every couple of weeks. while occasional tooting of your own horn is normal, the flagrant nature and the amount of vigor and energy you seem to be putting into a proposal that few even see the need for, is humorous. most wonder just why you are so galvanized in your resolve. bumping this just to see what you will say next is almost worth the rhetoric!"
7/10/2011,"i could not agree with you more on that this game has many other issues.still this question on 'un-inject"" skillpoints has been brought up way too many times. new players after 6 months at least have 2 to 4 skills they wished they didnt train.so, a thought to make players & ccp happy campers.add an item in the nex store called it something fancyi can think of two ways to cost it in aurums.1. per skillpoint some fixed price in aurum, it varies with plex prices2. sell in tiers, i.e. 100k, 250k, 500k, 1mil sp at a fixed price in aurumreally, if you think about it it is just a vanity issue with cleaning up you skill sheet. if players want to do it, make them pay. this way ccp gets something out of having to add the feature to the game.just a thought to make both sides happy. it is in no way ahead of other problems in this game which we all know about.i only have 7 skills/109,172 sp to be ""un-injected"", so not really a big deal on time for me, but would like them off down the road somehow. i would at this moment use the nex store for removing skillpoints out of all that is there now.o7kytp.s. forgot to say that in no way is this new nex item game breaking."
7/10/2011,"3 letters for you: ocd. :)and yes, i wouldn't mind ridding my sheet of some skills i once injected, but never actually plan to train. they just look fugly on my skill-sheet.un-injecting is tricky business, though; some skills may be prerequisites for other skills. like, what if i wanted to un-inject caldari cruiser? it would seemingly be harmless, unless i suddenly wanted to train caldari strategic cruiser up one day, only to find out i no longer can.i foresee tons of petitions waiting to happen. therefore, sadly, not supported."
7/10/2011,sounds like a good idea.
7/10/2011,"i dont read much of the forums usually but one thing besides mt keeps coming up, local chat.just wondering what is the problem with it? is it just a low-null sec problem?and if it is such a problem, why is deleting it the only way to be rid of the problem?why can it not simply be modified in some way, such as when you cloak you disapear from it? or even while in a mission site you cant be seen in it either?again appologies for the rehashed question, but most of the other topics ive read are derailed 3 posts in by anger responses and the real problem never reveals its self as a result. could even be its not a problem, but from a personal perspective, wont know till i ask though.thanks for reading, and if you take the time to reply."
7/10/2011,"it's more of a null sec problem. you see local was never designed to be the powerful intel tool it is today.in fact the showing of standing in local chat, was a direct result of a client hack that was used some time ago.the issue with removing local, is what exactly will take it's place? if they ever change local in some way it will have to be a part of a package of changes, which could include a change to cloaking. but cloaking could be messed up in wh space with any change, so it's a very tricky situation.this is why, even though ccp want to make a change to local, nothing yet has been done. they simply cannot find the right package of changes to implement."
7/10/2011,"before you guys say anything, yes i know alot of more important stuff is outt here right now, and it should be attended to first.on to the topic: the jukebox... not enough music, for one, the login screen music for incarna i personally love and would like to see it in jukebox at some point, as well, if possible, some of the mission music, like when you warp into a mission to fight some minmatar, i dont think that music is in jukebox (looked hard, couldnt find it).thats pretty much it, i gues my point im trying to bring attention to is that music is half the immersion in eve, which ccp ""seems"" to really want, and alot fo the music that i like i can only seem to find by missioning for 2 hours to find a mission zone that has it."
7/10/2011,"yes, one of these days i must turn sound back on in eve...the music was nice, but got old fast, and there were no game sounds i needed more than being able to listen to other music, tv and podcasts while playing."
7/10/2011,"seems to me that you should be far more upset than i am. good customer service is, in my experience, timely customer service. if there are more cases like yours, then it would behoove the council to see if ccp will devote more resources to something like this that directly affects our gaming experience. furthermore, it seems to me that ccp, being an entity that survives by providing a service would be heavily focused on making sure that their customer service experience was fair and timely."
7/10/2011,"oh, i'm pretty damn sure i'm more upset than you are :-d i've already cancelled my account... what, two weeks ago now? and in that two weeks nothing has happened to make me want to reverse my decision.i still get to stare at the ****ing door. i still have eve crashing every time i jump while tabbed out (been happening since incursion!), and sometimes also when eve is the active app. i still have the x vanish when i try to click it to close a window. i still have lousy performance and major stuttering when the new turrets fire. i'm still not getting responses to my petitions. fixed window mode still hasn't been put back in eve for mac. i still have no station id above station services. i still have no way to quickly see what ship i'm flying and a way to quickly interact with it. i still have muddy indistinguishable blobs for turret icons. i could go on, but you get the idea."
7/10/2011,"incarna is the first brick for a new dimension in eve... the upcoming milestone will be full station/ship/planet/ruins exploration on foot, skills fot foot combat, hand weapons, vehicles, foot combat like halo or mass effect. of course if a player wants to stay in the ship all his/her life it can be done, there is an option to turn off the cq at all times in the graphic settings... about the difficulties of multiboxing i'd say boo hoo for them... most of them had the bare minimun for a single client even before incarna was launched. heck i'm sure they are the same who was rage fighting when the updated graphics pack was launched"
7/10/2011,why would we want to read a doctored version of events? stop treating us like children ffs.
7/10/2011,because half the people on the forums do act like children and take things out of context. also meeting minutes for most companies are sanitized so discussions can't be taken out of context by people who were not there. text comes out very differently as you should know and so there has to be some consideration to what to release to put it in the correct light of the verbal discussion.
7/11/2011,"take wh space then - you can do the exact same thing there and never know it, yet that person is still 'invincible'. you have to admit that the only reason an afk cloaker is a problem is because you actually know they are there. what about hisec? local shows them, you know they're from a wardec corp, but you can't find them?the fact is that you can't do anything about it, as you've already stated, and you're not meant to be able to do anything about it. sec space has the advantage of local - you at least know they are there, in wh you don't even know who is watching you unless you constantly scan for probes too. popping a d-scan every so often is not that difficult, nor is acquiring a few friends to watch your back (few - like three tops).you have yet to provide a concrete reason why having friends, d-scan, or the eve rule #1 doesn't cover why afk cloaking is ok. i won't even touch the fact afk cloaking really only directly affects two things: people too paranoid and weak to do anything about it, and botters - which are really just the first thing. if you want to solo in low/null, you'll have to accept that afk cloakers are there. you are misinterpreting the usefulness of local as a stress-inducing problem, not intel that tips you off to potential attackers.as a side note - it's not griefing, consider eve in general, it doesn't violate eula, and that is one more account making money for ccp doing nothing at all (or maybe plotting your demise, both work really). cloaks are designed for a reason - mess with them and you further degrade black ops (if even possible) as well as severely harm the intel-gathering side of the game.tl;dr you haven't provided a concrete reason why having friends, d-scan, or eve rule #1 don't handle cloaked ships, afk or not, nor have you explained how they are more of a threat when viewable in local as opposed to being 'unseen' at all in wh space."
7/11/2011,"when even simple sarcasm flies over your head, i have to wonder how you managed to even get the game installed. stay in school, kid."
7/11/2011,"i cannot help but notice you only respond to the insults and trolls in this thread, not those constructively arguing why afk cloaking isn't a problem. if you want to be taken seriously, start by responding to your actual opposition. by avoiding the valid points made and simply insulting the insulters, your proving yourself only as a troll.explain how this is different from wh space where you can't see them at all. also explain why having friends, d-scan for probes, and the inherent rule of ""don't fly what you can't afford to lose"" isn't enough for handling afk cloakers, be they one or several?"
7/11/2011,if i had one tear drop from every whiny ***** who started one of these threads i would never need to buy lube again. this is far from an exploit. get over it and maybe pay attention while you bot.
7/11/2011,"so you're saying you went into unsecured space knowing it wasn't safe, and now you're whinging because... unsafe things happened?sorry, am i missing something here? is their some kind of bizarro logic i need to comprehend, before i can understand why you're crying about low/null sec's lack of safety, when you knew it to be unsafe in the first place?"
7/11/2011,i suspect even if local was removed this op would still be *****ing about it even then.qftw: sums it up nicely.
7/11/2011,"for sarcasm to work, it needs to be a sharply focused ironic retort. you simply added words pertaining to the topic without any focus placed upon it.do you even have an argument, or are you now only going to show how poorly you use the english language?"
7/11/2011,this.its not a hard thing to do and if your corp or alliance isn't organized enough to have this sort of system running i suggest you find another. afk cloaking is not a major problem and has the beneficial side effect of keeping bots out of action which i feel more than makes up for any minor annoyance it may cause those of a more fragile disposition.
7/11/2011,"re: b-flat's answer (suitable for wind instruments and generates a soundwave .. get it?!? ):i'd like for the safety net to lose quite a few strings as well, but for all 'sides' as the state of unsafe for one easily translates into safe for another (most cases).- make cloaks probeable (see prev. post).- remove local in player sovereign space (npc null should be excluded to keep the allegedly superior pvp environment it has)- tweak scanner mechanics to avoid carpal tunnel brought on by paranoid scan-spam.- allow owner greater control over local (ex. non-blues always show) by sacrificing other tactical tools like jammers/bridges.- etc."

7/11/2011,turn off local chat.
7/11/2011,"it's been said and said again... there needs to be one class of ship, a frigate, with negligible combat capacity, with just one ability: scanning down things that are cloaked.it won't be able to warp directly to them, just 'in their vicinity', and will have to continue it's snooping anti-cloak-warfare to detect the ship's sig, then approach it, decloak it, and do whatever it needs to do.it needs to have the ability to overtake a cloaked ship at speed while it, itself, is cloaked (it cannot scan 'uncloaked' except for uncloaked things). once it is within decloak range both ships are exposed, and a covert ship may be able to then destroy it.an afk cloaked ship will be easy prey, and will rid the system of the metagaming tards who delight in disrupting all activity while they're at work, asleep, or otherwise screwing off elsewhere.an active pilot will usually be warping around, scoping out juicy targets, or at the very least alert enough to respond when they're decloaked. eve wants active pilots, not afk macros (and afk cloaking is the same as macro activity, imo)."
7/11/2011,"5/10, average troll."
7/11/2011,exactly what i was thinking.
7/11/2011,"so go rat in pairs or threes, if you can't cope wit 1 freakin' ship ina gang of 3 you are pretty useless, ofc there's the risk of a hotdrop, but then i would say this is far less likely than a quick gank attempt on the ratters and well, it is zero zero, it's not supposed to be risk free despite the efforts of nullbears suchas urself trying to make it so"
7/11/2011,"organising a group and combat support is beyond these whingers. so far as i can work out, they prefer whinging to being proactive and doing something so they can still be active in their space, while threatened by the ominous lone afk cloakie :-d"
7/11/2011,the afk cloaker is the only counter to bots.the only person who is reasonably affected by an afk cloaker is a botter.every other person is capable of asking for help from corp/alliance if the cloaker turns out to be active.
7/11/2011,"wh space is not like null space cause you actually have to work to find things to do, you don't have an unlimited supply of things to do. upgraded null offers belt rats, instant respawning combat sites, and grav sites galore. therefore it attracts those who only want the easiest way to generate the most isk for their wallets, and want to do so with the least amount of risk to themselves.the need to use renters to pay the bills have made a new class of people in null that have done nothing but pay a bill to gain access to ""their"" systems. however, the ""landlord does not give a rats arse about their safety, and makes no effort to hunt them down on the way in or out. the landlords care and defend only a small section of null now.on the other side of the coin, null makes it very easy to ""find"" people, since belts are on overview, and all the combat sites can now be found using an onboard scanner that can be used while cloaked. add in the fact that its impossible for an active player to get any element of surprise since everyone in local knows they have arrived before they even finish their jump into the system.so we have people living in null that do so only to generate the maximum isk possible and who are risk adverse, we have no ability to attack them without them knowing we are there, and this interferes with their vision of the sandbox as a mass influx to their wallet.at this time, with perfect local intel on who is around, there is no way to for a small gang to effectively disrupt your operations without sitting in system 23.5/7 and most active players have no desire to do so. if you want to nerf cloaks then tell me what you are willing to give up so that the scales are not tipped solely in favor of all the null sec carebears. 1) give up instant local. delay it 5 minutes. oh you don't want that because then you won't get notice of a huge hot drop or some other whine. you already get a cyno on overview anywhere in system, is that not enough?2) make an active module on your ship that is a high slot. active module will, when active, tell you all the ships in system, but will also show your location on overview, same as a cyno beacon. kind of like an active sonar, you give up your position by blasting a crap ton of energy into space, but you get to know whats in system. heck even make a ship with the ability to use this module and pin down the location of a ship with skills, what ever you like, but you give up your position by doing so.3) make a ""probe"" that can be anchored anywhere, is visible on overview, and will tell you approximate ship class of anything passing within 200km of it cloaked or not. make it fairly easy to destroy and costly. can anchor that near a gate (or wormhole) and then you will know when something comes in system. however, it can not be anchored in asteroid belts of combat sites as there are to many things to interfere with the signal.so really if you want to nerf cloaky ships, which is the only counter to bots and all you skittish little carebear mice that run to your burrows everytime local goes +1, then give all of us pvp players a way to effectively hunt you when we are active.i am ready to entertain your ideas of how to rebalance this game mechanism that does not further tip the scales in favor of the null sec carebear mouse."
7/11/2011,"that right there details why afk cloaking is an issue, i have no issues with somebody coming into my system making past the gate camp or what ever and scouting the system and disrupting activities in that system. that part is a valid tactic and valuable intell gathering source.the fact that they can gather this intel and disrupt activities without playing the game is where the issue is at. i don't want to see the cloak mechanics them selves changed as it allows for the tactic to be used. but being able to use that tactic without actually being at the keyboard is effectively the same as using a bot. you are gaining a tactical advantage (by knowing what is in system and when) there by allowing you to plan an op when there will be little to no resistance, costing folks isk by lowering productivity, and disrupting or even preventing the upgrade of a system or maintenance of that system level for industry or military areas. all this without being at your keyboard or playing the game. you do it perfect safety with zero risk to yourself, your ship, or your wallet.to be at your keyboard and be able to do all that is fine and doesn't need to change.to be afk and do all of that is what needs to change. as it stands right now that person that afk cloaks is able to gather the intell ect. he disrupts mining for maybe a couple hours or so till everybody figures out that he is afk. then we all resume normal activities. it still hurts our wallets and we pay attention to scans and such a lot more and will usually have a few ships for protection but that's it. and yes once you hit indy 4 or 5 loosing a couple mining ships to trade out for protection can cause you to loose that industry level.when a cloak comes into the system it should disrupt activities and cause all the above effects to there fullest, right now it doesn't.there should be a danger, it should disrupt my activities and it should make me think twice about doing what it is i was about to do.simply put, providing a way to prevent the person from going afk without risking his ship and his pod provides advantage to both sides. we know that person is active therefore more effectively disrupting our activities and causing damage to the industry and military levels of a system and causing a bigger hit to our wallets. it causes us to sit in our pos or leave the system allowing the cloaker to find and bookmark our pos for a future attack. it allows him to more effectively gain the intel for targets when or if he has a fleet jump into system. causing us to boost our pos defense and actually think about strategic defense.by preventing the afk it allows us to try and keep those industry and military levels higher and allowing us to more effectively mine or rat when the player is not in system as normal. it gives us better experience at setting up pos defense and fleet defense.and most importantly it might actually cause more fleet engagements as systems get upgraded to level 5 industry and folks try to stop it or force it to go back down. or make systems more prone to traffic therefore generating more fights.all that by simply putting in a mechanic that causes the cloak to drop if you don't click yes i want to stay cloaked in a random spot on the screen every couple of mins. you still can't be found, your still going to be safe, you just now have to be at your keyboard to do it."
7/11/2011,"if you think afk cloaking sucks, wait until you go and live in a wh. 0.0 carebears have local to give them intel and to actually let them know that someone is in the system. wormholes don't and people there do fine."
7/11/2011,you haven't answered my question yet.
7/11/2011,"worms don't exactly have the revolving doors that normal space does and it is very easy for a large enough expeditionary force to keep tabs on all comers or even prevent anything that may pose a threat from ever entering by collapsing the holes.so yeah, great comparison, my dear"
7/11/2011,"right, an incoming k162 followed by several cloaky t3's is easy to counter. please, you know you can't live without your instant intel local, and that is really the crux of the issue. there is no balance in 0.0 when you know the second someone comes into system and you all scurry like roaches when a light comes on.so again, how much of your safety net ""local intel"" are you willing to give up to be able to address the afk cloaky?"
7/11/2011,"gota love the rage and fail, also how will probing them help? it takes several seconds to get to the target after getting a scan hit, in that time a probed ship will be a fair distance from the warp in point making it next to impossible to catch anyway. here is my suggestion: deal with it, you can do the same to the enemy as well so its no exploit"
7/11/2011,"this is not the issue, the fact that they are there is not the issue. at no time should any player be able to gain an advantage of the other players without being at there computer. that's what needs to be fixed with the afk cloaking. the fact that you gain a tactical advantage without playing.botting gives you an advantage without you having to be there to control your character.afk cloaking gives you an advantage without you having to be there to control your character. you get intel on a system, see who's there and who comes and goes outa the system, ect all without needing to actually play the game. its just like botting and going out a mining. the only difference is that you dont need to use a third party program to do it.that's the issue that needs to be addressed, by removing the simple fact that you can do it while afk as i have stated previously it allows for both sides to have an advantage. we still wont be able to find you, we still wont be able to kill you. the mechanics of the cloak do not change. the only thing that changes is you now can't just come into the system gather the intel or other items without being at your keyboard.personally that's all i want to see change, i want you at your keyboard to disrupt my productivity or gather intell on my systems. i honestly don't care if i can find you and kill you. i just want you at your keyboard and actually playing to gain any advantage perceived or real in my systems. you want to take my industry level from 5 to 4 by disrupting my activities great i have no problems with you doing it as long as your at your keyboard doing it. you want to scout out my system and find out the best times to attack when resistance will be light or not there, great fine just play the game to do it. you want to find my pos and take it out great just play the game while you do it. that's all i want to see change."
7/11/2011,"the only advantage, is the one given by the the guy turtling in the station or posting ""afk cloaking is not fair"" threads."
7/11/2011,no.
7/11/2011,this is a follow up of a topic brought up in the general discussions forum:
7/11/2011,why thank you...
7/11/2011,what can i say? snowballs are fun!
7/11/2011,i remember shooting concord with them and not getting attacked.also the explosion effects looked cool.
7/11/2011,i remember shooting noobs with them so the noob shoots back and gets zapped by concord. many lolz.
7/11/2011,imo snowballs should be available in limited quantities for limited time. that said i would like the have them be available more frequently.
7/11/2011,"yes, please!this font is terrible and gives me a headache."
7/11/2011,"i like the font size a lot in eve, but they do need to be more distinct."
7/11/2011,pwease!
7/11/2011,"i like the idea but...the boosters should not persist through death - they should instead come in one hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, one day, one week, and one month increments. this allows pvp players to utilize such a gift, but at the same time lose the bonus if not careful.even then, would a one month booster user then not pvp for a month? the fact is these items would be most effecient with the long-use ones: i.e. four 6 hour boosters cost more in materials (and thus price) than a single day-long booster.the idea is sound, but needs work which op already acknowledged. however a persistent through death is imo not good - because that renders short term boosters worthless anyways."
7/11/2011,"no its not an oversight - you misunderstand where implants come from - the lp store and agent rewards. unlike internet spaceships, implants are manufactured by ccp who control the supply rate, and hence the price."
7/11/2011,"isn't that exactly the sort of resistance that the op is trying to remove? the idea that pvp should be cheaper, and more immediately available. your amendment works well for existing pvp players who can juggle cost/benefit/risk, but maintains the same barrier to primarily highsec players wanting occasional pvp."
7/11/2011,"i like the general flavor of the idea, even though the details should be fleshed out more.a cautious support."
7/11/2011,"exactly. i think ccp is continually thinking the wrong way about this. their rationale is, ""not enough peeps in 0.0? nerf highsec, and buff lowsec."" like recent plans to move all ice-mining (!) to lowsec only. sigh.i don't think it works that way, though. you only help to make richer super 0.0 alliances even richer. instead, if you want folks to go to lowsec/nullsec, make it easier for them to do so. like allowing 2x clone jumps per day, for instance, or the above proposal."
7/11/2011,"fundamental problem is the risk transition, not the reward transition. ccp only seem to have one shaped peg to try to batter into numerous shapes of hole."
7/11/2011,don't we all have that problem ?
7/11/2011,"the only part i disagree is leaving 1-5 for pirate implant purpose only. much better solution would be switching pirate implants into 6-10 slots (and eventually boosting their effect to compensate?)because otherwise, having 5 slots just so 1% of population can use them, doesnt make sense to me."
7/11/2011,um. no; kinda using 6-10 for other purposes.
7/11/2011,"i wasn't around when mines first came out, so i don't know what happened with them. but i was thinking that maybe a new system is in order, and it would be done using current mechanics. meant to be used in conjunction with mobile warp disruption bubbles, they deploy from a new class of ship, the minelayer. they would anchor the same but instead of scramming they would have three damage modes, dense, standard, light, and each mode uses more ammo(mines).sizes: large, medium, small.large minefields would have a radius of thirty kilometers, mediums would be twenty kilometers, smalls ten kilometers, with a central command structure that is linked to the mines and is vulnerable, if the command structure is destroyed the mines linked to it detonate.ammo bays would be varied depending on the size of the minefield. larges would hold sixty mines, mediums forty, smalls twenty.ammo: five types of mines. em, thermal, kinetic, explosive and multispectral.bomb type signature radius damage reduction.dense field: a dense mine field would use 50% of the on board ammo in a maximum of two volleys.standard(medium) field: a standard mine field would use 20% of the on board ammo, in a maximum of five volleys.light(small) field: a small mine field would use 10% of the on board ammo, in a maximum ten volleys.each mine should do around eight hundred damage so the minefields should not be something to take lightly. while they are deadly to enter they can be destroyed just like the mobile warp disruption bubbles. optional: if the command center is destroyed it will send out a distress call to it's owners. and/or it sends out a shockwave of damage farther than the original field.thoughts and opinions?"
7/11/2011,"only in null-sec i presume?and will it be anchorable within jump distance of the gate? because if so, i could see null-sec alliances insta-killing anything that jumps through a gate by anchoring these mine fields."
7/11/2011,i was around when they first were used and they were fairly much used to block off a jump gate...useful if a gang of frigs all landed at the same time.it was hard to setup properly making sure you didnt set off a mine whilst laying another which could trip the whole field. i would like to see mines back...you could mine pos stations and gates they just need to be balanced.
7/11/2011,i'd love to see mines in w-spacedid those things work with drag bubbles when they where initially available ?
7/11/2011,"ccp already knows gallente ships win at pvp, didn't you all watch the new ""i was there"" trailer?in all seriousness though, i would love to see hybrid's 'fixed'."
7/11/2011,agreed. seeing aur next to my isk is an insult!
7/11/2011,yes.
7/11/2011,"this sounds kinda exploity so yeah something should be done, i like the evil idea of random system within jump range"
7/11/2011,does this mean the old online pos and jump just before it's online doesn't work?????or you can no shoot cyno with other t1 frig no?
7/11/2011,sieged dreadnaughts. true story.
7/11/2011,"the super carrier is still unaffected by electronic warfare in the proposal./me puts on role play hatthe idea is that the electronic attack ships, due to its small size and precise role, can hack into the communication frequency of the targeted super carrier. using the same frequency the super carrier is using to communicate with its deployed fighters and fighter bombers.so it is effectively using the motherships own communication frequency as an amplifier against its own weapons, its flight of fighters and bombers. just like in the movie independence day. in that movie they hacked into the orbiting mothership and injected a virus. thus causing all the deployed fighters and such to lose their shields.so essentially, electronic attack ships are not affecting the super carrier but its horde of fighters all at once instead of trying to lock each one individually. yes there are other things that need to be done to help balance out super capitals like removing the remote repair range bonus for one.i love this idea. bouncing the ew effect off the super carrier to its army of fighters. can't stop the signal."
7/11/2011,"the reasoning still stands. if the effect is transfered to the drones on a sc, it should work the same on every other dronecarrier.roleplay hat edit: if the manned fighters are recieving hacked transmissions from their carrier, whats to stop them from cutting off the signal?sidenote: independence day was :okay: up until they started on the whole virus thing. pretty lucky the programming of two races who never met before is compatible."
7/11/2011,"ditch the ""only fighters and bombers"" bay, allow a much smaller bay for normal drones, and this idea could work. the eas change just means eas are even more of a priority target than they already are and thus even more completely suicidal to fly. 25% ehp is really not going to make any difference to their survivability in a fleet fight."
7/11/2011,"it's not like you already risk the materials and wallet you have to give access to. supported.maybe a log would also be nice to have, to show if somebody delivered or cancelled a job."
7/11/2011,"to some extent i agree with you - we have all heard about disgruntled pilots opening cyos in the middle of hostile fleets, or fat fingered titan pilots jumping instead of bridging.you need to look at the rest of the game though - no one can cancel anyone else's jobs in npc manufacturing/research facilities but you can see that the facilities are busy. the same level of control would be nice for pos facilities: job installer as a separate role to factory manager, so you can install jobs, cancel your own jobs, see that lines are busy, but not see what other jobs are doing, and certainly not have the ability to cancel them."
7/11/2011,"so yeah, forgot to mention this also affects interaction with corp mates. so let me get everyone going with this info. you can actively shoot your corp member in highsec and guess what....you can even pod them!!!!so we can pod corp members in highsec but i can't rep or boost my corp members who are innocent pirates. wtf ccp, wtf"
7/11/2011,"innocent pirates? not sure about that - but yeah we should be able to rep people who are -10 in low sec without going gcc, a good way to fix it is make it you get the same punishment as the person you repif he is -10 caldari standing you get the effect of -10 caldari standing-10 sec status gives -10 sec status penaltyremote repping a war target makes you a war target (maybe include podding?) of course it would only be in effect for 15 mins"
7/11/2011,obvious troll is obvious. try showing the above pic to ten different eve players. none i did could work out which is which. maybe obvious troll has no friends to ask :-)
7/11/2011,rocks: real soon now.
7/11/2011,"it would be nice, and i support the idea, but, i think with their agile clusterfsck policy of not knowing what they are doing until well after the sh!t has hit the fan puts such an idea well out of the realm of possibility."
7/11/2011,"fairly simple concept:on the fittings screen, preceding the 'racks' (high, middle, low slots, and rigs) in those little 'arrow points' around the ship, have a strip option.ex: i want to strip my artillery and equip my auto-cannons because the mission i'm going into has close-range enemies. i use the 'strip high slots' and remove all the high slot modules at once to my items, like a normal strip, but all of my rigs, middle slots, and low slots modules remain.ex: my fc needs my falcon to switch to strictly magnometric jammers because they've engaged in a fight dealing primarily with magnometric sensor type ships. i dock, strip only my mid-slots, add the new modules in and go.really this is just a time-saver and convenience as opposed to one-at-a-time removing modules (and their ammo in some cases) while protecting your ship's fitting in general and not worrying with the stripping of rigs. i think a less tedious fittings screen is always a good thing. i've never flown capitals so i don't know if you strip the major modules like clone vats or anything like that ever...i assume you don't.edit - another thread was posted for enabling toggled racks instead. the link is below for the idea. my original intent was to keep it simple and build on what we have, but this would be pretty nice. the idea effectively allows you to select what racks to strip via a toggle switch, then simply using a single strip button - i.e. strip mids and lows, but not highs and rigs.toggling what module racks striptl;dr add to the fittings window 'rack stripping' which allows you to strip all the modules from just high-slots, mid-slots, low slots, or rigs. this enables ship changeup to be less tedious by not having to one-at-a-time remove modules, particularly on eight-weapon ships or ewar ships that change modules based on the battle."
7/11/2011,"support for easy ui that doesn't affect gameplay.(damn you scotty for holding me here!)speaking of which, what became of our not so favorite docking manager? was he re-assigned to trying to find a way to make capsuleer-worthy air in the stations? maybe was handed a wrench from the 20th century to try and open the door from the other side?"
7/11/2011,1
7/11/2011,"i see no reason why this shouldn't be implemented. i would also like an option to hold shift or control while dropping a stack of modules (say 7 repackaged guns) and have all 7 fitted on the ship. this works if you have 7 unstacked guns and mark them all and drop, it's just a pain in the rear that you can't ""speed fit"" if you like to keep your hangar tidy."
7/11/2011,makes sense.
7/11/2011,free scotty!
7/11/2011,"not supported.having to wait and work for your latest ship is one of the things that separates pvp in eve from the instant gratification of fps. when you have had to train and save for that ship and you then put it on the line in combat it means something, the risk and loss is much more real than simply being popped and running for an item respawn point. also the speed of skill training means you get to know the ships you have already trained, as well as many of the basic tactics required for your playstyle. i would rather the current progression rather than rich noobs buying massive amounts of sp, jumping into an expensive ship they have no idea how to fly and dying in a fire in their first encounter (funny as it maybe) followed by ragequit. the idea is to encourage long term players not instant thrill seekers who only stay with the game for a few months."
7/11/2011,my darling you still appear to be mad at your own inability's.have you found the help i told you about yet or would you like us to come to you it would only cost us a few mill a week to teach your entire corp how to play eve.
7/11/2011,"the issue is the break in the design philosophy of committing to a fight that a ship hangar on an orca provides. the proposal is that when a player is red boxed, they can not swap to another ship directly from the hangar. they could eject, and leave the ship in space and deal with the 30 second session timer.the detractors of the thread continue to wish to make the thread about me and not about the issue. when starting the thread, i knew what sort of crap would be headed my way, and that is exactly what has occurred. the detractors act as if this behavior of theirs is unexpected.it is a common pattern on these forums. someone recognizes something in the game is a bit off, they give their feelings about it on the forums, and those that make use of the imbalance attack the messenger with noises like ""carebear"", ""crymore"" and various other sorts of insults. their goal is to maintain the imbalance, to silence the messenger. those who have been around for a while have seen this pattern repeated time and time again, from nos ecm domi, to pre nano-nerf right on up through the old doomsday device.an imbalance exists in the design, the detractors want to keep it - that is the meaning of their words, nothing more or less."
7/11/2011,"if you predict the sun will rise tomorrow, will you also expect to get paid? often people don't outwardly support threads like these because they don't want to be called names by the self appointed pillars of what is and isn't ""eve"". that is why those self appointed aholes behave as they do, to silence the message and scare off support. it wouldn't matter of i replied in kind or not.my initial post in this thread, the p.s. shows i was and remain quite aware of how this would go. i for one find it fun to cuss back at them and watch them get all worked up and make their empty threats, even got evemail of veiled threats from them. it's all rather amusing."
7/11/2011,"^^ and there's an equally predictable pattern of people getting blown up, thru their own gross stupidity, who then immediately post to have the other guy's tactic nerfed, instead of spending a few moments in self-reflection on what they did wrong.and you, manfriend, did plenty wrong: you blindly engaged a can-flipper, not using your brain, thinking it might have been a bait. you suddenly saw an orca warp in -- you didn't warp out. you saw the guy change ships -- you didn't warp out. you died. those are the facts. you had ample time to get to safety; yet, for some bizarre reason, you chose to hang around. and then you died (but we already covered that).and then you go post on the forum, saying you want the other guy nerfed. i don't think so.and no, for the umptiest time, he didn't evade any consequences. he enaged you in combat: remember the part where you died at his hands? now, if you could actually dock up inside an orca, you might have had a point; but you can't: he was still forced to face you in battle; and he did. and you died. live with that."
7/11/2011,"oh so original, again attacking the messenger. thanks for contributing to the typical fallacy. again, read the first post, altering the subject doesn't not absolve you of your stupidity - the mechanic allows people to escape consequences regardless of this particular instance.oh, and so you don't feel left out, ""**** off"". have a nice day."
7/11/2011,"let me see if i get this right...you are mad that after you shipped up to kill his vigil he then shipped up to kill your crow?this is so typical. the ones who cry the most always seem to be the ones who are mad someone managed to turn the tables on them after they thought they were the ones who turned said table.this is not a gentlemen's dueling society here. this is simulated warfare including piracy and terrorism. expecting others to follow your e-bushido is going to send you down a path of misery and rage, you should go ahead and go back to wow now and save yourself some grief.but you won't which is great because you'll provide the rest of us with more entertainment."
7/11/2011,"orcas used in this manner are no different from zero risk logistics, at least with logistics they get flagged to you. you can make all the 'eve isn't fair, look at nullsec, wowz there are fleets in this game' comparisons you like, but in every other instance of direct combat assistance in this game, you atleast have the option of shooting the help. that and obviously this isn't a problem in nullsec so the abundance of nullsec comparisons don't particularly apply, hurr durr.i find people defending the use of orcas in this way under the guise of keeping eve hardcore to be the height of irony. you would seriously propose that preserving what amounts to no-risk logistics available anywhere in highsec even remotely resembles anything but extreme risk-aversion, or to be even remotely similar to the hardcore nature of eve? pathetic.that granted, this op seems kinda emo so i suppose i can't blame the trolling.yes you can, and you don't even have to wait 60 seconds either, or do you seriously see a difference between docking to escape destruction and switching to a shuttle that will most likely get away(not that you'd care if you lost it anyways). orcas are even better than being within docking range of a station, you can change ships several times mid-fight(you can fit 4 lokis in there you know), you can 100% escape the fight mid-fight(swap to shuttle and leave), and the 60 second aggression countdown doesn't apply to orcas nor will they get flagged like every other form of logistics.you're free to do whatever you want with an orca by your side, the only limit is the 30 second session change timer which is pretty trivial, unless you're a complete idiot but that applies literally everywhere. immune to losing your ship? no problem, swap out of the fight at any time. you want instant full-hp-restore logistics? no problem, you can fit 4 lokis in here easy. you want your logistics to be protected by concord? no problem, it is.yes- i've had this tactic used against me.no- i didn't lose anything, i won the fight, they ran.yes- they should've lost their orca for losing the fight so badly, unfortunately due to a certain risk-averse mechanic i was unable to destroy their orca as i would've done if it were flagged just like every other direct combat assistance mechanic in the game."
7/11/2011,"lol, it's not emo, it called drawing in the flies."
7/11/2011,"everyone knows better than to blindly engage a can-flipper. and why? because there is no way of telling what is coming to you. you can have 10 of his corp buddies hotdrop on your arse to 0 in an instant. and that, indeed, is part of what eve is. your argument that you can at least shoot the help is moot: you think his crow would have survived an onslaught like that?and my main point was not that eve is hardcore, really; rather i pointed out the 'softcore' nature of his predicament to him: he had ample opportunities and time to warp out; he didn't. soon thereafter he died.orca itself is not providing aggression-logistics (even though it feels like it) ; not directly, at least. thus, orca itself should never be flagged. i can see a certain logic in not being able to use orca maintenance bay while under player aggro. but i'd like to stress that i am, at heart, against this risk-aversion proposal: calling in help troops, whether they be corp buddies, or forces being cyno-ed in (obviously not applicable to highsec), or alts coming to lend assistance in an orca, these are all things that can happen to you when you engage someone you 'think' is alone. if you don't want to take the chance, then don't."
7/11/2011,"easy. just like rr transfers aggro, using a ship fitting/hangar should also transfer aggro (to the orca in this case). i don't have a problem with people using alts. alts shouldn't be able to participate in a conflict, consequence free though."
7/11/2011,are you seriously suggesting to extend aggro to ships that not themselves take place in any aggressive action? doesn't compute. and could be abused as well (to get someone's orca blown up: either on purpose or by accident).
7/11/2011,"interfering in a fight by providing a different ship or fitting is most definitely an aggressive action. if someone handed a fighter a gun in a knife fight, i don't think anyone would have a problem accepting that as an aggressive action. you don't accidentally join a fleet, accidentally turn on ""allow access"" then accidentally situate your ship where a fight is going on. the ""not aggression!"" is the exact same argument that had been used against transferring aggro to an rr ship. give me a situation where this could be abused where the ship hangar pilot isn't either complicit or completely stupid to the point of deserving to get blown up and i'll accept your point."
7/11/2011,"rr-ing a ship that's engaged in aggression obviously, and rightfully so, transfers aggro to the person's ship doing the rr. this, however, is a completely different sutuation: the orca is not itself in any way, shape or form, lending support to a ship engaged in aggression. all it really does is make its ship maintenance bay available to fleet members: that's all. what that fleet members do with their ship is no longer the orca pilot's concern.to debunk your gun/knife example, yes, what indeed if someone was in a knife-fight, ran into a nearby gun store and came out guns blazing, would you now transfer legal 'aggro' to the store owner?this thread is getting crazier by the minute. :)"
7/11/2011,"but it is giving support, a safe hiding place for that ship. docking and jumping gates also give that support, but at the cost of a session change and in some cases the 30 second aggression timer. no such costs are imposed upon the pilot doing the ship swap in this instance or in the hypothetical case of a pilot docking the ship and sitting there in a pod - ship now perfectly safe and protected by concord while in the orca's hangar.no analogy is perfect, to stretch one is fallacious. of course in your stretch, you forget to mention if the gun store owner willing participated. how convenient."
7/11/2011,"you know, crazy as it sounds, i think i'm going to support your proposal. :) lol.no, seriously. extending aggro to the orca in the case where one of the ships it had in its maintenance bay commits an aggressive act, i think that's going too far. but i can see how it's reasonable one should not be allowed to dock up in one while under player aggro."
7/11/2011,"o_o that was a suprise turnaround.personally i just find it rather ridiculous how orcas have become mobile personal stations that completely ignore aggression mechanics making them usable in-combat.ps- adunh, the aggression timer is 60 seconds."
7/11/2011,"thanks.the extension of aggro does sound a bit too far, and also could lead to some griefs and exploits that may not be desirable, i can imagine a few."
7/11/2011,i would love to see that all signatures (not exlusivly to wormholes) keep their number abc-123duting the entire life of the signature. this recudes server load (server does not have to update all signatures with a new number and it also reduces people finding them again after dt just with another number. maby a little of complaining too actualy its verry anoying to scan trough dozens of signatures just to find the new wormhole opening to get out..ohh yeah i am lazy...
7/11/2011,"not supported,bookmark the sigs before dt, now its easy to filter through the garbage to find that new whalso, not worth fixing, eventually there will not be any downtime."
7/11/2011,nice topic. improbeables be<U+FFFD>s machariels and t3 have died with incarna<U+FFFD>s patch. probably a good nanofit can solve your problem.not support.
7/11/2011,"nice.of course the reasoning in the op completely ignores the fact that probing a target has **** all to do with tackling them.in order to tackle a target, you need a hit from the probes and you need to warp in. as the ships warping in have to align as well, the formula looks like this:5 secs probing time + x seconds align time + 10 seconds warp time + y seconds lock time = all the ****ing time to align!!!claiming you can not align before someone probes you out and tackles is a completely moronic statement. in short: you use sniping machariels and want to live in a risk-free environment. ok. no."
7/11/2011,"pretty easy to do actually. will not go into details, but we have been able to catch targets all the way down to frigs if they try to warp in at range.when it comes to bs. we tested and tried on the test server. and there are no way for anyone in a bs to warp in, align and get out if the people behind the probing/tackling have half a brain with them.for proof, you are welcome to bring a bs and test this out with us on the testserver at anytime."
7/11/2011,it`s to easy to get a position on a sniper. sniping is dead atm. unless you really want to loose your ship.
7/11/2011,"alright, perhaps my reply was phrased a bit.. let's put it this way:i think you have a somewhat valid concern, in so far as it is theoretically possible to catch a battleship that way in an optimal case scenario.as far as i am concerned, the problem isn't really the probe timer here, but the fact that ships are dropping out of warp much slower than they used to. as in: they do not move anymore but sit there too long after deceleration has already taken place.somehow i have a feeling the probing changes lately didn't really help, either.now, changing the probe timers because it is theoretically possible to catch sniper ships in this fashion (i'll believe you that it works in your test runs on sisi) and basically swing the balance the complete opposite way is really not the way to go.it would screw up combat probing - and i really doubt the problem you're trying to address here is much of a problem at all. at least in so far as it isn't very widespread. some of it could likely be prevented by smart use of bubbles, and if that doesn't do the trick: ecm support.making sniper ships uncatchable (or even substantially harder to catch) by giving them a more or less guaranteed chance to align out before something lands on them is not ""allowing you to use them"", but makes it mandatory to use them.currently there's advantages and drawbacks to sniper ships, and i'd really like to keep it that way.thank you for taking my earlier, rather unpleasant rant calmly."
7/11/2011,increasing warp-to boundary to 200-250km makes a lot more sense and doesn't negatively impact nearly as much as a combat probe nerf would.added tears from the thousands of people with tacticals spaced 151km around a million gates only sweetens the deal
7/11/2011,"no worries.i`ll try and explain a little better.when i was referring to us catching targets all the way down to frig sizes, that was done on tq, before the eccm/unprobable nerf. that was not done on sisi.the sisi test was us trying to see if there was any way to engage something if there was scanprobes deployed.conclusion after multiple testruns was that if there was any probes deployed it would be impossible to engage without loosing snipers. the group who was set up to try and catch the snipers basically had a 100% success rate in tackling them."
7/11/2011,"confirming black legiondot don't use sniper hacs (muninns yo.), and that most large fleets aren't composed of alpha battleships which come in at long distances...lolwait... they do, and they are...flying sniper setups hasn't changed to be honest.you just failed to adapt, and so your way of gaming has died out.live with it, or change it and start flying them again in a different way."
7/11/2011,longer scan times for combat probes will break w-space combat probing. everyone is constantly staring at directional scanner around here so making it take even longer to scan people down will suck.
7/11/2011,always dictors can be brought to block path with bubbles...
7/11/2011,sad face is sad.i wanted them for my minnie ships...but i do fly caldari too.
7/11/2011,"as an amarr pilot who uses grouped guns, it becomes a real annoyance when the guns are loaded with brand new and unused tech 2/faction crystals when you chose to reload with used crystals. the group mixes up used and new crystals.this becomes a problem when each gun has different damage on their crystals. when one crystal breaks in the group, it stops firing, until you reload a new crystal. i would much prefer that all the guns have equal damages on the crystals so i know when i have to reload it."
7/11/2011,"i agree that it should not do so ideally. it may have to do with the sort order, or lack of a sort order, of a cargo hold when loading. as a work around, you could use a small can and keep unused crystals in the can. drop in a few smaller cap charges to fill up the space."
7/11/2011,"can we have a special forum dedicated to specifically to afk cloaking please ? it's taking me so much time searching for all those delicious tears, that all i manage to do in game these days is sit afk-cloaked :("
7/11/2011,"heh :) i do similar stuff occasional, but normally im not afk i look around for potential targets - or just watch fail stuff"
7/11/2011,i logged all my accounts today just to afk cloak as many systems as i can
7/11/2011,"with all the outcry over the ""monocle"" and the clothesi had an idea that ccp could let chars have a planet named after them for a feeit would not be game breaking and if ccp need to raise funds then this imo is a far better way of doing itim sure ppl in low sec, null sec or wh space would possibly buy into thisit's a bit of a mad idea, but imo its better than a monocle"
7/11/2011,"nice to see ideas of non game breaking aur stuff, however this could be a problem if 2 people try and name 1 planet, or if a planet suddenly has a foreign name, imagine an fc trying to tell people warp to planet 10 when its now named in russian - kinda nice idea but i dont think it works"
7/11/2011,"this would be the problem, however if names where held to a strict standard i could see this idea working."
7/11/2011,"soooooooo... lemme get this straight...you want to introduce what is tantamount to price fixing because you don't like how people treat the in-game market as a game.yeah, not buying it. if people want to ruin the profitability of others because they can... let them. this is the in-game economic version of ""lock the victim's wreck in high-sec if he/she has been suicide ganked."""
7/11/2011,"i can't agree with you on this.when you see someone list items at a very low price you see it as a negative. i see it as someone needing isk quickly or ignorant of the items true value and thus as an opportunity to get hold of cheap stock that can be re-listed at a better price, shipped to a more profitable market or just stored until the price recovers."
7/11/2011,"i do not support this.i think you are pretty far off on your theory of how pricing and value work. supply and demand are only two factors. there is also time as a factor. someone might sell something cheaper because they need the isk quicker. compound this with market speculation as a factor. a player might see the impending market crash and offer their product at a very cheap price in order to sell out and cut losses. market speculation also affects rising prices like when marketers prepare for hulkageddon. but what it all really comes down to is what something is worth. sure, to some extent, players don't pay as much attention to the price of things, but it's because they have a surplus of isk. the same as real money, nobody wants isk, isk has no value to them, they want the things it can get them. so they let isk go at a rate slightly less than what the product is worth to them. value is subjective though and it works both ways. i might have a bunch of product that has no value for me and i need isk quickly and really badly to buy the product that does have value to me while it is still at a low price.you are taking the stance that market players are taking a loss when they set a low price, but you are not looking at it from a subjective standpoint. to them, it wasn't a loss, that's why they thought to do it. let them punish themselves for not maximizing their gains. the invisible hand will balance it out like usual."
7/11/2011,"some prices don't recover though.. for example, navy dominix used to sell for around 420mil when i first started in the militia; then for a while they stabilised around 360mil... now you're lucky to get 320mil :(fed navy comets were at 27mil for a while.. not at 24 or less..just means i gotta be patient, or smarter and sell drones or modules instead **edit** or i could go around killing people flying navy dominix so they have to buy more - increasing demand, how fast they sell, and hopefully driving prices back up"
7/11/2011,"precisely. and the op should not fool himself into thinking this doesn't happen in real life. i personally know of 2 rivaling video stores nearby: one legit, the other, two doors further down the street, set up by a guy who doesn't like the owner of the other store. he rents his videos for a much lower prices. estimated losses for him? around $10,000,000 a year. may seem like a lot of money to us; but to some it's just pocket change to annoy a rival with.hence, not supported. reason: market 'working as intended.'"
7/11/2011,eve's market is effectively no different than real markets. with the exception of an abnormally high wealth to poor ratio.
7/11/2011,"companies do this. it is called dumping. in extremely obvious cases, companies get in trouble for it.manufacturing in eve has many flaws. the main one being the lack of differentiation, making most products stuck as large volume commodities (which irl are often manipulated by those with vast capital), while others get crazy pricing consistent with precious commodities (and thus dramatic price fluctuations like we see with precious metals and gems).again, like real life, this is due to commoditization.brokers run markets like games. eve's market is very realistic when you realize that it is a commodity market.... like commodities. check what is going on with aluminum, gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, and petroleum right now for real world examples of the market fluctuation you are complaining about.actually, in the real world, there is sale price deviation. the ""price"" you see is nothing more than the last completed sale price. in eve, any given commodity has less volume (mostly due to distributed sales) than irl commodity sales. so the deviation is easier to see. even in jita, you find a 5-10% break between most buy/sell orders.rather than putting complicated price controls on the market, it would make more sense to broaden the ability to remotely buy items, thus removing a lot of the distribution deviation, thus tightening up sale deviation. the next step would be breaking the commoditization of sale items."
7/11/2011,"don't like what your item is selling for? buy them out and re-list, or move your stuff to where you would get a ""fair price"".all i'm hearing from you is, ""waaaah! someone is undercutting the items i want to sell. i can't make a profit. ccp fix it please! waaah!"""
7/11/2011,"i agree, companies do dumping its however not legal and usually results in intervention by the sec. in eve there is no sec and no regulation on the market functionality to prevent dumping and market manipulation. ------------------------i was expecting the cash in people to complain. people crashing the market because they want to cash in quickly is exactly what this post is about. its like you crashing the auto market because you want to sell off your bmw really fast...never going to happen. removing quick cash people from the live market, removing their ability to affect it is what this post is about. so if your argument is that you want to cash in your stock of hurricanes fast, do it via contract.--------------------------------------im not sure how many people know this but large volume special sales of oil, grain, coffee, gas, etc happen through special contracts. these are special discount or premium plus deals which are done between two or more individuals / companies who agree on certain terms. i do this for a living actually, and im very good at it and this is why i bring up the subject.selling items well below market prices exist in the real exchange markets but these orders are not public, they are only triggered once the market prices reach that price. if the market price is 100 for an item, you cannot sell it at 95 on the market directly. you can only do it via contracts, called options. what drives the price down on the real market is the amount of sellers vs the buyers, not the seller dropping the price but the buyers offering less because of various reasons. its the buyer who dictates the prices....you know...the bid (buyer) / ask (seller).to answer your commodity market fluctuation, eve is not the case. large price fluctuations in the real market happen due to special events, interpretations and such and are cause by large sell-offs or buy-outs at market prices which rise/fall based on the speed for demand or supply of each goods. special events cause the speed at which supply and demand unfold to increase 10 times over.you are never going to see someone just giving you a 10% discount on their oil shares. its rather small increments moving the price down incredibly fast, across millions of transactions. its not just one dumbass deciding to cash in quickly, which the above people dont get.selling items below market prices on a regular basis only happens in what we call sub-markets, like you trading your games in or selling your stereo. that and black markets, but cashing in quickly there, has no effect on the market. in eve it does. eve market is the above mixed with a semi-simulation of nyse.people needing isk quickly is not a reason to screw with the market prices. im not saying to now allow them to do it, im saying to remove them from live markets.-----------------------------------eve's market is not realistic for a great many reasons, too many to list here. -----------------------------------im not complaining about price fluctuations, im complaing about fluctuations happening for the wrong reasons in eve, which ive listed above. in commodities markets rules apply, very strict rules. no rules in eve.-----------------------------------the price controls i proposed are very simple and would be extremely effective. they would prevent people from ""dumping"" crap on the market and playing by its rules if they want to participate in it. contract it instead.your comments about deviation has nothing to do with what im talking about. the buyers have the right offer what they want, seller the same. the bid and ask spread is dictated by market conditions and world events, not by a single individual (which can happen but its illegal).------------------------------------being a commodity market does not change the rules. the forces are still the same. read here."
7/11/2011,"this isnt about a fair price or the right price. its about mechanics. go to school or something...or stfu, troller."
7/11/2011,"the big difference vs the real market is that there is no bankrupcy, there is no invisible hand. please read my post again."
7/11/2011,um..no. looks like you were never working in the real market.
7/11/2011,"you're still not presenting a convincing argument on why the system as it stands should be changed.right now... all i'm seeing is, ""this is what's happening in eve's market, it is bad, it needs to be more like the real world markets, introduce controls so people can't mess with it.""so i will ask...why should people not be allowed to play games with or 'firesale' things on the market because it means little to them?"
7/11/2011,"oh, look. it's another, ""other players aren't playing the way i want them to. make them play the way i want them to,"" suggestion."
7/11/2011,"well, its kind of like why should people not be allowed to use doomsday weapons, cap ships, or bombs in high sec. both questions have the same answer. balanced game environment"
7/11/2011,"you are missing my point. the way to deal with this type of behavior is by reducing the 500,000 (estimate) different exchanges people can trade on in eve. as the exchanges consolidate, the price fluctuations will decrease. i mean, if you are worried about dumping, let buy orders cover constellations by default and the purchases consolidate in the issuing system. bang. suddenly there are plenty of buy orders to soak up the small market dumps people do. besides, the market price for things in eve is so ridiculously easy to manipulate with the current system, your suggestion would likely create an even bigger problem. let's say i want to kill an alliance. if i have a couple billion isk, i could get into their region, buy all their preferred ammo, set sell orders and buy orders at a magnitude higher than a reasonable price, then invade. suddenly, they are stuck with whatever ammo they have in their holds/hangars. suddenly they are flat footed, unable to rearm to bash the couple dozen sbus we dropped. with only a few billion isk, someone could seriously cripple almost any alliance in the game with your mechanic."
7/11/2011,some of us think that traditional economics are better suited for a hyper-capitalist game environment like eve than keynesian.deal with it. vov
7/11/2011,"umm...i disagree. consolidation of market hubs doesnt change anything. the behaviour i was talking about is strickly per sandbox system/region/universe. having only 1 wont change anything. you have the mechanism which allows said behavior..and the scenario you are suggesting is rather silly, so i wont comment on it anymore."
7/11/2011,"you're still pushing this? look, this is such a naively devised notion that it doesn't even begin to warrant the vaguest of consideration.this is... hilariously idiotic. so, what happens when some jita trader with a few billion to spare decides to buy up all of the stock of, say, warp disruptor iis, then puts up a single unit for a billion isk? what now? someone is forced to buy that unit for a billion isk to fix the ****up your genius plan caused? or, nobody gets to buy warp disruptor iis until another 700+ orders are placed (which is how many it would take to bring the price back to where it presently is) to drop the price by a hair at a time? and, of course, everyone else gets to pay taxes on 1b*.99, 1b*.99^2, 1b*.99^3, etc., all the way down the line. the amount of tears you could wring out of people (for the low, low price of 5 billion isk) would be well worth it, and you would eventually get most, or possibly even in excess of 100%, of the money back. what happens when they set the price to a trillion? ten trillion? a hundred trillion?yeah, that would be so much better. you've totally prevented any one person from doing awful things to the market."
7/11/2011,"yet another afk cloak thread, i'm just going to paste in the same response as i made in the last one.this.its not a hard thing to do and if your corp or alliance isn't organized enough to have this sort of system running i suggest you find another. afk cloaking is not a major problem and has the beneficial side effect of keeping bots out of action which i feel more than makes up for any minor annoyance it may cause those of a more fragile disposition."
7/11/2011,the afk cloaker is not disrupting anything. you are by being a frackin fearmong.
7/11/2011,the afk cloaker is the only counter to bots.the only person who is reasonably affected by an afk cloaker is a botter.every other person is capable of asking for help from corp/alliance if the cloaker turns out to be active.
7/11/2011,anything that is done to nerf cloaks has to be countered by an improvement in the ability of active players to hunt you. so what are you willing to give up?
7/11/2011,"here is an idea, make local low and null sec. just like local in wormhole space. if you don't speak up, you aren't listed. if a person is not seen in local, and they are cloaked, then there is nothing to complain about for oen simple reason, local didn't tell you they were there in the first place."
7/11/2011,the only problem with that is there is too much you can find in null and local without the use of probes. this would tip the scale too far in the attackers favor.even delaying local as little as 1 minute could allow a single ship to slip in and get to a few belts before he is noticed. at least in wh space they have to work to find you.
7/11/2011,"0.0 is supposed to be dangerous. to survive in 0.0, you can't go it alone - you need a corporation. you need an alliance. you need friends to watch your back, while you watch theirs. if you want to go into 0.0 and solo mine, solo rate, solo anom, then you're doing it wrong.the whole local / cloaking system is broken. local provides far too much intel, not just in relation to cloaking, but also in relation to finding enemy fleets. local intel needs to be removed, and a new system needs to be implemented.1) local should only display people who have recently chatted in local.2) implement a module (similar to smart bomb, but 0 damage) that can decloak cloaky ships within x km (20-25 km?).3) implement sentries. sentries can be deployed / anchored and have no propulsion of their own. sentries should alert the player who owns them as long as the player is in the system of any ships within a 100 km radius of the sentry (filterable, does not detect cloaked ships, does not detect transitions from gate cloak to regular cloak), and/or whether the sentry is under attack. a single pilot should be able to destroy a sentry in about 60-90 seconds. a player can only deploy one sentry at a time. sentries can be deployed near gates / stations.i can't claim i've thought of everything here... i am still fairly new to eve. but i think the above steps would be a good start in the right direction.edit - sentries reporting gate fire is a dumb idea.edit 2 - i know, the name ""sentry"" is already taken by some drones. w/e, the concept is still the same."
7/11/2011,"another cloak thread? must be the season for them.not supported even though i do prefer this to the standard ""afk cloaker"" rant thread.personally i much prefer this suggestion [proposal] -100% to capacitor recharge time while cloaked which only effects non covert ops cloaks."
7/11/2011,as long as i can also have a fuel that keeps me off local chat.
7/11/2011,not this again. :(no!
7/11/2011,i guess reading comprehension was never your strong point was it?

7/11/2011,"""the way the meetings are held and the conversations we have with the devs take place in a manner that is not appropriate for public consumption. when we tell ccp they are <insert expletive here> for doing this or that, it takes place within a certain context and an understanding of what is meant.""then i suggest that you adopt a more professional approach to the meetings and curb your language. i read the reports of the ""fireside chat"" recently held. the thought of wading through hours of cursing, swearing and indecent remarks determined me not to listen. for crying out loud, if the reports of the language in a fireside chat are to be believed i would hate to think what pillow talk must be like.it is generally said that resorting to foul and abusive language denotes either a limited vocabulary/intelligence or contempt for those at which it is directed. i hope that neither is true in the case of csm. if you cannot express yourself without resorting to such language then i don't think that i want you as my representatives.what you are really saying is that we must take on trust that you are doing the job that we elected you to do. ok. benefit of the doubt etc. but please be aware that trust is earned not demanded and if you continue to act as if the whole exercise of the csm is for your edification and gratification alone then i'm sorry, the trust will not be there. i speak from experience of being the minutes secretary at large, rowdy and heated public meetings as well as committee ones. try and keep the redactions to an absolute minimum, if any, and always bear in mind that you are not solely there as individuals but the players' representatives and conduct yourselves accordingly. sorry, the last bit is pompous and maybe obvious but i feel that it had to be said."

7/12/2011,there is still a csm?i thought there was just a mittani now.i'm a little bit coked up on lies and propaganda right now i'm afraid i won't be in attendance.
7/12/2011,does csm know how vanity items survive being podkilled? cause ccp wont answer my thread :(
7/12/2011,"csm knows more than ccp, as ccp are clueless (like fearless, just not quite the same). they dont answer questions, csm does. everything that csm says can be later denied, as they are not ccp employees. meanwhile ccp cant even post a decent informative devblog. so i gues.. 10x csm?"
7/12/2011,"don't hold your breath waiting for soe to get back to you.so is this ""chat"" just the latest directive from soe to get us to argue about something, anything not about the last few weeks? get some attention off soe and get a couple of wedge issues into the community so we resume the ""usual"" fighting each other and not them?"
7/12/2011,"they do this because if worn clothing was destructible, nobody would ever undock wearing any nex-store goods.and because nullsec folks tend to be in danger of being podded, this means they would not buy fancy monocles, because they would always be putting them on and taking them off -- too much of a pain.and if ccp decided to address this by making it easy to change clothes (so you had party clothes and work clothes), then apart from the occasional person who forgets to change clothes before undocking, you'd never have an opportunity to grief someone and blow up their monocle anyway.afaik this will not apply to items like ship paintjobs, only to clothes and other bodily adornments."
7/12/2011,"ummmm hello csm person.this is eve from my recollection, the same place my first retriever was ganked while mining, missions ninja'ed and been podded quite a bit in null sec.why does some rich **** get special treatment for a novelty trinket over my implants?it is ""fair"" or just that soe (ccp) want to train people into the consequence free land of mt?"
7/12/2011,"that sounds like a very good way to solve all recent problems. don't let people who buy this crap undock, thus keeping them out of our spaceship game.it's the perfect solution."
7/12/2011,"i (personally) would argue that the difference is that your implants have in-game effects.the whole point of the nex store is to generate income. non-destructible clothes are almost certainly revenue-optimal. and clearly, non-destructible items cannot be allowed to have in-game effects without breaking the sandbox.put all these things together and non-destructibility is the best route for sandbox purists, because it draws a line in the sand, so to speak."
7/12/2011,"that makes no sense, thats like saying no one would pvp in an expensive ship/mods because they run the risk of getting blown up. thats kinda the whole point of eve.even though ccp have stated that making money isnt the point of this (as stated by a dev), the reason that they are willing to implement an item which does not follow the laws of eve at all for the sake of money? didnt this bother you guys at all? surely the csm could see how this makes no sense, given that anything else in the game can be destroyed, and you actually are ok with people having items that can magically transport from one station to another?edit: props to you still trebor for your quick and detailed reply, so far 2 and a half days and ccp havent explained how vanity items are magically transported from one station to another. i would really like the same service everytime i shop in jita, seeing as its somehow possible in the eve world to do it with vanity items."
7/12/2011,"not at the current prices, you're right... however, at the current prices i'd imagine that almost no-one's going to buy them anyway...honestly, i've said it before, i think the whole pricing structure is absolutely pathetic. indestructible clothes have no place in (my) eve.if the prices were cut right down, so that the transactions were actually ""micro"", i'd have no problem at all risking nex goodies in pvp; hell it'd only add to the thrill."
7/12/2011,"doesn't this just contradict what you said about ship paint jobs?if someone wants to buy a barbie dress ups from the space shopping network then more power to them. they can look at themselves in their mirror all day long.however, what if i want to target people wearing barbie air hostess costumes? people either have it with them or not. i can't agree that these things should be magical. after all, i'll be able to target custom painted ships. running with your logic might not destroy the sandbox, but it certainly lets the local cats **** in it."
7/12/2011,"what a load of bull****. if you want to generate income you create destructible items so they can be blown up so people have to buy new ones.you really have no clue about this. it's obvious and you're not doing yourself a favor by pretending you do.jesus, they are even talking about built in obsolescence in the fearless newsletter as one of the best things to do. that's the antithesis of indestructible items.go away."
7/12/2011,and this is how the csm works.soe (ccp) party line all the way.
7/12/2011,"if cost is a factor, maybe they should make implants and officer mods indestructible too. oh wait, that's a dumb idea, just like arbitrarily setting these items indestructible."
7/12/2011,some people are always going to want to find something to complain about thank you for the announcement. i am looking forward to those may notes.
7/12/2011,"hybrids/gallente, ja?"
7/12/2011,"the last sentence sounds nice but doesn't make any sense.i see how non-destructible clothes are better from a revenue perspective but nothing you said did explain how they are better than fully destructible clothes from the ""sandbox purist""'s pov.unless you want to argue ""if ccp does not earn enough with vanity items they will start selling convenience and advantages""..."
7/12/2011,"yeah, like we just found out that the person who should be discussing the players stance on the economic impacts the latest expansion has on the sandbox does not understand the most basic economic premises and instead repeats ccp's catastrophic and wrong stance.that's the something we just found. we found out that we're ****ed. nothing more, nothing less."
7/12/2011,i'll make it even easier for everyone to see that trebor is not competent to discuss this by asking the following question:what is revenue-optimal?there. see what i just did? i just called him out on using a completely meaningless term.
7/12/2011,csm towing the company line. this is why you're irrelevant.
7/12/2011,"only for some, well off people wouldn't care, at current stupid nex prices. at reasonable prices more people would undock with clothes accepting it as a risk just as they do with anything they undock with.vanity items do have in game effects as well as out of game effects, creating a 'elite' class and relegating those not participating in the dress up to status of 'poor' pod pilots. in a game where you're value could be any number of things incarna will start out with class divisions to obviously make many look like poor slobs, certainly seems like a great way to make eve 'real' and increase immersion. some will care and some won't, in some cases the 'elite' will the butt of many jokes and harassment but in others it will be the reverse this obviously is excellent gameplay to add in eve and most assuredly extremely important to walking in stations. as far as griefing people it would be more about the grief than the monocle out in space, sort of like blacklisting, cause that is just about the only 'value' nex pricing/items 'adds' to the game. chase down the monocle wearers, kill them where you find them, deny them access to your corp, make them pariahs. with their precious nex items safe from being destroyed griefing them nets ccp no extra money from destroyed crap that needs to be replaced."
7/12/2011,"with respect, i must disagree.1) non-destructible items can be sold at higher prices than destructible ones (although we can all agree that the prices ccp settled upon were in most cases wrong).2) there are broadly speaking two populations in eve -- carebears who rarely get podded, and thus rarely would have to rebuy their destructible clothes, and pvpers who are always getting podded, and thus (given the annoyance-factor of having to undress/redress) would rarely buy them in the first place. nobody who is getting podded every week is going to buy a monocle.thus, by making clothing non-destructible, you increase your income from both groups. i would prefer there to be a strong precedent in place, to reduce future temptation. it is the set of conditions and prices that generates the greatest income. i have some small experience with pricing of goods with little or no marginal cost-of-goods-sold; you may be interested in a brief paper i wrote on the subject over a decade ago; not entirely on point, but there are analogies."
7/12/2011,"the actual reason why these items will remain invincible is really rather simple:if they were destructible, people would simply undress them before undocking. the consequence would be a lot of stress on the item database and a lot of whining from people who frown at swapping their vanaity **** around all the time to avoid losses.making them destructible wouldn't accomplish anything, really. nobody would gain, devtime would be invested for no tangible effect on gameplay. cpu would be wasted with just as little effect. it would be nothing but a cash sink."
7/12/2011,"everyone has opinions. all you do is try to berate people in most posts you make no matter what the subject. so yeah, i do not listen to a word you say. i believe most people can see through the poison you are trying to spread."
7/12/2011,"we're talking about revenue here. revenue is the product of price times number of sales. ignoring the second part of the equation does not really improve my view of your economic capabilities.using this approach anything can be justified. broadly speaking this is even more bull****, no facts, no statistics, nothing. i'd even argue that there are more than two populations. broadly speaking, that is.scanned over it. it's about tipping and intellectual property. barely any numbers included, no graphs, no formulae, no link to raw data. no references to other scientific papers. and it's three pages long.you wrote that in school and it does not apply to the topic at hand. you have no clue about this.the fact that you're even linking to that so called 'paper' to prove your point tells me you're delusional about the amount of your scientific expertise. thus i repeat my initial point. we're ****ed."
7/12/2011,see that's the problem. you think these are opinions and you 'believe' stuff.
7/12/2011,"all your doing yarrrrrhh is showing the entire eve forum community that you my friend are an arse :)ccp will always generate extra revenue by making certain nex items indestructible because many people will refuse to pay real money for items that can be lost by a suicide ganker.even if the item in question was only a few pounds it still does not matter as you as by the very nature of eve, anybody can destroy anybody else.on top of that, like another poster has already stated, if they could be destroyed all that is going happen is people are going to complain that everytime they undock they are going to have remove the items and they will stop buying items.as for the argument regarding implants.. they have a direct effect in game where as clothes do not.can't see any issue here other then people complain for the sake of it."
7/12/2011,"i will try to be there, seriously hope that the csm can push for some change, latest expansion/month was hardly a ""comunication/pr issue"" or ""bad luck"", currently game has stalled, is filled with unfihished or useless content, ccp seems focused elsewhere and the forums/comunity just suck with all the complaints going on.people aren't shooting statues anymore, this has evolved into a general feeling of dissatisfaction that is corrosive."
7/12/2011,"some players actually have some sort of pride. i understand that feeling must be alien to you but trust me, those players would undock with destructible nex clothes, showing the people around them how badass they are by wearing what they're wearing while flying ships that make it hard to be ganked."
7/12/2011,"the election is over you guys won. why keep campaigning with this townhall type electioneering?why doesn't the csm ever communicate with the players on the forums ccp set up for this very purpose? jita park has been almost empty since csm 5 left. not everyone can make it for your fireside chat. moreover these sorts of chats don't allow others to follow up and get more of an in depth idea of what you are doing. we are stuck with your canned soundbite responses. pretty lame stuff csm6! oh yeah and it doesn't help after mittani's first communication to the players after you ""emergency summit"" was ""nevermind those leaked memos"" i guess we have to assume you all agree with what he said since you never posted anything in response to him as individuals."
7/12/2011,so when is gold ammo coming out?i need a lowe to farm up some isk.
7/12/2011,tune into the fireside chat to listen to csm's soundbite for you concerns. will that make you happy? csm surely won't address that in any substantive way - like on the forums.
7/12/2011,"lol.. man you are a hell of a comedian.by the way, where are the these people you speak of?"
7/12/2011,"i think these fireside chats are a great thing, but as another poster said, they should't be replacing other more long term forms of back and forth communication between csm and players (i.e. forums). i feel that a lot more csm representation should be happening on the forums, jita park specifically. it's been mostly a ghost town for months now."
7/12/2011,"did you forget to add that he only expects ""his voters only"" to attend?"
7/12/2011,"i wrote that based on the experience of running a website using the model, a website that is still around and quite nicely profitable. and sorry to disappoint you, but not only was i not in school when i wrote it, but i had the benefit of 20 years of experience doing marginally relevant things like writing computer games and helping to create the anime market in the us.bottom line: you are entitled to your opinion, but until you lay down some facts to support them, they are unlikely to convince anyone.ps: the may minutes are now available."
7/12/2011,no arguing on that. that's absolutely valid. so what's your next step now that you've agreed that your former statements are unconvincing?
7/12/2011,"so plex are destructible, but monocles are not.neither has a direct impact on the game, and arguably neither are cheap. there is no ~real~ reason to haul plex around rather than convenience and yet people still do it despite the fact they are destructible.what makes virtual clothing different, and therefor exempt from the same rules as every other item in the game?"
7/12/2011,"snake sets cost multiple times the amount of what a monocle costs. people still use them. people fly faction fit golems which have a paper tank as well, which are worth a lot more than monocles.the whole argument of ""if nex would be destructible nobody would buy it"" is just utter bull****, disproven by items in game right now that are worth more than them.it's such a shame that we're represented by people who deny that."
7/12/2011,"by following that logic we should all have to buy new clothes (starter ones too) everytime we get podded; and don't try to say ""oh, but they are stater clothes so they should be free!"" 'cause it makes no sense when some of the starter ones look better then the nex ones. if you grant me this then i agree to your argument.also, you are quite selective with what you quote and most of times only reply to part of an argument, i'd recommend you don't do that since it makes it look like you are dodging the question, which you are not, are you?edit: crap posted with alt."
7/12/2011,are we allowed to ask for low sec or fw related stuff ?
7/12/2011,"you're just proving how bad this whole concept is. it doesn't make sense as it is right now. at all. shoes for the price of multiple battleships just don't make sense. no matter how you twist it. nex failed, ccp failed, the whole concept is flawed. i'm just pointing out that the people who defend nex can't even justify it with economic means."
7/12/2011,spaceships are expensive. if ccp continues to allow ships to be destroyed no one who buys an expensive ship will ever undock. this injustice must be addressed!
7/12/2011,"yes, of course, they will have a soundbite prepared for that as well. if it will make you happy to hear the soundbite make sure you show up."
7/12/2011,"trebor, is it more ""revenue-optimal"" to sell 10 $100 monocles or 1,000 $15 monocles?"
7/12/2011,"er .. just make them cheaper and destructible. it's very un eve to have an implant that ""as if by magic"" is the only thing to survive a podding (in game effects or not). if the items were much cheaper and destructible, the loss of income from price would be made up for by a) ppl replacing lost items and b) players with less money actually buying nex store goods. but.. there's the added benefit of keeping the eve purists happy and making a lot of players who feel disenfranchised by the nex current store prices (i know dramatic lol) happier that they now get to participate, where only the self proclaimed ""elite"" could. and consider this... eve is about risk/reward right ? i see you point out that vanity items have no in game effects. true ofc, but that doesn't mean they have no in game ""reward"", if they did not, exactly why would anyone bother to buy them ? the massive monocle trollfest was enough to clearly prove the fact that folks get an enormous amount of fun from the monocle, that is a rewardwhere's the risk ??"
7/12/2011,this! so much this!
7/12/2011,snake sets improve your combat ability. they have a use.people fly faction fit golems because faction modules are more efficient or powerful.the second part of your post is completely irrelevant. useless monocles are not estamel invulnerability fields.(p.s. stop double-posting. you're giving the forums literally twice the amount of whining.)
7/12/2011,"^^this, i need some more isk fast."
7/12/2011,do we all need a fireplace screensaver for the event?i will be there to listen
7/12/2011,monocles give an instant 500% bonus on ****ing people off. they're not useless you peasant.
7/12/2011,"currently risk is obviously showing people you are a tool who'd rather have a monocle than put that plex money towards something good like 'plex for good', rewarding a new pilot or something really useful like a ship you fit and fly for fun so someone else can ruin your fun.then there is the small chance people will harass the monocled fool in game, griefing etc.finally in forums 2.0 people can ignore everything monocle wearing trolls ever say, simply because they wear a monocle. so long buddy!"
7/12/2011,the only question i have is this- when is the next election coming up for new csm's ?
7/12/2011,really? because ccp keep denying precisely that. is this a personal view or something that ccp told you? if it is a personal view then have you challenged ccp on the fact that you think they are lying to us? if it is something you heard from ccp then have you challenged them on the fact that they either lied to you when telling you this or they are currently lying to the players when they deny this (e.g. zinfandel's devblog answers p. 1)?
7/12/2011,"hmmm. there are so many good reasons to be ticked off at this csm, i just don't see either the destructibility of worn vanity items or the price of vanity items on that list.but yeah, if you want to be ****ed off at the right people for the wrong reasons, glhf. i'm sure they are thrilled that you want to blow your wad on this crap and not talk about what matters."
7/12/2011,"sounds like a personal problem...you want to destroy them because you don't like monocles, they **** you off... boohoo...stop trolling these forums, you're awful at it. the only ""bad"" part of keeping these items indestructible is that people like you can't enjoy smashing them to bits... but what if it wasn't a monocle? how would you even be able to tell that he's got vanity shoes or pants? are you going to look at every avatar pic in the hopes to get a glimpse of what shirt he's wearing? come on, be serious! you're just a whining arse who cries when he doesn't get what he wants! now to be on topic, i'm very eager to attend this csm q/a!"
7/12/2011,i could not care less what a csm has to say or 'not' say.
7/12/2011,"i am very interested in hearing your clear, concise knowledge. please, teach me.and yaahhhr, i see what youre saying, you think people will have no problem spending money on ridiculously overpriced vanity items. the problem is, youre quite wrong. even going back to you risk/reward nonsense, there is no reward to having a 2b isk shirt/pants/eyepiece combo on your character when u pvp, shuttle around, stationspin...err station-door in jita. even bringing up multi-billion isk snake implants, or multi-billoin isk ships in some attempt to compare how expensive things can get in pvp.... completely shows u miss the point ccp is trying to convey. sure, my pvp char has billions upon billions of ships/implants/mods, and the entire purpose of having those things is to hold a greater chance of achieving my objective. killing, while not dying. clothes in no way will decrease my chance at dying, and if anything, make the chance go up, with the griefer-fun to be had even if/if not the clothes were destructible. would i, with 2b isk in my head, at least 1.5b isk on my hull, waste yet another 1.5b in space-dressup if i know i can lose it? no. no i would not. no reward. all risk.indestructible clothes? sure, why not, i got the isk!!ccp wins."
7/12/2011,you apparently don't know how a precedent is set. they sell indestructible items in a game where everything is destructible. regardless of what that item is the precedent is that it can and will be done to more and more items to get as many people as possible to buy.precedents on slippery slopes are worthless when the bottom line is the determining factor.....period.shame on the people who voted for this buffoon.
7/12/2011,"honestly, i'm getting sick of asking, this is like the 4th 5th (?) time i've asked, but can we please get a transcript of the fireside chats. i cannot listen to the fireside chats because i am deaf."
7/12/2011,naked.in.your.pod.
7/12/2011,what about monocles?
7/12/2011,"have you considered that maybe they are removable?oh and, why isn't there any up in space?man, i'll say it again, you're really bad at trolling."
7/12/2011,last (and only other) fireside chat was nothing but the mittani show. will be skipping it this time. really don't feel like wasting couple hours of my life listening to that total complete dumb ass.
7/12/2011,"with respect amazon disagrees.they have been quite successful going for volume over markup. sure nobody wants to pay 60 bucks for a destructible item, but would people pay 5 bucks for a destructible item? probably.and market saturation means nothing if the cheap item is destructible or suffers from decay, only people who refrain from playing eve will keep their swag while the others will lose and purchase more.going for the jugular is just stupid, vanity items will be in demand always so why not be smart about it and go for volume sales over gutting the players wallet on a one shot deal?"
7/12/2011,"oh no you didn't. you did not just call ccp and trebor stupid for not understanding micro-transactions, the long tail effect and how to adequately price vanity items in that context.you did not call them stupid!... or did you."
7/12/2011,"ill call them weapons grade stupid on vanity pricing. they had it close with destructable, just also needed plex to break into 35000 aur at current pricing.i completely understand the hobby analogy, but bait and switching new subs, or gosh people who invested years into the game are actually correct no matter how vehemently the csm is apathetic on the topic, or ccp protecting the markets. they are wrong and subscriber numbers will prove it."
7/12/2011,"pointless, much like that emergency summit you had and the csm as a whole.congrats."
7/12/2011,"just read through the well detailed minutes. thank you for so much clarity.i would love to get more feedback from the csm on where they feel ccp betrayed trust, and we sit at the current toxic environment.i would love to speak to the much valued npe, as i just started in late march of this year and am on the fence about keeping my 2 accounts. i see nothing in the gooey center of development, just a lot of totally new trial account conversions and bitter vet retention.example..3 month old player who plays on daily basis attempts joining corp and doing incursion, mining in hisec, only to be wardecced and killed against our will.negotiated ransom with their ceo only to have them cancel wardec, then repeatedly get killed for 24 hours thanks to ccp bug? cancel means cancel right? ccp cant fix dishonorable douch e bag s but they can cancel something as advertised right? this alone has cost ccp 4 accounts of the highly valued new players.?..or are we just quickhit cashcows and churn is predictable? why not make wardec avail only in low sec and null. didnt i just read in the minutes lowsec is pointless? unless you call gatecamping amamake for minmatar carebears the desired result because you wont retain people trying to get into the game if they are permanently injured psychologically the first 10 times or so they try. think mma world champ fighting...you. over. and over. hurts dont it. come to washington and ill demonstrate."
7/12/2011,lowsec is far from pointless for the people that live there. gfs happen all the time in my area.
7/12/2011,"we really need more then 1 remap per year, so i totally endorse this, either it be by plex or just waiting for a timer to run out."
7/12/2011,i actually agree with this and don't believe it's as game breaking as those against make out.
7/12/2011,"how do they gather intel whilst afk?what other items to they gather whilst afk?how do they disrupt your activities whilst afk?i'd like honest, factual answers please."
7/12/2011,"so what your saying is that you should be able to go afk, record logs of local chat, see what ships come in and out of the system via fraps. see when the system is active and not active and be able to plan an attack all without needing to be at your computer to grab that intell.by changing it to where you can not afk cloak anymore and actually have to be there it allows you to gain better more accurate intell on the system and our response times. it allows you to actually lock down the system for the entire time your on vs a half an hour to an hour. what is better attack a system when there response time is a half an hour or attack that system when the response time is 2 minutes. if your set in the right position you also get to see what kind of ships we field for that defense.i am not asking that the cloak mechanic change or that we be able to find you. we are asking that it be changed to where you cant just cloak up and walk away from your computer all day and stay safe and gather the intell or cause a drop in production without actually being at your computer.intell, if you set it right you can read threw the logs when you come back, if you sit near a gate and use fraps, you can see what ships come in and out. by using fraps you can see how many folks are in local and what the active times are.items you of course wont gain any.disruption is easy, i dont know if they are afk or not, so rather then risk it and have 10 hulks out with 1 person doing protection, i now have 3 to 4 folks providing protection, this lowers productivity, and if you consider how much ore you have to mine to keep an industry level of 5 or 4 each day, that loss can and most times does mean the loss of that industry level.if i am going to online a pos in that system, it would be relativly stupid of me to do so without having protection while it is going up and getting onlined.ratting is also affected as we will most times not go out and rat due to the rats warp scraming us. the risk is to great of you having scanned us down and then dropping a cyno and us being unable to get away."
7/12/2011,please answer each question directly.
7/12/2011,"right, and we are just asking that you not be able to sit in your system all day making isk while having perfect intel to be able to run to station every time someone comes within 2 systems of you."
7/12/2011,"i have yet to see answers to why these aren't suitable ways to handle afk cloakers:d-scan for probeshave a gang of friends with you to protect youalso - as far as 'free intel' goes, if they can do it so can you. so your only argument is 'honor playing' - that is that players shouldn't be able to get things easy if they can. why not send your own cloakers to their systems? only you are halting operations, not them. you are being reactionary.here's another thought - do you operate in only one system? guess what? afk cloakers can't follow you, what a concept. move next door and mine there. if you're worried about hauling - you should have an escort anyways, so a cloaker won't matter. if you are in just one system, afk cloakers are the least of your concerns.nullsec and lowsec is not safe - no you didn't say it was - but you fail to realize how unsafe it is. yes, it really is that easy to get intel on you so you better be ready when that afk cloaker ends up being a hot drop when you least expect it. stressful? only if you make it so, but generally yes. unfair? not at all. can you do something about it? yeah - go find his corp and kick their ass. can't? sounds like you're either not ready for low/null, are a bot, or you don't have any friends to help you...which goes back to you're not ready for low/null."
7/12/2011,"if your cloaked and afk it is perfectly safe.mags i did answer each item, i was in the process of editing it when you posted most likly.thats my point though right there. nullsec and lowsec is not supposed to be safe. no offense but after a half hour or so the cloaker doesn't bother me. all he does is make me change my operations a little. if you are in a system and cloaked up it should halt operations, it should provoke a response, it should cause an element of danger to the people in that system.right now it after a half hour to an hour, guess what, while i had to change my operations and have things disrupted a little, i still continue. i want that danger in my system you show up and cloak, it should stop my operations in there tracks, i shouldn't feel safer in null sec then i do in frigging jita."
7/12/2011,"totally safe, yes of course it is. guess what, you still can't do anything but sit there and watch too. i'm seeing a cost/benefit here and thus no problem.even if the guy was probeable - he could just move around and still accomplish the exact same 'problem' of yours. he could do it hours on end too if he so chose. so again, you're only problem is 'honor playing' in that you can't stand that a player can accomplish a task with minimal effort.you know we also have mining industrials, jet-can mining, data cores, fw and lp (talk about a faucet), changing ships while fighting with an orca, jump bridges, super-carriers that can only be beat by more super-carriers...i'm seeing a trend of minimal effort with benefits. so i really don't see a problem with someone being able to show up, cloak up, be unprobeable, and sit there while they go play tennis with the neighbors. there are methods available (that you still haven't addressed) to ward against the threat of these people - gangs and d-scan the most obvious, system security is more applicable to alliances large enough to support such an endeavor, but those first two a gang of three can do."
7/12/2011,you try and say cloaking and hanging out in your system is not 'playing the game'. it's becoming clear that anything you don't like 'isn't playing the game' as you see it. well guess what - welcome to the sandbox. anything goes. so either adapt or die. the latter is a good option for you.
7/12/2011,"you know i just realized that even if you could probe out cloaks...i have a covops, thus it moves at a normal speed. i take said covops and fit it to go as fast as possible passively (since we can't use mwd or ab, right?)i now warp in, cloak up, double click past the star...and walk off....cruising along at however many hundred (maybe thousand?) m/s. given that i'm moving, though slow relative to the size of probe scans, even if you pinpointed my cloaked ship and warped in, by the time you arrive i'll be more than 25km away from your warp in...and continuing to fly further away in a straight line. so unless by sheer luck you manually fly right at me, you'll not bust my cloak. ta-da, i just became an afk cloaker that's probeable. unless ccp develops a ship that can bust cloaks that far out (which i can see 20km maybe, but 25+?) your problem remains.food for thought."
7/12/2011,"ha, i dunno why i didn't think to mention that, cause i do the same with non-cloaky small fast ship by powering along with my mwd. thus anyone trying to probe me out lands way the hell back that way *gestures over my shoulder*, giving me more than enough time to respond. or if they jump in cloaked they're too far off to catch me without a mwd while cloaked. either way i can see them coming a mile off.the upshot is the whole idea of making cloaked ships probable fails anyway.i also say that making cloaked ships would screw over many bigger, slower, more expensive ships who make not have a chance to survive, unless they can stay cloaked in a safe spot, while they figure a way out of a hostile system."
7/12/2011,"you can't rely upon chat logs for intel, it's an extremely unreliable intel source.fraps. you honestly want me to believe, that someone would create hours of fraps to watch later?you already said they do, why did you lie about that?but they are afk. how do they do all of this, whilst not at the keyboard?"
7/12/2011,"you haven't lived in a worm with an organized crew i take it? all holes are tagged almost at time of spawn and collapsing the potentially dangerous ones them takes very little effort.keep in mind that the ""real"" worm dwellers don't solo crap like you are probably used to, so a t3 gang poses no significant threat .. read the long story about the first entity to ever be kicked out of a worm .. took almost six months if i recall (r&k doing the deed i think).do try to keep up, already answered that question. difference between us seems to be that you want changes that benefit your chosen modus operandi at the expense of all others, whereas i aim for actual balance.removing local alone breaks more than fixes.ps: please stop thinking i have anything to do with the daisy-chain stroking that is null .. i saw the impending fiasco of dom before it was deployed and got out while the getting was good thank you very much.oh no, my solo ratting super-capital backbone!!!!1111you must be referring to supers, nothing else fits and nothing else would be impacted to any significant degree.guess what, supers shouldn't be out and about without support if they want to live. supers are alliance assets speaks not only about the cost but how they were intended to be used, the fact that any moron with half a brain can buy one with a couple of months of grinding does not really change that.would probeable cloaks make supers obsolete? hardly, a few would die in a fire after the change but then tactical changes are made .. like jumping with triage nrg-trans archons or forward bases (pos) along travel paths.would probeable cloaks make solo supers obsolete? most definitely, as they should be. that homogeneous super-blobs is even viable is ridiculous beyond belief and one of the reasons why they will be hit hard when the pendulum comes back."
7/12/2011,"not true all efected by thatos freeks, as botter in the same way just ratter, this days not so much good space to rat only 3-5 systems in all regions where is good anomalys. and from my expiriance mostly clouckers have cov cynos on them so par rating and fleet ratign dont change a **** and its still for that cloucker to easy get targets."
7/12/2011,"how do they gather intel whilst afk?boting wath els, so they geting intell on wath hapening in that system, bots geting intell, its not verry hard make soft with wil count up a ppl in sytem and if you put close to station otr to gate even direct scan rezutlts off ship types. what other items to they gather whilst afk?basicly main purpes fo thos is get inetel and get easy target you newer know hee is actiuve or hee is not actif but only a chance that soem one can sit in systme weeks witout sleep and eating somting, and geter intel all the time its inaf to get them out off system no easy mode for them to.how do they disrupt your activities whilst afk?how is ad newer know when hee beckoms active if hee beckoms active no change to safe your self, you wil be hot droped in seconds. so to easy get targets."
7/12/2011,"answres:1. d-scan for probesnot works usualy they booking sanctums havens befor you even geting them and scan down santum or heven no need probes. so no chanhe to see oprobes att all, hee can just simply warp from one sanctum or hevenm to ader at 100km see if there is osme one if is rewarop and atack you will not have even a chance to rpotect or call reinforcments you will be hot drops and died. even if you ratr with 5-6 ppl probably smalest wil exacape but alinign times to high to excape atall. i saa even with 2-3 distrupts such clouckers.2. have a gang of friends with you to protect youno point ot have them they wil have eny way biger force to counter you and frends.3. also - as far as 'free intel' goes, if they can do it so can you. so your only argument is 'honor playing' - that is that players shouldn't be able to get things easy if they can. why not send your own cloakers to their systems? only you are halting operations, not them. you are being reactionary.meny off them even dont have systems and oppareting from npc space so wherre you will send your couckers :) in to empire or npc 0.0 space and wath you wil disturp there afk siting pvper chars with are siting in stations until they play in high sec msion runing with ader chars :) 4. here's another thought - do you operate in only one system? guess what? afk cloakers can't follow you, what a concept. move next door and mine there. if you're worried about hauling - you should have an escort anyways, so a cloaker won't matter. if you are in just one system, afk cloakers are the least of your concerns.you even know how much systems left for good ratign in space thos can cover even small alince clouckers i dont talk about biger ones. so you have in region only like max 10 systems and you tink they will not get 10 clcoukers to distrup them all i sa allready that hapening.5. nullsec and lowsec is not safe - no you didn't say it was - but you fail to realize how unsafe it is. yes, it really is that easy to get intel on you so you better be ready when that afk cloaker ends up being a hot drop when you least expect it. stressful? only if you make it so, but generally yes. unfair? not at all. can you do something about it? yeah - go find his corp and kick their ass. can't? sounds like you're either not ready for low/null, are a bot, or you don't have any friends to help you...which goes back to you're not ready for low/null.no one talks about safty here. wie talking about that one pilot can do to much interfirence iin local ppl activitys, than supose to, its okey roming gangs thos you can counter they coming in you make gang counter them kil them or they run home all its good and every one happy but couckers you cant counter eny known way you wil be dead eny way or dont rat atta all or dont mine at all. and than you dont need wonder that oppl leaving 0.0 meny hoo left are pist off thos clouckers. so conclusion:roming gangs solo runing pvp and cating soem one its okey, but coucked sit in system for weeks and hot drop ppl with will not have chence even proteckt them self not okey, tho big interfirance in local live from them.i hope answeered on all off them."

7/12/2011,"no, i'm mainly referring to battlecruisers and battleships as i don't fly caps myself (nor do i have much interest in doing so). most bcs and bses cannot fly fast enough cloaked to make probing cloaked ships fail for them, if they're set to burn in a straight line. nano fits might change that, but they have been impractical for larger ships since the nano nerf.but good job not knowing the speed capabilities of sub-caps while cloaked, or how far away one would have to be to escape tackling."
7/12/2011,"no serious pew'er cloaks their ships any more except maybe during logistics operations. even macros/bots don't use cloaks any more for goddess sake.the only 'combat' cloaks i have seen the past 4 years are fail bb's and dictors plus an assortment of noobs who don't know any better. remember that any one change will have to be made together with a whole slew of companion changes, probeable cloaks would fit nicely with an elimination of local for instance and would naturally exclude ""legitimate"" uses (ie. all ships with cloak bonuses)."
7/12/2011,"right, no one ever gets ambushed in wh space while doing sites. i have been on both sides of that equation, and if a group is mobilized it takes about a minutes or two to ambush a group with a hic and gang. also ask ccres how long it took aharm to boot them from w-space. guarantee it was not 6 months.but aside from that, you are missing the whole point of my argument. these ""isk-*****s"" don't live in w-space because they have to work to find the limited supply of combat sites and mining sites. they want upgraded null sec to be soft and warm, and have the ability to put a cloaked ship several jumps out and watch local for incoming gangs. they want to make isk hand by chaining belts, grav sites and combat sites that respawn in a minute. you are right the whole balance of null is broken, there is no way to effectively hunt industrial and ratters, and they have no effective way to stop running from afk cloakers. it is a poor balance, but a balance none the less. to eliminate the afk cloak without giving some way to hunt these types of players would throw off the balance."
7/12/2011,+1auto log out for afk<U+FFFD>s after an ammount of time (1hr?). not even low or 0.0
7/12/2011,"jesus i don't even live is 0.0 and i can think of several ways to cope with this tactic1. stay aligned, really not hard to do, warp as soon as you see the ebil person uncloak2. rat with a couple of friends, 3 v 1 should be fairly easy to manage if you don't all fill your pants at the sight of a red3. have a falcon alt / friend / whatever handy (i'm sure you null bears can manage this one already)4. move to the next system5. actually think tactically and bait / kill the dude in the cloaky (best option surely)damn, if i can manage to rat my sec status up in 0.0 where everyone is hostile to me, surely you can manage in a 0.0 area you own, that's full of blues and only has 1 enemy in it"
7/12/2011,you've obviously not spent much time in other people's space if you think cloaking isn't used by pvpers.
7/12/2011,^^this
7/12/2011,afk = away from keyboard1. i have yet to hear of one incident that involved a afk player killing another player who was sitting at his key board.2. the issue is not cloaking it is afk. so lets do away with all afkers. a. player in stations are ejected every 30 minutes so they have to redock. i hate flying 30 jumps into 0.0 to a station system with 30 people in it all docked up and afk.b. i want a weapon called the fumigator that after going into siege mode on a dread attachs itself to a station and injects poisen gas so all players who dont undock with in 5 min will begin to lose skill points. after undocking the gas blocks their ability to redock for 5 min.c. pos ship draggingtractor beam that attachs to a dread and can drag players out of a pos who are afk. if they are active all they have to do is fly back to the tower and the beam is broke.or how about you come to grips with the fact until ccp hooks you up to your computer with a wireless implant that tells the server when you are not sitting and playing eve you should get over your fears of being killed by people who are not touching there key board.
7/12/2011,^nice :-d
7/12/2011,"that is where the difference is, you probably think that killing pve'ers is pvp whereas i consider it ratting .. use a cloak on a ship not designed for it against a willing and armed opponent .. doesn't do very well at all.there's a reason why cloaks on ""combat"" fits are laughed at when they appear on the various killboards."
7/12/2011,"who is laughing exactly? i can not think of one, serious 0.0 presence past or present that has not used or continues to use this tactic. it is a widely used tactic in 0.0 across the board. and it is not all about popping fat jewbears, flying pinatas. they just happen to get in the way sometimes."
7/12/2011,this.the argument for years boils down to: you want ccp to develop a game mechanic to compensate for your own fear/paranoia.its a multi-player game. don't do anything alone and there wont be an issue.
7/12/2011,"indeed.easily bypassed, as has been said numerous times before."

7/12/2011,"i like the negativity of the people that don't see the point, or maybe they do unsterstand it, but refuse to see why it's needed because it might be that they lose their faulty advantage.screw the haters, i want this."
7/12/2011,"great idea. hi-sec'ers aren't screwed around, pvp'ers get a more sustainable method for skill boosting, and a new high volume market opportunity is created out of the deal. there is probably a downside but i'm not seeing it."
7/12/2011,"if you actually think about it, it makes sense.promotes more ""interaction"", etc..."
7/12/2011,"would you mind telling us about the original mines? i still find contracts for them around, but know nothing about how they worked or their strengths and weakness."
7/12/2011,would be interesting to see mines as an anti-super weapon.
7/12/2011,"i didn't think about that. i was mostly thinking about how to secure nullsec border systems and pos's. though if the super cap warped in badly it could enter multiple fields and that would wreck it's day a bit. also after some further thought, i think the damage should be increased to a base of 2000 or 2500 so it's higher than bombs."
7/12/2011,instead of a command structure make it a new ship. that also means that players can't leave it unattended.like the hic it deploys a minefield and cannot move from the spot. if the pilot ejects the mine field is destroyed.
7/12/2011,i to wish mines back.
7/12/2011,bring back dd
7/12/2011,yes let me solo gate/station camp.i want it nao!!
7/12/2011,"while i was hoping for an around the clock defense system, the second option could be worthwhile. a new ship styled for gatecamping, or both types, anchor type for nullsec defense with heavy damage or hic style for lowsec/nullsec gatecamping, limited damage but much greater mobility. only thing to make the ship balanced would be one high slot to fit the mine launcher, so it isn't overpowered."
7/12/2011,"i think it should be similar to the mobile warp bubbles. if an alliance sets them up around a gate it will hit anything that goes either way through the gate, hitting their own ships as well, if they seal off every gate in a system they will be stuck.if they are under attack it's not a bad option, but it will limit their own mobility otherwise. a decent balance."
7/12/2011,"dear lord, please fix gal ships. i want to get into serious pvp and i keep getting told ""oh, train into projectile guns"", ""oh, train into minmatar ships"", ""train into amarr"", ""train into caldari and get better shield tanking skills"". it's bs that one race just gets the sharp end of the stick while all the other races keep getting their toys upgraded."

7/12/2011,supported !make cq optional...
7/12/2011,"one problem...stacking.think about it: i put five ewar frigates on your mothership. ewar, most notably webs, stacks - meaning your fighters and fb's are moving at the speed of a bs. no mwd makes this even worst. tp's + dampeners and you just really made these useless.the idea is a great one and certainly ingenious, don't get me wrong. sc's really do need a nerf of some sort, or dreads need to be buffed to counter them somehow and stop the i have 1+ sc i win scenarios. however, this suggestion goes above and beyond nailing sc's...and drone boats in general if applied that way. it severely overpowers ewar ships. fact is that a solution either to make sc's more vulnerable, fb's less powerful, or an effective means to combat the drones needs to exist without upsetting other balances.i'm all for ewar ships seeing more love (even jammers, though not necessarily in the form of a buff) but other ships are in dire need of attention. black ops are virtually useless, sc's need a counter other than more sc's, dreadnaughts (and arguably carriers) are obsolete because of sc.(personally i think dd needs to be aoe again and be able to wipe supers drones out. more ships destroyed = better economy as well as more strategic battles.)"
7/12/2011,"he did say that numbers would need to be adjusted. so a 60% web would slow the fighters down by 30%, maybe 10%. there is also stacking penalty to consider. if the super carrier is really being bothered by the electronic attack ships then maybe he should have brought in a proper support fleet instead of nothing but supers.i guess super carriers without a support fleet will view them as being over powered. certainly other ships won't think that way because these effects only apply to super carriers.supportfleeti agree, but this proposal has nothing to do with blops or somehow arguing where development attention needs to 100% focused on.so your saying to field another super capital to be able to fight a super capital? aoe doomsday was incredibly stupid. you would get hundreds of people ready for a big fight and then one side would just drop in a couple titans, dd and that was it. so where is the rock, paper, scissors in that? rock, paper, scissors, bigger scissors?bring a support fleet."
7/12/2011,"you could have stopped there - the rest is just wasting space and trolling an opposition comment. as i said, the idea is a great one but i have my doubts about its viability. also last i checked nobody is bringing just supers - support fleets are always there.the next concern i'd have is lag - yes that sounds lame but think about warfare links, great concept, causes crazy amounts of lag. now take into consideration what ewar ship effects being spread across so many different entities are? personally, as i said, i'd rather see other ships brought up to fight against supers - dreadnaughts have a chance to fulfill this role or destroyers could possibly be revisited - they are meant to be anti-fighter support and given their inherently higher dps could be buffed more to suffice as fighter/fighter-bomber killers while still remaining fragile.the short of my point is that this idea sounds neat, but i'd rather see other solutions implemented to handle super-carriers and their imbalances. i'm straddling the fence on whether carriers should only use fighters/fbs - it would certainly change gameplay with them, possibly for the better, but then again its kind of lame that the ultimate drone ship is incapable of launching light drones to handle a swarm of frigates (like those ewar ships?).kudos for thinking outside the box - we certainly need that, ccp seems intent on thinking inside the coffer...err...box."
7/12/2011,p. 3 csm meeting notes.the long awaited scarrier nerf. a reasonable one at that.
7/12/2011,"we'll have to wait and see if it makes it into the game like that, a little bit too tame in my opinion as it apparently leaves the ridiculous ehp values intact as well as implant interactions.on a side note, the 'changing local' bit has me pretty excited. addressing the instant intel problem is long overdue. here's hoping for the best"
7/12/2011,"i am going to ""support"" this idea, although i think it is a little bit too harsh of a nerf on sc.but as a generality, i really like the idea of ew ships having a special ability to harm super caps."
7/12/2011,bump!
7/12/2011,dunno if the same problem occours on research stuff but i would like to see produktion and research (me/pe) contracts possible either. due to the lag of some non-player facility space that could be an interesting way to make additional money and/or fill empty time in pos modules.also prevents ceo<U+FFFD>s from giving rights to some new/unknown corp-member
7/12/2011,"supported. every day i have to use bookmarks, sharing them between people copying back and forth. i'd love to know more about them (and possibly how to optimize my own and the servers' use regarding them)."
7/12/2011,"oh god yes.the original ""fix"" of having a delay in copying was made on purpose due to server performance issues (oh how so long ago that was...), but that does not excuse the fact that managing them via folders and such is a complete pain. if you reinstall, have fun setting up your folders again. the whole system sucks. keep the copy delay, that was a game design issue...and promotes people to get their own damn strategic marks.fix the manageability of them."

7/12/2011,*yawn* you need some new material. at least someone previous was willing to try the go back to wow line. you just keep repeating the same stupid crap. i suppose that's easier than facing up to the imbalance that exists.
7/12/2011,"and that is why npc stations don't draw aggro when people dock there. :) but you cannot escape therein to avoid the consequences of your aggression, either (at least not immediately). so, under aggro rule, one shouldn't be able to find refuge in an orca for the duration, either.i agree the op had plenty of time to get away. but, ultimately, i realized that his decision to stay had nothing to do with the issue he brought up. if you can't dock inside a station, you shouldn't be allowed to dock inside an orca, either. that logic is hard to subvert.besides, an orca is like a locally spawn super-station, in that you you can just 'hug' it and play docking games with it, even when you're webbed and scrambled to death... or, not to death, is the point, rather. :)"
7/12/2011,"uhh, what philosophy again?whoever told you that is an idiot, this game revolves around not committing to the fight while making your idiot victim commit to it."
7/12/2011,"an npc station or a gate is a passive entity, they are not player controlled, they make no choices. an orca pilot does make choices, as does the player who chooses to use this tactic. the tactic creates an imbalance that allows someone to escape the consequences of their actions."
7/12/2011,"yeah, ya think so huh? tell it to the devs then."
7/12/2011,"do you even understand what he is saying? since you obviously dont, i'd like to encourage you to review what the nano-nerf was actually about. it would probably help to read all the assorted dev blogs on that topic too.hint: it was not about removing kite tactics from the game. it was about removing the ability to deal damage while at the same time completely avoiding incoming damage. the ability to 'just warp off' if you cant take something did remain completely untouched fyi.yes, thats a foot. its so deep in your mouth its almost in your stomach. edit: and no, as someone who uses mainly nanoships, i'd very much like to keep that buff, erm, i mean 'nerf'."

7/12/2011,"this, at the very least. i'm still a fan of transferring aggression though, as the orca pilot is clearly lending aid in a fight."
7/12/2011,"care to point out where i said anything like that again? oh wait, you cant.my exact wording was: ""whoever told you that (there is a design philosophy of committing to a fight in eve) is an idiot"".factual evidence that there isnt such a philosophy (non-exhaustive list):- non-uniform speed properties on ships- limited range warp disruption and speed control modules- long range weapon systems- anchorable warp disruption bubbles- wormhole jump/aggression mechanics- logoff after jump mechanics- logoff mechanics regarding supercapitalsnow it was you who wrongly deduced that there must be such a philosophy from the dev blog you quoted, which contained exactly zero evidence in that respect. conclusion: i called you an idiot.bump so you may humiliate yourself some more, it is very entertaining so far. what are you going to do now, dodge the point again?"
7/12/2011,"actually, it's simply a moronic game mechanic to give high-sec griefers a 100% chance to walk free without loss, 100% of the time.the issue isn't that the people using orcas swap to a better ship and kill someone. the problem is that they get pwned regularly enough, but instantly switch to a shuttle and warp out.solution is simple: if ship maintenance array is used, the orca pilot is forwarded all flags of the parties using the array.effect: miners etc. can still switch ships when aggressed, but griefers lose their invincible walk free card. want to use an orca to win at high-sec griefing? fine. risk vs reward says you stupid ****er should better bring a fleet to keep it alive."
7/12/2011,"you think you hurt my feelings? *snorts, amused* when did you manage that? dude - you're now a laughing stock on these forums. you a) fell for the oldest bait in the game, b) were too dumb to run when it because painfully obvious twice that you were about to get ganked, and b) - worst of all - made the tragi-comic error of whinging about it here :-dyou haven't hurt my feelings you poor fool. you've provided non-stop amusement from your first post *chuckles*but hey, if - like realising you were the reason you got blown away - you need to believe you've hurt my feelings (i can't even type that with a straight face :-d ), that's cool with me. in fact i encourage you to spread this thread around as much as possible. link it everywhere. make it your sig.after all you're not a dumb **** who keeps digging his hole deeper. no, you're the poor put upon hero, who was the tragic victim of an unfair tactic by a nasty wasty pirate, who no doubt needs to be taught a lesson."
7/12/2011,"how do you differentiate between miners and non-miners? and don't say 'because he has a mining mod fit', cause then you've clearly not seen or heard of the many wonderful 'when miners fight back' incidents in eve."
7/12/2011,"pretty simple. a miner doesn't pull aggression then swap ships. usually goes the other way around. thus, the orca won't have an aggression timer in that situation."
7/12/2011,"that would create an 'invisible aggression' exploit/feature using ship maintenance bay and fitting service though.now i agree the orca switcheroo is kinda lame, as is the neutral logistics and pretty much everything that concerns hisec pvp. but its not worth opening that can of worms for it."
7/12/2011,"puts a hell of a damper on using ecm or combat drones with your barge, or ecm mods (if a mining bs is being used) for defence, or to break target lock to jump away.i've killed attacking frigates, dessies and even really dumb cruiser pilots with my miners' combat drones, and often carry ecm drones to break lock. i don't just sit there and get ganked.also i still say it's bloody unfortunate for the unwitting orca pilot who has some dumb or malicious corpmate aggro another player, and then dock.really i don't think yours is a winning idea, but i agree it would be nice to make it a tad tougher for orcas to be used as get out of jail for free cards. i'm just not sure how you'd go about it without breaking the game for others, as i point out above."
7/12/2011,"just add a straight aggro timer to ship-change like we already have for docking and jumping, 30s-45s would be more than enough to make the trick much harder to use (still viable against utter morons though). refitting need not be impacted at all.no need to change anything else really."
7/12/2011,"yeah, and the issue is being discussed. don't let obvious smack you in the face, you apparently can't recognize it."
7/12/2011,cause i don't need to. :)
7/12/2011,this is why the docking transfers agro is problematic. denying use of the array while the player is red boxed is the most clean solution.
7/12/2011,"heh, i kinda suspected you were a troll when i couldnt find any killmail of the incident.good amount of bites though, well played sir."
7/12/2011,"why would you have to worry about using ecm/drones/etc if the purpose is to break the lock so you can warp? if you can warp and have to use an orca to switch ships out, you'd be doing that in a safe location where the orca will remain safe (like in a pos shield). if you've just beaten off an attacker with drones, why would you be switching out ships? besides, orcas usually aren't just left sitting somewhere afk that isn't safe. also, the orca has to actually be in fleet, with the hangar access set for someone to interface with it in a way that could pass aggro."
7/12/2011,"which is exactly the problem, invisible aggro transfer. since the orca hangars are just regular hangar arrays, that would apply to all ships with these facilities.bad idea, way too much griefing potential for hisec, and way too exploitable for low/null as well."
7/12/2011,+1as long as a signature is within its lifetime it should have the same signature name without beeing bookmarked or needing any other kind of additional work to verify it at any later moment.i would go further. if a signature is probed out closer. lets sa
7/12/2011,"i do think the current agression/gcc mechanics are a bit messed up, nothing seems consistant.one is ninja looters. im all fine with people doing that. but if they get aggression/gcc then like on other occasions they should not be able to dock or jump into an orca.if they loot you stuff outside a station they dock, or they go change to a pvp ship in a orca next to them and instadock. annoying as hell and you cant even kill them!this is loot we are talking about not wrecks.why implement a aggresson/gcc when they can easily avoid it.at least give them aggression and docking timer so we can shoot them! being allowed to insta dock is stupid"
7/12/2011,"please read up on the various aggression timers and then repost your thread, gcc is not what you seem to think it is."
7/12/2011,thats the whole point of the post!
7/12/2011,gcc means concord will shoot in high sec and shows as a red counter. aggression means another player can shoot in high sec and shows as a yellow counter. any aggressive act prevents docking or jumping for 30 seconds. how is this complicated?
7/12/2011,looting does not give a gcc flag.
7/12/2011,"looting aggro =/= gcc, if they loot your stuff ... only you and your corp can shoot them, gcc means they are red to everyone.looting is really not that big a dea that you should be prevented from docking"
7/12/2011,ok updated i meant anyone with gcc or aggression should get docking timer
7/12/2011,"did ccp forget to finish these off?for a npc region this severely lacks stations, and what is there are pretty much next to each, thus giving controlling station huggers more control.add more stations all over venal and great wildlands please, just like all other npc regions, then more people can go and live there and have more pew pew to surrounding sov alliances."
7/12/2011,"this is a key feature of these regions, it allows for the region to be split into multiple factions/holdings instead of station games like in syndicate and should not be change imo"
7/12/2011,except that gw has some bottle necks that force you certain areas and the fact it's all npc means you can't claim sov to put up a jb to avoid the bottle necks or get to the stationless pockets easily
7/12/2011,"could work as well.scanning in itself is ok, as long as it`s something you try to find off grid stations, gates etc.but as soon as scanning moves to the mentioned areas, it just gets to easy.hit scan, wait 5 sec, warp to 0km."
7/12/2011,"seems hardly any of the ******s, besides the be guys, understand the way they fight.you nubheads need to remember that be always fight outnumbered. stop thinking they are a blob just like most of you moronsand like be said ... their snipers are tackable even before they come out of warp> took me no longer than 8 seconds to get on one.so yeahplus one to support the awesome pvp be has brought for multiple years.good tactics, skilled pilots and nice change to the blobs you nubcakes all loveccp, fix the thing. your quest for rl isk has put you on track with what the whiners want so that you forgot about a corp that made eve."
7/12/2011,bump
7/12/2011,"i think one major thing is missing in the npe: timers (docking,gcc, aggression).i recently ran through the npe with a new player and within a day, the confusion of the different timers and more importantly the noob-gank cans inevitably cropped up. the npe should have a section explaining these different timers and the player interactions surrounding them. if for no other reason than the noob rage a lack of understanding about these mechanics can cause."
7/12/2011,not supporting until ccp fixes the damn timers in the first place.i'm fed up with the denial and refusal to acknowledge they have a invisible aggression counter.
7/12/2011,"honestly, i think that if more new players knew what was going on, they'd be able to identify the hidden timer instances (been there, been impacted by those, but it is rare for me). being the bright-eyed, bushy tailed noobs that they are, there would likely be a flood of bug report info that could eventually bring about a fix. where as bittervet/jadedplayers like myself don't even bother to send in a bug report unless we see it multiple times in a row and can assemble overwhelming evidence to convince the person who opens the report to not ""cannot reproduce"" it into oblivion."
7/12/2011,you cant reproduce what you can't see.i'll support it on principle but my reservations remain the same.ps: it's happened to me twice.
7/12/2011,it's because not even ccp knows what all those timers arebasically expect that you have some surprise timer for everythingin dark dark mmorpg like eve it makes sense that noobs die because someone touched the can they just threw out of airlock... wait
7/12/2011,..
7/12/2011,"there's a thought that occurred to me for the detractors who claim it's not worth ccp's effort: it's no more wasteful than a store that sells useless avatar items for the equivalent of $30-$60 dollars a piece. and you might even get people who pay for this sort of thing regularly to cut down on their 5+ accounts.anyway, thanks for the defense. i wish these suggestions would attract more attention, though."
7/12/2011,"makes it easier to train up 3 cyno alts on one account, as you can just toss a few extra plex at the account and train them simultaneously, rather than one at a time."
7/12/2011,"i think this would be a nice feature honestly. i have two accounts, will not be paying for a 3rd, and don't really care to manage another account on-again/off-again using plex. but i would buy plex in-game semi-regularly to train a second char on both of these accounts. it would allow us to buy and apply them when we want to train the second and let them sit otherwise.i've always thought those two character slots were a waste unless you were a trader having them camp an exchange somewhere remotely just to check prices or gathering intel in hi-sec when you are wardec'ed. it would be nice to make them more useful.i do, however, think there are higher priority issues in-game that should be addressed if this is a major rework."
7/12/2011,"this, as well as making lowsec pvp a more viable choice for beginners and/or solo players as they can train up a character for logistics purpose without hurting their pvp training.these chars typically stop training rather quick in their career, and are a waste to have on a separate account."
7/12/2011,i would love to have corp logo's on ships...even more so than an alliance logo.if alliance logo's are requested make them cost aurum when alliances apply for a logo. let that ofset development costs on adding a logo to ships.
7/12/2011,"makes sense to have corp logos as priority, since a lot of alliances dont even have logos.alliances paying aur not so sure, but then again why not? make it something like 35k aur, thats still only 3-4bill isk and peanuts but would remove a few plex from market."
7/12/2011,"i want my corp logos, alliance be damned. where do i pick them up?/signed"

7/12/2011,"i can't wait for the resulting names :-d yeah, this is an idea that cannot possibly fail"
7/12/2011,i know people who blow money playing with the market. for fun.
7/12/2011,"""ccp talked about removing abc (arkonor, bistot and crokite) mining sites from wormhole space at some point in the future. this may be from all wormholes, or possibly from lower class wormholes only. it was claimed by some members of the csm that a large fraction of the high end ore supply is produced through these sites, however the csms who were active in the wormholes would not accept this claim without hard data to back it up.""and then again on page 29, paragraphs 3 and 4:""based on comments by ccp greyscale in a previous session, the subject of removing ""abc"" minerals from wormholes was raised by nullsec-resident csms, who were surprised to learn that wh space was nullsec and that abc minerals were available in them. they favored entirely removing abc from wh space -- or limiting them to c5 and c6 holes -- but the two wormhole-resident csms objected strongly, pointing out that exporting minerals from deep wormhole space was difficult, and much of it was likely consumed locally.an argument was made by some csms that the prices of abc ores and refined products were being crashed by ""daytrippers"" mining in easily-accessible wormhole space; other csms stated that no nerfing of abc minerals should take place without first obtaining detailed statistics about the balance of trade for each mineral and class of wormhole.""and once more on page 31, the last paragraph:""the csm, with the exception of two members, is irked at the idea of high value ores being mined in low-end wormholes distorting the market. ccp zulu mentioned that he considers this ******ed and that this will be looked into. in class 5 or 6 wormholes the position is more nuanced, and the csm acknowledged that these minerals could be used for local production, and that they are too far from the market to distort it.""i think my only real response to this is ""wtf! seriously?"". although its comforting to see the null-sec csm members (who are apparently completely ignorant of whs) are actively trying to ensure no lowly non-null sec residents cut in on their profit margins."
7/12/2011,"it takes time to carefully censor the secret nda covered stuff and then spin the rest so it sounds ok, even calming. aint that what csm are trying to tell us. mmhm.."
7/12/2011,"i agree with this, cccpsoe are going this way if we like it or not, its their game, so be it.but ppls are blind if they think aurum won't be game changing, think about dust514, i read somewhere that aurum will be used in this part of eve. how can that be non-game changing. to level this out at the least cccpsoe should make sure that pi/dust514 items in store should be affordable by all. lower the aurum prices and make them micro-transactions. btw cccpsoe how much more money you need to repay the loan?"
7/12/2011,csm minutes.i clearly missed something. anyone have a link to more info on this?
7/12/2011,i believe they are referring to this winters' expansion. no blogs have been given for it yet.
7/12/2011,"it seems so. it just seemed like a weird way to announce what was coming in the winter expansion, as sort of a side note in the minutes of a meeting. especially considering how much players have been clamored for it."
7/12/2011,ccp even manages to break the fibonacci sequence
7/12/2011,i think they talked about it in the last alliance tourney. day four on youtube.
7/12/2011,"they are also killing local chat? p 6. holy... these meeting minutes look like they are just filled with ""everything the players have been demanding and more."" well, except pos changes."
7/12/2011,"everything here usually flows in the here's-what-i-think-csm-should-do-for-me direction. after reading all the minutes, i think that eve is generally moving in a direction i like. so, how can i help you csm?i'm a carebear mission runner, though i dabble in fw once a year or so, and occasionally join low-sec or null corps for a change. i play 10-20 hours a week (that i admit to). i run a single character on a single client.what can i do to help you out csm?"
7/12/2011,thanks
7/12/2011,"i personally get more and more the feeling the csm doesn't do what it is meant to do.they are representatives of and by the playerbase. but i don't really see that happening anymore.arnar made a slipup in the video where he clearly said that ccp has no intentions of bringing in anything else than vanity goods into eve today.but what about tomorrow or next week?i still haven't seen a ferm no to gold ammo or other stuff.also i don't see clearly stipulated what is considered gamebreaking. playerbase vieuw will differ on that with ccp's vieuw.our csm got steamrolled by ccp and the big bad goon lawyer is exactly the same type of guy as those who don't / can't communicate with the playerbase.it's all easy said they had heated discussions, but were they discussions about players concerns or about what to order at the nordica?this whole vague crap which to contribute to the nda is nothing more than that. crap.now they have to brush and polish the minutes till it completely fits into the same line of all the other nonsaying bullcrap they used over the course of time.not one of those people dares to speak open and clearly and it only shows one thing. we are being misrepresented. and we are being held on the short end of a long stick.i am disappointed by the csm which has subcome to just another marketing tool for ccp and i am disappointed by ccp by more and more turning the ea route.csm delegates which said they would show how to rattle a cage only rattle the player cages for ccp now."
7/12/2011,the fact that the notes are not available yet is not the fault of the csm. they are waiting on ccp to react.i think we should praise the csm for the work they did already. don't blame them for stuff that is not their falut.
7/12/2011,"who knows what happens 3-4 years hence? it could be that ccp makes a deal with some online company where we can transfer isk back into the real world in the form of store credit or something. market is still very young when it comes to the whole virtual currency thing.common sense, apply it. something that is on par or beyond something attainable only through oodles of :effort: would be gamebreaking for instance.as the nc-goon voting bloc was ever so happy to point out: ""democracy in action"". you get what you deserve, no point in moaning about it after the fact .. at least we got a few decent people in there and they seem to be rubbing off on the bloc (or maybe its because they lost ingame influence and can devote more time to csm matters )you have both a wrong idea of what the csm is and what the week-of-the-emo was all about. figure those out and you'll see that at least half you paranoia is unfounded.ps: may minutes appear to have been posted, available in left side."
7/12/2011,and if you shift **** through enough siffs at the end you get clear water.
7/12/2011,"after reading through everything, i would like to suggest to csm the following.1. publish the edited minutes as normal2. publish an unedited audio/video/transcripts3. publish additional relevant notesi believe that all of the above should be done for all future csm meetings to assist the general populous and ""dedicated"" eve players into better understanding the outcome of the meeting, to the last, dirty, gritty, raw and unedited truth.i know it sounds unorthodox but its the only way to satisfy both the general eve community and those dedicated to the csm/ccp/public cluster-****."
7/13/2011,"yes, exactly...what happened to the post of the long list of items the player base already voted on to be fixed from the last csm?"
7/13/2011,ability to strip racks on shipsplease add this to your list - i imagine it's along the lines of that 'little things' thread and team. i can't imagine this taking hardly any time since the functionality already exists in the game.
7/13/2011,"i would call hg clones vanity, quite a few people undock with them regularly. you speak of terms of convenience with having to remove things but i have to wait 24 hours between switching out of my various clones into something more suitable for varied situations. what exactly is the point of such an isk sink when you violate mechanics and allow for the purchase to be permanent."
7/13/2011,"if they make them destructible and lower the prices they lose money.at the current prices everybody can buy them as there's no risk. if they cut the prices to lets say 10 % and make them destructible, all people who live in empire will spend a lot less money on this stuff and wont have to replace it anyway because they dont lose pods.i'd like to have it cheaper and destructible and i'd probably buy it in this case myself but it's not going to happen if it lowers ccps income.and from an rp standpoint, its more resonable to pay like a half a billion for a lifelong licence for a shirt (as capsuleers will live forever) than paying 50 million for a single shirt."
7/13/2011,2 words...decay
7/13/2011,"and if they were destructible? would all you whiners be complaining that it is a conspiracy to get more money because people have to buy more of them?!god it is like you people complain just to complain. i hope you all quit over the monocles, and things you don't have to be involved in, but get upset when others have it. it is as dumb as fighting in kindergarten over a crayon. seriously start clarifying your opinions. and stop blindly hating on everyone and everything that disagrees with you.also be grateful that we even have csm's and people with a voice outside of the development team. not to mention they come here and talk with us on their time. unless i am mistaken they get no pay or special service to do what they do. show a little gratitude, respect, or at least enough dignity to address them like you would a stranger in public.unless of course you act this way at the supermarket, work, or perhaps you are some immature kid? either way grow up or people will start ignoring you."
7/13/2011,"must. find. pencil.as far as ship paint jobs is concerned, it probably does apply in some fashion. who would undock for pvp in a ship with even a $5 paint job? knowing that they might lose it in the first few seconds? either paint jobs on ships are dirt cheap (a few cents a ship; $.25 is probably too much in the long run), or they'll wind up being indestructible for the same reason."
7/13/2011,"i have perfect clarity in the question im asking. every other item in the game is transportable/destructable and must be transported via a ship. many items in eve cost alot more than a monocle. you can purchase any item from the nex store with in game isk, by first purchasing a plex and converting to aurum. nex items can be equipped to your avatar, then magically disappear as you are naked in your pod as has been said by many, and when you redock you are reclothed again your items are on you. you do not have a ""license"" to wear the clothes and get them provided to you at each and every station, or at least ccp have never said that, or there is no evidence to support. your items are not destroyed if your ship is destroyed and you are wearing them, so they must be in your pod? ok so if you get podded, the items never drop and you get a brand new set every single time? i am not a role player, but i like a consistent game, and how does that make any sense in the current context of the game? at all? i dont care about m/t, or the price, but when it starts ****ing with the core parts of the game like making things magically transport across the galaxy and making them indestructible, well isn't the risk of things dying in eve kind of the point?"
7/13/2011,"apparently the monocles and all other items are destructible when in your ship's hold, but not when they are on your face.so ccpcsm's assertion that people will feel fully robbed is looking like hollow nonsense to cover up that they technically don't want to re-render a person's face when they get pod killed.i'd wait for an answer, but why get excited over more truthlessness from ccpcsm?"
7/13/2011,"apart from the other drivel i gotta agree on this.the pricing for nex items is pretty insane. it creates this disconnect where you're scratching your head thinking ""okay now why would i pay multiple battleships worth of isk for a pair of pixel shoes?!"".they'd have to cut the price tenfold for this to make sense. and i think nex would work better that way as i believe people would be a hell of a lot more eager to buy some of the stuff if an item would cost like a dollar max."
7/13/2011,"the high price was a great move by ccp.most mt in game store have a couple of very high price vanity items that only a few will every buy.right now ccp will be watching the sales of the space pirate eye patch and as long they are selling the price will remain the same. at some point the sales will drop off because everybody who is prepared to pay that amount would of brought one.at this point you most likely see the price for the pirate eye patch drop and a new expensive item appear, and so on and so forth.as for the whole they should be destructible, unless the items only cost pence, they will not sell. most people will not buy vanity items that they can lose because somebody decides they does not like the colour of their pants and ganks them. the biggest mistake ccp made was when they introduced the store they only had a few items. they should of had at least 20 - 30 low priced items with the launch."
7/13/2011,"i disagree, why ? because you are forgetting to factor in all the people who may now buy said items because they won't cost silly money."
7/13/2011,"came in expecting mittens to be telling peopel to f off, left disapointed"
7/13/2011,"someone needs to ask the csm how they can be stupid enough to think the trace amounts of minerals wormholes produce compared to the bot-fleets of null warrant removing abc ores from wormholes. daytrippers? bull****. they come into an occupied hole, they leave in a pod, if they're lucky. they come into an unoccupied hole and odds are the sleeper rats will run most of them off. with only an 18 to 24 hour window into a hole they're not going to put a dent in anything. hole residents? please... with the occasional site we get we mine what we need and tend to use most of it. we're not competing with your nullbots.what they need to do is push to add moon-goo to wormholes. let that shake things up a bit."
7/13/2011,"non-destructible items break the rp immersion aspect of the game. period.however, try this on for size, the nex store vanity items are not indestructible.this issue might be resolvable by some new descriptive text about just what it is you're buying in the nex store. you're not really buying a single physical item but rather a lifetime 'service' or 'subscription' for an item of that type and when you're podded they supply you with a new one, wherever needed, every time needed, with no questions asked. they could even spin that as an explanation for why the items cost so much since a capsuleer's lifetime is unbounded and the prepaid 'item replacement and delivery charges' could be quite extensive over time."
7/13/2011,"i'd be glad if you stopped taking position for all of us players. you are just one player and although entitled to your own opinion, you should not assume you speak for all of us.whether i agree with your opinion or not, it is just not your place to speak for me (or anyone else); the only ones who might try to do so are the csm, simply because they are a democratically voted bunch ... you however are not."
7/13/2011,"using ccp logic i would think that destructible clothes would force players to buy same clothes quickly again, netting ccp more money? maybe up the price to 1000$ while were at it?oh, wait, people buy these things?technically it doesn't since you can manufacture clothes anywhere.."
7/13/2011,i'll help the csm out here.the answer to all of your questions is:money:
7/13/2011,"my question was, what total assets would kirkland langue freely give to me?"
7/13/2011,if you are naked in your pod then your clothes and monocles stay in the station you buy them in? do you have buy more clothes in each station then?
7/13/2011,"csm's are a complete waste of time, i support the complete vote of no confidence of these people."
7/13/2011,"i support 2-4 remaps per year, either given for free as a shortened counter or as a plex (or aur amount of plex) for counter reset option.it would consume plexes, would not be overly advantageous while still being useful.edit to activate ze thumbs up assuming above limitations are used"
7/13/2011,yes. even a limit of 2 neural remaps per year would probably do it for most folks. i will add the ceiling to the original proposal.
7/13/2011,"a plex is one month. a plex should therefore cut a single month off of your timer, that's it. i would support the proposal with this little change.if you complain that it would cost too much, htfu and find ways to get rich"
7/13/2011,"math, not your strong suit, is it? :) a neural remap doesn't make you train from 0% training speed to 100%, as you seem to suggest. rather, absolute worst case scenario, you'd be training at 2700 sp/h from 1800 sp/h, or something extremely similarly low.i'm sure ccp can come up with some sort of price that's reasonable; that's details, though."
7/13/2011,"you speak of math and then go on to say a 50% increase is ""extremely similarly low"". well done. and this is for all intents and purposes buying sp. not receiving it on the spot doesn't make a difference. it's now given to you during the x extra months that you gained from the remap.edit: incase of severe ****: not supported."
7/13/2011,"i gave training at 1800 sp/h as an example of training extremly slowly.and his math is still way off. by 50%, to be precise. :) because what you win is only a 50% increase, instead of training time for a whole month. and that is in the absolute worst case scenario of needing to remap to your now lowest attributes. and you don't always need that, of course. for example, i'm currenty training perc/will at 2700 sp/h. i have a 225 days will/perc plan, that i would be training at 2520 sp/h. not horrible, per se; i'd still pay to get that done more efficiently.also, 'increase' in training speed is an awkward term, because 'remap for plex' does not speed up training beyond what the current game mechanics allow; you'd still be training at 2700 sp/h -- the game's max. the only difference being that you can remap once or twice more a year."
7/13/2011,"sorry will not happen, there was already a huge community outrage over this and was brought to a hault."
7/13/2011,until ccp zulu recently brought it up again. :)
7/13/2011,"supported with reservations. remaps should be more frequent than once a year, but i'd prefer that this be done by reducing the cooldown. under no circumstances should the cooldown be less than 3 months. i think it should be 4 months or 6 months."
7/13/2011,"jesus ****in' christ. no matter how much you're given, you always want more.they've already given you remaps and removed learning skills and now you want... more remaps? really?why not just ask to have all stats pegged at 30? hell, why even stop there?"

7/13/2011,"hello, so after reading the minutes from the csm meeting, it seems ccp is actually going to commit some resources to ship iteration. this is great! i have decided to take up ship iteration and pvp mechanics in eve as a short writing project. all thoughts will be posted on my blog and i will update this post as more ideas are released.part 1, overall mecahnics changes hopefully this is more productive then writing walls of text in this thread. mj"
7/13/2011,"1. no one understands those hieriglyphs there 2. i think most of ppl agree with heavy neut to some degree3. drones. bad ideas, except that most of combat drones are useless and only few are viable to use outside level 4 missions. 4. ecm. like most of ppl you end up crying ecm just cos you dont know their weaknesses or how to counter them and which ships to use. dont expect to fight everything with minmatar which has bad ecm resistance. i surely agree that if you get something at the belt with falcon support you're pretty op, but how did he end up at the belt at first place is his fault."
7/13/2011,"i think that i've had many a cat and mouse game with gate camps and locals in my stealth bomber, etc. i don't recall ever being laughed at, and while i was sometimes able to catch the unprepared pveers, i also engaged pvp targets of opportunity who were trying to find me and my mates, camp the gate/station/whatever in question, etc.so again i suggest you're unfamiliar with the fun and damage (can someone say ""bomb!""? :-d ) a group of cloaked pvpers can have.not to mention the many times a black ops crew have snuck a fleet behind the lines. what was that well reported engagement in providence i think, where an alliance snuck a fleet of mostly stealth bombers to a mining op (that was betrayed by some of the miners), and took out a rorqual? that was very funny. who was that? gah - memory failing..."
7/13/2011,"right back at you. have you ever been in a organized wh crew? sure as hell does not sound like it. a t3 gang poses no significant threat? that is just so wrong on so many levels...you try to keep your home system reasonably ""safe"", but you can never ever be 100% sure. 2 seconds after scanning a new wh may pop into your system and suddenly you have that ""insignificant t3 gang threat"" decloaking right next to you so that they can proceed to give you a nice suprice buttsex session.i told one of the new guys is that if he manages to survive the initial period of wh life, which is kind of a huge change to someone used to 0.0, he will most likely never go back to k-space and he will start to frown on all the sniveling 0.0 people that scatter like vermin to a light as soon as you enter their system. 0.0 people must be the safest people in the game, yet they are probably the ones that are the most scared as well.you 0.0 people have your infailable local intel channel, and since you do you know stuff you really should not know and that makes you scared. the simple fact is... local turns boys into (cry)babybears. this thread is the perfect example of that fact."
7/13/2011,"oh you are suddenly speaking of ships designed with cloaking in mind, well guess where/when my ""laughed at"" comment was made .. let me quote you for ease of reference:had tons of fun with lots of cloaking bc/bs lately then? did the people who slaughtered you commend you on your inspired fitting choices or did they laugh at you as if you just wet yourself in public?"

7/13/2011,"would it suprise you greatly if i said that i would like black ops cynos to work in whs?to me that would be very cool indeed.0.0 is supposed to be unsafe, yet it is the most safe place in eve. and from reading what you really write the big problem is not the cloaky ship but the ability of said ships to put up a cyno... so the thing you really should be talking about is to nerf cynos.personally i would like to change the way cloaks work entirely. from the prototype cloak that should just remove you from overview but leave you fully visible in space and directional, to the improved cloak that removes overview and directional and adds a ""blurring"" effect making you hard to see if you are stationary in space, and finally the covert ops cloak that should remove you from the above and local as well as making you totally invisible while stationary and only very slightly visible while moving."
7/13/2011,"easily bypassed, as has been said numerous times before.i<U+FFFD>m not realy sure if i understood this right but if i am then the question of that action ist how much efford neds that mechanic (near zero) will everyone who uses the afk-cloack-tactic bypass it (guess not)so will it minimize some problems a bit (guess yes).just a first step. but if there were bypass arguments that often, the request for that mechanic seems a minimum that often.maybe the first topic in that direction should just be the topic ""support autologout"" and if the problem is still that present, some additional ways can be looked for.and there are always some other reasons wich can be solved by an autologout (i guess again^^)."
7/13/2011,"would be cool, but it would skew the power ratio so much in favour of an attacker that no one will ever put down roots in worms.would be similar to removing cyno jammers from game, it will quickly degenerate into hot-drop-o'clock 23/7 with no thought or reason other than ""just because"". any sort of permanent residence would be made impossible to maintain for any period of time."
7/13/2011,"yeah, that sounds horrible. one of the great advantages of wh space is that force projection is much harder; another is that scouting is a difficult profession requiring effort and skill. with blackops cynos in wh space, any engagement could end up with an unscoutable gank squad being hotdropped on top of you."
7/13/2011,"you're really not very bright or experienced in eve, are you?ok, let's talk bcs and bses. i like the drake myself, with it's handy free eighth high slow to fit a cloak in. it's very handy for slipping past gate camps using the old trick of pulsing one's mwd, cloak, then uncloak and straight to warp once the mwd finishes it's cycle, or you're out of the warp disruption field.again i don't remember being laughed at for slipping a gang of larger sub-caps through a camp and on to an attack. in fact i'd say it was more tears like yours on the other side when we were successful.or maybe you want an example of cloaks used directly in combat (or as direct as you can, given you can't exactly fire cloaked, heh), not just to get the ships there?ok - more than once i've lain in wait using a regular cloak either solo or as a small group, for a victim to pass by. if they're sloppy or simply not aware your character is a threat (it helps to make sure you're not a red), this works well. they get close, you de-cloak and spring the trap.unless you're going to cry that's more 'unfair' play :-d, then there's your use of regular cloaking in combat.it's also been handy to use a ship with a regular cloak as a spy already in place, when they don't have to warp somewhere else cloaked, and/or you expect them to die (a t1 ship with a regular cloak costs a lot less than a t2 covert ops ship).oh, and though it only works the once, there was also the time we warped in a small missile sniping fleet and a group of heavy tackle drakes, a couple hundred km off a gate camp. the drakes immediately cloaked. the sniping bses started attacking. not being the best and brightest eve has to offer, the campers turned on their mwds and powered towards us, either unaware there had briefly been a lot more ships on their overview, or that local showed more of us, or perhaps just not caring - as i said - not the best and brightest.the snipers pulsed mwds, cloaked and scattered making them hard to bump into. then our second group of heavy assault drakes de-cloaked and tackled the incoming campers as they reached our snipe spot. panic ensured, and the snipers de-cloaked again, and re-joined the attack, unleashing their drones as well. at that point our drakes with their huge tank were targeted, and not our paper tank dps fit bses. the campers were slow to switch targets back, and we annihilated them before they could take out any of our bses (one of our drakes did bite the dust, iirc) :-)and that, dear fool, is just some of the fun that can be had with non-covert ops cloaked sub-caps."

7/13/2011,"tl;dr* supercapitals require a power core to function.* power cores are indestructable and strictly limited to provide exclusivity.* supercapitals are still built like normal, but come with no pg and no drone bandwidth. they get their pg and drone bandwidth back when they find and install a power core.* when a supercapital is destroyed the core survives and remain on the battlefield to be picked up and used by a new supercapital ship.preamblewhen ccp created titans they imagined a select few being built and operated during the entire life of eve online. their stats were designed with this in mind. this is not true today. as a result titans constantly need rebalancing.the same can be said about motherships/super carriers. while probably not intended to be as rare as titans, they were still supposed to be a lot rarer than they are today.suggested fix - power coresimagine that all supercapitals would need a special power core to function.when the ship is destroyed the power core is preserved and stays on the battlefield. the core can then be incorporated in another capital ship as follows:1) supercapital ship gets destroyed.2) power core survives and ends up on the battlefield.3) the core is too large to be moved in any way, and will stay where the original ship exploded. the powerful core will immediately show up on the star map for everyone to see and warp to.4) a nymph* supercapital jumps in.5) during a lengthy operation (30-60 minutes) the power core is loaded into the new ship.6) a new supercapital is activated and ready to fight.* what is a ""nymph"" supercap? see next headline!""nymph"" supercapitalsfor this suggestion to work there must be a way to load the core into a new supercap. but the core can not be allowed to be picked up and moved as it might be forgotten or hidden away in some inventory for a long time. therefore the supercap that intend to use the new core must first exist (be buildable) and must be able to jump to the core by its own.however this capital can not be allowed to be of any use what so ever, or the core wouldn't be needed. enter: ""nymph"" supercaps. this is a supercap that is built just like today, using the same materials, with normal stats, except for powergrid and drone bandwidth that is zero. this makes the supercap entirely defenseless with no tank and no offensive capabilites; it's the precursor to a ""fully grown"" supercap. and once the power core is loaded it will be given it's intended powergrid and drone bandwidth.loregiven the very limited number of titan power cores (say we want to perhaps limit them to 10 in the game) significan lore can be built around them. let each core have a name and certain bonuses. that way the titan loading the core will inherent the bonuses, and all titans will be ""personalities"" with stats depending on which of the 10 cores they happen to pick up.example of different cores and possible bonuses:the divine spear - halved reload time for super weaponsthe reaper - 100% bonus damage to normal weaponsthe life giver - 25% bonus to all shield and armor resiststhe commander - 50% bonus to fleet support modulesthe wings of eden - doubled jump rangeand so on (five more)...let the core description then update each time its host ship is destroyed to include it in a list of previous ""owners"".to be continued in next post..."
7/13/2011,"continued from prevous post...how to migrate from old titans to new titans?there are essentially two ways to migrate eve from the old supercapital system to this new supercapital system, the nice and slow way, or the hard and fast way.* nice and slow - immediately make all newly constructed supercaps into the new nymph type supercaps. this will make them essentially useless and the old ships have to be used. as they get killed off one by one, eventually there will be only a few left. when there are only ten titans left, and one gets killed it will for the first time drop one of the cores and the cycle can begin.* hard and fast - immediately make all supercaps into nymph type supercaps, then randomly seed one power core per week in random spots in nullsec and let the festivities commence!advantages with this idea* supercaps in general and titans in particular will once again be something special, highly limited, something only a select few has possession of. something worth more than their cost in minerals. an awsome force on the battlefield, making any battle they show up in noteworthy.* supercaps get easier to balance towards the rest of the game (essentially they don't need to be balanced anymore due to their extreme rareness).* fantastic incentive for impromptu battles whenever a supercap is lost. both teams will do their very best to manouver in a new supercap of their own to steal the dropped core, but at the same time must defend the defenseless ship while it loads the core. not to mention that the core can be located by other interested parties at the same time.* self destruction of supercaps to save face is not as attractive anymore; losing a core like that essentially means you give the opposition a new supercapital.* more often than not a supercap lost in battle will essentially feed the enemy a new supercap. therefore needlessly dangerous manouvers with the ships will be limited. whenever they are used it will be with full realization of what is risked, they will come with proper support and not just hotdrop people for the lulz. and an alliance that happen to end up with a lot of supercapitals can either use them and eventually ""hand them over"" to the enemies when they are destroyed, or not use them, making the board balanced either way.* no active titan will be the same as any other active titan even if they use the same hull, because their power core will give them ""personalities"". those interested can keep track on which titan currently has which bonus stats, but for those that don't keep track of it, every titan encounter will give unexpected results. alliances will be known by what titan they own, and which bonuses and capabilities it has.* ccp can easily adjust the number of supercaps in the game with this mechanic. turns out there are too many? make some cores be permanently destroyed when their host ship explodes. too few? spawn a few at random spots in nullsec."

7/13/2011,"one alliance wins battles over and over - gradually takes over all cores because if they won the battle, they probably hold superiority on the field to take the core.1 or 2 things happens...you hope - people will use their caps to fight despite chance of losing the core...what will actually happen - just like moms, the caps will hole up and on very rare occasions actually come out. at least with super-carriers we see tons of huge ships out and about (and unbalanced, yes)the idea is neat but i don't think it's going to fly."

7/13/2011,in the universe where all other ships regenerate almost all cap while in basic warp in between cloaks.the only case where it might have a negative effect is when activated immediately after a prolonged mwd burn .. even the gay mwd/cloak trick is unaffected by this.
7/13/2011,"allowing nullsec to become more industrially self-sufficient will kill t1 manufacture in hisec, depriving new players of the avenue of deriving income from industry. this will increase the dependence on mission-running or ratting as an income stream - especially if ccp ends up entirely removing ice from hisec.to solve the ""problem"" of hauling materials from jita to nullsec, either provide the security required to mine veldspar in nullsec (""superveldspar"" is the wrong way to handle the problem), or provide the security required to carry bulk materials from hisec to nullsec. the fact of the matter is that there is no economic incentive to mine veldspar in nullsec due to the sheer volume of tritanium that needs to be moved around.one option is to increase the availability of high-grade refineries in nullsec - perhaps a nullsec or sov-only refinery module for poses that will have higher refining efficiency. perhaps an ihub upgrade that will provide higher refining efficiency. perhaps consider allowing character skills and implants to have an effect on pos refineries.in the real world we offshore a lot of production to eastern europe or china because that is where the cheap labour is found. in eve we do the same thing - the cheap labour is hisec where people can mine veldspar with no fear of losing their 150m isk hulk or 500m isk orca. they just sip wine and talk nonsense with their friends while enjoying the relaxing pass-time of mining.labour in nullsec is more expensive because the players need to provide their own security. sipping wine and talking nonsense while not paying attention to intel channels costs ships. thus it makes absolutely no sense to expect that there be some means of making nullsec ""self-sufficient"" in terms of mining.as for markets - to spread markets out you don't kill them. what needs to be done is to look at what makes jita so big and powerful: the network effect. everyone goes to jita 4-4 because everyone goes to jita 4-4.now look at the real world. what happens when everyone goes to london? that's right, london gets congested. the roads can only carry so many cars. there are physical limits on storage capacity. there are physical limits on the tonnage that can enter and leave the city during any period of time.look at any cargo or bulk harbour. ships are marshalled in and out. berths are allocated, berthing fees are paid, transfers take time. you can't load more ore into ships than you can hold in your holding yards.so rather than magically teleporting products to nullsec, simply enforce the logical limits of trade. this isn't commerce - we aren't dealing with orders for materials we are dealing with bulk transport.stations should have limits to the number and tonnage of ships entering/exiting. stations should have limits to goods stored.then there are the star gates. look at any bridge: there is a limit to how much traffic can cross it. the same should apply to stargates. the relevant authority should be able to upgrade the gate e.g.: anchoring something like an sbu to increase or decrease the capacity of the gate.with more logistics pressure the market will become more dynamic, with more to think about than simply, ""lowest sell price in jita"".the current nullsec mindset of many csm candidates is dangerously skewing the views of of the csm as a whole. there is more to eve than nullsec."
7/13/2011,"the danger of the ""superveldspar"" mindset is that they feel the economics of supply can be answered by overabundance. what will happen if ""superveldspar"" is introduced is that veldspar and tritanium will become even less valuable, and thus even less attractive to everyone. at worst, superveldspar will become the only economically viable source of tritanium, killing hisec mining. at best, superveldspar will not be worth mining and the status quo remains.there are copious quantities of veldspar in nullec, the problem with mining it being not just the yield but the sheer volume of tritanium required to build anything. the issue is not hauling veldspar, the issue is hauling tritanium. even hauler spawns end up being ignored because noone wants to haul 40k m3 of tritanium from a belt when there are reds three systems over.other than increasing system security or enhancing logistics security, one game design approach would be to reduce the quantities of tritanium required for everything, reduce the volume of tritanium itself, provide better mineral compression, or severely reduce the volumes of veldspar available everywhere.""superveldspar"" is not a solution to any problem. the nullsec csm seems entirely too focussed on what they want for building their war machines, and unaware of the ramifications of their desired game changes on the future of the rest of the game."
7/13/2011,"discussion of limiting ingress/egress/tonnage in stations has been discussed before. apparently the ability of an airforce to simultaneously launch 30 fighter jets from a controlled runway is supposed to reflect on the ability to dock supertankers at petroleum facilities. fighters in formation are a different beast entirely to supertankers, bulk haulers and container ships.placing limitations on the number of ships entering a station per minute (i.e.: enforcing minimum delays between ships entering) will go a long way to breaking jita 4-4 into multiple smaller markets.further expanding the simple seconds-per-ship delay to stargates will encourage pilots to become more careful about planning and scouting. allowing local authorities (nullsec sov holders, faction militia) to modify stargates will provide for better logistics routes, along with providing more targets for military action (e.g.: hacking gate boosters to temporarily disable them, thus allowing your invasion fleet or blocking the other guy's freighter convoy)."
7/13/2011,"t1 production is already dead because of missions and overproduction.t1 modules overall are very expensive in null sec. generally people in null sec tend to manufacture high end products like titans and super caps. the minerals are not shipped out in bulk from jita, but compressed."
7/13/2011,"there is still profit to be made. profits go up considerably when large battles in nullsec end up consuming scores of supercaps.what is the cause of the expense: lack of security for mining? lack of interest in mining low ends? logistics? poor quality of pos refineries? lack of build slots? poor yield of nullsec veldspar?why aren't pilots taking advantage of the opportunity to buy stuff in hisec, sell it in nullsec?the issue is still the volume of tritanium required. why would you have spreadsheets detailing the best modules to manufacture to provide the mineral compression in the proportions required for the ships you are building, if the volume of the minerals themselves wasn't a concern?of course the csm don't understand the issues, they are nullsec warlords (well, then there is the chairman who doesn't even play the game or understand w-space). the csm didn't understand the impact of ""ship created from nothing"" before their logistics guys clued them in. the few nullsec industrialists that do exist are burning out because no combat pilot wants to escort freighters, jump bridge networks were a pain to maintain, and alliance leadership treats them as second rate citizens.adding ""super veldspar"" is not going to make life easier for nullsec industry. removing abc from w-space is not going to help nullsec industry. what will help nullsec industry is some of what csm is giving words but no thought to: the ""farms and fields"" where the focus is on lots of little infrastructure, giving industrialists better facilities than are available in hisec, each of which is vulnerable to small fleets. such a system needs to be thought out and planned carefully, which i fear is above the capacity of the current csm."
7/13/2011,"your concern is based on the assumption that changes will be ""as is"" just bigger, which i sincerely hope will not be the case.- high-sec t1 production has 1-5% margins at best, not a lot of isk made that way. that it exists at all is due to surplus slots and minerals.- t1 modules take up a lot of space and are thus not convenient to haul anywhere, least of all null after bridge changes.- mining is null suffers the same problem that is the cause of the rampant botting .. it is boring! no amount of super asteroids or security will change that.as for spreading out markets: do what is done in the real world when ever loads of money condenses into one area .. tax the snot out of it.increase transaction fees based on isk changing hands in any given station/system with a discount to corps who managed to snag an office in the relevant station .. smaller hubs will grow out from the bigger ones and eventually (couple of years probably) contract into larger ones so instead of rens/jita/amarr we will have 10-20 roughly equal hubs."
7/13/2011,"there's a good point about product magically appearing in nullsec. logistics and jump routes are just too short which makes hauling require very little effort = no profit.and again everyone forgets low sec though, it's just place you pass while going to null in cloaky hauler or jump freighter.self sufficient should mean that it's worth of trouble to haul modules and materials there"
7/13/2011,"mara<U+FFFD>s arguments sound like they make sense and for me +1 so far.the question for me here is, what exactly is csm planning?"
7/13/2011,"simple. due to risks of null sec, solo or small group industrial work does not exist. because it takes so many people/accounts to do industry in null, there is little reason to produce things with slim margins. why would my corp build rifters at a 2% margin when we can build caps at a 20% margin (numbers are not exact, just for illustration)?1. the risk of mining low ends are not worth it for small mining groups, and thus not seeding into the market (as the bigger groups are in industrial corps that use all the minerals miners provide and more).2. the low demand for small t1 items in null. other than the occasional rifter fleet, very few players fly sub-bc t1 stuff in null. most t1 hulls are used for t2/faction hull production, leading to the next point...3. the high demand for things that require hauling from multiple regions to begin with (such as t2 and faction production) - since you are already spending a lot of time hauling, it makes sense to haul the t1 hulls as well.4. carrier proliferation. the supply of carrier/pilots is high, so the cost of hauling ships is low.5. production efficiency is substantially lower in null sec than high sec, due to the base efficiency of outposts and poss."
7/13/2011,"i completely support this.as ceo of an industrial corp i can set access rights for my members so they could use specific pos installations and hangers in specific offices, however whatever i do i have to allow them the ability to be able to cancel any job in the s&i tab.madness.i support the concept of factory manager being exactly that, a manager. the rent research or rent factory roles allow corp members to install their own corp jobs, which they can see or cancel, however only managers can see all jobs and deliver and/or cancel all jobs.at the moment i consider the system broken and unworkable. we're not the drf building dozens of supercaps, but the level of trust required vs the risk exposure means i am very reluctant to allow members the factory manager role due to the potential risk of isk loss.csm - please move this up the to-do list. i would hope it's not a major re-write, rather a ""patch""."

7/13/2011,"first off, im sure some things of those im about to mention are already planned and/or in the making, but better give too much feedback than too little.i'm not a gigantic fan of cq due to the serious limitations it has right now, starting with looks (environment looks somewhat decent, but the characters? lighting is a joke), ranging to functionality and usability. but to keep this topic somewhat focused on one thing, ima just concentrate on the viewscreen.its a fantastic addition and at this time the only thing making me want to stay in there. its the only thing thats not constant in that room, and therefore the only thing i watched after having explored the room, turned it off for a few weeks and now turned it back on.however, at this point, whats on that screen is highly repetitive and not customizable at all. in addition, most of whats shown neither concerns nor interests me. my suggestions are:-set up a menu where players can choose what they want to seei dont want to see what price badgers sell for, i dont wanna see career agents, epic arc missions, new pilot certifications and i dont wanna see bounty offers.what i want to see is stuff thats actually happening in game and that either affects me directly or just interests me: sov changes, news items, incursion warnings (not because i actually do incursions, but because it relates to something thats happening at this moment out there somewhere, which makes it infinitely more exciting than other stuff).i'd even go as far as adding options for devblogs, patchnotes, maybe (far reaching, admittedly) even an interface that lets you fetch rss feeds from the web - im melting just thinking about reading en24 on my cq screen.also, market announcements arent bad per se, but they should be customizable as well. probably only show me things on my market quickbar, e.g.lastly, players may also be interested in things like nex sales (if there is such a thing planned) - but always provide the option to not show these.-more detailed reports on the items i choose to seewhen i wanna read news reports and go to cq for it, i dont want just a random headline with a link to the webpage, i wanna have the article scroll down so i can read it directly on screen.for sov changes, some information from the sov screen could be displayed instead of the huge alliance logos, which tend to be the standard stars anyways.-restore functionality of the old hangar viewcustomizing the viewscreen to show your current ship, possibly including shield/armor/structure values, with buttons for various cargo and drone bays on the ship might help alleviate the 'sorrow' of loosing the old hangar view. if i dont want the screen to show me anything but that, i should be able to customize it in a way to make it so. dont get me wrong the interactible ship model on the table is a nice gesture, but giving us back the old hangar view, even if just on that screen, would be a nicer one. maybe even go as far as make the ship spinnable on screen - but thats just me dreaming a bit as for the implementation of those changes, an on-screen menu as opposed to a new regular interface window would be truly badass. i think the basic infrastructure for this may already largely be in place, as the scrolling clickable headline links would work similarly, but obviously i dont have deeper insights on how difficult this would be."
7/13/2011,"gladly supported. :)+1p.s. as for 'restore functionality of the old hangar view,' would be nice if it were done the other way around: start you with ship spinning hangar, and an extra 'zoom out' button which, when pressed, zooms out the hangar view to your cq, with the old hangar view now on your main screen. in other words: you were basically always looking at the big sreen, as it were, only zoomed in.that idea is not mine, actually, but was posted once in general, and i can't find it any more. i thought it was brilliant, though."
7/13/2011,what do you mean you can't apply a 'saved' fitting?
7/13/2011,seems simple enough
7/13/2011,"by ""saved"" i meant the fittings carved out to an xml file when they pared the list down to 50.if you had your 4 alternative fittings for your myrm, and due to this new restriction only kept 1 in your server side fittings, you can't select one of those other three alternative fittings and click apply. if you're maxed like me, you'd have to delete (or export, then delete) one of your existing server-side fittings, then import the fitting you want to apply (by clearing the checkbox of those 75 other fittings socked away in the xml), then click apply.this is a pita. they could have retained the ui for offloaded fittings (or at least give us an ""invert selection"" option), but they didn't for some reason. and while i am one of the people who has played my character from more than one physical machine (laptop, new machine...), i was never much bothered by having to transfer the xml and get all the settings back.when i swap guns, i usually change out the other slots as well to take advantage of or compensate for the difference in pg and cpu."

7/13/2011,"exactly. which is precisely why aggro should not transfer to the orca.keep in mind that an orca used for legitimate purposes (pvp is also legitimate, but you know what i mean) cannot be held responsible for a jerk or noob doing something dumb.and keep even further in mind that access to the orca's ship maintenance bay is fleet-based; that's pretty broad. so, the orca pilot may just be rendering docking services to people who aren't even in his corp. it takes only 1 jerk from a different corp, for instance, to really screw the totally innocent orca pilot over."

7/13/2011,amount of stations makes regions unique like amount of valued moons.a lot of people hold great value on regions with only few stations because it fits their play style. adding more stations would just destroy it.whole 0.0 is soon going to be full of stations anyway. why not have these rare natural parks like gw where pirates can still roam free and you can go hiking there to spot few.
7/13/2011,"charmed by the idea of just stripping 1 rack, as proposed elsewhere, i realized i'd also very much like the opposite: to not strip a rack when unfitting! like my grouped and loaded launchers, for instance: i may want different mods, but still have the same grouped launcher setup. i therefore propose the following:add a +/- toggle, akin to the mini overheat-icons, next to each rack (plus a single one for 'all'). when fitting, the state of these toggles set to + means you want the rack included in the fit; when set to -, you want it excluded. and vice versa for stripping: set to + means you want the rack stripped; set to - means you want the rack to stay fitted the way it was."

7/13/2011,"it's frustrating yes. however, there are other more important things to fix first i feel."
7/13/2011,"for example,"
7/13/2011,"yes, ccp needs to learn to fit better.no, ccp does not need to let highsec carebears get faction/officer mods off a dead mothership. they can go to lowsec/nullsec to get them like the rest of us."
7/13/2011,"i can only imagine the craziness if one of those scarriers actually started dropping modules that people normally fit on a scarrier:remote ecm burst i - volume 4000 m3 capital shield transporter i - volume 4000 m3let alone fighters/bombersetc...people would be lining up in haulers for incursions instead of actually participating. the animosity between the people actually doing the fighting and the ninja looters would abound. the tears stemming from properly fitting those ships would be immensely worse than the complaints about how they are currently fitted. i and many others would enjoy warping a single disco bs into the fight right at the end to blow everything up for the carebear tears, but i know it would be bad for the game."

7/13/2011,wait - i don't necessarily want actual 'turret launchers' as op pointed out that many ship skins would be incompatible with those. so are you saying ccp isn't developing new missile graphics at all or just not like the turrets?i like the new turrets by and large (my cyclone feels even sexier with the additional turret embankments) but i really want new missiles too - then i'll rate incarna a little better...maybe.
7/13/2011,"the entire crystal ammo system needs a major usability overhaul. automatic reloading of a replacement crystal when one breaks would be a welcome change. also, something in the ui that gives the approximate number of shots left rather than having to manually work out that figure by multiplying the volatility with volatility damage would be very nice. any means of seeing the crystals current health from show info would be welcome."
7/13/2011,"im against skills for plex in those ways that often mentioned bevor. but the possibility to train the second or the third character on the same account is worth to be supported so far.since it is possible to have multiple accounts it is realy a hard question why i should train an alt on the same account so there has to be a be a benefit. and the only benefit would be to gain more trainee time for that second (and/or third alt) for one plex than gametime for an second account. why? easy! becaus i can<U+FFFD>t be online with 2 of that 3 alts at once.while a plex gives 30 days gametime, for me it would have to give 45-60 days trainee time for my other alts on that account.the priority is more trainee-time - not faster training.so far the benefit for the player. is that really money for skills?i guess not. i have a benefit but also an massive restriction. there came up a question: why should ccp do this?first: an account has three slots, why let two of them be unused.well this is a small point - i see :) but second:i belive that some player would use another char on the same account on that conditions (even when character transfer of the two other toon-slots would be on heavy restrictions or not possible).i would. my second account would stay untouched. ccp would sell one more plex in 45-60 days (direct or indirect) to me than bevor.i like this idea so +1"
7/13/2011,"cross posted from features idea and discussions. it seems this is the more relevant forum...tldr;combining incursions, anomalys and belt npc's logic together. make every system valuable.think of the current system. the more you farm, the more the system becomes profitable. that bar that gains a % with each kill? think of that, but in reverse. the more you kill, the worse it gets, until it is replenished overtime.no longer mass isk farming in one system. (bots wont have fun under these circumstances win win for the standard honest player)sorry if this post is messy / confusing, its one of those late night ideas.my proposal;return anomalys to their former state with the following changes. all stats below assuming level 5 military index.combining incursions (that bar at the top left of your screen near sov red or blue ect) anomalys and belt rat npc's. the more a system is farmed for rats, the less there will be to farm. (spawns get worse and worse overtime.)lets use sanctums as an example. fully upgraded systems could have upto 4 - 5 sanctums. and said sanctums spawn every 10 minutes.anomaly spawn rate when a systems true sec is included;-0.0 to -0.2, 0% bonus re spawn rate. ie anomaly re spawn every 10? minutes (standard)-0.3 to -0.4, 25%-0.5 to -0.6, 50% bonus re spawn rate, they re spawn every 5 minutes-0.7 to -0.8, 75%-0.9 to -1.0. 100% bonus re spawn rate ie anomalys re spawn instantly. now add the following. using the true sec system again. the more a system is farmed, the slower everything will re spawn.for example, every hour in a -1.0 system 5 anomalys are run/killed ect. all of which are instantly replenished after completion (as writen above for -1.0 systems)now lets say these anomalys are run for 2 hours. those 5 anomalys become slower and slower to respawn. until eventually, they wouldn't spawn at all.in this example we will say that a group or 4 or 5 players are farming the 4 or 5 sanctums for 2 hours strait.-0.0 to -0.2, 0% respawn rate. ie anomalys respawn every 10? minutes but high end anomalys, ie sanctums / heavens become very unlikely to spawn. if at all after a couple of hours.-0.3 to -0.4, 12.5%-0.5 to -0.6, 25%-0.7 to -0.8, 40.%-0.9 to -1.0. 70% reduced re spawn rate. ie anomilys respawn every 3 minutes instead of instantly. npc pirate spawns shouldn't be and endless supply. if they keep dying / losing, they shouldnt return so quickly. this would also effect faction spawns in belts. the more a system is farmed, the worse every spawn in system will become.this imo does a few things.-it allows all o.o space to be useful again. but it still makes lower true sec system valuable to own.-over farmed systems mean people need to expand their territory to npc more efficiently.-newer alliances and its members to 0.0 can still make good isk. and every system becomes a valuable asset for isk making.im posting this now, and ill re asses in the morning.thoughts?"

7/13/2011,"high end ore in wormholes is an issue that is complicated not just by wh class but also by location. location is the bigger of the two issues, though the spawn rate of grav sites also comes into play. the potential issue holes are higher class, static highsec, with high rates of grav sites spawning. it is certainly true that wormholes can produce massive amounts of ore, but in most cases the transportation difficulties make it extremely suboptimal to mine all of it, as after the 17th time you jump through a connecting wh in a industrial to move ore out to high sec, it starts to get old. the holes with static highsecs avoid the issue as they can move the ore at any time that they control the wh. (usually)the classes of wormholes are already fairly balanced in term of what you can get out of them, any real issue that might be there is going to be connected to having a hidden nullsec system in highsec space."
7/13/2011,"i blame drone regions. large amount of ore in wh, lol. they mine it in anomalies, like lowsec and even highsec pilots does, omg! large amounts!"
7/13/2011,"are they actually stupid enough to think that the occasional sporadic grav site with limited amounts of non-regenerating abc ores in wormhole space, where transport is greatly limited not only by the mass of the ores but the mass of the wormholes themselves, is having even the slightest dent in mineral prices? you have these null-sec mining bots going nearly 24/7 out there and they actually think what we get in holes matters in relation?for the most part, when we have a grav appear, we mine, process and use the vast majority of the minerals in the hole itself. it's not cost effective to be shipping the ores to empire, and processing in the hole already has a 25% penalty at the least, plus a very limited supply. holes can go for weeks without a grav site appearing to mine. we also don't have the ""bonus"" style asteroids with the bonus mineral amounts in them... it's plain arkonor, bistot, etc.now, if they gave wormholes moon goo in exchange for reducing the number of gravs, that would be interesting. considering wormhole is the true null sec, you'd think those null carebears with their infinite roid belts, jump bridges and all that would be happy to straighten their skirts and enjoy the grotesque mining advantages they already have."
7/13/2011,"the more heated the opposition is to removing abcs from the low end whs, the more i am for the removal. if it was only a rare thing that wasn't aggressively sought out, few people shouldn have a problem with them being removed. now, granted, the c5, c6 whs are a whole different animal, and they have a right to be angry about the removal of minerals which are a giant pain to obtain otherwise. plus, those systems are more on par with the risks of null sec mining than other whs."
7/13/2011,"it's nonsense,grav sites don't spawn that often, nor do most corps haul the ore back to highsec because its a big pain in the arse logisticswise.the exception is offcourse systems with direct highsec or lowsec statics."
7/13/2011,"even more of a laugh was this out the notes: ""the csm brought up superveld and the need for high-yield low-end asteroids in nullsec to remove the need to compress and import everything from hisec. ccp greyscale was cautiously in favor of this, depending upon what the statistics might show""is the csm turning into a self-serving bunch of null sec alliance carebears?"
7/13/2011,"so you are saying that if people are against its removal, you are for it. and if people are not against the removal, you are still for it.... um, that is kind of the point of living in a c5 or c6 (and c4 too).no, they are not. you are more likely to be killed mining in the lower class whs (1,2,3) as they routinely have connections to k-space generating a higher amount of visitors.null sec already has moon goo all to itself, which is much more profitable than mining will ever be. having abc in whs does nothing to hurt the game and only adds to it by adding variety."
7/13/2011,"considering the response to things like the anom and jb nerfs, the response here is extremely tame, but even if it weren't, ignoring the actual facts associated with the issue and judging it based on player rage seems a bit off. as people still live in even c3-4 wh's, there are obvious implications about removing them for those groups. these would most likely be smaller groups less equipped for complicated logistics. the idea is further complicated by the fact that the csm's suggested that they be made more self sufficient. this really doesn't add up to anything other than a punishment of wh dwellers when we look at the facts:no local (which means no instant intel or warning).no ice (could be wrong here, please tell me if i am).belts are only found in sigs.mass limitations prevent large scale ops in low class wh's.ease of access for ""daytrippers"" provides greater danger due to equal ease of access for pirates.pirates themselves would also loose targets due to decreased activity in low end holes.for those that do live in wh's supply can be less than consumption at times as is.the only one area in the game that could benefit from changing wh's is null, which has significant advantages over wh space in terms of mineral production as is. the hypocrisy of the null representatives in suggesting that they deserve to be more self sufficient in their chosen area of the game while decreasing the ability of others to do the same is somewhat deserving of rage imho.i'd be very interested to hear more of the csm/ccp reasoning for their desire to make this change.edited for misspelling."

7/14/2011,"i'm all for cheaper destructible nex merchandise, for a lot of reasons. mostly becuase this is eve, and the universe doesn't give a flying frack about how much grief losing something expensive will cause.here are some arguments, c is the critisism, a is the answer:c: servers will have unnesscesary load due to people removing their vanity clothes every time they undock. a: if ccp had actually done anything but copy-paste the character creator to make the character recustomiser, swapping clothes wouldn't be such a frackin' hassle. for instance, if putting on clothes was as simple as standing by the mirror, opening a container and dragging the clothes onto your avatar (similar to the dead functionality of dragging a module from your hangar onto your ship [not the fitting window] to fit said module) is an easier, and less hassleful experience for those who must have vanity items and do not wish to risk them. c: what about the portaits then? people could buy a monocle, take the photo and resell it... a: make the portrait photos auto update when you add time to your account as well as whenever you choose to do so (the recustomiser becomes a photo booth essentially). it even makes sense from an rp perspective (you sumbit a new passport photo when you update your liscence). c: no one will buy the cheaper, destructible items because they don't do anything! a: the problem is that they do do something. they are a status item - just like the 700$ sparkle poney tigers from wow. ccp is underestimating just how attractive that kind of thing is to a lot of players. so here is another question, will i be refunded my 100$ ishukone watch scorpion if it gets blown up? c: argh! my plex market! a: statistically, the vast majority of plex sell orders are in the quantity range of 1-2, which hints at that most people buy 2 plex, and either spend 1 on themselves (adding time to their account), and sell the other - or sell both. sure, plex prices might go up a bit, but ccp will not let it get out of hand. and it will eventually stabilise again (i for one think that 360 million isk for a month's gametime is a bargain, and i'm not exactly the biggest isk maker in the world). for all arguments, there is a counter - until a certain pyramid invalidates said argument. back on topic...about time that another [republic fleet] fireside(tail) chat landed on grid.i'm excited to hear about the unified service layer (usl), and especially if it's going to be eve gate exclusive (would give people a propper reason to use the damn thing), especially if it would let the user change skills out of game (changeing skills from your smartphone would be the most useful thing ever).meeting minutes were, as always, the highlight of the month for me - lots of cool stuff. 0.0 really does need a revamp.footnote: i'd love to see trebor play devil's advocate on this."

7/14/2011,"it isn't just about nullsec industry but making it so nullsec is it's own special independent 'game' in eve and eventually we'll all be punished for not running out there through nerfs. not working to make it more attractive or leave it as it is for those that want that kind of gameplay but nerf other parts of the game so null is the only place to do x,y,z."
7/14/2011,"this is the only serious attempt to providing an argument against it. everyone else is just whining against it.this is not buying skill points. buying skillpoints is, i give ccp my credit card and tomorrow i fly an avatar. neural remaps already exist. people do use them to train faster. you probably do too. no one wants them removed, only a few vocal people oppose a way to obtain more. i would support as few as 1, with a cooldown of 6 months. i see the failure in buying skillpoints outright, people could become a titan pilot in a day. that's just stupid. with remaps, you cannot become a titan pilot in a day. it will still take a very long time."
7/14/2011,"i like most of the sheep here oppose this idea entirely along with any ""change"" that might happen good or bad.taking years for training is good and we should not try to give new players ways to help fast track their enjoyment with more options for remaps. playing other games while avoiding eve entirely while your character trains itself in real time is excellent and preferable.totally do not support anything that helps speed up skill training and increases player enjoyment/freedom and would preferably limit remaps to once every 5 years. if the players are impatient they need to learn to be more patient."
7/14/2011,"fellow capsuleers,it's easy to make all these grandstanding nay-saying posts -- i know, i've been in plenty myself. but can you honestly say to yourself you're sure eve still has another 8 years? well, i can't. that's the problem. the eve training system works great, but it doesn't scale well. schematically, the issue is as follows:'for every x year in the past, the chance of eve existing yet another x years becomes smaller when x gets larger.'to give you a few example:'eve existed 2 years; eve will exist another 2 years' = very likely.'eve existed 4 years; eve will exist another 4 years' = probably.'eve existed 8 years; eve will exist another 8 years' = not so likely.'eve existed 16 years; eve will exist another 16 years' = almost certainly not.so, the issue is, that ahead-time 'condenses,' as it were, with each year passing. that means, in simple terms, that whatever others have done before you, will become a less attainable goal. so, for 8 year old vets to say new people should just wait as long as they did, is a linear logic which simply doesn't apply here. heck, even, say, a full 3-year carrier plan is on shaky grounds at the moment.also, please understand that this 'condensation' of ahead-time, as already outlined in the start-post, becomes more pronounced with each new year passing.hence this proposal. it's not even adding a new game mechanic; it's merely applying an existing one a bit more frequently, to compensate slightly for the increasingly-less-time-ahead matter."
7/14/2011,"whilst the total impact of plex-for-remaps would be small, it crosses the line, however slightly, of paying for something that can't be obtained in-game.ccp have a lot of trust rebuilding to do before i'd consider accepting the risk of letting them do ""just one small"" power mt. starting down that road would do more to shorten eve's remaining lifespan than almost anything i can think of."
7/14/2011,"not the same as buying sp huh...situation 1:""hey, think i'll train per/will for the next 6 months to get into those nice t2 ships and getting some proper gunnery skills""*remap to per/will, training them at 2790 sp/h*6 months in:""ok, time for my fitting skills! too bad i'm only training them only at 2070 sp/h... oh well. got my gunnery fast"" *continues training int/mem for 6 months until next remap*result: 20,995,200 sp from that yearsituation 2:""hey, think i'll train per/will for the next 6 months to get into those nice t2 ships and getting some proper gunnery skills""*remap to per/will, training them at 2790 sp/h*6 months in:""ok, time for my fitting skills! too bad i'm only training them only at 2070 sp/h... screw this, i have isk to spare!"" *buys a remap, now training int/mem at 2790 sp/h and continues training int/mem for 6 months until next remap*result: 24,105,600 sp that yearnow please tell me how the person in situation 2 didn't buy a bit over 3m sp, given to him over 6 months. yea the rate is bad, but that's not the point is it?(think it's worth noting i could've made the post-remap time 11.9 months for lulz, but trying to be fair here. and it could also be that the time required for per/will is only 6 months and the player is switching over on purpose so it's not about him/her making a mistake)maybe this is not game breaking in itself, but it does cross a line.this proposal does not help new players what so ever unless they are rl-rich, because they can't afford to buy plex in-game anyway. and the rl-rich can already just buy a character with their $$$. so basically this is all in an effort to train new alts and old mains faster, which is not needed.edit: changed situations a bit because people are ******ed."
7/14/2011,"wtb training at 2790 sp/hlack of game mechanics knowledge aside, both people in both situations have the same choices open to them. either buy a remap, or don't."
7/14/2011,this example may be the purest incarnation of malcanis' law yet.
7/14/2011,"exactly we don't want more enjoyment or progressing for players, its better to punish them and get them stuck with bad training times for 6+ months when they decide to change game play styles, which is totally their own fault and they have to live with it or quit eve."
7/14/2011,knew someone would herp so hard they derp... well. *edit on my example situations*and eve is all about living with your choices. only trained amarr while minmatar are fotm? live with it. and so on.

7/14/2011,"i agree, but with neural remaps, which exist today, it still takes years.uh, neural remaps already exist. they can be obtained in game, they are obtained in game at a fixed rate. this isn't plex for gold ammo or gold ships. if you think ccp still has trust to rebuild over an internal newsletter containing speculation that never became a reality, and that they said is never going to become a reality, you need to brush up on comprehension skills."
7/14/2011,the only one derping is you youth.
7/14/2011,"supported.i'd used the tutorial agents to fix my mains balance before and it was pretty straight forward and effective.tonight i thought i'd use them to bump my alt to get a headstart on courier missions working towards r&d rep, get a cheap frig fit going, set my waypoints, rock up to the first agent. no show.disappointed, i'd just be happy to get option 1 back."
7/14/2011,"there is no problem with afk cloaking.improvise, adapt, overcome."
7/14/2011,"i have a red who constantly, probably 20 hours a day, afk cloaks in my system.and i don't give a rats ass about it. know why? i check my d-scan when i rat/mission, i have friends on comms/chats who, while they are doing their own ****, are also ready to help a friend in need as soon as **** gets real.its not hard. either adapt and work with others, or die in a fire because you're too lazy to manage the 'perceived' threat of an afk cloaker. i'll be honest, when i first came to 0.0 i thought it was ******ed as hell too, but now that i've got many months under my belt of living in null, i've not only grown used to it, but i counter it often.as for the fear of him having a cyno... be aligned? have intel on his corp/past engagements/etc? there are many things players can do to minimize the risks they are presented with. the question is just how much effort are you willing to put in for that bounty tick or mission reward. if you can't be bothered to put the effort into countering an afk cloaker, then why the flying $&%@ are you in 0.0 space?"
7/14/2011,"give cloaks a timer, 10 minutes for example, train it up and have an implant and you will get a few more minutes. once your timer is up you will have 30 seconds or whatever before you can reactivate your cloak. that way if your afk you will de-cloak and can be scanned and found. or make the cloak run on some kind of fuel that takes cargo space. can't stay cloaked forever if you need to go refuel it. personally i like it the way it is right now, if its not a risk its not worth doing. mining and rating while someone is in your space just means you have to be a little attentive while you do it. have fun and fly safe."
7/14/2011,aww tears.... get over it
7/14/2011,it wasnt in the release of incarna!!! raaaaaaaaaaage!!! come on csm this has 29 pages of support get off ur ass and get'er done!
7/14/2011,/agreed
7/14/2011,"signed, my name is terrible (my imagination was dead back then) and the gallente's only option for long hair is dirty looking dreadlock things."
7/14/2011,"or maybe enhance destroyer hulls a little by giving them and only them the ability to use mine launchers, might give the class a bit of a shot in the arm.anyway the basic idea is sound, would just be a matter of tweaking for balance i think."
7/14/2011,"i was thinking that, but i thought the destroyer wouldn't be strong enough to handle gate guns, i could be wrong. i was actually thinking that one of the tier 2 battlecruiser hulls would be a better fit, or another cruiser hull, as if there aren't a ton of those already."
7/14/2011,"i like the idea of mines, lets give them a detection range (30km for example) before they explode and a deployment range (35km apart) a cleaver pilot could set a maze around a gate and give his corp way points to navigate past it. after all, mines in real life don,t know if your on the same team."
7/14/2011,"i was hoping to just have them be like the bombs, hit's everything in the area, friend and foe, that way you can setup a passage of same space but if you stray a bit or try it with too big of a ship and pop. very hard thing for scouting, skills required? very high, danger? extreme, rewards? great."
7/14/2011,"i think letting people place hundreds of aoe weapons on a grid is a recipe for massive lag followed by node crashes, especially if any reasonably large fleet warps there.another question to consider: if someone is undocked in highsec when one of their 0.0 mines kills someone, do they get concorded?i would get around these problems by turning mines into single-use, high-damage drones, doing self-damage each time they fire at a target and blowing themselves up after 4 or 5 shots. optionally, make the drones fire missiles rather than doing turret damage, so that smartbombs can be used as a counter.also: create a new minelayer ship class, with a massive bonus to # of active drones, but not drone bandwidth. give 'mines' a very low bandwidth requirement, but a moderate to high volume to stop other ships using them excessively (except maybe the odd carrier or guardian-vexor)."
7/14/2011,"i like the idea of mines, and this thread has kind of inspired me to tweak the concept. instead of mines being a singular, one-shot aoe weapon with a given radius, players would deploy entire minefields via a minelayer module. the size of the field can be manipulated by players, but at the cost of the damage generated; small/tight fields (~30km radius) will generate a lot of damage but cover a very limited area, large/dispersed fields (~1000s km radius) will generate limited damage but might do so over a wide area. multiple fields can overlap with one another, allowing players to customize their minefields. since each field is made up of some enormous number of mines, each 'unit' of mines has substantial material costs.damage taken will be probability based. every second a ship spends inside a field it has some probability of being hit by a mine, based on the size of the ship (the larger the ship, the more likely they are to get hit) and the density of the field (probabilities higher in smaller, more focused fields). the total damage taken could be expressed as a percentage, rather than as a total amount of dps. given lower chances of being hit, this would mean that small, fast ships would be able to sail through fields without much hassle, while larger ships (i'm looking at you, capital ships) would be largely unable to safely access mined areas. so this would allow for more strategic play, and act as a defacto nerf for capital and supercapital ships.thoughts?i may have to add this to my nullsec omni-proposal."
7/14/2011,"this is very close to my original thought but i toned it down so it wasn't so overpowered. i wanted some type of limit to the number of mines and max damage it could do so large alliances wouldn't just set up an unassailable wall and jump bridge over it, while also not adding to lag that much(individual mines would, like drones, stress the servers.)"
7/14/2011,yes that would be for the best!
7/14/2011,supported. +1
7/14/2011,worth repeating..
7/14/2011,bumping for justice.this thread will not die.
7/14/2011,"maybe... just for the sake of argument.... you should consider that learning projectile guns is a valid solution? maybe, (if i were to put on my devil's advocate hat) the federation prefers tactics of drones and long range rails or close range blasters? i mean, if we disregard for a second that this is a game, and think in the 'story' terms, it may be completely okay that projectiles pwn gallente weapons because, well, gallenteans are not exactly an aggressive race? besides, the minmatar are their allies, so they would be having those same hurricanes fighting at their side in any faction conflicts with the state. you all are capsuleers afterall. not tied to any faction really, not subject to the laws and restrictions of mere mortals. if you want to be the best pirate ever, then maybe its time you trained to fly good alpha ships, like minmatar ones. the ones designed that way so that they could over throw centuries of slavery to their masters, the pompus amarrians?i mean, if i were put on my rp hat.balancing the game so that everything is 'equal' makes eve about as boring as chess."
7/14/2011,"dear lord, please fix drones too"
7/14/2011,im not the biggest eve fanboy but something that important should to be built not randomly spawned. it's also a punch in the junk for those that managed to play the game long enough to get into those ships. the better and simpler idea would be to make building times longer. however good luck getting sc pilots support either way.
7/14/2011,"the power cores are not randomly spawned, they turn up when a supercap is destroyed. also the supercaps themselves still needs to be built.as for some people being butt-hurt, well yes, it's unavoidable. the long term health of nullsec can not possibly be maintained if supercaps continue to be built like this. you have to limit their numbers in some way, it has to come down from todays numbers, a lot. how you limit them is less important, although i think my solution is pretty neat in many ways.if you don't limit the numbers there will be an unavoidable power creep. eventually nullsec will be nothing but titans and super carriers. how fun does that make it for a new alliance to try to stake out a claim? today you can be lulz-dropped by 20 goon titans, do you think it'll get any better later on?no one likes their ship to be nerfed, but sometimes it just has to be done to keep the game fun for the rest of the players. when the speed nerf hit the hacs there was a lot of complaining from those with a hac, but of course in the end it turned out to be better for the game to nerf them. it's true what ccp said; we should note what the players do, not what they say.titans started out as koenigseggs, now they're ferraris, in another five years they'll be folkswagens. with my suggestion we would make them koenigseggs again."
7/14/2011,this is a really neat idea.
7/14/2011,"while i agree that supercapitals/titans should be very rare ships i dont think your way of dealing with them would be ""fair"".any alliance/corp loosing a few of those cores to their opponents (allowing them to field even more scs than they had before) would result rather soon into very onesided battles.in the end very few ppl would control those cores and that is really worse than what we have now.rather make them consume fuel like a pos, no matter if their pilots are online or not.that way the maintenance cost alone would force the numbers of active scs/titans down to a more exclusive level."
7/14/2011,"so what you are saying is prevent new players from advancing in the game. excellent. may i take this opportunity to nener nener.also, this is a terribly unbalanced idea. far worse than the current situation."
7/14/2011,"fair, no, but nothing is fair in eve. they took a calculated risk by fielding those supercaps, and lost.also there will be a sort of equilibrium; the more supercaps one side gets, the more likely they are to lose one (by providing more opportunities to get them destroyed). sure they get a certain edge due to their supercaps, but given how limited they would be, the edge would still not be an i-win button.letting supercaps consume fuel has its own problems; either it's so extremely expensive that only the very largest alliances could afford it. or it's cheap enough that any alliance could afford it, which means it doesn't limit anything anyway. either it isn't balanced or it's toothless.yes because as we all know, the first ship new players zoom around in is a titan, right?"
7/14/2011,"smart people will simply deploy these en masse even more than today and have ""empty"" supercaps ready to pick up destroyed core if mishap did happen.eventually there will be only one group holding supercaps and nobody will ever be able to contest them no matter how successful they are otherwise.simplest solution would be to remove these ships from the game and reimburse skill points, isk and minerals to characters. not that ccp would dare to do that."
7/14/2011,"in a large enough battle a limited amount of supercaps will have very little effect on the battle as a whole. maybe you have an alliance with almost all supercaps in the game, then all of a sudden they end up in a battle they can't handle and two hours later they don't own any supercaps at all.say 50 super carriers exist in game, and 25 of them are owned by a single alliance. the alliance is powerful sure, but say it comes to a battle of 400 battleships + 25 super carriers vs 500 battleships on the other side. 500 battleships will easily kill a super carrier and i think the result of such a fight could go either way, and the fleet sizes are reasonable.what i mean is that with a limited enough number of supercapitals it doesn't matter if a single alliance owns all of them, they can still be defeated if met with a superior force of non-supercap ships. today though i think it could be perfectly possible for an alliance to buy a close to invinsible supercap fleet if they have enough resources.with my suggestion, money wouldn't automatically mean superior supercap numbers. a small but skilled alliance could easily steal a couple of supercap kills and all of a sudden they would be a force to be reckoned with."
7/14/2011,"actually, no. of the caps, supercaps are the ones able to run from a fight and an fc will sacrifice every other ship on the field to save those supers. in a fight with 400 bs + 25 scarriers v 500 bs, the scarrier side would absolutely destroy the other fleet in spectacular fashion. the way supers die are either solo supers that fall into enormous, cunning traps, or from giant lagged out battles. in the case of those battles, ships, wrecks, and pods are known to reappear after the fight even after they are dead or cruise around continuing to fight even though they are actually dead. i have a fraps of me flying an apoc around for about 10 minutes, shooting stuff, with 0% hull (it ended up dying twice according to the killmails, which is highly lulzworthy), but that's a side story. point is, how can you be sure those things don't multiply like everything else does in those situations? how can you be sure they spawn correctly in high lag situations? the answer is that when supers die, ccp has no logs and no control over what is going on, so to put some mechanic in place that needs to work correctly is just... dumb.currently, pl has such a force. they also are smart about the mechanics enough to very very very rarely lose a super (and when they do, it is often returned by petition). instead of your dream version of small alliances yoinking these supers, what will happen is they will become the hottest commodity and the blocs will go out of their way to take any supers not supported by a bloc, thus consolidating bloc power dramatically. due to the risks suddenly involved with large fleet fights, the blocs with supers will likely all end up naped together against the rest of eve and work out who owns what valuable space through diplomacy.to sum it up, you don't seem to have a good grasp of what goes on with supers or null sec and your idea is flawed."
7/14/2011,no. not going to work if introduced now just going to make a lot of people angry. you cant have that ship cause we changed the rules and you get to role play titans now... not going to work.. and will probably lead to them being unused as a 'trophy'. 1. they need to be nerfed (especially ew resistance and damage vs anything they come up against)2. a new ship is needed specifically to kill supercaps (heavy bomber)3. dreads need to be resist and vs supercap damage buffed when in siege mode (drop 50 dreads.. seige .. kill 20 supercaps lose 40 dreads) dreads having always been vulnerable to cap warfare and swarms of subcaps.. game balanced.the usual chain is broken by supercaps at the moment restricting them wont fix it ..rock scissors paper.. supercap.. (requires supercap killer vulnerable to subcaps to close this loop).
7/14/2011,:)!
7/14/2011,"so?this proposal wants to hurt supercaps somehow, and does so by asking for a (totally unnecessary) nerf for every regular cloaker. ideas like that are always inherently bad.if people want to nerf supercaps, propose something that only affects supercaps, pure and simple. like, i dunno, cut their ehp in half, maybe?"
7/14/2011,and have them land at a gate.
7/14/2011,i've never used cynos so i may be way off the mark with this; but why not just make it that you can scan out cynos? that way it doesn't matter if the ship gets destroyed; you can still scan out and warp to the intended entry point.argus
7/14/2011,i'm not familiar with this mechanic. but if it's true it has my full support. cyno shows on overview for a reason....

7/14/2011,"the problem has a lot to do with so many parts of manufacturing already requires jumps to high sec, that the price to produce would have to be lower in null sec than high sec. if you do that, you will reverse the problem and suddenly high sec would be flooded with stuff produced in null sec. that problem stems from all the jump freighters and carriers having to move back and forth to supply everything and the empty room being filled with whatever random stuff they want to bring to seed the market. if it were reversed, the problem would likely be amplified as the ships are rarely able to be filled currently when going from null to high sec, as the only stuff being hauled is loot not worth reprocessing.i honestly think that the way to improve industry in null is throw low ends at the problem, in a way that they can't simply be passed over, such as some kind of hauler spawn plex/anom type of thing. mining isn't done solo, but ratting is. forcing ratting income to also be in the form of minerals would reduce the isk inflation a bit as well as seed markets in null with low end minerals. this would have to be followed up with equalizing the industrial efficiency in null as in empire or the low ends would likely just start piling up then become the ""ugh, i got another hauler... skip."""
7/14/2011,"sounds like homework...i know.essentially i'd like to see a csm member (or two or three!) take an active role in faction warfare development. for those of you who like fw, no ccp is not developing it - i want csm to try and push that!1) find out how many players actually partake in fw - this could be as simple as looking up all the registered militants and miltias, something ccp could aid you with quickly.2) perform several polls on fw - why do people like it, why not? as i'm sure many veterans know, new players always ask about faction warfare and are drawn to it - likely because it's pvp focused, but presumed to be more controlled than lowsec/nullsec (many think its in hisec!).3) leading off #2 - npe: if so many new players are drawn to fw, why isn't it developed more? it's well known ccp is pursuing a npe campaign (incarna the centerpiece at this time) and devs have long touted that getting players into corporations is a priority for retention. pve provides a straightforward, though limited, path of progression (hulks, battleships, freighters). however no such progression exists in pvp - except for faction warfare and its complexes. i'd like to see the csm deliberate in conjunction with ccp on why faction warfare inherently draws new players (until they are informed of its current state) and how it could be improved to benefit both veterans and new players as a defined tool for pvp progression? from a business perspective, fw could increase player retention by providing a different pvp environment than lowsec (piracy and lawless), nullsec (sov and alliance warfare), and wormholes (survival). this results in more 'places to go' when players get bored with one facet of eve.ex: i started as a miner...was cool in my hulk, then an orca with my buddies in a gang. got old of course, so we decided to push past level 2's and cruisers. we got battleships, were making isk like crazy - and getting bored of missions. so we moved into lowsec to try piracy! didn't fit the bill - too much waiting for us and we lacked logistics at the time (eve is a learning experience, ya?) now we're involved in nullsec and so far like it there. as a result of having so many different places to go - we're still playing eve! that's the beauty of the game, two of us are talking about taking up the miner operation again to build a carrier. this is player retention in action - the more quality features available, the longer the retention.4) the final step is to present the ideas the csm representative(s) think about faction warfare, what they've discussed with ccp, and future plans. obviously nda renders them unable to give us explicit details on features - but fw has a lot of potential for factoring into npe and in general fixing a feature that has been sub-optimal since launch.are there any csm members that would be interested in taking on this task? (there's no deadline considering how ccp operates!) the csm or devs would need to create a centralized discussion thread of course at the end - players have this habit of duplicating threads or some such...edit: i realized that i posted with a different alt than i usually do - oops! lakuma is traditionally my 'mouthpiece' and i will be answering posts as him. sorry about the confusion!"
7/14/2011,"i would be very interested to see if any ccp employees, particularly develops like soundwave who deal directly with ship balance, would be in support of this measure to save them some legwork. afterall, ship balance occurs only as a result of ship competition - i.e. pvp in some form (be it freighting or fighting).faction warfare has the most 'controlled' version of pvp in the game by virtue of being complex-oriented (though not successfully of course, but that's besides the point).so...are there any devs out there who also would like to see the csm compile some data from the playerbase to present to them in regards to faction warfare?"
7/14/2011,not even a drop of interest?
7/14/2011,i thinking getting someone on the csm to champion faction warfare is a must!
7/14/2011,"would support this with wholeheartedly if i thought it would have any effect, but you are fooling yourself i am afraid.newbies are not necessarily drawn by interest, they are (or were) presented with a big fat ""join the army!"" button at the end of a tutorial .. the number of people who pop up in militia channel and ask why they were just killed or some other rudimentary question is staggering.fw already has champions on the council, or at least that is what they said when campaigning problem is they are all null-bears and ccp has dangled a tasty trout in front of them, filled with joy for their neck of the woods .. good luck getting anything meaningful from them until after null has been placated.they even consider it 'abandoned' .."
7/14/2011,"then you should vote for someone in the next csm. null sec has been tired of the sov mechanics and pos grind for years. we, as a giant block, voted for csm delegates who made sov mechanics and structures their priority. most of the current csm delegates champion the demands of the null sec community. the which came first, the chicken or the egg can be played, but the point is suddenly we have a null sec, sov focused winter 2011 expansion coming.it had been hoped that fw would get the ""grand new sov mechanics"" that ccp had rolled out a few years back for null, but as they are not exactly... good... be thankful your sov mechanics have not changed yet. hopefully ccp get it right this time and fw will likely benefit from a modified version of whatever null gets."
7/14/2011,well i did vote for someone. but i agree if you mean all fw members should get together and support a single fw candidate.
7/14/2011,"other way around actually, fw was used as a trial run for some of content scheduled for the dominion sov revamp. remember how the pitched dom way back when? - multiple objectives.- small-fleet action all over the place.- limited but crucial blob viability.most if that plan was scrapped shortly after they saw fw fall flat on its face and the current sov system was launched instead (at least that is what i can piece together from timeslines/comments).would be grand of there was some link between the systems as they have marketed fw as a steppingstone for null .. so dependant on what they cook up (read: fail at) this time around a simplified version could/should be implemented in fw."
7/14/2011,"i think it went something like:null: grinding poses sucks really bad.ccp: no worries, we're about to test some cool new sov mechanics on empire!fw: this is terrible.ccp: hmmm... that didn't work.null: so, about that whole pos grinding thing...ccp: we have new sov mechanics coming for null! it is awesome!null: yay!fw: but, what about us?ccp: once we work the bugs out in null, we'll port it to fw. it is awesome!fw: yay!ccp: tada!null: even more lag and unheard of structure grinding... awesome?fw: still broken over here too.ccp: winter 2011! it'll be awesome!null: it sounds good...fw: still broken.i got a bit carried away there, didn't i?"
7/14/2011,not sure you were actually .. hahahahaha sounds very ccp'esque.
7/14/2011,"i was intentionally avoiding the fact that this had a low chance. yes csm is very null-oriented (last i checked it always is because primarily null players actually vote/run for csm and on an account basis severely outnumber hisec players active on the forums).my point is that ccp is already engaged in seeking ways to improve player recruitment and retention (because fixing old features apparently doesn't help either of those?) and thus faction warfare as an almost obscure feature has a lot of potential to fit into this overall plan. you are correct in that new players are directed to fw via a ""join now"" that's more akin to a scam than an advert.nonetheless - i think csm could gain a lot of traction with the playerbase as a whole, as well as ccp, if it was to be proactive as opposed to reactive - hence this proposal. ""sounds like homework"" indeed - but if you do the basics for ccp, they have more reason to review faction warfare and pursue it.so again - are any of the csm members, who supposedly partake in fw or care about it, interested in doing a bit of legwork to see if this feature really is important? i personally think that ccp has ignored it as a feature for the simple fact not nearly enough players are vocal about it - as opposed to pos misery and nullsec."
7/14/2011,not letting this die!
7/14/2011,"if they can only cancel jobs they start themself, it wouldn't be much of a issue. if you got someone in your corp building big things on behalf on the corp, they probably got roles to do more damage than just cancel a job they do regardless."
7/14/2011,up
7/14/2011,this requires more oomphpirate faction ships are more like faction tech 2 ships and thus should be treated as tech 2this is a real problem. please fix.
7/14/2011,seems good to me :d
7/14/2011,i want to strip racks
7/14/2011,you're so not stripping my rack
7/14/2011,so now anyone who points out you failed is a liar? :-d best edit your op then...
7/14/2011,your reading comprehension skills are bested by a slug.
7/14/2011,"ultimately, you missed the real problem.there is no 'design philosophy' that says a player must commit to a fight - otherwise ecm, wcs, and other methods of disengaging would not exist.nor is there an assumption that what you think you're fighting is what you see - he could just as easily have brought some friends to play (and would have if you had been able to hold tank for too long)if you were better informed, you would have known that this is a standard ninja tactic - he wasn't stealing your loot - he wanted to kill you. you took the bait.the only problem here is that there is no way for you to spring his trap on him, and kill the orca.when that is fixed, life will be more interesting for ninjas and victims both."
7/14/2011,"why worry about transferring aggro at that point? you've hopefully broken the lock, you've warped out, safe up and wait it out if that was what you were planning to do. if you were planning to switch ships, then do it from the orca that is in the safe you just warped to, where the transfer of an aggro counter won't do anything negatively to it. did you even read the rest of the paragraph i wrote or just the first sentence? you're started to look like a troll."
7/14/2011,"solution: orca is protecting a pilot who aggro'd you knowing the situation, thus orca should become red box to you too."
7/14/2011,you can't board a ship that's targeted. i think its a good idea that you can't dock a ship that's targetted either..... with the exceptions of stations and outposts (o.w. station games would take on a whole new aspect!). docking your faction bs into a carrier to save it from destruction is such a pansy use of the game mechanics that it really ought to be changed....
7/14/2011,"missions should not be the only way to increase standings. i beleive that a small standings increase from placing orders via brokerage s well as paying tax, would help not just the economy, but also allow traders bypass missions to trade and haul while still getting counted as a part of the npc corperation and factions good side. going pew pew for agents should not be the only way to get a standings gain. as a trader i would rather stick to trading and hauling player made goods. not doing missions that keep me away from helping the economy by putting my isk to the value of the items on the market. so my standings suffer and i end up paying rather high fee's and have no way to grow my competitive edge. and when i have less fee's due to higher standings i make more isk to keep buying more goods from players. however. i am also wanting to propose a anti exploitation factor to include into this. any market manipulations that result in false pricing via buying your own goods in an attempt to create a false price on an item, should result in a small standings decrease. as falseifying the market is a ""bad"" thing."
7/14/2011,"i would agree that some sort of standings for traders would be in order. however i don't think adjusting the standings just from normal trade activity is the way to go.perhaps, with changes in smuggling coming there can be some sort of thing that brokers ""want"" that is less than legal. something that can moved from region to region. ""insider trading data"" if there needs to be an rp reason for it.you can incarna your way to some broker agent, but some data sheets, and then move them to another region and give them to another some other broker and gain some standings with that npc corp.this way there is some time effort and risk involved, above and beyond just doing what you'd do anyway."
7/14/2011,"you can pay someone to grind standings for you, enough said i think?"
7/14/2011,"just a thought, (if not original, then please forgive me)but why not make fw pay the participants?i mean, many complain that fw is a empty shell of what it can be. it seems to me that the easiest way to get anyone to do something in an ultra-capitalist society is to reward them for actions with isk. if you are part of the armed forces, you should expect to get paid for your services.currently the only way this can happen is through militia agents, and frankly, anything less than lvl4 missions are not worth it, as the amount you stand to lose in loss of ships for lvl1 and lvl2 players aren't worth the rewards.why not pay for kills? you are fighting for your faction anyhow, seems to me like the faction should reward you for it. (should apply for corps and players)of course we have to make sure that people don't create alts just to join the other side to be killed. so maybe set the rewards for kills to be depending on the 'pretige' or rank of the pilot that you shot down. also make lower level mission rewards worth more, so that it can be a full time profession. it makes no sense that people have to mine or do something else just so that they can make a living while in the militia. the missions should not make anyone rich, but it should at least make them self sufficient. make the rewards a function of how large the enemy force is or how much territory they have vs yours etc.any comments or suggestions?"
7/14/2011,"we already have lp-for-kills, they just need to fix it so that all involved get a slice (top damage/mail recipient only now i think). there is your direct pay.if you know of anyone mining to make ends meet in fw, pod them for me please. they must be so dumb that their deaths will bring the average iq of the server as a whole up several points! i can (if i could be arsed to) make isk enough for a supercarrier in little over one month with only a few hours per day invested in fw .. show me a place that is not deep null where that is possible.why do you think that 95%+ of all militia members do nothing but mission whoring?ps: fw is a proxy war, it is not the ""armed forces"" but rag-tag militias."
7/14/2011,"maybe i'm missing the point of all the threads that fw is 'broken' then.interesting though, didn't knaw about the lp. how does that translate into isk though?getting things from the store and selling them?"
7/14/2011,"it is not broken because of the lack of isk, but because the mechanics and general system is fubar. ccp did not spend months prior to release riling people up with promises of the biggest cash cow in eve's history, but rather meaningful small-gang action, rp and entertainment .. the pew is there, but not really all that different from everywhere else any more.lp-for-kills is pretty low, but yes you get lp with your militia to use fw store for killing others. any higher and you will start to see people killing alts repeatedly so not really a steady income but nice to see a flash once in a while."
7/14/2011,"sorry if i'm being obtuse, but i really just never been in militia so don't know, but is the lp earned any more than the lp with regular lvl1 and lvl2 missions? if so, then how can this really pay for itself? are there any special items that you get from militia stations or missions that are worth more than the occasional lost frigate or destroyer for beginner players?in your opinion, (as you seem to have more experience than i) can a beginner player support themselves doing fw (what does that mean exactly) alone? i know 1 case where someone was just doing the lvl1 missions and they complained that at that rate it would take them forever to earn enough to buy a cruiser, let alone carry the cost of losing one. if i were to take his story at face value, i would say that their is a game mechanic problem here. but as he already quit eve, i thought i would throw this topic out for discussion and comments from those who may know better."
7/14/2011,fw missions can easily support a fw player's pvp habits.
7/14/2011,"the lp in fw is fantastic. check the lp reward costs:faction warfaremission runningdedicated, reasonably skilled fw pilots make a couple billion a month. one problem with fw is the gap between skilled (both experience and sp) players and new players. one big problem has been that because gallente ships are generally gimped compared to other ships, their faction versions have much less market demand, so people in fw for isk don't join the gallente militia, creating a dramatic imbalance with the caldari (which are possibly the highest demand) ships/militia. another issue is that incursions, from an income standpoint, draw experienced players away from the militias. but the major problem, from what i understand, has to do with the fw sov mechanics. i would assume that if ccp can come up with sov fixes that work in null in this winter 2011 expansion, then fw will reap some of the benefits of a functional sov mechanic."
7/14/2011,"""beginner"" is a strange term to use, does it mean new to militia or new to game? you can acquire standings enough for lvl4 missions in a few days of doing almost nothing thanks to the broken plexing mechanics.once lvl4's are unlocked you can make enough for a supercarrier in a couple of months by investing 2-3 hours per day .. the income potential has no equal except maybe for a locked down -1.0 system in deep null."
7/14/2011,"i don't think it's broken that experienced player gets to level 4 missions fast. because it would be pretty much waste for any experienced player to do level 1 missions. so there is no problem there.if you spend time exclusively doing missions you can get pretty nice income, granted that there is no one hunting you in plexes. however there is plenty of other ways to make isk faster, it's no ""i win"" button for eve by any means.also lp stores have differences, there's much more demand for caldari items and missions are more difficult to do with higher amount of ppl in fw area = higher gain.what has bugged me most with fw is almost non-existant rewards for actually participating in war. you get rewards for carebearing. originally idea was probably that people would go shoot people doing missions but that's not really working right now. fw sov seems more like ping pong."
7/14/2011,"read it again, it is not that it is possible that is broken but the mechanic that allows it. hell, you could buy the bloody standings for all i care .. but when plexes that i want for rp/tags purposes are blitzed by stabbed frigs i get sad name it, because i sure as hell have never come across a better revenue source. bulk invention comes close but is very vulnerable to market fluctuations.marketeering can get similar income, but you need a massive wallet to begin with to really make it work.the payouts are identical to any other agent, payout is based on system security .. lowsec pays better than high-sec.difference is that normal missions can't be completed in 5 minutes and normal lp stores do not have the same item spread or ship discounts.preaching to the choir dear, preaching to the choir nothing worse than playing a game and getting the feeling you are wasting your time, which is why it would awesome to get some (read: any) response from devs."
7/14/2011,"hmmm, yeah actually you're right - it does kind of add to the wildland's character. *support withdrawn*"
7/14/2011,"this is one of those ""every region of space should be the same and equal and balanced"" threads again isn't it?sheeeeesh. you people need to go buy yourself a pair of nice ripped jeans and learn to appreciate that the imperfections in life is what gives things character, and personality. stop wanting the world to be so digital. it's boring!edit: oh, and i'm minmatar and love my heritage, and having very few stations fits right into the character of the thukkur tribe btw. they are nomads. like mongolians. no permanant homes. it's quite fine the way it is."
7/14/2011,"ok, i think this is going too far. if you could strip a rack of your fitting, you can also strip 2. or 3. if you want to keep 1, don't strip that one.alternatively, you might want to make a proposal for locking modules in the fit. locked modules could have lock mode toggled on / off. locked modules wouldn't get strippped if you did it for the whole ship or a rack...."
7/14/2011,read op fully - second paragraph states this as their idea.
7/14/2011,"as i was finishing reading empyrean ages (great read btw) i started reflecting on the may notes, fanfest, and day four of the alliance tourney dev chats. it came to me. i think it was greyscale saying he would like to have a modular rebuild of poses, an example i believe from the dead horse thread. how cool would it be to have a place to refuel caps from a market at poses. this would be helpful when there is no station in system for people that do not have access to the corp hangars. i imagine people in wh space would love this too. i then took it a step further into this idea. i see this as a win, win because of course it can be destroyed. we could even have it outside of shields where you would pull up and access a personal hangar there to get your purchases. this would also create another place for pvp i bet. i would like to see this just like a market in a station. any thoughts?"
7/14/2011,"the problem i see is that within seconds of reading this, i thought ""ooo! i could set one of those up, then sit off it in a cloaked super and gank the fools that come."" and realized that few cap pilots in their right mind would actually warp to one of these because this will be the reason for 90% of them.i tried to think of a way to solve that. sentries that protect anyone refueling just means i could bring more ships, knowing exactly how many to bring. allowing only one player to be on grid at a time with a cap would mean i could go to these, empty it, then wait for the previously happy owner to arrive to restock it, only to gank him for the fuel he is carrying (thus doubling the fuel i get out of it), alternately that would also become a way to create impregnable safes for supers, which would not be a good thing. making it capable of being docked at would erode the purpose of outposts and stations.in the end, i just can't come up with a mechanic that wouldn't being exploited into disuse or become an op exploit. it is an interesting idea, if you can come up with a way for it to work."
7/14/2011,i still think the pos should have defences. i also like that it gives another choke point for pvp too. this also gives wh people and small alliances a easier way to have a footprint than a corp hangar or building a station.
7/14/2011,"even better: why not per ship?too many times, i lazily click orbit and find my bc trying to close in to 5km, or my tackle frigate trying to orbit at 60km....."
7/14/2011,"indeed - i see no reason why they can't be stored on a per ship basis, till said ship is repackaged. it's a pita to have to set this every time i swap ships."
7/14/2011,"yeah, change it to per ship, who wouldn't want this?op can you please change your original post, or create a new proposal?"
7/14/2011,"we all know it takes about 4-5 months to sit in a carrieror about 2-3 months to sit in a jump freighter now that's a lot oftime for someone who is not really interested in training in thosetwo directions and wants to spend his time training to be sub-capitalpilot.this would be a ship for low-mid sp players who live out in lowsec and0.0 so they can become less dependent on their corp mates that are capitalcapable. this would allow them to have a ship of their own that can makejumps between the systems and allow them to move their things when theyneed to instead of relying on worm holes or their corp mates.for instance before being a cap pilot i had problems say i bought a ashimuand wanted to bring it out to null sec i had to wait for about a weekso i could catch a corp-mate that was going to empire and back to bring it up.this ship would fill this missing hole.so what i had in mind was a mid-large sized ship maybe just a tiny bit bigger thana bs. probably in ore ship category so all races have 1 same type.here is what i had in mid:- jump range ( base 8ly )- cargo hold: 50.000 - 75.000 (expandable up to 15-20% by two cargo expanders)- no ship maintenance bay or corp hangar array.- maybe a 400m3 drone bay (capable to field 5 drones)- 4 hi slots, 4 mid slots, 2 low slots, 2 rig slots"
7/14/2011,"so, a jump orca, minus the extra bays? do i understand that correctly?"
7/14/2011,"yes but say less skills required, and costs around 100-300 mil range."
7/14/2011,so... what you want is capital ship capabilities without the price or skill requirements?
7/14/2011,sure great we definetly need more ships capable of jumping. i think it should have also cov ops cloak.
7/14/2011,and it should be able to jump gates as well. and field fighter bombers. maybe a doomsday device. definitely should be able to use bridges as well. maybe make it immune to bubbles. the 100-300m price point sounds about right.
7/14/2011,1
7/14/2011,yes
7/14/2011,supported
7/14/2011,"yes to fixing the icons. no to bringing back the old ones. i like the art batch that was done for the pi icons. so something along that style would be nice. realistic, but not too starcon3 ish, and not 1990's throwbacks like the old ones. but that's just my opinion."
7/14/2011,no.
7/14/2011,signed.
7/14/2011,"small issue is that no one, including ccp, now actually understand how all the timers work in eve.anyway even if someone would manage the impressive task of figuring out eve timers, i got a much better plan b: simplify timers so it doesnt require a tutorial. start by removing idiotic stuff like npcs in belts giving an agro timer. then remove stuff like extending agro timers by shooting someones cans, which dont actually show on the victims screen that his agro timer is extended, etc."
7/14/2011,"even simplified timers and aggro will still need to be explained to new players. in no other game that i'm aware of can players bait other players into pvp in such a dizzying array of different ways quite like eve. a new player shouldn't be forced to learn every possible way that can happen, but the tutorial should give them the basic knowledge that taking from someone else allows them to shoot you, the difference between yellow boxing and red boxing, and gcc. also, the basics of the aggro counter that doesn't allow docking/jumping for 30 seconds should be explained to new players. if ccp wants to retain new players, they need to do a better job of giving those players the information they need (in a game when losses really hurt) to not lose ships left and right to other players until the quit in confusion. when they lose their first ship it should be to a ""crap, i forgot about that"" rather than a ""why can he do that? why can't i do this? how did i just die?!?"""
7/14/2011,"collisions on things sutch as asteroids, and stations, and flyign space junk, are a bit ridicoulus, i have lost too many stealth bombers to rats because i cant allign, even though that asteroid is the good part of a thanatos' length away from me.i beleive that ccp should attempt to get the "" collision wall ""right up with the opbjects skin.any other sugestions?"
7/14/2011,"objects are typically defined as an arbitrary set of spheres, which i think makes the collision detection simple since the game only needs to know the distance between your sphere and other spheres near you. trying to make objects an irregular polyhedral shape would probably make the collision calculations far more complicated."
7/14/2011,"yes it does. the sphere, even elliptical ones, are the easiest shape to test collisions with. if everything is a sphere, then the equation becomes measuring the distance between 2 points and comparing that to the radii of the spheres / ellipses. if you use cubes or lists of triangles, you have to test against each face. that will hurt the server's ability to perform."
7/14/2011,"but thats the attitude that i feel ccp has and i am bothered by in the first place. whatever happened to ""excellence""?"
7/14/2011,"dropbear stated theres no reason to fit them the same as conventional ships for the situation, as much as im critical of ccp atm, im sure they know that the fit you posted isnt an accurate portrayal of how to fit your motherturd. i would liken it to going on the test server and fitting your ships up for a bit of fun."
7/14/2011,"^^^this, and more of this."
7/14/2011,"that was the part that i really didn't understand, ccp brought it up and the uninformed csm raged as if hs carebears were in wh mining abc ores unmolested, but in all of the tidbits in the minutes i saw no reasons for this nerf. i would gladly accept this nerf if wh can also become a bit more self sustaining, but that means adding ice, grav sites or comets w/ice. previous posters have stated the pain of logistics in moving ore, wow, that's an understatement, i need to bring in everything, from fuel, ammo and spare mods and ships and take out everything if i plan on refueling... ore is not cost effective in this, sleeper tags, sleeper salvage are. also, for wh residents in c5-c6 wh space they are not there for the ore... sleepers and gas for t3's, but ore? yeah... i've never run across a hulk in anything higher than a c4.one caveat, i have run across a couple large operations in c2 holes that use a rorqual which significantly eases the logistics pain of moving ore, these are the only operations that will be crushed by this, since they made the investment in that ship and it is stuck there... for the rest of us... it'd be just another nerf/headache of living without a market or a reliable exit."
7/14/2011,"i once or twice ventured into a wh connected directly to high sec. i now live in nullsec as a miner/industrialist. tbh the nerf is totally unnecessary. there is more risk of someone blowing up your hulk in a wh than in nullsec because pirates go into whs often specifically looking for the easy ganks associated with them. what i dont like about this nerf is they make out that whs in high sec are like high sec but as everyone knows, theyre not, theyre equivalent to nullsec.next theyll be suggesting that all the abc ore in a nullsec region vanish when a high sec area gets directly connected to it via a wh.of all the changes that could be made, this seems like such a pointless, unnecessary change which just makes the game more linear. i like the variety of options and associated risks. saying abc ore only in nullsec, sleepers only in wh, etc. just boils the game down too much. itd be no more fun or challenging than boiling the game down to three ships combat ship, industrial ship, mining ship."
7/14/2011,"and yet again proof howfar the current csm has grown away from the average player who doesn't see null sec as the endgame.the whole removal of abc ores from wh space is utterly ******ed and only get's an approval by mitanni and cronies cause every penny they can't make on a certain thing needs to be nerfed so they can get more.every abc you can't mine in wh means less competition for the nullsec residents. they already managed to bring faction drops in hi sec to a virtual halt and also to bring droprate of mods in missions down a few notches.for high end minerals they want you to be as dependable as possible of null sec. not to mention the moon goo story.the whole issue at hand is that the major part of the community which lives in high sec isn't as vocal as the null sec dwellers, which makes (mis)representation for them a lot easier.i personally feel we have to find a few very good strong candidates for high sec and get some real blockvoting going for the next elections.then you will see a whole other sort of blockvoting from null sec."
7/14/2011,"just to play devils advocate, why not take them out? most of the people i see worrying about them going away also say in the same paragraph that its hard to get out of there and not worth it. if its so hard to get out and so logistical intensive then why worry about it going away?again, i'm not trying to start an argument, just confused."
7/14/2011,it's as challenging to bring materials into the hole as it is to bring them out. the minerals obtained are mostly used within the hole. there's something just wrong with requiring hole residents to be reliant on null-bunnies for the materials we need to survive in more challenging space.
7/14/2011,well that makes a lot more sense. thanks for the clarification.
7/14/2011,"so run, get elected and make it mean something.or would that distract you from making idiotic troll threads on the forums, you stupid attention seeking dumbass."

7/15/2011,"nex clothes are fully destructable. nex manufacturers however, understand the dangers that pod pilots face and when you buy them you get two sets. one for your current clone and one for your medical bay one. when you get podded you get to claim an new replacement from the manufacturer, and that has to be shipped out at considerable cost and thats why the damn things are so expensive you are actually buying a lifetime's supply!implant manufacturers do not do it because the cost of a single implant would make it prohibative.they don't show on the killmail because nothing on the podkill shows. but rest assured pvpers when you pop that pod you definately scortched that guys skirt!"
7/15/2011,can i get a link to back this up as something beside an idea you came up with please?
7/15/2011,"really trebor at what point exactly did you think that was even a little relevant. lots of us have done ""meaningfull"" things in their lives, perhaps even more meaningfull then ""writing computer games and helping to create the anime market in the us"".who knows some people here work for nato or the eu, fund cancerresearch or even work at hospitals. its time to get of your high horse that's actually a small pony from up here and get to grips with the fact that you need to do more then just rehash pr info. this goes for the rest of the csm also.everything in eve can be destroyed, even nex items when they are in the hangar of your ship, thus they should also be destroyed when you lose your pod/ship and are wearing them.0.0 isn't the most important thing in eve, it has become the most important thing because all the rest is broken with skewed reward/risk ratio's. we need to balance the whole of eve not just 0.0.for instance:faction warfaremining (get a decent mechanic, like reynir's 'deep sea trawling'/fishing idea)mission running (there has been some input on that front)"

7/15/2011,"this is the last time i will try and explain it to you all.the issue is not that they are cloaked. cloak mechanics do not need to change.the issue is the tactic is not having the desired effect. people have become so used to it that while some folks post threads like this over all going into a system and cloaking and walking away from your keyboard is not causing the effects it should.yes all the countering tactics, running with friends ect, get used when a cloaky comes into system. that's not the issue. the issue is that while it disrupts a system and causes a little grief and lowered production. it in no way causes the effects that it should.a cloak in system should stop that system in its tracks, while folks try and find him, bait him, kill him, work at protecting assets ect. that's what i want to see change. the cloak doesn't need to change just the afk portion of it. untill the afk portion of the tactic changes it will continue to be just an annoyance and that's the part i want to see change. i want to see this be more capable then what it is of disrupting a system. for those that asked, i would create hours of fraps for intel for systems that i wanted to take down. any good tactician gains as much information as he can before launching an attack. you also don't need fraps. there are programs out there that can ""read"" the info displayed on your screen and put it in a text format. sit 130 off a gate cloaked up walk away and you get to see what kind of ships come into system how long they where there by having local logged properly to see who was in system."
7/15/2011,"seems to me the simple solution to the afk cloaker is requireing cloaks to actual use cap !to generate a system that reflects the universe around you should require a great deal of energy to accomplish ! this way it requires the cloaker to to recharge cap while decloaked and gives the carebears time to hunt him down ,,,,, bahahaha who am i kidding they will still hide and whine ,,,, but still this is a sound solution to the issue !"
7/15/2011,"and how is this different from, say... neutrals in local who are afk when you are mining/missioning in lowsec?(the answer is that it isn't different at all)therefore, the annoyance, is ""just something you have to deal with when you are not in highsec"".so nothing needs to change here, except maybe, that everyone who cannot deal* with this annoyance should move back to highsec.* using the standard counter tactics that have already been mentioned many times in the thread."
7/15/2011,why are you avoiding my questions?
7/15/2011,make cloak drain cap.done.
7/15/2011,learn to deal.done.
7/15/2011,"i skipped over most of this thread as it is a well known topic. but i had to add my 0.02 isk.afk cloaking is just another form of espionage or covert ops. it is no different than the police leaving an old squad car parked under a bridge or along the side of the road. it will deter speeders even if there is no cop in the car. it is one of the jobs cov ops ships such as recon ships are made for.the ones that do this are generally the same characters in the same area's. after a while you will get to recognize most of them, and know when you see them in local, they are usually afk. the truth is many do not do this to disrupt the system, but do it for gathering intel for their alliance. i have done this, not actually afk, but to everyone else it would seem i was afk. i have several accounts, and when i am busy in fleet with one account i often will place characters from the accounts i am not using in cloakies and stick them in nearby hostile systems. not to disrupt the system, i have no intention of ganking miners or ratters(unless i get bored) but i do it for intel, so i can alt tab over occasionally to see what is happening in the system, if a counter fleet is gathering there or not. a good fleet commander always has scouts in the surrounding systems that they expect a possible counter attack from. the best way to avoid a surprise attack is to see them coming. watch the systems you know they will be coming from. if you see a spike of reds in local, there is a good chance they are headed your way. maybe your fleet can even go after them before they get organized and ready to fight. there is nothing like catching a fleet while they are forming up before the logi guys are ready. it always means a few easy kills before they get there **** together.just my 0.02 isk, but try to understand why players do things before you go and rage about it."
7/15/2011,"mag's i already answered your questions. along with a lot of other folks. i don't want to see the cloak mechanics change at all. i want to see the tactic cause more chaos and problems for the folks in the systems, in return for that i want the cloaker to actually have to be at the keyboard. being sorta afk is fine your still on another account and changing back to it your still at the keyboard, with changing it to where you can't afk cloak it provides us with a lot more disruption, gives us the chance to try and bait you. disrupts the system 10 times better then what it does now, generally provides more fun for all of us. i would rather spend an hour trying to bait said cloak to kill them then to know that they are afk and be stuck in my normal activities all the time.so in short.make it to where you have to be at the keyboard, in return you all get better disruption of systems and more accurate intel on a system.benefit for the pvper: better disruptions of the systems allowing you to prevent industry level gains and better disruption of ratting.benefit for the carebear: knowing that the cloaker is active and therefore allowing you to do the normal hide or to actually start getting into the pvp aspects of the game."
7/15/2011,ohh and mag's me thinks your looking at it from me complaining about the tactic being used on me. its actually the other way around. i am looking at using the tactic and what i would like to see happen.
7/15/2011,they should remove cloaks and probes from the game so its just like it used to be way back.
7/15/2011,no
7/15/2011,"cosmetic onlyand to op. if you can get rid of the obvious biased words from the original post you might earn a better attention to ccp. you might not like mt, but you don't need to be immature about it."
7/15/2011,"it is not what is already in game that is the problem. yes you can buy plex and sell them for isk and use that isk to buy what ever you want. but this does not hurt the game economy. you are basically buying game time, and trading it to someone for in game stuff/currency. this actually supports the game economy as the isk generated from the plex was worked for buy who ever bought the plex, and the items bought with that isk were made by someone else in game, so plex effectively remove isk from the game helping to curb market inflation. the items bought with that isk were made or looted by someone in game who put them up for sale. it comes full circle and supports to in game economy. the thing many players are affraid of is mt directly for items means players willing to spend real life money can obtain them with no benifit to the other players in game. this is not a problem with vanity items, but what if you could buy the whole ship with the new skin for aurum? this puts a ship into the game that nobody built and with no benefit to the in game economy. the current plan as i understand it, is for those new ship skins to cost aurum plus the normal skinned ship purchased or made in game. which is not a problem. but every other mmo that has introduced mt has eventually started to sell items that did effect the game. it start with xp potions or in eve's case probably some implant that speeds up training time. then moves on to unique weapons, and eventually the best in game items are only available through mt and can not be earned or made in game. this is what most of us are worried about. not what they are saying now, but what will happen down the road."
7/15/2011,"quick, dirty and efficient supercapital fixes...all:* remove ewar immunity, or, alternatively, have ewar modules work at 50% effectiveness against them* preferable : add jump drive ""spool up"" time (not very long, under a minute)* optional : logoff ""vanishing"" timers doubled (or even tripled)supercarriers also:* bomber-only bay separate from drone bay (which is made too small to fit a fighter)* change +2 bonus to controlled (now only) bombers from ""always on"" to a +2 boost for one dcu per level"
7/15/2011,well done ed ! very well thought out ...... kudos !
7/15/2011,"the lag issue really bugged me, which is why i thought the minefield would be better than reintroducing individual mines. and with three sizes and three damage modes with in each size it would allow for greater customization of the defenses without making it too overpowered and while still keeping it dangerous for both the owners and the victims."
7/15/2011,would love a little gallente love.

7/15/2011,"it would be nice if cpp did something, gallente suck arse atm"
7/15/2011,"i read in another thread where someone suggested having a cargo rig type structure that could be anchored anywhere, frieghters could dock here to load/unload cargo. he also suggested having it so you could add modules and such. although i like the idea it seems a little far fetched. i have also read some players suggesting making poses so they could be anchored in dead space. so i think that this might be a cool idea for t2 poses. let them anchor anywhere, no moon required. give them more ehp, less power grid/cpu, and maybe a built in hanger. this way by sacrificing a little power grid/cpu you can anchor them anywhere, filling this niech sugested by the cargo rig/platform idea. a t2 pos would be perfect for this. there would of course have to be restrictions, like can not anchor within say 1 au of a cosmic signature or asteroid belt, or whatever. you could anchor a t2 pos at a safe spot or in deep space where the only way it will be found is through scanning. maybe even add a defensive module that makes it harder for probes to detect. these poses could be used as deep space depots, or to make jump gates harder for the enemies to find. i would think the power grid?cpu penalties would be high enough so you can not run capital ship manufacturing there, but then again why not. freighters can load cargo at a pos so these could be used as safe spot docking stations for freighters. just a thought, but what do you think about the idea?"

7/15/2011,"on may 9th, ccp made an ""every question answered"" thread. they poorly estimated that they could answer all questions within a week or so. two months later, small groups of answers are still trickling here and there... i check it every few days. on the second page of the answers that are posted so far is this:i was curious to see what that ""new effort"" link was all about. it was a lengthy thread which then lead me to this thread, in my mission to find the most current discussion on fw and these unanswered questions. i personally asked a questions about fw on the initial ""questions"" thread and am waiting their response. they are not exaggerating about the ""many"" fw questions asked... there are a surprising number of them.anyway... long story short, i have been given the impression that ccp has something to say about fw (in addition to the response above, i think it was referenced in a recent video or during the tournament) and i give my support to efforts made to make progress or at least get the answers on fw."
7/15/2011,anything that might result in ccp fixing the broken mess that is fw is worth a thumbs up.
7/15/2011,agreed with op and rodj
7/15/2011,i too was drawn in interest in this however being told to find other pursuits as you cannot fulfill some of the objectives due to mechanical fractures means the game content has been broken in an update and never repaired. our corp leadership discussed this as a fun thing to do in the future but we will not ask players to embark upon a content that is broken.
7/15/2011,"sorry i fully support fw - ccp bought me off with the missions. good things;1. free war dec2. missions for income bad things:3. occupancy mechanicsnot sure there's anything you could do with the occupancy mechanics. although, here's an idea i had. the locals in low sec are tired of giving their allegiance to an empire that spends more resources on fw pilots than they do on protecting their space. this is going to change.1. expand occupancy mechanic to all of low sec and all of npc null sec.2. occupation gives you minor bonus for stations in system, ratting, anomolies (something like 5% boost in payouts).3. change occupancy to include all corporations and all alliances that do not hold sovereignty in 0.0 - including the current fw factions.so here's the mechanic. 1. plexes operate and respawn the same way they do now. however;2. plexes aren't run by proxy navies, they are not filled by empire navy factions. they are filled by the pirate factions in the area. 3. plexes are capped by killing all rats in it (no spinning buttons). plex closes when last rat is killed. 4. the corporation/alliance/fw faction that kills the last rat earns points towards occupancy. the local civilians recognize whoever takes down the most plexes in the last 30 days as the top dogs (because these factions have helped clear the systems of evil pirates) and they give bonuses out to them. these could be pirate corps, rp alliances, whoever doesn't hold 0.0 sov.this way, many small corps, small alliances, rp groups, whoever, can have some fun fighting for something without having to join an empire faction alliance. fw alliances are still around and still in the mix, but others participate too."
7/15/2011,"supported.depending on the market conditions, you can make up to 180m isk/hr from cyto gases. my most profitable hours in eve have been cyto sucking and c1's...or ninja salvaging. i support this because, firstly, we will get a new chance for an invent a starship competition; throw it open to the eve community to design a cool gas ship. secondly, if you have a dedcated salvager ship, you may as well have a dedicated gas ship. thirdly, it gives the devs an ability to look at the booster market and lowsec (aka mylhani's idea for the mobile redneck drug lab of lowsec) in a new lightfinally, it will make w-space more vibrant and deeper because the gas mining specialists would have something new to devote a month of training towards, even if the ship buff is something as banal as extra cargo per level of skill."
7/15/2011,thumbs up if you want pod squishes back
7/15/2011,this would certainly give navy ships some love - which i'm all for!more importantly it would keep pirate ships out which in turn makes the plexes more fun for t1's (which have a much better chance against navy ships) as well as force veteran players to fight on more level ground.+1
7/15/2011,"problem? no problem, already supported this most noble endeavour.destroyers are awesome when done right, but i eat them in t1 frigs if they are ****-fit or low-skilled and walk all over them in navy frigs so can only imagine that pirate frigs will barely notice they are there.if on the other hand it is t2 fit and flown by a skilled pilot you are no longer in noob territory as price is quite high and they take more than xx sp to fly properly .. gives my slicers a run for the money though.same ""issue"" with all ship hulls really, they are accessible quite fast but you'll end up dead in a hurry if you jump the gun and board it.ps: won't support with this secondary main because it is dishonest, so 'hah'!"
7/15/2011,"i support making pirate faction counted as t2, i do not support making navy faction count as t2. no excuse for not using navy anyways tbh, that **** is basically free to everyone in fw."
7/15/2011,"yup, this does make the most sense (as long as we still get a god damn fix on the spawning)"
7/15/2011,"these are the parts of the argument that make me not want to see this sort of thing in game in a general sense...but, at the same time, i stand that like i've said before, this isn't really the pro-[monetary component]-for-sp conversion proposal.a reminder that i am an '06 character, and i've done it the hard way all along, and enjoyed it. i've had plenty of great n00b experiences, and this isn't about that.i don't want anyone over some arbitrary value, say 10m sp, to be allowed to apply purchased sp. you bought 10m? apply it to one char. bought 20m? apply to two, and so on, but not on any one (10msp is just an argument sake). additionally, i would certainly not want to see sp spent in any category over a 3x skill set. meaning, if it's a 4x category? no purchased sp allowed here.they already have lock outs for skilling up for trial accounts, so, there is code for it, etc.but, the point. severe limits, and high dollar price tags allow such a thing as an avenue for some folk. this isn't about the rich brat. he'll have to spend his rl monies on isk, and whatever few sp, or, go to the bazzar, and spend the same on that 10msp char someone else squatted, and skilled up. difference being, limits in place, the bazzar still had trade value for over [whatever amount of sp]. no high sp n00bs running around (except the bazaar ones, of course... ). and no insta-titan pilots.that isn't the plea here. the plea is my friend who shows up in a t1 frigate, and the other 10 or so of us in 2+ year sp afrigs's/bs+fits. he can't play with us, and all this ends up doing is promoting a squatter in the fleet, earning standings, while he plays l1's, or mines tiddly winks. this creates a frustration for the new guy. as older players, we are more than happy to train them in the way of playing, fitting, learning the system, etc. but, /they/ get frustrated, and just leave. i've already lost 3 bud's to the whole ""eh, don't want to listen to you guys having fun, when it's going to take me 3-5 months to get into something that let's me run in those same missions with you""....my only other alternative to this is an idea of ""buddy"" pilots. no sp for sale? ok. but, perhaps the half way point is pilots get a new skill [leadership: protectorate], which allows us old-timers to add (if interested/willing) to train it up, and grants us some ""simply there"" (passive, like siege warfare standard, et al) and grants stupid high resists to t1-only fitted frigs while within 20k, and some %age over normal damage. if aggression timer kicks in ; kill the bonus, aka ""neuter the temptation to exploit for gank fests"".*shrugs*"
7/15/2011,"you have a point here. there is a problem with noobs fleeing the game** because they can't figure out how to have fun quickly enough. but i do think that this may not be the solution to that problem. (as buying sp can be abused). so maybe what we need is for some 1 time only noob training missions which give out sp boosters which are 1 time use for boosting specific skills/trees. specific because we want to limit them to be used on say only 1x and 2x skills, and they cannot be used by players over a certain sp. also the skill branches they can be used on would be reflective of the career path training agent they got it from. the sp limit on use will prevent them from being resold, as they will be of no use to experienced players.another idea is to make the sp usable only on skills that are in the 'beginner profession' certificate skill trees. so the 'military traning agent mission paths, upon graduation, gives a bonus of soldier sp, that can only be used on skills in the soldier - basic, certificate tree.**though, as someone pointed out, the number that do stay keep the growth of the player base positive"
7/15/2011,"thanks for thinking with me. not looking for skill point give-aways... just looking for ways to get folks that are willing/able to have an out for a boost that helps get them ""into the game"" in /some/ way. plugging into the larger old timers crowd is a hard step when you know they spent 4-7 years getting there, and no matter what you do, you will have to spend that time to play with widget x. it's a bit daunting to new-comers, and try as i might to point out lower level ships, and toys are often plenty useful, it's easier to say that (from their perspective) when you have the choice.agree. outright large scale sp sales is not a solution. it's too pragmatic without concern for longer term consequence, if it's done without some pretty serious limitations.this is some thinking on our part (the players) to help ccp with creative juices, rather than leaving it to them to solve something on their own. not that they can't ; but, we would like more players, and would like to see the longer term success of the game, and perhaps help maintain some momentum in their success so us old timers have game to play later. if it's slow growth, it's still growth. no one has made the argument (that i read in this thread, anyway) that we should open the flood gates of sp sales unchecked.but, to be clear. i don't make any argument that all new players see, all new players leave. that's silly. but, i have experienced personally several who just aren't interested unless there is something that allows them to at least participate with their buddies that already have much higher sp. it's fun enough they want to, and i've even convinced a couple to stay by going tot he bazaar, and getting a character that way. but they aren't always sure of that as an out, as not many are willing to fly around with the name ""fluffy mcsimpleton"" or, whatever. perhaps a start might be aur purchasable renames, but, that's another disaster waiting to happen, as well, i fear. perhaps ""rename on character xfer for an extra $50"" or some such? *shrugs* again, just trying to think a way through all of this to allow new comers to have some way to plug in with a more meaningful way that makes them ""feel"" like they are plugged in."

7/15/2011,"lol. wow, you are one sad little man :-d nonetheless your original tears over your very own !@#$up remain for all to see."
7/15/2011,"the suggestion was made that i needn't gain aggro before docking. i said i often do need ecm mods/drones or combat drones (though if i need to bring them out, my chances are usually very slim, but !@#$ it, i'll try anything to escape :-) ) to escape. you then said ""why would you have to worry about using ecm/drones/etc if the purpose is to break the lock so you can warp?"". i basically said ""..."".the upshot is if you can't see why i'd sometimes need to gain aggro to get away from an attempted gank, you've obviously never had someone try to gank you.so really - what are you on about and why are you trying to call me a troll? you're the one suggesting i never fight back, which makes no sense in many situations where i'm scrammed."
7/15/2011,"the amusing part is that you think i'm upset. the sad part is that you and a few others feel that anyone who makes a suggestion does so for selfish reasons. sorry to harm your world view, but not everyone is a self centered prick like your self.as for the issue of the thread, thanks for participating. ;)"
7/15/2011,"it obviously bothered you enough to post this thread then spend 5 pages defending it.sounds like you're kind of upset to me. this is a well known tactic and you made multiple errors that resulted in your death. let me reiterate you lost this fight through your own stupidity not because of the orca's ship maintenance bay.you are also quite hypocritical, the guy flipped you in a vigil, i note that when you ran back and grabbed another ship you didn't pick up a t1 frig to give him a ""fair"" fight you brought back a t2 ship.lets break that down. you are mad because the pirate switched into a superior ship after you switched into a superior ship.now lets go down your mistakes. first you engaged a a can thief, this is a mistake because the only reason people will steal from your can in a mission is to get you to aggress which means he expects to be able to win. now do you really think a vigil stands much chance of killing a mission bs before he ran off or you blew his ship up?no the vigil was used to get dumbasses like yourself to engage thinking you'll get an easy kill. any reasonably intelligent individual would know that he would be using a different ship for actual combat. you didn't which is my justification for the first sentence in this paragraph.you're idiocy in this case is slightly mitigated by the fact that you grabbed a different (cheaper) ship to actually engage him in.you're next mistake was not recognizing what the orca landing in the mission pocket meant. this is a very commonly used tactic which you should have known about, even so it was an unknown variable in the situation and that change should have been enough for you to re-evaluate the situation and decide to gtfo. you're final mistake and the one that cost you your ship is that as soon as you lost lock and he switched ships that should have been your signal to gtfo. it was going to take a couple seconds to lock and you could probably get outside of point range and warp away in that time. you were in an interceptor so it's not like it would have taken you long to align to warp out.as far as using the orca's maintenance bay being a cheesy tactic, sure but it's just one more in a long list of cheesy tactics. he could just as easily warped back to a station to have his bigger ship ready when you got back from grabbing your inty.face it you're just mad because he out thought you. you thought you would be the one to get an easy kill but instead he turned the tables on you. but please do cry moar your tears are quite tasty."
7/15/2011,"opposed.this comes down to housekeeping - both of your wormhole, and within your corporation.#1 don't let them build up, ie; be active and utilise them, spawn the crappy ladars so they disappear, spawn your gravs if you don't need them, and you won't have this problem#2 organise your in-corp intel somehow, via motd's in intel channels, web applets, googledocs spreadsheets, whatever it takes."
7/15/2011,"seems you talking about owning systems or equivalent but there are some vagabond or freelancer in every sec lvl<U+FFFD>s, tooplay a game to use as many out-of-game-utilities as possible while a relativ simple database change could prevent this? well yes, your suggestions are possible and used already but i think they schould<U+FFFD>t be needed. and something like a (customizeble) boardcomputer would proof the game experience, too. not even for roleplayers. the more i think about, the more usefull capabilities i can find. make them useble with scripts that can be bought on the marked. some business scripts for trader or a roid-field database for miners and so on.i dont like starting my browser to get informations as fast as possible. i like to explore some roid-fields und mark those who have valuable ore<U+FFFD>s in it. but not on a google sheet or else. those technics are more for real life actions.but yes, fleet/corp/alliance sync. could be possible, too.have to edit: going away from topic a bit but i think it starts with static signature names."
7/15/2011,"as i've bought a new graphic card i've seen (ctrl+f) my fps are much higher than 60, as 60 is the maximum my monitor can show, the rest is power waster.i'd like ccp to introduce to the client a new option where you can limit fps to a certain custom maximum.what do you think about it?"
7/15/2011,"60 fps is about the average limit the human eye can detect, too.i'm curious though, what do you hope to gain in limiting the fps to 60? you don't lose anything by going above 60. your hardware consumes the same amount of power if it's rendering 5 fps or 5,000 fps."
7/15/2011,"i can monitor temperature and fan revs of my graphic card. on fixed window mode if i click on eve client it goes to a 150fps average (monitor still showing 60fps), on the other hand, if i click out of eve client the average fps goes down to 60 and so my temp and revs (of the graphic card) do. this is a prove that not limiting client to the maximum of your monitor can show it's power wasted, (graphic waste, and energy waste as heat)."

7/15/2011,"new to the game. new players to the game, with no isk cannot make any money from fw. essentially forcing wannabe pvpers to be mission standings grinders for the first 3 months in eve.there may be other problems, as someone else mentioned, but the problem i see is that it has an impossible barrier to entry for new players, where as other professions can support themselves for new players."
7/15/2011,"exactly my point. and though lvl4 missions make money in fw or normal missioning, that isn't the problem. the problem is lack of a 'beginner' -- err ""new player"" -- profession path for pvpers. fw was supposed to be it, but it fails in that regard horribly. (23 jumps to do a lvl1 mission that can get you killed and not enough reward to even cover the loss of your ships???)other professions have easy 'noob' paths:pve - missioningindustry - miningexploration - salvagingtrading - npc commodities all of which can grow your isk and skills.pvp - ???solution may be just to make the lvl1/2 fw missions pay more. i mean they earn so little lp, and the number of things you can get at the lp store that are cheap enough for a noob to buy are not really profitable to sell. also, if it isn't this way already, lp should be rewarded for kills. so the 2 pronged approach is1) make sure low income players who don't have the standing yet to do lvl3/4 missions, get paid enough to replace their frigate/destroyer class ships.2) encourage more shooting of other pcs by rewarding more cash/lp for kills. (though this may affect the veterans, so must be careful to balance)"
7/15/2011,"interesting that you mention this because i heard it was the opposite, the caldari have more numbers in the militia, but the gallente top the kill boards, followed by amarr. i have heard many self-deprecating jokes from those in the state protectorate about their own inferiority, and how many of their numbers are actually spies from the much better organized gallenteans. though maybe things have changed."
7/15/2011,"you already said you had no clue (or words to that effect) when it comes to fw so why go on?thanks to the broken fw plexes you can take a t1 frig and get all the standings you want in a matter of days .. literally days. after that it is bomber training for the lvl4s and you are good to go .. you should come see the farcical situation in the fw areas, 80% of all ships are alts in bombers going back and forth grinding lp."

7/15/2011,"it will never work if you try to limit super capitals by some kind of limited access natural resource, you will never get support and it isn't realistic or fair to players in general.limiting stuff by sov would work if you could actually win the game at some point but this is persistent mmo so you cannot. having limit by sov would mean that bigger alliances would just get bigger and bigger until there was only one left. also there has always been supercarriers without alliances...easier way to limit ""amount"" of them would be just limiting their abilities and usefulness in general so people just wouldn't use them. just check out dreads.there's few things which would reduce number of supercaps on field very quickly and they would also seem pretty logical to me:- reduce supercarrier offensive capabilities, adding fighter bombers for them was a mistake at first place. they were suitably strong already and thus their amount in game was sane. - reduce titan effectiveness against sub capitals, they're still too effective- and most importantly in my opinion, normal cynosural fields need to change to have some kind of timer before cyno can be used, i could agree with even cynoship moving while doing it as long as there is a timer. in my opinion timer should be equal to aggression timer before you can jump or dock to make cynotrapping useless at gates or station undocks that would effectively reduce supercap usage in low sec also.all these things make sense though, so i don't see that csm or ccp is going to support them."
7/15/2011,"you put a lot of thought in but i don't think you'll get any support for this. i don't fly supers, have no interest in doing so and i still don't support it. your proposal would restrict supers to those in established alliances in sov space. there are a lot of us who prefer the pseudo sov of low, npc null and w-space to those mechanics. and i see no reason as to why we should be forbidden to have those ships. we already can't build them, being unable to board one takes it way too far.the solution as said is to reduce their appeal. sc's are an all in one wonder ship, when that changes, we'll see their numbers go down."
7/15/2011,"so the alternatives are either make them unlimited and useless or limited and useful? in my opinion the second alternative is better.also remember that this idea has general advantages when it comes to nullsec industry and small scale warfare.and the relative power between the blocks will be kept. typically as it looks now, the larger your alliance, the more systems you have and the more supercaps you have. the same will still be true with my suggestion only now supercaps will be something special instead of just, meh another titan."
7/15/2011,you say lvl 5 indy for a titan ???pls check the eve map and tell me how many lvl 5 indy systems there are atm plslast time i counted i had 5 or so you need 20+ hulks mining 24/7 to get it to lvl 5 and keep it therei think that's kind of hard to doand how are small non 0.0 alliances ever going to be able to get suppercaps ?
7/15/2011,"why would you want supers in low sec anyway? they are more or less expressly built for nullsec warfare. i mean if you are going to nerf super carriers anyway, why would you as a low sec pilot want to use one if you instead could use a much cheaper carrier with superior rr support?as i see it, there is no harm in making the supers nullsec only, it defines nullsec and nullsec warfare."
7/15/2011,"as i said it would not be easy to have a large fleet of titans, but remember that there is a lot more room in nullsec for industrialists than today. part of this suggestion was to get more industrialists out there by giving this as incentive.well as a small non-nullsec entity you wouldn't be able to field supercaps. you would just have to take some smaller out of the way system first, hold it with regular caps, get an industry going and start producing supers."
7/15/2011,"linkagemy take on the issue ?the bare minimum, quick&dirty but sufficiently efficient supercapital changes needed...all:* remove ewar immunity, or, alternatively, have ewar modules work at 50% effectiveness against them* preferable : add jump drive ""spool up"" time (not very long, under a minute)* optional : logoff ""vanishing"" timers doubled (or even tripled)supercarriers also:* bomber-only bay separate from drone bay (which is made too small to fit a fighter)* change +2 bonus to controlled (now only) bombers from ""always on"" to a +2 boost for one dcu per level"
7/15/2011,"your proposal is interesting, but not well thought trough.problem n<U+FFFD>1big alliances will effectively have more suppers than small ones, that may even be true for today, but what happens if that one alliance keeps winning because of their amount of suppers ? as for today one can narrow it down to this statement, field more suppers than your opponent and you win. the result would be one alliance that rules all of 0.0 as there is no chance of anyone beating them due to their lack of suppers.problem n<U+FFFD> 2you state, that an alliance can only have as much suppers as they have industry 3 zones, but every supper that exists will still be operational even without sov. so let's beat your system. first you build a supper and board is as you got enough sov and kick that char out of the alliance. now you got another free space for an suppercap and can go on with that method until the end of time ...although the second one maces the first obsolete, both are still flaws in your system and therefore the hole idea has to be rethought."
7/15/2011,"yes this is a pretty large hole isn't it? i didn't think of that at all.but i think it can be fixed with some creative thinking. say for example that if you sit in a supercap and move between corps all modules in it get deactivated. then the game runs the check every time a module is activated on a supercap. this would also prevent refitting of the supercaps as long as you can't support them, which may be both good and bad.but it sounds like the general consensus is that most players want the supercaps nerfed and unlimited instead of powerful and limited anyway. question is if ""most players"" know what is best for the game...personally i would like to see the supercaps as something special, the way ccp imagined them when they were created, but maybe it's just time to give up on that notion."
7/15/2011,"it wouldnt actually fix that supers are op. supers need a nerf, which as akita pointed out should start with making sure they cant fit an unlimitted ammount of regular drones and lose some more of their flexibility (either by forcing them to use their high slots for dcus, but i have also seen other proposals that simply nerfs their ability to fit neuts for example).furthermore, apparently there are 5 industrial 5 systems, that are 5 more systems than i expected. it is stupidly hard to keep industrial levels on a reasonable level. (especially since it is trivial to put an afk cloaker in them and simply bridge in a fleet once in a while to obliterate the mining ships, you cant defend agaisnt that, thats why it is now way more useful to have multiple lower level industrial systems).and then finally you give the dominant 0.0 powers as only ones the ability o field supers, i cant see how that could possibly go wrong..."
7/15/2011,"you missed the point i was raising. though i have no interest in leaving low sec, many new alliances use low sec as a stepping stone to null sec sov. in order to take and hold null sec sov, you absolutely have to have 50+ sc's. that's just the way it is these days. your requirement basically forbids any new alliances from entering null sec except as pets.secondly, your whole proposal evades the entire problem. sc's are overpowered, make them not overpowered and they will be less desirable due to them requiring a dedicated character slot and being relatively expensive. i don't see very many titans running around, do you? the reason they are less popular is they aren't game breakingly overpowered like sc's are. in fact once you ignore titan bridging, the 15b isk sc's are superior combat ships compared to 50b+ isk titans. and you're telling me there is nothing wrong with that?sc's need a good whack with the nerf bat. i'm not totally opposed to some production restrictions but yours seem heavy handed and skirt around the real issue anyways. for production limitations, i've always like the unobtanium idea. make it so only a fixed number can exist."
7/15/2011,"this is bad - it gives even more power to those who already had it, and takes it form those who don't. it makes it even harder to lose what you already have, and harder to gain space if you're small... :s what's good about this?"
7/15/2011,"i couldn't give a flying fig about burneden's need to safely deploy, viz, sniping nightmares, sniping blops, sniper machs or whatever other ship they wish to deploy in k-space at a gate. their problem is they are deploying expensive ships to pvp and hate the fact an easy countermeasure exists to increase their risk to the point that it is untenable. boo hoo. find a new tactic. here's the facts: if you are sitting within 14 au of someone, you're on scan (shocking statistic, huh?). if you are in a bs, someone needs to get 4 probes within 1 to 2 au of you to get you at 100%. if someone can put those probes within 2 au of you regardless of your safespot location, they get a warpable on you, and voila, you are boned. their problem in doing so is reduced to zero if you are idling within 200km of a gate. if your safespot is not within 250km of a celestial, this makes it harder. this is especially true if you are not within 1 au, and especially so if you are not within 2 au. but it does not make scanning you impossible - just harder. skilled combat probers can give you as little as 5 seconds of probe time in the water on scan from you (assuming they have launched probes off scan). this is, viz. them putting in more effort than ""deploy on gate hit scan"" which only works on burneden and other whingers because they have crappy tactics. your problem is solved by, firstly, maintaining d-scan coverage of all areas of the solar system, and reacting to a combat probe launch accordingly. second, not idling within 250km of a gate and crying when someone dumps probes on you. thirdly, running d-scan and not relying solely on local to allow you to safe up like my little ponies when someone jumps in.if you make probe scan times longer than the current minimum of about 5s (with perfect skills) then as previously mentioned, combat probing is dead. real combat probing, not the hamfisted idiocy which nullsec and lowsec and hisec fools think is what you do with combat probes. as it stands, to be safe in w-space, you have to mash d-scan constantly. 10s (plus probe warp time) would make w-space too safe. in short, adapt or diaf."
7/15/2011,"exactly my concern with the proposal, probing while available to anyone rewards not only investment/sp but experience.making changes to how probes work by extending time for instance will exclude all but the ""leet"" from partaking and that is not something i want to support willingly.you have 2-4 full sets in space at all times. one at 0.5au around target celestial, one with 1-2au range and sets in neighbouring systems (reconnect to probes is awesome!).gangs such as the ones be run must necessarily have safes relatively close to their target area or base travel time makes it so ineffectual that you might as well not bother.alternate solution (or in conjunction with increase in warp-to range): - make core probes capable of scanning down probes in general.- make all probes destructible (target/shoot).let the cloak'n'dagger crews wage their own little war behind the scenes. has to be cores to open door for using probes as ""bait"" so no point in having ships show when probe hunting .."
7/15/2011,"not only is your post full of factually wrong information (you can get a 100% hit on a bs with probes at 8au, just fyi) but you are ignoring (mainly due to the fact that you were somehow manhandled by be at some point in time) the fact that the probing changes completely negated an entire fleet type (fleet sniper bs) and what these new probing times have done to on grid combat probing (2 forces on the same grid, usually each will have a prober in fleet with probes deployed on grid, giving a 100% hit in 5 seconds to the other fleet).this has pretty much changed the face of battleship combat to be either arty abbadons or arty maels, there is no reason to bring anything else to a fleet fight, as there is no reason to be able to hit farther than either of those ships is currently able.also you should stop being so mad that people think of things/spend money on things that you are unable to, it shows all over your post."
7/15/2011,i don't know how you achieved such poor results but my forays into drone-space via a k346 static c3 was incredibly profitable. just stop holding onto the low-end drone poo.
7/15/2011,i don<U+FFFD>t see any need to buff drone space. drone space is owned by drf. drf are the worst bot-users in eve. bots run 24/7. problem solved.
7/15/2011,awesome idea! then the russians wil have even more isk to sell! fully supported.
7/15/2011,"my bad, you're right. i misunderstood. still, i think stripping racks + ability to lock / unlock modules would be better. similar to how you can offline a module in the circular fitting window, you get a padlock symbol that you can toggle for modules. so your ewar boat can have everything but jammers locked, click strip rack, re-fit jammers you want. your mission ship can have everything but hardeners locked, click strip fit, re-fit hardeners you wants. the op does say racks, not modules. i'll support this, these are simple ideas that are a convenience and don't change gameplay."

(please tell me he's not the smartest guy in the room.) am i missing something?what's being done about bots? if ccp has no plans to get rid of bots, could i please have a 'bot' button/module so that i can passively earn say 50m isk/hr without doing anything? i don't think that would be very difficult to program, correct me if i'm wrong.those are enough questions, i guess. obviously you're incapable of getting ccp to devote any more than the pitiful trickle of resources they devote to internet spaceships now so i take it that finished content is out, optional incarna is out, a firm commitment on microtransactions is out, an apology from hilmar is out ... trying to think of something constructive you guys have accomplished or might conceivably accomplish in the next 6 months ... nope, i guess there's nothing."

7/16/2011,"that's the issue, old players not wanting new players in the game. while i cannot support this issue due to the fact that in the end it is buying skill points, just getting them over a longer period of time.the idea that new players should not come into the game is wrong. new players are what allow the game to continue to grow and stay alive. should we cater to the new players no. i say this as being a new player. however we should make eve interesting enough to encourage them to play and continue to play. the older players while they should not be necessarily nice should be the ones to come up with the ways to get new players in the game and keep them in the game. the whole attitude of the older players is what is honestly driving players away from the game.its not enough to point out why an idea is bad and come up with an counter argument or even a way to make the idea viable, you all trash or wardec the player that came up with the idea. seriously there have been some decent ideas that have been posted that while not viable and i cannot support have a merit of truth to them and could become viable if everybody worked together to make them viable instead of just trolling."

7/16/2011,personly i think they should remove local and put in new probs that can do nothing other then prob out active cloaks both other wise bo's and other stealth ships become to powerfull.but at the same time i think it should take like 5-10 mins to prob out a cloaked ship too. and you cant prob out any other ships becouse the probs should only be able to find active cloaks and nothing alse. have to pull thoughs probs back and relauch the normal combat probs for ships and thoughs probs should not be aloud to find cloaks.but thats just how i feel about it. i dont feel you should be 100% safe and unprobable no matter what and you diffently should not be in open space and be 100% safe and afk and still know your ship is going to be ok ether.
7/16/2011,"you're only 100% safe while cloaked. once you have to move your ship out of the system, or undock if you docked earlier, you're subject to the dangers of gate and station camps.but really - the fud that cloakies seem to inspire is largely undeserved. with a little awareness and organisation, it's easy to protect one's self while ratting or mining. it's having to actually lift a finger that bothers the 0.0 carebears - they're worse than highsec carebears who at least know the realities of highsec."

7/16/2011,"noteworthy ideas but i imagine ccp intends to bring back the original ship spinning with an ability to enter cq, as its alpha version originally allowed (see the original videos for incarna several years ago). an option of 'which is default' loaded will be available in the menu.as for an animation, though everyone is clamoring for one, it will likely never come - or certainly not soon. as any veteran can tell you (and really a 6mo char) there is one video in eve - and it's not actually in the game, it's prior to it. there isn't a single in-game video anywhere - no cinematics, nothing. the cq is the first real introduction of this on the screens - which are just simple displays.as neat at an exit/enter pod animation would be - players would turn it off after the third undock. eve is an impatient society (may have something to do with waiting on skills?). we got so impatient that scotty was fired and apparently had most of his clone brothers bioprocessed (the original is probably still out there somewhere - maybe sansha abducted him and that's why incursions take so long to spawn and despawn)."
7/16/2011,"doing my best to avoid the infamous 'we' (because i can't speak for the playerbase, and if under the right conditions sometimes for myself...it's safe to say that the majority of the players who have been involved in fw (or still are) would like to see faction warfare updated in some form or fashion to an actual 'feature' - not a war status. as united way would say, ""not for profit is a tax status, not a business strategy."" faction warfare needs a boost both in content (not necessarily in rewards like ships or modules, but mechanics) as well as differentiation - that is to say, fw pilots should feel like they are engaging in a different kind of pvp.how this should be accomplished is not the topic of this thread, and i will not address your idea - it needs to go to features and discussion forum. for that matter, all faction warfare threads should be in f&i since it is a feature. i have created this thread specifically to ask the csm to involve themselves in this process actively and get the ball rolling, a feat ccp is notorious for not doing.i ask that you support this thread as a show that you, too, wish to see the csm take an active stance in the promotion of further developing faction warfare into a defined feature of eve online (if not a career choice like missions, piracy, mining, manufacturing, etc). there is, after all, a career agent dedicated to explaining the basics of pvp. thanks!"
7/16/2011,"needs to be moved to features and ideas forum...as for the typical response - another more efficient ship will only cause gas harvesting to further drop in profitability (as if it could reach new lows). the idea that struck me as best is approaching this issue not through ships but modules or additional boosters.one such proposal called for the total removal of attribute enhancing implants and replacing them with (legal) boosters that last a set amount of time, coming in various strengths and duration (which fleshes out the market and manufacture of them). the booster effects would then be interrupted by pod-death or change of clone (much like implants behave now). the point was that gas would get a boost in usefulness throughout the game (hisec particularly), players wouldn't be so frightful of death because boosters could be cheaper (being duration based, not permanent), and pilots who regularly engage in combat could utilize shorter duration but also cheaper boosters when out of combat.pvp pilots aren't know for flying around with a +5 set - but they might use +5 boosters when they aren't actively in combat. again, all of this should be in the features and ideas forum so devs will be more likely to read and comment on it. (they are much more passive in the ah since topics are for the csm)."

7/16/2011,"when you kill a pod it would go 'squish', quite why you need a youtube vid for something your imagination can do in a split second i don't know."

7/16/2011,"navy faction frigs fill the role of combat interceptors, so comparing them to afs is kinda moot. even though they can give some afs a good run for the money.firetail vs claw is up for debate, i'd say firetail is superior in general due to slot layout. or rather more flexible.taranis vs comet, mostly on par but comet does come out slightly ahead. that is, before we consider it has a full flight of replacement drones. easily makes comet the better choice.crow vs hookbill, honestly the hookbill outclasses the crow to such a ridiculous extend its not even funny. how you'd chose a crow over the hookbill unless its simply a price consideration is beyond me.anyway, back to the top."
7/16/2011,"yeah, lets do it."
7/16/2011,"i have money that i can splash on stupid things, why not pixels and junk!! you can't afford it? well get a job and quit whining and preventing me from spending mine!!let me spend my way to eve greatness - i can buy officer fit faction bs, why not the skills to fly it effectively?"
7/16/2011,"the day ccp makes sp appear out of thin air and sells it, i quit.you want to buy skillpoints? go buy plexs and buy a character off the character bazaar."

7/16/2011,"your error, along with the rest of your ilk is the assumption i am mad about loosing the fight. i encountered an imbalance, an imbalance i knew existed but had yet to experience first hand. now that i have, i can speak to it.the annoying thing is this all too common eve tough guy attitude. you give me ****, i throw it right back in your face. i'm not afraid of being called a carebear or shrink in fear from stupid comments like ""go back to wow"", etc.an imbalance exists, in my view it should be addressed. you need to defend the cheesy tactic by calling someone names and going after the messenger. you're full of ****, deal with it. you're just another fake tough guy sitting behind your screen."
7/16/2011,"no, you're not upset, are you? :-d you've not spent five pages crying about your stupidity getting yourself killed, nor have you abused anyone and everyone who pointed out the realities of the situation.*pats you gently on your back* there there. there there. life is just so unfair, isn't it?ah dear, it's just too funny. i wonder how long you can be goaded into continuing to embarrass yourself? oh, and don't hesitate to share your future !@#$ups :-) someone like yourself ought to be a near endless source of amusing pratfalls in eve *grins*"
7/16/2011,"effect: orca pilots cannot allow anyone access to their hangar apart from their own alts, since that would be just an open invitation to have your orca flagged and ganked.aggro transfer like that does not show in the ui. the poor bastard has no way of knowing someone can legally shoot him in hisec, or that he will not disappear after logging off in lowsec/nullsec/wspace.now i am all for griefing and ganking, but invisible aggro timers the victim has no chance to notice is just plain stupid."
7/16/2011,"you sure assist flags add the pvp timer for logoff, doesn't for rr as neutral logis seem to disappear just fine. not hidden timers either as you get the flawed ticker in left hand/top.the problem with aggro solution is that the orca is technically ""innocent"" as he just happened to be there in his mining support craft with fleet members who just happened to shoot stuff adding the run of the mill docking timer for all maintenance arrays is by far the least intrusive solution. will require minimal adjustment to account for in the field, except when a whole fleet absolutely positively has to change to frigs mid combat!!"
7/16/2011,"lol, i've nothing to be embrassed by. i'm not the one showing my ass, you are. you jack offs just can't help your selves. too funny. keep going. :)"
7/16/2011,"this is likely the least expensive, in terms of code, to implement."
7/16/2011,"yes, it would just leave the question why a friendly carrier would refuse a friendly ship docking rights for attacking an enemy.makes sense for stations and gates as they are neutral entities, for ships of your own corp/alliance/fleet not so much.arbitrary answers like ""it works better that way"" dont really cut it here, given how wormhole jump/spawn mechanics work.edit: given that the whole 'issue' is pretty much irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and ontop of that is easily being avoided by just a little common sense, i still see no valid reason to touch it."
7/16/2011,"thank you csm for all you do, cheers.i suggest that a nerf is appropriate only a percentage of the time.though it is the easiest to implement, it is also not necessarily conducive to the prosperity of eve or any environment.it ****es off all the people it affects directly. an indirect approach wouldnt catch so much criticism. like giving people the power to overcome what you consider needing to be nerfed.you see it in nascar and governments and other environments. when considered on a single case basis it makes the best sense.when reglations are added up over time and considered by the end user or affected parties, they are not necessarily positive.in balancing a game, countering a nerf, with increased capabilities to the other parties involved, can have the same desired effect. without caging, the victims, with a negative effect. its much harder to implement sure. the easiest rout is not always the right one.example: i flew in a game called fighter ace. it was a combat flight simulator game. in the beginning it was very fun. over the course of 10 years the most whined about uber killer planes were nerfed. at the end of ten years everyone was flying around in bathtubs that wouldnt turn, couldnt shoot, go fast or take a punch. it was boring and the game died.thinking out of the boxroar exodus"
7/16/2011,"i too agree, that nerfing 90% webs was bad thing. bring back 90% webs.really dude."
7/16/2011,"the system needs to be looked at for sure, but just paying you a wage to be part of the militia = free isk so that wont work. also if your getting major lp or isk for killing pod pilots then what stops them sticking an alt in another militia and farming kills for stuff?i love the idea that you get rewarded in fw for getting involved in pvp, but you need some pve material too. i think it comes back to the issue that plexes need to be totally revamped or axed for a new system. i think at the very least pve content in fw should not be doable solo in a stealth bomber, it should be more like incursions where you need to work as a small gang team or the whole militia. we need a system which encourages people to join fw for what it should be, awesome small gang warfare, with group pve/pvp content."
7/16/2011,"alright, let me first say that i'm not really sure where to post this, so i'll do it here as the most likely place. kindly put this thread in another place if need be.here goes. i was thinking about a cool gameplay idea that is kinda like the incursion mechanic. for prosperity, i have named it ""instability"".now, the basic idea is that, just like incursions randomly pop up, so too can these system instabilities. you then have a choice whether to aid the sovereignty holder/concord or the pirate faction/3rd party depending on where the instability occurs. the winning side (again, depending on what initial npc/player faction started the instability) can then convert the security sector into a higher or lower value depending on how overwhelming the victory is for a few weeks or months.i think that this could make the game a bit more dynamic and make you really feel as if you are changing how the universe is like living in. imagine turning jita into a 0.0 space for a few weeks. or a contested 0.0 area into high sec with concord flying around popping you if you do all the regular things you do out there in lawlessness.because of server strain/patches/whatnot, instabilities might not happen all the time.i'm thinking that every security sector (except 1.0 and systems adjacent to newbie areas) should be a viable place for an instability to occur.of course, this might not even be possible to begin with and i understand that completely, however i'd still like to hear the communitys thoughts about the idea."
7/16/2011,"i can see it now, null-sec players getting lolz first absorbing low-sec and then majority of high-sec into their empires, would make newbie integration into the game impossible, considering they would all be packed into only a handful of systems, and the game basically becomes about paying everything your character owns in tribute to your null-sec overlords or you can never mission/rat/mine or anything unless your in thier roster."
7/16/2011,"not necessarily. if you limit the areas that can be affected (for an example, a certain amount of systems within a 1.0 newbie area cannot be destabilized), then it should be possible. another things is, that unlike incursions, nobody says that instabilities have to occur all the time. once in a while, 2-3 areas could suffer from instability. afterwards, after a fixed set of time, the destabilized system becomes stabilized gain and returns to normal. how does that sound?"
7/16/2011,"so basically the discussion is we've going from one near-impossible situation (catching an unprobable sniper bs) to the show being on the other foot, if the snipers are facing competent enemies. i can see the call for a happy medium, but the fact that fighting in or against sniper bses leaves so little room for error on either side, finding that balance is difficult. for the term of the unprobable ship, the ball has been firmly in the sniper's court. while i personally enjoy the change, i do see the inequality."
7/16/2011,got my support. as is probing a ship down in 5 secs is bs. second battle ships this day and age are not much good in pvp other then sniping. ya you can use one but you can spend less isk on a smaller faster ship that hits just as hard and is harder to hit and hits more targerts easyer.i personly dont care about wormholes though. wormholes and the new scaning changes have screwed alot of people over from day one. i mean realy scan a hole solar system in seconds in some cases 0km lock in 2mins or less thats just dumb. i could drop ccp in 24 squar miles of wheat fields with any gear they wish and they could not find me in 2 days let alone a hole solar system.but i have felt is was ******edly fast from day one any ways.
7/16/2011,"supported, jesus christ if you dont want to support this then maybe you should pull your thumbs out of your arses and actually conisider balancing ships across the board. woohoo sniper bonuses in a game where sniping is literally death, never mind the rest of the useless ships. love your game but ffs fix the blatant gaps."
7/16/2011,"since it`s obviously you don't seem to grasp the real issue here, i'll do my best to give you a reply.- we have no problem that probing exists, or that there is a risk involved. - that we might be probable in a ss is of no concern to us. we have been probable before and it didn't give us much issues.- unprobable setups as a combatfit came to life basically because of the probing mechanic we have today. to be honest, i can come up with a bunch of other useful stuff to put on my ship then a bunch of eccm mods.- the main problem is that probing as it is now, makes sniping bs a non viable tactic. fear of getting sniped? simply deploy probes on gate, station, whatever and you will have the snipers spot before his warp animation is done.that is not risk. that is bad game mechanic. you are welcome to come and test this, and i can assure you that we will have your ship tackled before you have aligned back out again, even in a cruiser."
7/16/2011,i constantly run into this annoying thing called 150km. it practically means engagement range is limited within somewhere approx. 75km range from target and that will pretty much count out everything long range but it isn't limited to that. it even means that if i have a relatively fast ship and i keep kiting enemy gang they might just warp to just one guy who is fast enough to keep up the pace with my fast ship and warp to their range again.i am not feeling intelligent enough to say if it's totally bad or not but it surely gets annoying if you try to actually fly in space and then suddenly gangwarp.supporting the general idea for sake of keeping the discussion up.
7/16/2011,how damn long does it take a company to fix a game sound problem lol? really make this game still feel likes it's in a beta stage? come on fix it!!support please i'm sure alot of you want this back
7/16/2011,i my sound was un-broken with tyrannis. was unware people still had major sound issues... i do now occassionally get an issue when i start a second game client where it glitches to no sound at all though.
7/16/2011,i have not had game sound period so it get boring unless i have music on while i play. its pretty pathetic really.
7/16/2011,"it's weird - you start off with sound, then it slowly fades away to nothing over a couple of days. so you do a re-install and lo!!, sound is returned in all it's glory. then it slowly starts to fade away to nothing over a couple of days.i don't think ccp want us to have sound in this game anymore. i know of plenty who have no sound either but we are getting used to it (much like you get used to a canker sore or an ingrown toenail)."
7/16/2011,eve has sound?
7/16/2011,hmm does ccp actually look at these posts at all? its not like this post is important or anything sound make the game more enjoyable. happy customers mean long time paying customers. fact!
7/16/2011,eve doesnt have soundsi also fully support keeping it that way. everything should be possible to notice visually without a sound effect. a) it helps people who cannot hearb) you can listen to radio whatever meanwhile
7/16/2011,"first we have to consider all who are affected, we're getting close. is there even any truth, we don't know. ccp could pull mega reserves and compare them to sell orders. mega was the only one i recalled that dropped after wormholes. i bet there is a reserve not responding to new market pressures cause people overmine it cause of greed. even if the reserves are in balance. it was good to loosen the null stranglehold. besides price, the out of region logistics complicated t1 in similar ways to t2. its nice to have highends dropped in empire from small wh operations. because i like the effect of null not having a stranglehold on highends, i do not support this initiative.beyond t1 convenience, t3 would have to rise to compensate. its too expensive as it is, a cruiser over a carrier price? lots of times yeah.there is a process going on, the situation is not static so it does not require a nudge. if things aren't stalled, the market can do the work. mineral price was balanced by lower demand from the introduction of lag and the balance they did in the drone regions. they have stimulated demand with sov changes and work on lag. the prices are just starting to rebalance in the opposite manner than they balanced. it looks smooth to me so there must be reserves people are itching to sell.some people have lost moongoo income, others have taken space and not utilizing it yet. no outside rebalancing should be applied at this time."
7/16/2011,"according to the qen for q4 2010 the population disctribution in eve is:hisec: 79.61%lowsec: 6.68 %nulsec: 11.26%wormhole: 2.45%therefore approximately 80% of ccp customer accounts and 80% of the players the csm represents are based in hisec.despite this i have heard little if anything of csm/ccp thoughts on future hisec developments. please could the csm/ccp enlighten us.minutes from the may csm meeting indicate the next expansion is 0.0 focused (to follow the dominion expansion perhaps). the csm also expresed a desire in the minutes for nulsec residents to get sole access to abc ores, better t2 invention opportunities, and to be able to operate with further independence from hisec. i saw nothing to suggest ccp/csm have any thoughts on how to enhance the eve experience for the 89% of people not in 0.0."
7/16/2011,i will buy sec status from -7.2 to -1.9 for 100$..ccp just give us the option. you will make so much money
7/16/2011,"if being selfserving is a great job then i have to agree, they are wonderfull."
7/16/2011,"they're sure as hell not representing us. democratic representation requires accountability, and the csm is accountable to no one. and they know this. which is why you have csms telling players they're ""stupid,"" ""always wrong,"" or calling them ""whiny"" and ""irrelevant."" and if that doesn't get the point across they just tell players with criticisms to ""die in a fire.""csm doesn't really achieve anything meaningful. the csm members are, however, attempting to do something meaningful in the form of suggesting changes and nerfs that will directly benefit themselves.the first rule of bureaucracy is to perpetuate its own existence. the second rule is to secure perks for the bureaucracy members."
7/16/2011,"i read alot of negative responses in the forum to a point where one wonder why some are actually playing eve for my part i think it's a really good game, richly detailed and fun to play and i want to send a big cheers to the csm and ccp."
7/16/2011,"you said it yourself.. if people didn't really love this game, why would it make them so mad?"
7/16/2011,"actually it's because people love this game so much, they get so mad. you don'thear anything from the people who doesn't care.many, or at least a lot of the people who write in the forums feels ccp have lost touch with the playerbase, that they dont play the game themselves anymore. one thing that makes this very evident is the new turret icons that are fubar. then theres the lack of communications from ccp, the mt, the forced cq, the mail from hilmar, the fearless intern ccp magazine, plus a number more.i am, which you have probaby figured out now, one of those that love eve, and it breaks my heart when ccp is seemingly down prioritizing work on eve to focus on dust 514 and wod.but you are right, apart from the above, eve is a good game, it is fun. thank you ccp. but csm? atm, i don't know who they are working for"
7/16/2011,forever - a future vision world debut trailer (2011) | full-hdccp's eve - a future vision 1080pfor me if ccp is pushing for their game console and these players can interact with the players from eve this will be exciting so it worth the patience to wait for next coming of dust514 and incarna is a step ahead in this direction.
7/16/2011,"man you got it all wrong and sideways. it was said in the devs blogs that at the beginning we would walk around the quarters and not much else. so there it is, we walk around the quarters. personnaly i think incarna is stunning especially the view in the station. second of all, i play second life and it is a role playing game and a social network, as of eve is a mmo so we can see you cant make the difference between a mmo and a rpg..."

7/16/2011,"you can send an receive evemails already via evegate and reading evemails (but not sending them) is accessible via the api, so you just need someone to make an app that supports that"
7/16/2011,"because it isn't that simple. just because you do want a service from someone, does not justify bending over and taking anything and everything that is asked for that service.no one (who isn't an idiot) has a problem with the concept of vanity item micro transactions. the problems however are in that first sentance. firstly, ccp said they were not going to extend the rmt model outside of vanity items. the leaked email said they planned 'to evolve the nex store' (paraphrasing). secondly, the price is not justifiable. nothing they are providing in the nex, is worth what they are asking, nothing fits the bill micro transaction. the man power and materials needed to supply these things could easily be paid at 1/10th of what they are asking. no one has a problem with the concept, it is the degree.put it this way, if you went to buy a litre of milk from me and i asked 30 dollars what would you say? you might laugh it off and walk away not letting it bother you (you can get your milk elsewhere), or you might take offence that i have devalued your money and in turn you by asking out of all proportion what i am offering. either is a valid response. now imagine that you can't get your milk anywhere else. you want milk, but you can't get it from anyone else, so by your reasoning thats cool to pay me 30 bucks right? i'm not holding a gun to your head, so im not forcing you. that justifies it right?it may not be up there in the realms of starving orphans and world peace, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth objecting to.nor is it out of place to ask for an equitable exchange. that however, is not what i am asking for for this milk, and it isn't what ccp are asking for nex.actually, on an unrelated note, i might have a bridge if your buying....there was also some opinions expressed towards or about the community which has fanned the flames of those torches.now i am willing to believe the community may have acted prematurely in the non vanity issue. the price issue however, the facts are right there in front of you just by clicking on one button.it needs to be emphasized that they only people who are either a) arguing against the concept of vanity micro transactions or b) making it out to be vital world issue are the strawmanners."
7/17/2011,"hey guys, ill be changing up some stuff after i talk to the csm this next week. see what shoudl be removed and what will be added."
7/17/2011,i expect this fireside chat to go as smoothly as getting us the may summit minutes. c/d?
7/17/2011,i got to about page 3 of the responses and saw nothing but trolls with bad logic. so i'd just like to say i agree with this position and give you a +1/inb4ccpalt
7/17/2011,"yes, indeed. and we all know which ""folks"" are this csm's sole raison d'etre, don't we...oh wise, supremely clued-in people who didn't even know wormholes are -1.0-rated?don't we.tell me, what's it like being a joke? does it rankle awhile and then stop, or does that little tingle of knowledge never quite go away?thank you, treb, your answers, along with the minutes, are proving most...instructive."
7/17/2011,nein.

7/17/2011,"really? wow. some people never learn.csm, do the rest of the universe a favor and don't bother with another so called fireside chat with the mittani. there is enough bull**** being spread around than to subject us to him doing audio ************ spreading lies."

7/17/2011,sorta a troll comment! (sorry!)i hope there is a fire side chat on april 1 - and wonder what things the csm could come up with and how many people would believe them.... till laughter breaks out.

7/17/2011,"thanks to csm for doing this. it was a very depressing and pessimistic performance, but thats not your fault and you are fighting an uphill battle. i got some interesting insights thanks for that."
7/17/2011,"i heard more of white tree than mittens, but i guess you'd rather have your pre-conceptions confirmed that actually listen to the facts."
7/17/2011,"wow. i 'get' that you think you are edgy and hip in some sarcastic profane fashion, but as a player elected representative, you fail. it's not about you deciding what the game should be for everyone, it's about you being professional and trying to represent everyone as you were elected to do.you do/say things like this then expect any respect?"
7/17/2011,was white tree still crying over it's free trip to iceland?
7/17/2011,anywhere we can get the recordings of this chat?
7/17/2011,...
7/17/2011,"just listening to the recording.what is ccp gonna sell us as convenience items?ships, fitted ships, ammo delivered any where, more ship saved fittings?are they gonna **** anything in the player driven content?you wouldnt answer that question and id like to know what they are gonna charge for."
7/17/2011,"convenience is a pandora's box though. if you offer say ""ammo delivery"" for a small fee then that gets around the player economy *effort*, thats a no no.any service that could be offered in-game being conjured out of *thin air* that a player would have had to have provided himself, beforehand, breaks immersion.that only leaves things that are outside the scope of player interaction, like ""extra ship fittings"". but the problem with things like that is avoiding the perception that you are simply out to grab as much cash out of the individual as possible for seemingly tiny improvements that should already be a part of your subscription.perceiving people as greedy is almost as poisonous as mechanics that break immersion."
7/17/2011,"could be but more likely they will start with things that aren't obvious market workarounds want extra wallet divisions for your character, not corp, pay them, how about for the corp, pay them, how about not having to fly out to get a skill book pay them over and above the npc sell price and it will spawn, want extra jump clones pay them, how about reducing the time to use a jumpclone by 4-6hrs pay them, how about increasing the standing/security you gain by a factor of 2 for 24-48hrs pay them. the point is they will try stuff they think will gain traction with some people and be 'meh' to others always looking towards pushing the envelope to full pay for advantage aka p2w. they might not introduce p2w for a while but when dust514 enters it will have pay for advantage and that is the beginning of the conversion to bring it into eve if it isn't already here by then. just as plex turned out to be the seed that brought 'mt' into eve for all the good it was supposed to do it will always be the progenitor of mt in eve. dust514 will be the point we mark when eve had some claim of not being p2w and when it no longer did for all those that understand what and how plex works of course not the 'plex is pay to win'. the people who think like that are okay or say 'meh' to more mt and pay for advantage because they are not cognisant of the difference just as ccp hopes with their ideas that skirt the fine edge to appear to not be gamebreaking or have loose ties to the market to mask the p2w aspects."
7/17/2011,"ea did that with battlefield heroes (theres a video blog with statistic and everything before and after changes.it work almost to good to be true for them, even the most rabbit haters where later spending way more cash then the avarage user. cba to find link thou sry, it was posted in eve general some weeks ago. but im 95% sure we will see this(read quote) as its logical from the numbers point of view to the company. myself ill play aslong as i feel the space game weights up for the doll game. and im actually up 1 account since incarna :p.but i dont have any illusion about where ccp is heading. its the same way everyone else in the market is heading _everyone_."
7/17/2011,"so much for the cold hard eve i feel in love with. looks like the road to hello kitty is on its way.oh well, all good things must come to an end i guess."

7/17/2011,"with all the advocacy of social engineering and creating personal relations and all that angling, do you still think you have personal relevance in any of all this in the aftermath of repeatedly ending up in pant's down moments thanks to your ccp brosefs?"
7/17/2011,"i read this, laughed, looked at my cat, and immediately realized this had the potential for a lolcat picture. too bad my camera is broken. t_ti thought this thread has effectively been shot down - but i guess some dead horses need beating still? soundwave confirmed local is getting changed, if not outright removed, in nullsec - but it likely won't happen until the winter expansion."
7/17/2011,"without nullsec local won't they still stay in-station, terrified of what might be out there? after all - if an afk cloakie scares them silly, imagine what the unknown will do! :-dseriously - i doubt any changes made will satisfy these nullsec crybabies."

7/17/2011,"wormhole space is better in every way, this is obviously why far more people live in wormholes then in null...oh wait...you don't know what you're talking about. was mildly amusing though. 4/10"
7/17/2011,+1 for asking csm to do their job.-1 for assuming they will when you voted.+1 for trying to help fw.you're good in my book.
7/17/2011,"dear ccp , csm and coplayers,when a player do missions in empire space there is a explicit warning when enemies in the misions use warp scramblers from a agent before accepting the mission. i trusted in this warning until today when there was no warning, nevertheless there was actually a frigate scrambling me. i was not ready to handle the situation and lost my ship. please fix this either adding warning messages to all missions with npcs armed with warp scramblers or a general warning under help->missions ingame that you can meet enemies with warp scramblers. as the situation is now new players like me trust in the warning and then have to write a petition reimbursement when there is no warning and you get warpscrambled."
7/17/2011,welcome to eve..you are always warp scrambled unless you are not.
7/17/2011,no. also lol.
7/17/2011,"great idea.also add a warning that nasty ships may shoot at you, ccp.i considered it quite rude and unfriendly to us new players."
7/17/2011,this may be an interesting read for you.
7/17/2011,"especially after ccp soundwave's recent grandstanding about it being too easy in eve to make money, i say it's time to remove t2 bpo's from the game. the people who own them have been able to outrageously exploit these isk printing machines for years now, and it needs to stop. i therefore propose the following:-- remove all t2 bpo's from game; which is to say, convert them to t2 bpc's, with 100 licensed runs on them. no refund, or any other kind of compensation, shall be given to their owners. ccp already made them trillionaires overnight when they gave them these isk printing presses. it's time for them to get off their lazy asses, and work for a living, like everyone else."
7/17/2011,no.go read one of the billion threads on the topic that have a majority consensus that they are in line with invention in terms of profitability.
7/17/2011,agreed. i say ranka mei should buy a bunch of plexs in order to reimburse the current owners so we can finally get rid of this atrocity.
7/17/2011,in before akita t unloads on the op as to why he's wrong.
7/17/2011,"this post is bad, and you should feel bad."
7/17/2011,if the profit from these is comparable to invention then what is the problem with removing them?or what is the problem with releasing more?
7/17/2011,it's unnecessary.
7/17/2011,also: add the option to play your own videos. nothing says immersion more than watching your fav tv show and playing eve at the same time \o/
7/17/2011,i would like to make a proposal that the pre-incarna sound effects for strip miners & mining drones be reintroduced as soon as possible. i cannot see a viable reason why they were removed in the first place. the current sound is quite pathetic and not in any way 'industrial' sounding. i would also like to see the return of the cracking rock sounds when 'looking' at asteroids being mined although this is secondary in importance to returning the old laser sound effects.nb. this proposal is for return of the old sound effects only as the new laser visual effects are indeed 'cool'. if you support this proposal please reply to this post. thank you.
7/17/2011,i am in favour and give my full support to celgar's proposal for the previous set of sound effects to be returned for strip miners and mining drones.
7/17/2011,supported because it was yet another pointless 'improvement' that just made things homogeneous and bland. a few weedy beams of light are pathetic compared to the nice big pulses you had before and if the sounds have changed that's even worse.
7/17/2011,common sense? you won't see any of that from the op. he thinks he's being persecuted and 'rationalises' away any and all counter argument as trolling attacks.p.s. how long do you think i can keep him embarrassing himself here for? :-) five pages so far!
7/17/2011,"lol, keep it up. show the world how much of an ass you truely are."
7/17/2011,"how many supports have you got, again? :-d nah, you're not wrong, are you? *snickers*p.s. if you can't spell, at least use a spellchecker."
7/17/2011,"i'd say he spent as much time defending as you guys spent attacking him.yes, he handled the situation very poorly, like a noob really, and got shot to smithereens. however, try and not fall into the trap i did at first too: mocking him for his gameplay at the expensive of the legit issue he brings up.when you got a player aggro timer on you, you're not supposed to dock up for a while (or jump gate). the orca offers a way around that, in the form of what clearly appears to be a loophole. the only logical way to deal with this, therefore, is to close the loophole, and suspend the offender's docking privileges to the orca's ship maintenance bay for the duration of the aggro timer as well.again, try and separate the logic of this reasoning from thinking about the circumstances of the fight; because they're irrelevant, really. it would, in fact, have been much wiser had the op not mentioned the fight at all, and just outlined the issue. alas, he didn't. doesn't mean you can't strain yourself a little to distill the abstract of the matter at hand here, and base your vote on that."
7/17/2011,"the pf/rp side of things was sacrificed on the altar of balance a long time ago.why does a friendly player controlled station disallow docking? the issue exists solely because of a sub-cap (the orca) having a maintenance array with no restrictions. even the bigger rorqual has severe limitations: if people can't agree on having the same aggression mechanics apply across the board, then apply the rorqual indy-only restrictions to the orca.problem solved. carriers are unaffected and rp/pf is satisfied, the only 'losers' are high-sec ""pvp'ers"".edit: to compensate the 2-3 people who use the orca to actually haul assembled ships around which was the reason for not restricting its bay, give jf' and/or freighters the ability to carry assembled ships."
7/17/2011,supported:the cowardly risk-free pvp that orca and carrier hot-swapping allows is completely at odds with the risk/reward model of eve.
7/17/2011,"far better i think to simply apply a cooldown to ships with aggro docking inside an orca.it still shafts innocent people who try to escape inside an orca from an agressor, and use ecm or combat mods/drones to get away to the safety of the orca (and thus gain aggro). but at least it wouldn't gimp the orca as you suggest doing so :-)but really i think the best solution is the one we have now, where it's not perfect, but isn't as bad as the 'fixes' being suggested. carebears can suck it up when they fall into an obvious trap, and pvpers can live with their targets sometimes escaping inside an orca. adapt or die. don't try to 'fix' eve till it's stuffed."
7/17/2011,"that would be a reasonable solution indeed.they already have that ability, you can make a courier contract and stick the plastic package in the cargo."
7/17/2011,"no downtime would make the signature's always have the same id's during it's lifetime. as for bookmarking each and every signature, that's just more load on the server, besides filling up the places tab. most dedicated explorers are scanning constellations, not just a few systems.i support this proposal and the options mentioned by vislor amatin."
7/17/2011,"the alternative to nerfing is power creep, which would be even worse for the game. personally i don't want to be playing something where only 5 ships are worth using.pretty stupid example as buffs can and do happen in this game. remember when nearly all faction ships were just as useless as you described there? remember when stealth bombers were just zero-nich<U+FFFD> toys? i do, but that changed and added more variety to the game.the inevitable cost of this is that simple poor judgement or unforseen metagaming results in some of these ships becoming overpowered - i.e. the dramiel. that's when the nerf bat is quite rightly swung.oh and lets look at major nerfs that have already happened. nano nerf? nanoships are still viable and frequently flown. they're just not godmode any more.ecm nerf? worked out fine, and brought the falcon down to ranges it's realistically possible to kill at.(and in the process they buffed the rook, adding another viable ship).so yeah, i really don't see why you're so worried here."
7/17/2011,"actually the nerf to webs was a classic example of over nerfing, something ccp excels at."
7/17/2011,"ya i'd rather them give us things than take away... why slow down dramiels just give us counters to the dramiels the nerf to 90% webs was over nerfing, less over nerfing needed more counters...."
7/17/2011,"the dramiel will still be perfectly usable post-nerf. and to answer your question: because if you've got a choice of bringing one ship back into line or buffing another 20, buffing the 20 would be a catastrophically stupid thing to do and would affect a lot more than one ridiculously op frigate.and exactly what do you propose implementing, that people wouldn't use for a lot more than dramiel bashing?"
7/17/2011,"yes, stop with the constant nerfing stuff. everyone who's ever trained a good ship inevitably gets nerfed by ccp. stop doing that!"
7/17/2011,nerfing webs to 60% was pretty much a perfect decision. that is one of the things ccp got exactly right.
7/17/2011,"and this has happened to you... how many times? i fly 3 races out of 4. grand total of ships i've had nerfed:... 1. the falcon.and numerous others buffed.yes, ccp certainly are ""constantly"" ""nerfing"" everything."
7/17/2011,"yes scs are op, so we can either:nerf scs (for example half their ehp).or we can double the ehp of all other ships, double the damage done by weapons, double the ammount repaired by repair modules, half the repair cost in stations, etc. then we are going to use a new unit for hp, where one new hp = 2 old hp.in other words scs have their hp nerfed by 50% only you made it look like all other ships got boosted."
7/17/2011,would be nice to get some medals for a few of those things. definitely would make them feel like something is being accomplished right at the start as well as giving some short term goals.
7/17/2011,i like the idea. gives carebears a little something extra to go after.
7/17/2011,hahhah i support this product
7/17/2011,this is not achievements online. try to set your own goals and show some imagination
7/17/2011,"considering fw already has this......and that the existing tier system perpetuates this idea......i don't really see a problem with it. carebears will be carebears. make it where my killmails show these ranks and such so i can change the start of my story from ""so i killed this carebear..."" to ""i killed this carebear that looked like a mexican general...""in all seriousness i don't see anything wrong with this at all, but i think development time is better spent elsewhere. hisec has all the features it really needs for the time being - low and null could use more love, as well as features like fw that got left in the dust after launch. players who spend time getting achievements isn't an issue, if anything achievements that require players to work together strengthen the community.that being said - i'd rather see achievements for null, low, and wh long before i see them in hisec. living in hisec isn't an achievement. it's where you started. it's the safest place in eve. there is very little adversity or difficulty spaceship wise (marketing is cut-throat at least!)"
7/17/2011,"i want this, if only so that ppl will rage against bears for it."
7/17/2011,almost anything that will incur the wrath of trolls and emo nullsec fanatics is good imo.
7/17/2011,bump
7/17/2011,"it's 60 seconds.... so apparently it's complicated enough! *giggle*regardless, this op is very confused and has little idea what they're saying and/or is simply terrible at communicating it."
7/17/2011,"can you please have some sort of skill like, ship assembly technician, which would@ l 1 allows the fitting and rigging of any t1 frigate without boarding it or being able to use the modulesl 2 allows the fitting and rigging of t1 cruisers and industrialsl 3 allows the fitting and rigging of t1 battlecruisers and t1 mining bargesl 4 allows the fitting and rigging of t1 and t2 battleships, and all t2 ships below.l 5 allows the fitting and rigging of t3 cruisers and capital shipsmaybe split the skills into combat ship assembly and ship assembly for combat and non combat ships. i would have this skill cost 10 million isk. this skill would be conditional of:1. industry v + some other high end indy skills like frigate, cruiser, battleship construction?i dont see why a factory should be able to use the guns well in order to mount them on a ship or rig the thing. specialized industrial characters should be able to do this without actually being able to fly the ship or use the mods and contract ready to use ships with all the bells and whistles."
7/17/2011,"not terribly many people even care to buy ships pre-fitted, making this somewhat irrelevant."
7/17/2011,"the case i know about is a friend who quit eve because coming out of the training missions, with 2m mil to your name, he did lvl1 missions for the state, got a destroyer, lost it, lost interest in the mindless monotony of flying 25 jumps to shoot 1 npc only to gain 150k and 100lp in mission rewards, and quit eve.so i don't know what this 'couple days and you should have enough to do lvl 4s' comes from. maybe you had a friend who tossed you 50mil to start? else where did the money to buy the stealh bomber come from?guess what i'm saying is how to bridge the beginner 2million to 50million isk hump (and get self sufficient enough to 'farm'?t1 frig used was a merlin, if that matters."
7/17/2011,"plexes, not missions. run defensive plexes semi afk or offensive in a speed tanking ab frig for militia standings.it is boring as hell but about as as riskfree and activity as you get in eve.bombers are not very expensive and the time it takes to get skills trained is more than enough to acquire the funds for several."
7/17/2011,"you still have the problem that high-sec corps have offices and pos's in high-sec, and most of those corps/alliances barely break even on bills, if their site foes under, they effectively have to close up, disband, and find somewhere else to live, because once it goes unstable, all the pirates and null-sec'ers will kill anything and everything left in that system.this means that youll have alot of players either stuck in the station for several weeks, pos's taht cost hundreds of millions of isk guaranteed destroyed, and alot of alliances wiped out by pure chance of game mechanics, its not really fair for the newer players who would suffer from that, the only people who would benefit would be griefers and pirates."
7/17/2011,"unfortunately, i still have to disagree with you on these points. however, isn't this what might happen in the real world given the right circumstances? if so, then i don't see any reason as to why this couldn't be possible. also, if this idea went on and became reality, then prehaps people shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket. if you cannot run your corp without your office or pos's keeping you on track, then prehaps you ought to think of expanding to include more divesity just in case. and new players aren't really that likely to even have a pos in the first place. it does, after all, take some work in order to place pos's in high sec. if, however, you have an alliance that is capable of doing so, then they should be aware of the risks involved. even if the system is not distabilized, a war dec can and will do the same to a new corp or alliance. is this fair? no. does it happen anyway? yes."
7/17/2011,"the idea has merit - but again you have a slippery slope. once an alliance reaches a 'critical mass' of systems they'll forever have far more supercaps and, by virtue of their not being limitless systems, opposition will continue to be unable to retaliate...resulting in zerg tactics if they can succeed.i'd suggest that a given alliance can only have x number of super-capitals active - literally link this to the alliance as an alliance asset, not a player asset. that number is entirely up for speculation - i can imagine 20 is about as high as i would want to see for a given alliance. this includes all capitals - rorqs, carriers, dreads, sc's and titans. freighters and jump-f's would be excluded given their absolutely necessary role as logistics and the fact there is no 'super freighter' to balance.that's my two isk. balancing the cost of the ships could be easier - as well as their actual stats, since this problem really didn't exist until supers. then you're just getting into whether the nerfbat needs to come out or if dreads and carriers need buffing."
7/17/2011,nerf artillery!
7/17/2011,"that's even more doomed to failure as the original proposal. what ships do you think an alliance would choose to have active if all capitals would count into this limmited number ? they would have x titans and or suppercarriers. why should one use a standard carrier if those two are just so much better, same with dreads."
7/17/2011,"sounds like a plan if the aim to solidify the chasm between the haves and the have-nots.two things need to be done to make supers/capitals less of iwin.1. destroying them needs to be ""easy"" without having to resort to super/capital spam oneself.2. production of them needs to be made more vulnerable.point two is already being debated as an option by having pos modules (incl. csaa) outside of shield bubbles.point one can be done by removing immunity, adding vanilla-drone bays and reducing ehp slightly.there, fixed them for you. now lets move on to the sov revamp, ls boost, hybrid boost, fw revamp etc."
7/17/2011,the great wildlands is owned by the thukker tribe who are nomadic and so do not need or use that many stations. consider them tribe meeting grounds rather than stations.
7/17/2011,very violent mongolians.
7/17/2011,"you can't bring a hulk into low-end wormholes.you can't refine very efficiently at a pos.you don't have a local, so botters can't exploit the system to just warp away when someone enters system.hell, actual players can't just warp away when someone enters system.it's more difficult to ship ore in and out of wormholes (you need to worry about industrials not going over the weight limit as they jump in and out repeatedly, unlike 0.0 alliances which just pile everything onto a carrier and jump it to wherever they need it.)low-class wormholes have insignificant amounts of the abc ores, claiming that it's destabilizing the industry is ignorant.wormholes don't have mercoxit. (afaik)wormholes don't have moon mining.wormholes don't have ice mining.so tell me why the bloody hell people want to nerf that?"
7/17/2011,"my corp will be directly affected by any such change. as a tiny mining corp (+/- 15 players, ~5-8 fulltime residents) living in a c2 wormhole, we see a grav site approximately once per fortnight. we have 3 people who can mine at all, the rest being combat site runners/security. our wormhole has statics to both c4 wh, and hisec. sounds like a perfect moneymaker, right?here's the reality:every day, the first one to log in scans down everything, and updates the bookmarks in the can at the pos. this takes about 15 minutes or so, on average. if there are any wormhole sigs besides our statics, we go look them over, and compare with dotlan (which is usually checked before we even log in). let's say we have a ""lucky"" day, and find a grav belt, along with 2 combat sites, maybe a lowend ladar site, our 2 statics, and a 3rd wormhole (k162 to anywhere).job 1 is to go visit that k162 and gather intel about who/what is in it. with 4 players, we won't be touching that grav until we feel we've minimised the risk to the hulks. just like any other 0.0 system, except we have no intel channel, no alliance to call on, and no instant local to warn us. to continue: we find where the k162 leads to, and run a ""box recon"" of the system, in order to establish who lives there, active ships, etc. this includes going on grid to all pos's, many of which have bubbles nearby to trap and decloak the unwary (using cans, drones, etc.) even if all this is done well, and safely, there's no guarantee the intel will be current 5 minutes after we jump back to our system. the person who did all this might still be alone (others not logged in yet for the day), and therefor has to sit by that hole and watch it pretty much until another corpy logs in. let's say we get lucky, and this happens within the next 10 minutes or so (no guarantee, out of the usual suspects, 1 is from ny, one from australia, 1 from malaysia, etc.). anyways, someone logs in, and a decision is made, based on the previous intel, to crush the hole, in order to provide one less potential threat to the hulks. this, if done quickly, and successfully, with an orca, can take nearly half an hour. it'll require the covops to sit on the other side to scan for ships during that time, and leaves the orca wide open to attack in our system. but again, let's pretend luck is on our side, and we do this successfully. everyone is home safely, and the hole no longer exists. now we have to worry that whoever scanned in probably mapped our system and warped to both statics. so we have 2 more ""holes to plug"". both guys get into covops, and each goes to one of the static holes to run intel checks. we see our static hisec takes us to within 5 jumps of a major trade hub, and there are 44 people in local, no probes on scan at this time. the c4 is occupied by something nasty (say a corp with 3-4 pos's, tonnes of ships out, etc.) the corpy in there has to visit and confirm that all ships are accounted for in pos shields, empty (since we can't reasonably jump an orca into it without knowing this). now we have to decide, based on intel, which hole to crush first. let's say we pick the hisec, since the orca will be safe on the hisec side, at least. the guy in the c4 has to stay there, near the hole to our system, to prevent the orca from being bushwhacked from there. the orca is on its own to crush the hisec static. one more time, let's assume we get lucky, and this goes without a hitch. 1/2 an hour later, the hole is crushed. the orca driver swaps to a covops, and scans down the new hisec static, but does not warp to the sig, sealing it off.now we have to deal with the c4 static. even if we are extremely lucky (and at this point, we should be buying lotto tickets, amirite?), crushing that will (again) take another half an hour. the first corpy in covops scans out the new c4 static and ""seals"", updates the pos can, and we finally feel safe enough to think about mining our o-so-precious belt. (continued)"
7/17/2011,"(continued) we go to it first in a drake to wait for the sleeper spawn, pop them, and loot/salvage the wrecks (waste not, want not). of course, we had to wait 10-15 minutes for them to spawn, 5 to kill, 5-10 to loot/salvage. but we're feeling lucky, becuse 2.5 hours after the first guy logged in, we can actually get ready to mine............with 2 players. ok, let's get lucky again, and 2 more log in, in the nick of time. gotta give them a few minutes to update their bookmarks, and give them the scoop on what's been done. one driver in the orca, 2 in hulks, and our first guy in a hauler. let's mine!we get to the belt, to find its an ""average deposit"", our most common. here's what it looks like:"
7/17/2011,i think the real point is nullsec residents just feel dirty using ore they know hasnt been botted... must be some kind of itis they get out there....remove local and see how much ore gets mined in null....also id like to see the prices on your precious needed t3s once you *$(% your suppliers.
7/17/2011,"just a quick little something i forgot to add in my last wall of text. ever consider what we'll do, if these changes get pushed through? i'll tell you. we'll just stop mining, and go farm our c4 for tags and salvage. that's right! we'll go next door, and pull isk out of nowhere, so we can help add to the inflationary pressure in new eden. you take out a player driven thing, and you replace it with a faucet. just watch it happen. all, so a few prima donnas and their bots (myriad), can force hisec players to pay more for everything. it won't affect us monetarily, we'll make billions more than we are now. if only we were in it for the money..........right?"
7/17/2011,"as elaine solarheart stated, if you don't want to get ganked, or fail repeatedly, you need to be uber-cautious about all the sigs and you need to take the time to find/scout them and reliably know their status. anyone can mine or rat without doing this, and occasionally get a way just fine, but the squad of t3's in the wh you failed to scan down is just waiting for you to go to the next anom, because they're waiting for the hictor pilot or their cov-ops scout to re-ship, not having situational awareness leads to losses. back to topic, the majority of wh will not be adversely affected if abc ores are removed, but it will raise the inconvenience level and as stated above expect t3 prices to rise since we would need to import more ore/parts/ships when we could have just mined locally and built locally. on that note... i would suggest an interesting trade... the 1st wh only pos mod (otherwise it'll end up all over null) a structure that compresses ore like a rorq, and does nothing else... for that mod i would actually get back to mining more since the compression takes the pain out of the logistics... i think losing abc ores would be worth that. carebears=hs mission runnersnull rabbits=0.0 botsyarr=ls ghetto dwellerscave dwellers=wh addicts"
7/17/2011,"mp3 of csm fireside chat2nd one, 22 minutes in for what the csm had to say about this issue."
7/17/2011,so true.
7/17/2011,"wow, and i will quote (who i think is mittani).complete ignorance and the only arguement he throws is low risk. and whats more low risk than mining in null-sec?"
7/17/2011,"how is mining in a foreign, ever-changing system with no local any less risky than mining from the heart of a big blue blob of happy nap space in nullsec? if anything, class 1/2 are more risky since they're all connected with highsec and are frequently roamed, while 5/6 are deeper and you'll have less gankers going in there for easy kills. learn 2 wormholes. hulks can't fit into a c1 unless you build them. and again, how is a big blue happy nap blob ""extremely dangerous space?""why are you blaming wormholes for the collapse of mineral prices when every miner can be blamed for that? especially when a whopping 2.45% of eve's population actually lives in whs? maybe if nullbears stopped naping everything that moved it would be a riskier environment for miners, resulting in mining being more lucrative. that's not to mention all the other ways that minerals are injected into the economy. (i'm looking at you, drone regions.)"
7/17/2011,"my god, his ignorance is amazing. how can you be a csm and on top of that then advocate for something you have no f-ing clue about!?guess what? that hulk ""daytripping"" in a system two jumps from jita just got ganked because of being two jumps from jita!! and how did this hulk get his ore out? you cannot take a whole grav site worth of ore out through c1-3 exits, so how much money is this guy getting? like maybe 20 mil. only ignorant people mine in wormholes they don't live in. the logistics are terrible, and the risk is not cost effective.this continues to amaze me.edit:i didn't even see this one.quote:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i think its dumb that you can have some guy in a hulk from jita pop in with relatively low risk into a c1 whatever and get abc, when abc is typically something, uh, reserved for extremely dangerous space far from empire.so this csm doesn't know about mass limits at all. you can't even get a covetor into a c1 without building it in there. that's what i like to call wormfail."
7/17/2011,"ah, but you should know by now that the only ""real"" players in eve are in nullsec. now that the likes of goonswarm have decided to take the csm seriously you should not be surprised that csm are trying to enhance the benefits of operating out of 0.0. it's what all power blocks do, they try to get the best deal for their special interests. the solution is to put up some credible candidates from whs, hisec etc. to try and achieve a balance because if we don't then the only game worth playing will be from 0.0, and that is not somewhere i want to go. i'm not presumptous enough to think that i would be a candidate at any time, this nda business is enough to put me off but i would be willing to help out and try to counter the block votes of the 0.0 alliances, who will, of course, only be voting for their own candidates and in their own interests."
7/17/2011,if you read the may minutes and
7/17/2011,fact is that high sec players aren't as vocal as null sec players.whereas the null sec residents vote in large chunks the residents of high sec only dribble in here and there and are too spread out to have a real candidate to be pushed forward.if high sec wants a better representation they have to look for a few credible candidates first and then vote en masse on them.but since a lot of high sec people don't bother to vote they resort to complaining.
7/17/2011,i'd also like to hear if the csm has any ideas on improving hisec gameplay. i believe this forum is the official means for comminicating with the csm. if the csm views hisec as boring or repetitive then what are their thoughts on how hisec gameplay can be improved?
7/17/2011,"well if we had their full apis we could get them and their alts and just go assasinate them. you know, form another mob and track them down instead of statues. sounds like a cool activity actually."
7/17/2011,"yep, i reckon clavian voi has hit the nail on the head. at the moment all we have to look forward to is the aggrandisement of the csm delegates spiced with a little self serving for the 0.0 inhabitants.bah! as to the op, i surely do admire you patience waiting for the minutes of the may meeting."
7/17/2011,"why do people like me play eve when we have things that we are not happy about? simple, i've invested over five years playing eve and when people have a stake in anything then i think thay have a right to be critical when things appear to be changing in ways that adversely affect the game. just because you love someone or something does not make you blind to faults. eve is not what it was when i started playing, some things are better i.e. pi, invention rather than the lottery. others are not, lag, general performance and at the moment cq."
7/18/2011,"i saw that and ccp wants mt period, when players in a majority said no to mt it didn't matter ccp wanted to put them in and they did."
7/18/2011,"who the hell vote for this failures anyway,csm is god damn joke."
7/18/2011,"no one gives one **** about your opinion. so u read up on worm holes yet, so you dont look like a total idiot next time u talk about them?"
7/18/2011,"predictable... i raise a concern about your behavior as so-called lead of the csm, and you lash out like a child. skip any further political office... not for you i am afraid. especially since you consider your constituents only those people belonging to the 'mittens club'. the obvious 0.0 slant of the last two (and only) fireside chats make that obvious despite what other csm members have tried to say. your legacy i am afraid is ruining any progress the csm has made over many years in legitimizing itself."
7/18/2011,"your only now realizing his agenda?ever since csm 5 went for the jump bridge nerf, the mittani has been hell bent to dismantle any credibility the csm has with the public. any possible idea or change that would hurt his goonies and how they operate he is against even if it's what is best for the game as a whole.he runs around telling people to commited suicide and die in real life. do you honestly think he gives a **** about eve, much less the csm?"
7/18/2011,"really? typical politician...greasing the hands that feed. i understood that the csm's job was to represent the entire player base to ccp? hmmm...let me see...i found this in the evelopedia:the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp. this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base. the scope of issues is restricted only to eve, its ongoing development, and limited meta (out-of-game) issues which have direct relevance to the eve universe. it is important to keep in mind that the csm will not have formal powers within ccp, they will have a voice inside ccp.notice that it doesn't say ""greatest good for the chairman's constituency""."
7/18/2011,then you are in the wrong place mate.
7/18/2011,"that's rich, coming from you."
7/18/2011,"this pretty much sums up why most players can't be arsed to care about the csm, and why many hope the csm loose what little power they have. in the end it would be better if the devs and designers made the decisions, and not a group of players who are willing break the parts of the game they don't play to improve on the parts they do play.even with the recent bad decisions made by ccp, i feel they are doing a better job, then the csm, trying to improve the game for all players."
7/18/2011,"i'd say that his sentiment is what will fuel such feelings for csm6 and beyond, the work done by csm5 tossed aside in part due to his antics and the csm as a whole 'going' along with the join statement bs.also you are aware that the csm doesn't make the decisions they have a voice that ccp will listen to but ultimately the decisions are ccp's not the csm's. the csm will try to push the issues they unite behind and that is it ccp listens and ignores them or puts some effort into working on their ideas in whatever capacity they feel is correct. i disagree they are doing a good job in this instance both ccp and csm are failing hard, ccp's just been doing it much longer cause csm gets recycled every term and this one is pretty much a load with few less than stellar exceptions."
7/18/2011,"yes, even if it wasn't what i said, i meant the decision making process. anyways if they csm had zero influence on the direction ccp is developing eve, it would be pointless to have the csm."
7/18/2011,"i have this question lingering around for quite sometime and this seems to be the right place to ask it given the context.from eve wikipedia the scope of the csm:""the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp. this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base. the scope of issues is restricted only to eve, its ongoing development, and limited meta (out-of-game) issues which have direct relevance to the eve universe. it is important to keep in mind that the csm will not have formal powers within ccp, they will have a voice inside ccp.""now, from what i understand in this statement, the csm is a group of people which express the player base interests to ccp, elaborating a little bit more on the perception i get, the csm in a very frontal and crude form, are the link between ccp and the player base interesets in order to achieve a common ground of agreement, but unfortunately, what i've been reading through all this forum/tweets/mumble recording, is nothing more than a group of people with their own personal interests (csm) mostly disregarding the player base interests (or the majority of them, since i see very little feedback request from the general player base in order to understand the player base opinions/interests) and imposing their personal views/interests and/or agenda.now i don't have any issues with voting people for their interests and opinions, as long as it is stated and explicity declared like a real political party with an agenda very well defined on prior to voting for the player base to choose what 'agenda' or 'game political side' they're voting for, but i was sold (or have been) that the csm is the player base spokesman, and not a party with it's own political agenda.i have no issue whatsoever with the csm having their own interests and views of the game, i do have issues though if they are our interests 'spokesman' and they impose their own interests disregarding the player base, i'm also fully aware that there will always be people against something, granted, but i haven't seen many statements from the csm with the tone of 'i might not agree with it, but the majority of the player base whishes this that i have to express this as the player base interest' instead, only the 'i don't care about this so ccp can decide whatever' or the imposition of csm interests on to ccp with little or very limited player base reasearch about the issue.anyway, the real question is, what is csm supposed to be after all ?best regards,"
7/18/2011,"listened to the fireside chat recording and enjoyed it. it was nice to hear a variety of voices from the csm this time, rather than just the one pretentious douchebag hogging the stage. i was at first content with our new csm chairman, but more and more i just cringe at the fact that he's the public face of this important group. sir, i pray that you find yourself with a hellish job that requires you to work 80 hours a week and leaves no time for eve, forcing you to resign and hand the reigns over to trebor, who is far better suited for the role. i must say though, mittens has improved considerably from the last fireside chat...he mostly dropped the insulting and childish word r-tarded from his vocabulary for this call. kudos."
7/18/2011,what is quite funny if someone in a real political movement made a stupid comment like this his resignation would be expected. it seems to me that your ego has far far exceeded your actual position.
7/18/2011,so are you saying that you don't represent yourself then? ... lol
7/18/2011,darius iii the fair for csm
7/18/2011,and 70% of eve players support reducing refine rates by 10%.
7/18/2011,"there is no limit to the mittani's ego. that's just how he is. he really thinks quite highly of himself. sadly, that makes for a very poor representative.all that aside, i would think this is the last csm. there is no credibility left. without that there's no sense of representation and any work performed is seen as just an extension of ccp. even though the csm may have the best intentions they are constantly undermined by ccp so they really arent doing anything other than pr stunts. too bad because it was yet another great idea sunk by ccps mismanagement. of course, the csm at some point may want to stop playing along. it may be a bit too late for them though. a lot of damage has been done."
7/18/2011,"hey vile rat,in regards to ship ballances (specifically capitals), i believe there is a very large gap that can be filled, from carriers and dreads to scs and titans.personally, i am of the opinion that scs are fine as they are. people have invested alot of time and money into chars that can sit in these things, as well as the actual construction of them is a very big undertaking. they are also prime offensive weapons, very versatile.anyway, to my point. i believe combat capitals should be looked at in terms of a scale of 1-10 in terms of isk spent and a combination of dps/ehp.to that ends, in my mind i have the following:10) titans9)8) scs7)6)5)4)3) dreads2)1) carrierscarriers make great auxiluries (sp) to cap fleets and are pretty damn useful in terms of docking ability, corp hangar etc.dreads also have their use, as limited as it may be these days. lots of dps, little ehp. they are essentially a glass cannon.there is a huge gap between dreads and scs. scs cost upwards of 10 times the price/effort. they have about 1/20 the ehp, yet require very similar skill training time.i believe the big gap between these can be filled, by not reducing the ability/stats of the scs. in some ways i think capitals should be a slight mirror of sub caps: frigs, destroyers, cruisers, bcs, bss.i think a tier 2 dread has a very good opportunity to appear. a type of ship that has less ehp than a sc and alot less versatility. no siege module, but a straight weapon damage bonus. similar dps as a sieged dread, something to make a sc fc think twice about.in similar gameplay with subcaps, it would be bad to send a scythe into battle vs a tempest. get a bc instead to make things interesting. the same premice should be for scs as well.a new hull, 5-6 turrets, 100% odd bonus damage multiplyer, decent drone bay, x% bonus to shield/armour rep amount per level. keep tracking very low so sub caps can fight them efficiently. essentially, giving a dread alot more ehp, and without a siege module but with all the benifits/drawbacks that go with it (minus the speed decrease).i think that would be a good re-balance of scs."
7/18/2011,"not sure if this is the place butright now freighters are huge and there is no mid sized option other than the orca(different skill path)players do not always need to carry the huge amounts freighters carry, but we do not also want a new ship to take away from the freighter.so why of all the ships are there no fittings on these ships? add 3 rig slots. reduce the amount they haul so if cargo rigged they are equivalent to current freighters.this would let people set up there freighters how they like. more tank, more speed, more agility or more cargo. rigs rather than modules because these ships are huge and not easily reconfigured like military vessels. may also promote people having more than one to use when they need a particular load hauled.also helps use up more rigs and introduces a sink when the rigs are destroyed or changed.will also make freighters more appealing.thanks for reading."
7/18/2011,"nice blog, definitely worth the read. fixed the link so it works. to few bother to cut and paste links, especially when you can insert it as a proper link."
7/18/2011,"dreads definitely need some love'n.they used to be the end all for pos warfare and still hold there own in cap fleets. but as many have said sc's can out perform them in every way.i would like to see the seige mode buffed so they are almost immune to subcap attacks while in seige, but at the same time should get a tracking penalty in siege mode to the point where they can not hit even a bs unless it is not moving. they should be able to hold there own against a small bs gang (4-5 bses) in non sieged mode,at best a 50/50 survival chance, but be near impossible for that same bs gange to kill while seiged. to balance this make there tracking while in sieged mode so bad a bs can easily avoid 90% of the damage if they keep moving. basically causing a stalemate until one side or the other gets some reinforcements.i would say keep the buffer where it is or even lower it a bit, but give a big increase to passive recharge. this will keep them very vulnerable to super caps as the high dps of subcaps with burn though the buffer faster than it can be repaired, yet the repair/regen will be enough to make it hard to kill them with subcaps. think heavy armor. in wwii the german panther tank was heavy and slow but the american sheman could not take them toe to toe. the armor on the panther was so thick the shells from the smaller guns on the american tanks mostly just bounced off. while the huge guns on the panther could take out a sherman with one shot. the panthers weakness was that the huge gun had trouble hitting smaller faster targets. it was almost immune to most attacks but could only effectively kill larger slow moving targets. along with a nerf to tracking while in sieged mode the damage boost should be much larger. dreads should be the best choice for pos bashing. shooting at a stationary object nothing but a titan should out dps a sieged dread. a significant dps boost would not make them overpowered if they could not hit a subcap ship while sieged. but they should be much harder for those subcap fleets to kill. this would restore them to the role they were meant to fill. at the same time give them enough dps to be worth having in a combat cap fleet. with a couple carriers supporting it with rr to keep it alive the dread could deal massive damage to apposing fleets capitals. i believe this is the role it was meant to have. however the super carriers can far out dps a dread, making it pointless to have a dread over a carrier in fleet. a good boost to the passive tanking by either increased armor resists or shield regen or both while in sieged mode combined with a reduction in effectiveness against sub caps, and a huge dps boost should put them right back to where they should be. at least in my mind."
7/18/2011,"speaking from what i have seen in eve, i put forward the following:each region (or ""group"" of regions has its own plusses and minuses. drone lands has alot of mins, but no conquerable npc station to be seen anywhere.gurrista/sansha/angel/serpentis/blood space all drop nice modules and bouinties, but not alot of minerals.high sec produces alot of the requirements for t2 construction.forexample, in drone lands, you can build a super cap and equip it with t1 or t2 rigs and t1 modules. in serpentis space you can raise the liquid isk to buy such a ship and have the modules on hand to put on it. check jita out for t2 modules.one way i can see that type of ballance being overcome is to have each constellation in every region have different types of rats. otherwise, one region alliance is going to be dependant on the other regions produce."
7/18/2011,"add destructible mining stations, which can mine unattended.add destructible research stations, which will take research away from the pos.be able to add missile and turret batteries to these stations to defend them somewhat.all these structures are separate and independent from a pos and have to placed somewhere else in system."
7/18/2011,"i really liked the eve books (empyrean age especially).i would pay money for a plkex or two to see that side of eve fleshed out more, or even made into a tv series.also, i would be happy to buy a tornado ship from the nex"

7/18/2011,they should be special items for christmas only but idiots ruined that.ccp have already removed them because they were getting too many complaints from clueless carebears who didn't understand aggression mechanics and got themselves concordokken for firing back at people shooting them.not supported.not going to happen.
7/18/2011,"hi, henry's alt here (henry is in suspense/limbo at the moment).carebears are complaining to ccp anyways when people gank them in highsec when they mine or mission. also, why are you against my proposal (just curious) if you sounded like you are against the carebears who were too dumb to learn the mechanics?"
7/18/2011,"if they reintroduce them it should be for christmas only, as i stated, therefore not supported.carebears whining about them got them removed in the first place so it's unlikely that ccp will reintroduce them only to end up with more inane petitions.in short, they were originally a bit of fun for christmas that ended up being more trouble than it was worth.despite what you may think, i am not automatically supportive of things used to 'grief', trick or whatever you want to call it. ccp have indeed made this a game for babies and nerf all kinds of mechanics that should remain. market scamming is practically impossible now, remote rep agression, the lofty scam (despite a warning given on joining gangs etc). this is a bad trend and closes the sandbox but regardless, this is a waste of time for ccp when they have far more important things to fix."
7/18/2011,"one feature i think would be great would be more introduction movies. you have the racial videos when selecting a char, then you make your char, and then you just get on with it strait away. could there be another intro movie played after creating your char? for example leaving a space port on a planet, blasting into the sky, into outer space then zooming to the station, along the way you get introduced to 'rats', what damage they do, different sizes, swing by a stargate and overlay the network of gates/systems, pass my planets and show pi, zoom through a fleet battle dodging fire from both sides before entering the station, parking your ship, disengaging the capsule, watching it fly to the cq, then see yourself get out, climb up th stairs and then have the camera zoom into your head, and away you go.another idea may be a readily available list of 'gold star' quality pc corps in the local area you could join, each of these corps can be monitored by ccp and ensured they are genuinely helpful. a condition of entry into these 'gold corps' could be that once you get to a certain sp level, you have to leave them.just some ideas."
7/18/2011,should post this over in the new player q&a forum.personally waiting until avatars can interacts with each other before introducing eve to to many people.
7/18/2011,"my thoughts so far.1. ui overhaul2. finished career agents. what now? (maybe an expand for specific careers. eventually triggered by skill-lvl?)3. explanation of some basics like standings, kill rights and more.4. less ""need"" for external information and tools."
7/18/2011,"the npe needs more information on player-player interaction. things like aggro counters, gcc, yellow boxing, red boxing. some basic bits of information the noobs will almost instantly encounter (check the undock point in noob stations for all the players trying to bait them). if these things would be covered before players undock for the first time, there would probably be better retention. people should be able to bait other players, but noobs should be given a chance to know what is going on before it is too late."
7/18/2011,bump
7/18/2011,"you can currently get a new name by biomassing, using a different slot on your account or opening a new account. circumventing these mechanics gives you a clear in game advantage and will never be allowed.suggesting an alias list makes this acceptable is ludicrous. standings flags for people in local was introduced because it was a default behaviour to show info on every new person that entered your system; this would just force more show info activations. furthermore known fc's, falcon alts etc could use the mechanic to appear less threatening in local or in fleet.there are consequences to your actions and reputation is a highly valuable resource to be used or abused. circumventing this without starting from scratch will not be allowed.not supported.never going to happen."
7/18/2011,"while there would need to be restrictions on it, having a deep space outpost would be a great idea. it would remove the need for so many safe spots and create the safe haven/home for more corps to move into lowsec. it would of course still be able to anchor around a moon, perhaps giving it more cpu and powergrid to work with, being in a locked orbit or some such. while in deep space it will need to sacrifice a portion of cpu and powergrid to monitor and defend against cosmic rays or micro meteors.i support this idea."
7/18/2011,i see nothing wrong with this idea.+1
7/18/2011,there is a deep space pos already: its called an orca with a cloak.
7/18/2011,good luck doing bpo research in an orca.
7/18/2011,"you really want a lab you can anchor off of a celestial, cloaked or nearly impossible to probe down (aka unscannable t3's what just got nerfed yay), which is as tough as a pos, defendable, blah blah blah? what's the point, it will take someone all of 10 minutes, at worst, to find your cloaky deep space carebear creche and ruin it. in which case, here's an idea: form a corp with your research alt, pay someone to be a faction fluffer, get faction standings to +8 for your corp, anchor pos in hisec. bingo! you're just like everyone else!"
7/18/2011,"the reason i suggested the limit of being anchored at least 1 au from any cosmic signature was so that it could not be anchored in an asteroid belt, or inside a plex,effectively keeping it from despawning. that can not be allowed. i know scanning down a pos in deep space is not a hard thing to do. but it would provide a little more security from hostiles just passing through. and if someone does stop to scan the system there probes will show up on directional scan and the defending force can possibly scan them down and kill them before they find the pos. with additional stats slightly better than the faction towers only a reduction in cpu/power grid as a sacrifice for the ability to anchor in deep space. it would give an option to have a more secure pos but would support less modules for that extra security to maintain a balance. whether or not these could be anchored in high sec is another issue. trying to find an available moon in a decent high sec system is no easy task. but allowing these to be anchored in high sec could result in far to many poses in a system. perhaps just adding a restriction to the number of poses per 10 au system width. then systems 100 au wide could have far more than systems only 20 au wide, but there would still be a maximum number. t2 poses would also be much more expensive creating a good isk sink for larger alliances with far to much extra resources."
7/18/2011,"if orca's had enough cargo space to hold a full freighter load, 25+ million ehp for protection, and could protect the freighter within its shields while loading an orca would work well. but an orca provides none of the defensive benefits a pos does."
7/18/2011,"that would work, just code it so if anchored in deep space it has cpu/power grid penalty to maintain the anchoring. and if anchored at a moon there would be no penalty. in keeping with t2 stuff being generally better than faction t1, give the pos even more cpu/power grid than faction towers, but make the deep space penalty high enough that you have less cpu/power grid that a normal t1 pos if anchored in deep space."
7/18/2011,eve has q&a??
7/18/2011,"i approve of physics which properly simulate booby movement. while we're at it, put gannets and skuas on the list."
7/18/2011,"you guys are disgusting. let's not turn eve into a tomb raider franchise. i think the folks complaining are just those men who made a women toon with maxxed sized inhuman breasts (the kind that are made of silicon), so it looks weird when they don't move."
7/18/2011,even small boobs move. but really this is a bit silly to worry about given how many more pressing issues are in eve.
7/18/2011,"this is already in game. however the structure of braziers in eve is far more advanced than we have on earth, giving far more support and keeping the girls in place. that is why they do not move. any woman with average or larger size breasts that participates in active sports or runs/jogs on a regular basis knows the value of having really good support. most athletes do not giggle much due to the firm support of a good sports bra. if they changed the game so you could actually walk around topless, like in age of conan, then i could see a need for life like breast movement. but in eve this is a fail idea."
7/18/2011,"aye, support me... err... supported."

7/18/2011,"thanks for the bump, i needed a good laugh and your proposal delivers."
7/18/2011,you know this almost made it to the second page then you had to go and post. can you imagine how much effort all the other forum watchers had to put in to not post and bump this? you should be ashamed for bumping this - i only post because it's already at the top...and naturally was waiting for someone else to bump this!please leave this thread alone so one more thread with actual content can make it to the front page./thread
7/18/2011,"no risk?www.suddenbuggery.com/killboard/and others like narwhals, ccres, lost, etc etc.as for the farm the hell out of abc, i doubt its really as bad as you nullturds make out. 10k abc is 160km3; you refine in-hole you lose 25%. you export, it takes 8 round trips in a meta-4 industrial through hostile 0.0 space at risk of bombs, hictors, sniper hacs, mwd-bumping t3's knocking you off the hole, etc etc etc. which takes almost as much time as mining the damn stuff....as for mining the stuff, well, you have to sit there mashing d-scan like a rat on methadone or you get probed out and podded, whereas in nullsec you immediately see your enemy enter system and hit warp to pos and you go cower in your fairy bubbles like schoolgirls until your 50 man blob comes and chases the bad dramiel away.yeah, wormhole miners are creaming it.oh, and here's an idea, dumbfirkin: hows about you lern2probe and find those wormholes which spawn into nullsec? you, too, can be farming of the sites."
7/18/2011,bump.can we get a csm response on this idea?
7/18/2011,"gentlepods,in a few days i will begin another round of prioritization crowdsourcing. in preparation for that, i would appreciate your help in getting the list of items as accurate as possible.i have done a pass of csm's list of in-process items, and migrated completed and denied items as appropriate. i have also moved some items that ccp has sent back to csm for review to a new ""to-be-reviewed"" category in the wiki. i intend to prioritize both the in-process and to-be-reviewed items.i particularly need help verifying that all the items listed in these categories are correctly categorized. no doubt there are a few that have actually been implemented in some form by ccp, and i'd like to move them off the list.i have put up a skeleton page listing all the items on the wiki.based on feedback from the last prioritization, this time around i intend to let people vote both for and against items, and i'll generate results in multiple ways, so we'll be able to see the most loved, most hated, and most divisive items.you should expect formal crowdsourcing to begin towards the end of the week or early next week."
7/18/2011,"sweet, enjoy doing these and seeing the results.i do not see some items and am not sure how the list was populated.prioritizing the art departments work would also fall under this would it not. so raising the desire to se engine trailes and new effects should eb there should it not. as well as the addition of corp logo's to ships via the csm minutes(even thugh the csm said it was low priority)"
7/18/2011,couldn't see my proposal listed on the 'skeleton page' to bring back the old/previous sound effects for the strip miners and mining drones. i have read numerous people asking for this to be done.
7/18/2011,"ccp, you want to sell 'convenience'? then allow me to buy premium research lab time; like available slots, x0.56 multipliers, etc.i'd *certainly* pay aurum for that!"
7/18/2011,"no way,that gives you an advantage with real money in the game."
7/18/2011,"does it? i'm just purchasing a commodity, like available research slots and time. mind you, this is no more giving me an 'advantage' than buying pos time somewhere -- the only difference being that i can do it directly via the nex store (which is where ccp's 'convenience' part comes in).and think about it, why shouldn't npc stations rent out research slots, for immediately availability, to folks willing to pay extra for it? the fact that they don't is actually what's strange. it's like selling server bandwidth: if you pay more, you get more. makes perfect sense to me.also, please don't get hung up on the word 'aurum,' as it would likely just be plexes converted to aurum anyway."
7/18/2011,because your proposal gives an in game advantage for aurum.if you wan't private research slots there is nothing stopping you from putting up a pos somewhere.
7/18/2011,"i don't see how. if i form a 1-man corp, people will just dec me and fly in as many battleships as it takes to destroy my pos in highsec. and in low/null sec i probably wouldn't even get the chance to put one up."
7/18/2011,"yes, making a corp does indeed open you up to war decs... but that's the price you pay for gaining all the extra benefits of making/being in a player corp.here's my advice;- keep your head low; don't smack, aggravate, or gain the attention of the locals. attention is bad.- set yourself up in a place where there is little traffic. or more. make a judgement call on where you feel you'll draw the least amount of attention to yourself.- make friends, preferably ones with ""teeth"" (even more preferable, ones that are ""local""). if you get decced, have your friends dec the aggressor- make deals. can be done with friends (preferable) or mercs... just offer up your ""services"" if they defend you (ex. cheaper bpcs, cheaper ships, cheaper ammo, etc.)- always put in the maximum amount of strontium you can into your pos. this will give you time to formulate a proper response.but i digress...not supporting this. it's a blatant example of people paying rl money for an in-game advantage."
7/18/2011,"its an m.m.o. not single player. but srsly - you can setup a pos in low with 2 man corp - been there, done that. just make sure that:1. its rarely used system2. its within one jf jump from hi, or more preferably its connected directly to hi. 3. moon have no worthy moon goo4. full stront bay5. get some friends, srsly, ill say it again its an mmo"
7/18/2011,in to advertise my alliance. why pay aur when you could pay good old isk?
7/18/2011,another good reason not to support your proposal. entrepreneurship such as this fine corporations.
7/18/2011,"in missions, if any npc is warp scrambling, it's almost always a frigate. there's only one case i can think of where a mission cruiser warp scrambles, and that mission has a total of six ships to fight. so, i generally eliminate the frigates first, and then deal with everything else. i haven't lost a missionrunning ship to npcs, yet.that said, i don't see the harm in this, so, supported."
7/18/2011,"you having to buy a new ship incentivizes the whole economy and your personal interest < health of the economy, so no."
7/18/2011,when ever i am being warp scrambled or webbed there is a little icon on the overview beside the ship doing it. just pop those ships first and you are free to warp out.
7/18/2011,"i reported it in a bugreport and it was classified as bug by bughuntersteam. its only logical if you first get warnings in missions about scramblers, trust in them and then suddenly without warning before accepting the mssion there is sctually a ship with warp scrambler."
7/18/2011,"your comment would be great, had it been sarcastic. so, i'm confused as to why you support this proposal."
7/18/2011,it would end these threads!there is nothing you can do to change the common perception that t2 bpos are unfair. when people find out that a privileged few have something they cannot they have some anger and frustration. eliminating t2 bpos will make thousands of players who are less unhappy.
7/18/2011,"i'm not even into industry myself, but it's the idea of it. it's like p2w items -- except you didn't have to pay for it with aurum, but ccp just gave them to you. it's just weird; such items simply shouldn't exist in game.and to those who claim there's not much difference in profit to be had between t1 and t2 bpo's, a t2 hulk bpo currently goes for ca. 60-100 bil. i guess it costs that much because it's not much better than just inventing a hulk with regular t1 bpo's, right? /sarcasm. i'm often amazed how people can say these things with a straight face."
7/18/2011,signed.
7/18/2011,"i am always for removing anything that is a static isk printing machine. currently those are t2 bpos and bottleneck moon goo.on a side note; you do realize that there is a mailing list that all t2 bpo owners are a part of right? any time a thread appears with the idea of removing them from the game or reducing their efficiency in making isk, they spam it hard core. telling everyone to derail the thread as fast as possible with their army of alts.you have been warned..."
7/18/2011,"but if you remove all t2 bpo's from the game then how will you make new ones with t1 bpo's, and it will make the isk you pay for t2 ships and equipment go up. but yeah who needs that stuff stupid me. you are so right op down with any way for us to have items easy to make so we can get them easily."
7/18/2011,"dude... you'd invent t2 bpc's. :) you know, like every other non-privileged industrialist does."
7/18/2011,"you are seriously overestimating the profits involved.only a handful of bpos are in the hands of the original ""winners"" and the exorbitant costs involved with buying what is essentially convenience takes years to get back (unless it is sold again) .. and that is before market fluctuations take their toll.with a modest payment upfront you can start inventing and make more isk than any bpo holder. all it takes is a bit of business savvy.if you want to rage then find an actual problem, like moon-goo which is 100% the rich-mans isk printing press (supers needed to acquire/hold) and a pre-requisite for bpo and invention both.the only area where the bpos are skewing the markets are for the resource intensive items (ships), but for all their epeen enhancing properties they are but a small part of the overall picture.ps: sounds like you tried your hand at invention, chose an ego-booster item like a hac only to find it is impossible without taking a loss. now who is the lazy one .. you didn't even bother reading up on it."
7/18/2011,"so petty, these ad hominems. and, alas, so common for threads like this. still, penalty for personal foul.oh, and do try and read a few of the replies a bit before you post, would ya? since i already said i'm not an industrialist; and have no intention of becoming one. it's apparently very difficult for people to understand that one can advocate balance without actually having a vested interest in the matter."
7/18/2011,"so not only do you speak on a subject you have zero knowledge of but you do so without having any intention of ever acquiring said knowledge .. you should be taken seriously why exactly? not having a vested interest is one thing but being ignorant of the subject matter is something else entirely .. read up on it, loads of material available. the ignore feature on the new forums will do wonders for my calm .. can't wait."
7/18/2011,"again with the sad stream of personal attacks. would it kill you to, i dunno, stick an actual argument in there somewhere? you know, just for good measure?n.b. oh, and i don't fly supercaps either; nor do i intend to become a supercap pilot. and yet i still want supercaps nerfed; weird, eh?"
7/18/2011,it takes your about 6-8 years (depending on bpo) to earn enough isk to pay off the purchase.isk printing machines indeed.
7/18/2011,this is a blatant lie!
7/18/2011,wanting to do away with things you know nothing about.
7/18/2011,this should have been done ages ago when t20 was giving out prints for his buddies
7/18/2011,"this is something that has happened to 2 of my toons in 4 different corporations already since i came back a couple of days ago. people will war dec highsec mining lowbie corporations hoping to either get isk or get some easy kills. there should be some kind of change to the war dec system. here is what i propose:1. make it so that in order for combat to occur both sides have to declare.2. double the amount it costs to declare.3. both sides pay above amount, half the isk goes in to a fund with the winner getting that isk.4. you win by causing the other side to surrender or after 1 week have less loses then the other side.please this is a serious discussion, treat it as such. if you are a forum troll please find a different thread to troll. however if you have something that you feel should be added or changed please reply."
7/18/2011,you will find all these things and more in hko
7/18/2011,maybe you should find another game

7/18/2011,no u!
7/18/2011,this topic has literally been beaten to death. please read those threads to find out what you've missed instead of making new ones.
7/18/2011,not using that word it isn't.
7/18/2011,"this game is a pvp mmo. non-consensual combat is not only to be expected, it is more common. this doesn't make griefers any less lame, but it's true.i've realized that eve war is not war in any sense of the word. griefers win if they derive pleasure in your misery; that's really it. it's not war in an economic or political sense at all."
7/18/2011,to the top
7/18/2011,"no! i am a lower skillpoint character and i am saying %^$# %^ no! this is the worst idea that anyone could ever come up with. i think the only thing that would even be acceptabl to give newer players/characters a skill boost would be to give them a boost to skillpoint learning that goes away as they get more skill points. such as for the first 1 million skillpoints they get double gains, for each subsequent million they lose 20% after 5 million they go to normal. actual numbers could changed to be more acceptable, also other actions could be used to trigger the end of this bonus such as certain skill book injects (with the effect added to the description anyone with these skillbooks would be allowed to have the bonus as long as they do not train any points into the skill), also entering lowsec space could cancel this effect as well.***edit*** also if you want to buy skill points buy lots of plex and by a flippen character, that can do what you want to do or stfu.***edit***"
7/18/2011,"christ, is this still dragging on??look, i sympathise with noobs joining eve only to find out they're not immediately able to handle lowsec, 0.0, or wh space (which i'll just call 'lower sec' from now on). but how is that any different from any other mmo? i can't do max level raids in eq or wow with a new toon, either.yes, i understand it's possible for characters in those other mmos to get to max level much faster (not that eve has a max level as such). but then they just transition from level progression to gear progression, as if it's any different...).however - getting back on track - perhaps instead of complaining that they can't join their established mates in lower sec space, eve noobs ought to take advantage of the multitude of other corps that will happily take on new players willing to learn with a good attitude. as well as the many soloable activities for off peak hours.i'm also aware of many large corps and alliances that have noob friendly activities or sister corps in highsec. maybe if you want a rl friend to stick at eve, you should take a week away from your high level lower sec activities, and spend it with them in highsec, teaching and helping them along. or even get your corp organised to provide a highsec venture to get noobs interested and ready for your 0.0 activities.there are also programs run by established corps that teach players of any level how to pvp, function in a fleet, etc. not to mention eve uni which is free and excellent.so in summary - once again i say if you've a problem with eve's slow skill point progression, perhaps the issue you're having is one of your own making, given how much fun and company there is out there for the new player with the right attitude. breaking eve for the rest of us just because you don't like it is not a reasonable position. i'm really sorry, but it is not. or if your friend is the kind of player who can't ever wait for anything, then eve is really the wrong game for him, no matter the effort you expend trying to help them.now since i've asked you to be proactive, it's only fair i do the same. thus if you have any questions about how an eve newbie can have fun, feel free to ask. or make a new thread - i guarantee you you'll get plenty of help. probably a lot more if in a new thread, actually. threads like this make most of us shudder and move on (me - i have no life so i respond now and again to them ;-) )."
7/18/2011,good idea.
7/18/2011,"sounds like a great idea. i don't know how many times i have just stripped manually one module at a time just to keep for having to reload everything when i only what to change a third of it.it would be nice also to have to option to strip rigs, even if it meant losing the ship. i'm sure a lot more players would use t2 rigs in t1 ships if you could strip the rigs by sacrificing the ship. i'd put full t2 rigs in a mammoth if i could later sacrifice the mammoth to get the rigs back when i no longer needed to ship. considering a mammoth is less than 1 mil even t1 rigs are worth more than the ship."
7/18/2011,also give us back some decent looking mining laser beams. these new ones are just pathetic! but still not as pathetic as the new weak sound that only plays once.
7/18/2011,"the new sound is so pathetic i thought it was an unintended glitch that would soon be fixed. difficult to believe that it was an intended feature working as intended.ironically, the new visual is nice."
7/18/2011,"i'd like a pet fish in a force field bubble of water, that floats above your shoulder using anti-grav.but still doubt i'll ever buy anything from the nex store after ccp's stupid launch and the absurd prices of today's goods. it's put me off the entire idea."
7/18/2011,"yeah, some themed clothing would be nice. shoulder pets is going a little to far, but whatever. i actually like the look of the military style shirt currently available in the nex. however the prices are absurd for a vanity item. in what world should an optical implant that provides no stats or bonuses of any kind and is only for looks be in the same price bracket as a capital ships? 1.2 billion isk for a monocle may be worth it for a select few elite traders making billions of isk a day, but that is a very small number of players. i also realize this is probably the whole point. they want the monocle to be rare only owned by the elite rather than every other toon having one. but at least have different versions of it. maybe a really fancy gold plated monicle that has a borge style lazer shooting out of it for 1.2 billion. but the standard low end one should not be more than 1.5 plex worth of aurum.there is no way i would ever even consider spending over $100 in real money on plex to get enough aurum to buy a vanity item. i'm sure at least 80% of the eve community would agree with me. i find these prices so overboard that i refuse to even support the nex by buying the cheaper items. i would have no problem paying a few mil isk for some nicer clothing even a few hundred mil for the higher end items, but over 1 billion isk is just ridiculous. they did this totally backwards, they should have released the nex with a few basic items at much lower prices and then added the more exotic elite items at ridiculous prices later. having vanity items that on release cost over $100 in real money just makes ccp look like a bunch of greedy money hungry idiots, directly resulting in the revolt against mt. if they are so money hungry to ask for $100 worth of plex to get a monocle, than it is not so far fetched to think that they will add non vanity items in the future, "" oh wow, i can buy a carrier for $250, my dad is rich, he won't mind me putting that on his credit card."" this was a major blow to ccp's credibility with much of the player base. another decision this stupid could ruin the game, sending players running like they did when nge was released in swg."
7/18/2011,i was wondering on what everyone thoughts were on dead pos' in space. basically not fueled and has been for months.this is only a suggestion so please refrain from the flaming as i am fragile to the flame. what if a pos has been offline for so long or empty of fuel that it actually unanchors or just disintegrates? like containers in space have to have someone access them every so often. why not have a pos require fuel every so often or it disappears or unanchors? anyone??
7/18/2011,"it certainly would not be. orca can haul all sorts of ships; that's one of its assets and charms.applying a simple non-docking period to people with aggro is both in line with the already existing rules, and it's clean and simple."
7/18/2011,"rofl - you've stooped to the lowest level of internet debate, you're now a grammar ****. classic."
7/18/2011,that's an interesting take on the issue as well.
7/18/2011,"you know, had i done that, the very same chest thumping clowns would have said ""did you loose a ship noob?"" or some other such comments. i choose to lay it all out and throw their crap back in their faces. i did this from the very first post, there are no edits there. my reactions and format of this thread have been quite deliberate."
7/18/2011,"i'm not the one who created the post, i'm just making fun of him.you are missing my actual point. it's not that he fell into a trap it's that he's being a hypocrite for complaining about someone shipping up to a more powerful ship after he went and shipped up to a more powerful ship.such a mechanic wouldn't have changed the outcome in this case if the op was cleared of aggression timers blocking docking to switch to his interceptor from his mission ship. the pirate would have been free of any aggression timers to swap a ship from the orca's maintenance bay. eve is rife with imbalances and lopsided mechanics. knowing those is a part of success/failure in the game. there are so many things in this game that need attention more than this ""issue"" things that actually rate developer time and affect more than the occasional mission runner who is stupid enough to try and fight a ninja. i mean come on there are only two circumstances people engage in combat in this game. when they have an edge they are pretty sure will give them victory or they don't have a choice. this is a situation where the op thought he had that edge when he went and got his inty, only to learn that he did not as his opponent swapped into a strategic cruiser."
7/18/2011,"the only change i could see wanting in this situation is the orca pilot should have got agro for interacting/supporting him. would have been really funny if he warped in his orca, got into his loki only to lose the orca.i agree that the op only died from his own stupidity, but being able to swap ships at an orca ship maintenance bay while under agro without the orca pilot getting agro is not right. this should either not be allowed or the orca should gain agro from interacting with the player who has agro. what if the op had got the loki down into structure and then the aggressor switched to another ship to avoid losing his loki. that would definitely be an exploit. and probably would have happened if the op was strong enough. you can not be allowed to support an agroed character without becoming agroed yourself, it is the same principal of getting remote repped by a neutral, they fixed that, now fix this."
7/18/2011,so how many supports was that? :-d
7/18/2011,"so, your point is you roam around constellations, scanning, and never staying in the same place long, and then dt happens and all the sigs get reset, and this is a problem...how? if you are camping a wormhole for a few days farming sites from the back of an orca, it pays to bm the sigs. when you move on, you delete. if you are in there less than 24hrs, you move on...the connections collapse...you might not find your way back to that hole for weeks, and...you want the sig bookmarks to be accurate?i'm honestly not seeing the point. move on, trash the bm's, deal with it.there are roid field databases already, pulled from the eve api; dotlan, for example. this is quite functional with the in-game browser as it stands. you just leave your browser open and minimise it when not necessary. believe me, living in a wormhole as a resident i cop this sig id change at downtime every day. i would love to have them stay the same. ccp must have had a reason to implement this change, and my corp has adapted, others have their own solutions (as simple as corp bulletins, for instance) so it is what it is. but changing things to make itinerant freelancers lives easier when they are roaming randomly around k-space isn't much of a target audience."
7/18/2011,"opposedthis is just good housekeeping, corps in wh space should know what sigs are in thier system and should scan regularypart of being in wh is the fact that sigs do change and i see no need to make it easier for lazy corps or those that do not have the scanning skills or the logistics in place to know what exists in thier whas has been said before, wh space isnt ""easy mode"" just leave it as it isand that includes leaving the abc ores"

7/18/2011,"the store has nto been well implemented and has nothing i wnat to buy.that does nto mean that i am against the store, but having a new coat does nto intrest me. i also do not want to see non vanity items there.well fine i don't need to use the nex store....but what can ccp do to get me to use aurum?simple.the store needs some high value items for corps to purchase.these items would cost aurum(and maybe more) that could be earned through isk or buying them. these items would be big and considered corp goals(more expensive the a monocle)the idea is to buy something that affect the entire corp.some examplessewen badge of corp logo 10 aurum-each memebr of the corp can chose to wear the ""patch""ship logo's 40 aurum-each memebr may add a corp logo to his ship for 5000 nobel metalcorp background 5 aurum-each memebr can use a new back ground(all your corp could look similaryou get the idea.i think these need to be put in. i have a lot more intresest in working towars these than to individual vanity items."
7/18/2011,"i like the idea, however i think it would be to much work for the art dept. they would need to make an entire new ship skin for each corp that wanted there own logo. i don't believe the current model can be modified to have a logo added to current skins. it would be cool though if they added military style uniforms in a bunch of different colors the the corp/alliance could buy, and they would automatically be available to anyone in that corp/alliance. this way a corp or alliance could have a standard uniform (even if not unique) that all members can wear. it would be really cool if they could add a feature to certain cloths that did allow for custom colors and logo's. it may be possible considering that the station captains quarters skin has a logo above the walkway that changes depending on what station you are in. but again from what i have read in dev blogs, the current model for cloths and ships does not allow for variations. each variation needs to be introduced as a new skin. that would be a huge server load to introduce a new skin for every ship for each corporation/alliance that bought it. but if they charged enough arum it might be worth it for ccp to look into it. 1 plex = 3500 aurum. a custom shirt with corp/alliance logo for everyone in corp 100,000 aurum. thats about $500 usd real money for a coustom alliance shirt in game. not worth it for ccp as a 1 off item, but if they made a few custom skins that just need a color and logo inserted for each corp that bough t it they could cut it down to 15-20 minutes dev time per sale. but they would need a lot of corps jumping in to pay the cost of developing that customizable skin in the first place. if they did it i would expect to see 80-100,000 aurum before they would justify the time invested to develop a custom skin for an individual corp. some big alliances would have no problem paying for that though. only 20-30% of the cost of a titan."
7/18/2011,"the corp logo would be easier than a re-skin as it uses the current skin and the lgo could be placed as a sort of modual using the color matching tech already displayed for turrets. the corp logo is made up of in game images rather than custom art so it may be possible tohave a ""badge"" shirt.if this can be built into the current ship remodel that woudl be really nice. so it would not require a re skin to implement."
7/18/2011,sounds good to me.
7/18/2011,"even the nerf they propose for the dramiel isn't really much of a nerf. its going to make it actually killable by something, somewhere, maybe, if the dram pilot stuffs up."
7/18/2011,"i'm on the fence on this one.that said, if it were implemented, then the easiest way to do it would be a decoration awarded by npc corporations and/or factions. so, ore awarding decorations for asteroids mined, an npc corporation awarding decorations for missions run, and so on. that way, we're using the existing mechanisms rather than creating new mechanisms."
7/18/2011,"but, hisec has the community that sees the most attrition in the game. and everyone has known one or more friends who started the game only to quit a week later. lowsec and nullsec players are very unlikely to pickup and leave the game, having invested so much into it already, so, sadly, ccp can ignore them more while still keeping the 'greater population' happy."
7/18/2011,"yes this is a good idea. it will also add to the rp dimension. i think that if eve can get more of the single player rpers, they once they get hooked (and get enough money to afford a couple of lost ships) they will come around to enjoy the other parts of the game (low and null)."
7/18/2011,supported with the reservation that i should be able to salvage those medals off your frozen corpse :)
7/18/2011,i like that idea.
7/18/2011,"it would be very useful if there would be ability to group members and their alts together in the corporation memberlisting. not only it would provide good view which members are actually active, but also would provide nice compressed information to who is who in the corp.a few cents and fistful of dollars,"
7/18/2011,"no,i have not provided you with an api and thus my account is secret. i have 2 charcters in your corp. ever notice how ___ and ______ are nto on at the same time?...that is because we are going to rob you....tuesday, 14:07 eve time.-----------really, no because it would provide information not available normally. also not all alts are on the same acount."
7/18/2011,"zangorus's suggestion is considered an exploit and bannable offense. login traps considered an exploit of game mechanics, and get you kicked from game if reported to ccm--at least that was my understanding."
7/18/2011,"like mission running, mining and turtling in npc corps......"
7/18/2011,"*perk* did i hear something about felonious goats?? totally, 100% wrong. logon traps are not at all an exploit."
7/18/2011,"yes, log on traps are not an exploit.but seriously, we can stop posting in this (my) thread, it's quite dead.and for the record, activities involving goats and felonies are among the best ideas mankind has yet to offer."
7/18/2011,agreed. hybrids should retain their wide variety of range bonuses. really imo all they need is a wee bit of a dps boost compared to the other weapons.
7/18/2011,"i like the idea of all the same ammo and changing charge levels to affect range and tracking. make changing charge levels instant like lasers but they have a 20 sec reload when they run out of ammo per clip. make the damage get higher at longer range charge levels for rails and opposite for blasters to enhance their ""flavor"" even more."
7/18/2011,"this looks like a workable and sensible way of buffing hybrids, particularly rails. right now you have basically 2 choices for pvp with t2 railguns: navy thorium or navy antimatter because the tracking penalties of anything else utterly bork your real dps. there is also merit in differentiating gallente and caldari hybrid weapon bonuses from ship type. eg, the rokh gets great optimal bonuses which get completely borked the moment you load any ammo in the guns, be they blasters or rails. a mechanic where you get better tracking for shorter range ammo, with lower dps, should create a fairly flat dps curve. this would be a major improvement for hybrids, allowing a reasonable dps output at all ranges. however, it would potentially make blaster bs too dangerous to approach in a smaller ship with good close-range tracking, especially because people will quickly drop the mandatory mwd/scram/web trinity for blasterthrons, with more of a mwd/scram/tp. it would also require thought about sniper boats loading high-dps long-range ammo and dropping massive sniper fleets at extreme 220km range and getting max dps. though, it must be said, that this would just turn the alpha fleet fotm from maelstroms with arty to hyperions with 425's. nevertheless, a worthy mechanic worthy of worthiness."
7/18/2011,"i really like this idea. it needs some work to balance the details but i like the idea of hybrids being more power at range limits. like for example a rail gun would out perform a artty at max range but rapidly lose the advantage as range is lost, while arttys perform well at lower ranges(except for tracking) and gradually lose dps as range goes up. arttys better at medium to long range, rails better at long range sniping. and on the flip side blasters would be unmatched dps and tracking at close range but would rapidly lose effectiveness as range increases while auto-canons are good at medium to close range losing tracking become less effective at really close range. again blasters are better if you are always up really close, but auto cannons better if you fight at varying from close to medium auto cannons are better. i really think it would work. i think this is basically what the op was thinking. but to implement this through changes to the ammo i think is a great idea. it would give hybrids a unique niche to fill. making them most effective at extreme ranges(close or far) but much less effective in between when projectiles will shine. i believe this would make them more of a experienced pilots dream weapon, if you are good enough to dictate range in combat they will be the best weapons, but far less versatile than projectiles. so arttys would reduce in dps as range increases, rail guns would increase in dps as range increases but also need more cap as range increased. and auto-cannons-blasters would be the opposite with blasters increasing in damage and cap consumption as range got closer as more power would be needed to keep the gun accurate/stable/better tracking at closer ranges, making them both unique with there own strengths and weaknesses. lazers still would have the big advantage of not needing to reload, no ammo, just crystals and capacitor energy most likely still preferred by many mission runners to keep costs down. hybrids need a unique feel, and to fit as the best weapon in certain situations to really see them used regularly. most players will always go for the higher dps, so hybrids need a situation that makes them the best dps without over shadowing the advantage other weapons have. with the current system, as others have said, most players will run either lazers or projectiles even on hybrid platforms as the hybrid turrets currently leave much to be desired. however there is always the chance that these weapons where meant to be inferior. caldari do have the best missile boats, and gallentine have the best drone boats, to give them both really good hybrid weapons as well might be to much, but if done right it could really help to balance the use of all the various ships available."
7/18/2011,"at higher fps values the human eye does not ""capture"" discreet frames. it can, however, distinguish between different fps values through movement fluidity. for instance, on a high frequency crt the difference between 60 and 100+ fps is very noticeable in fast paced games like shooters. it's a shame almost all lcd panels are 60hz only...that is incorrect. by limiting the fps the graphics card can go into idle/power save states much more often, reducing power consumption and thus heat."

7/18/2011,"i wonder if csm is getting confused about thousands versus millions when examining the figures that ccp provided?then again, it could be an attempt to get a wh nerf in under the radar while trying to distract everyone with, ""oh look! supercaps nerf!"""
7/18/2011,"jesus h. fcking christ!! this has got to be the stupidest fcking statement ( of supposed fact(!) ) i have ever seen! as a player who has had a character live in both a c4 and a c6 system, and i'm sure anyone with any amount of time spent in dubya space will agree: this shyte don't happen! sorry - opening your mouth and making that kind of general statement shows you know nothing about the subject matter you're professing knowledge to. zero, zilch, de nada.while i had time away from eve, i don't ever remember a wh exit right into jita. closest i remember is maybe 5 jumps ( and people had to change their soiled underwear when that happened ). it was a crap shoot where you had exits to, and it wasn't always caldari space. or even hisec. making it sound like there's some wh exit superhighway system into jita is plain ignorance and pander to your null sec ( abc bot mining no doubt ) buddies. not to mention spreading misinformation ( dare i say - damn lies ) to players of eve who don't know anything about wormhole space and might see you, as csm president, as having some understanding of how the game works.you go take around 20 people into a wormhole and live for a couple month. then come back here ( or your csm fireside chat ) and tell everyone how easy it is moving stuff around and how easy it is to mine ( much less find ) sites in a wormhole. if one of your folks can fly it elaine: try a plated up domi w/an ab for crashing holes. that was our proffered method, along w/having one of our guys loose an ocra when he miscalculated the mass and ended up on the null sec side of a wh once. a domi is a little cheaper on the wallet in those instances."
7/18/2011,"being comparatively new to the forum, i have not been able to find any references to a body to represent the interests of people living in hisec. having read both the minutes of the csm/ccp meetings in may and also a number of posts to jita park i am concerned that 0.0 maybe making a move to shift the balance of eve to favour lowsec in mining, invention and so on. a couple of threads here and here seem to show a campaign aiming to convince ccp that the proposals coming from the csm have the full support of all sections of the game. i feel that this is to promote the interests of the corps and alliances in 0.0 at the expense of the other areas of the game. some other posters have suggested that a forum should be opened to allow hisec residents to coordinate their responses and ultimately to put forward candidates for the next csm so as to safeguard the interests of hisec. i agree and would like to hear from others interested in setting up such a forum, if there is not somewhere already for this purpose. i should say that personally i have no interest in standing as a candidate in any future election, the nda insisted on by ccp makes this impossible as i have an aversion to gagging clauses of any kind."
7/18/2011,"i fail to see where any of the threads you're linking says anything you claim them to. the first is some guy expressing his gratitude towards the csm for going to iceland on short notice, discussing the latest pr fiasco concerning virtual goods and force-feeding players cq. it is entirely unrelated to any null/highsec issues which weren't even talked about at that particular emergency summit.the second one is proposing more work on highsec because the majority of characters is located in highsec, which is the exact opposite of what you claim it to say..."
7/18/2011,"o.k. thanks for the feedback. let me see if i can make things a litle clearer.the first post, on first glance, has nothing to do with the moves to enhance the opportunies for 0.0. it's a peaen of praise for the csm.the reason i highlighted it was because the op has a very short employment history yet seems to have knowledge of the timescales involvedin the meetings, something i was not aware of, and i have been following the election and so on quite closely.the second poster also has a short employment history but again seems to know a lot about the benefits and disadvantages of 0.0 versus hisec.i'm not the only one to notice the short history of the first poster by the way. to me, the fact there have been two posts both supporting, in different ways, the stance of csm seems to be curious, i'll not put it any stronger than that.what i'm trying to point out is that there *seems* to be some sort of effort to boost the standing of the proposals about giving 0.0 advantages not shared with other sectorsand that the posting of two supportive posts by characters with short histories, who should be less informed than more long-standing players, is an anomaly. it smacks of ""astro-turfing"" to me. it could be that i have not been paying close enough attention to the csm and its schedule etc. or it could be that old age and paranoia are taking their toll.what i feel is more important is that hisec should try and organise a mechanism to ensure that the residents are sufficiently represented so as not to be unduly disadvantaged in any changes mooted for the future."
7/18/2011,"i see - so regarding the second thread, you're not referring to the op but some other guy in the thread. i wouldn't pay any attention to character age on eve-o forum postings, as most people use disposable alts to do that (i think this character only has a couple of months on her back without ever being in any corp - it's an untrained scouting alt i have on one of my accounts and i biomass those frequently to avoid anyone associating her arrival with that of my other character ;)).i still fail to see how the first post relates to anything with highsec/nullsec priorities, as he thanks the csm for discussing the mt issue in an emergency meeting. again: high/nullsec balance was not discussed there (in case you think he refers to the recently released transcripts in which those matters indeed were discussed - those were from the regular may meeting, not the emergency july meeting the op is talking about).edit: ah - i think i've found who you meant - the guy has a point imho: ccp designed the game with a certain progression in mind - i.e. learning to walk in a safe playpen (highsec) and then, once the character/player has grown up, made some isk and can look after his own security without calling for mommy (concord), he moves on to null/lowsec, where he occasionally flies bigger ships than he could in highsec, makes more money and so on.the problem is not ccp/the csm not caring about the people in highsec - new player experience is constantly iterated on and has seen the latest iteration with the improved tutorials provided through cq and aura. the problem is that the playpen is too comfortable compared to 'finding an own apartment', like one should normally do eventually, which is why we ended in the current state with grown up, rich characters still sitting in highsec like 40 year olds still sleeping in cradles (mission hubs) and being breastfed (l4 missions).so i'd agree with him that the best way to make the game more interesting and less repetitive for highsec players is to create more incentives for them to finally move out into the real world (0.0)."
7/18/2011,"i think you are the one who has to grow up and realise that 0.0 isn't and never will be the ultimate goal for all players.a lot of people don't have fun playing the big lag battles where it takes 10 minutes to lock a target and then you maybe can get a shot off.a lot of people don't have fun flying in pure gank fits to shoot easy targets and then roflmao them.a lot of people stay in high sec because why would they let the null sec carebears dictate their gameplay?instead half of null sec is napping eachother and in return the other half naps themselves too. and then the tears come because all of a sudden there are only a few frontlines.socalled hardcore pvpers crying they don't get enough targets to shoot at and blaming the high sec players for not comming to null sec.if the socalled hardcore pvp=ers want to pvp so passionatly i am sure they can get all the pvp they want in 0.0.ow wait they can't. half is blue and the other half is too far away or god forbid, they might be able to kick your l33t arse back to the crib.want 0.0 less stagnant? make blue list a very short list so only like max 1 or 2 alliances can get set blue.max 5 corporation.red setting not possible cause that would make it too easy to see who's really neutral and who is only neutral due to not being in the blue setting.but heck, that wont happen cause then 0.0 would really become a dangerous place to live at and you would have to do more than blaming people who don't give a rats arse about your playstyle for not following it."
7/18/2011,"nooooo! ""move out into the real world 0.0"" this is exactly my point, i'm a carebear and not ashamed to admit it. i don't want to move to 0.0. i play eve to relax, my real life is stressful enough. so i invent a little, run missions, have some pi etc. etc. i don't need any more adrenalin rushes from pvp or have to keep looking over my shoulder to see what's behind me, nor do i want to be a ""master of the universe""tm. i want to be allowed to play as i want to and not as some mega-corps/alliance or ccp think i should. my money is accepted by ccp as readily as the blackest pirate or ceo of a huge alliance. if you want to build an empire complete with titans, stations etc. be my guest but please allow me to play eve in a way that suits me. to do otherwise is to infringe on the equal rights i have to enjoy playing a game that so many people love and have invested so much time and money in."
7/18/2011,"despite your rather emotional inflammatory post, i'll give a serious answer.i don't even have a single character in a sovholding alliance.guess what - i don't enjoy flying around like a drone once a year, clicking a broadcast in my fleet window and hitting f1 either, because i for one don't consider that to be pvp. there's npc 0.0, wormhole 0.0, lowsec - all without blobwarfare, structure-grind, napfests and all that.i also agree that sov 0.0 people are for the most part the biggest carebears of them all. actually, that's the fascinating thing: the carebears still not moving to sov 0.0, despite it being just as safe for a carebear not interested in pvp as highsec - as the guy in the other thread said: the biggest 0.0 entity until recently consisted of 50k carebears with no interest to pvp ever and they did fine for quite some time. these guys wouldn't leave their sanctums eben whilst their space-empire was crumbling. hell - haven't been there in a while, but getting ganked in motsu in a tengu is more likely than getting killed in some pocket in sov 0.0 with a bubble camped entry.so what exactly is your point? are you complaining there's not enough pvp in sov 0.0, so you stay in highsec because you get more pvp with empire wardecs?good for you - don't go there.are you not interested in pvp at all, but miss 'higher level content' in highsec? join an alliance and go to carebear sov 0.0 for high level carebearing or go to a wormhole for a little more adventure.are you interested in pvp but are annoyed with wartargets hiding in stations all day long in high?go to npc 0.0/lowsec.actually, this intrigues me - what do you people expect ccp to do with highsec? more varied background stories for the red crosses you shoot at in your officer fit golems?"
7/18/2011,"well - that's an honest answer - and it's in your best right to play as you wish, but the same question as to the above poster applies: what do you want added to highsec then?(besides sov 0.0 not being the murderous, harsh place where you live in constant paranoia - it's carebear heaven where you can grow your own complexes, which you can then run in a supercarrier if you wish, with a few entry points 20 jumps away from your location which are bubble-camped by a bunch of wannabe-pvpers in your alliance. if yomething slips through, they'll warn you in your intel channel, giving you plenty of time to safe up even if you were afk at the time...).also, i'm really just wondering: what do you people make all these isk for if you don't intend to do anything that could put something at risk. one day (or maybe you already do) you have your fully officer fitted machariel in which you can run an ae in 10 minutes and an additional 100 bill isk on your account. and then what?if you never put anything at risk, you don't need isk to replace it obviously, so why are you still generating them?"
7/18/2011,"most of the csm are 0.0 lobbyists, so what do you expect?also, abc ores already are restricted to nullsec (whs also being 0.0). in general, highsec serves two main purposes: - let newbs learn to walk.- have a neutral meeting ground for trade.so basically i don't see much need for highsec expansions. if it's boring and repetitive, go do something else - be it in highsec or somewhere else. even highsec isn't restricted to mind-numbingly rescue damsels all day long. go wardec someone, do incursions, leave for 0.0, wh-space or lowsec.there is no need for 'mid/endgame' highsec-content, because the mid/endgame content of eve is already there - it's called wardecs/0.0/lowsec (as hopelessly broken the latter might be).the only problem is that highsec is far too lucrative and risk free, hence a huge percentage of players never moves on to a higher level and gets stuck in the newb-area due to a lack of incentives to move on. this needs fixing and this is what's being worked on for the winter expansion."
7/18/2011,"this. not a single highsec'er i know bothers with the csm. then again, most of them don't even visit the forums on a regular basis. if highsec wants representation, they need to abaondon isolationism and get a serious set of candidates in mind for the next round.i am; however, confident that this will not happen."
7/18/2011,so even though 80% of the player base lives in high-sec it shouldn't matter. if that were true there would not be nearly as many high-sec systems. think about it. what you said is short sighted and one-sided. i know plenty of people who choose to live in empire space because of their play style. not everyone wants to deal with blobs and gate camps.
7/18/2011,"well, you know of one now. me."
7/18/2011,it strikes me that we seem to be being astro-turfed on the merits of 0.0 versus hisec. this poster only has an employment record of 4 months and this seems to be a pattern with amar azaph posting here link. he too has a 4 month employment history. coincidence? maybe.
7/18/2011,"@carmen: well - until very recently, the majority of players living in the biggest nullsec powerblock consisted of people who never engaged in pvp, didn't camp gates, never left their anomalies even if a homedefense blob was called for or never ran into g"
7/18/2011,"i saw somewhere that the average age of an eve player is 31. i happen to have a young family. i assume i'm not alone in having significant rl demands that prohibit me from being on-line for extended periods, on voicecoms or able to monitor local and the scanner without distraction. that makes trips to lowsec or 0.0 an infrequent luxury for me. does the fact that i am based in hisec make my subscription less valuable to ccp than that of those in nulsec alliances? i hope not. indeed the fact that i am a casual player means i have had to spend real dollars on plexes to buy new ships when i've lost them. i just don't have the rl time to make that much isk.it already seems that a disproportionate protion of ccps development effort goes to supporting a minority of players in nulsec alliances. i hope this doesn't continue."
7/18/2011,"there are several csm members that care deeply about hisec issues, most notably meissa and myself. there are lots of things that are horrible that need to be fixed, but the blunt fact of the matter is that hisec participation in csm voting is much lower than nullsec participation, so most of the csms are going to come from nullsec until this changes.add to that the fact that fixing basic things in the game is boring, but fixing nullsec is a more interesting challenge, and there is a definite bias towards nullsec, at least for now.it is for this reason that i put most of my :effort: into general game issues like the ui, where improvements would benefit everyone, because it's easier to make the cost-benefit case."
7/18/2011,"caring about high sec issues is a whole other ballpark than actually doing somehthing about it.it means that the high sec representation will have to realise they have to work harder.the number of votes alone in the csm isn't the only thing that decides if something comes up on the agenda. it's also the amount of players agreeing on the forums about a topic.and yes to have more people in high sec to actually agree with a certain topic you need to work a lot harder than in null sec.the high sec csm members can put in their own agenda to bring the csm more to the high sec crowd. raise interrest etc. you represent a slower to respond and most likely slower willing to vote mass, but if you want to be representers of this group then that is what you do, and not just ride your own favourite piggy and for the rest swim along with the null sec incrowd.you aren't in the csm to avoid the boring stuff. stuff like this just proves to me that the representation we currently have are mainly glamour bunnies. ""heee, look what we all did"" but heck, i look at all the stuff you again didn't represent or brought forward.what you call boring is a part which improves the game experience of a lot of people if finally handled.fixing null sec is just as boring/interesting as high sec.the only difference is that the null sec is more vocal about it. this means you will have to find more ways to get the high sec side more vocal. yet again, less personal directives and more representation. your ui improvement isn't why people voted for you.there is no biase towards null sec, stop flogging that dead horse. there is only more vocal sound about null sec. if you manage to bring high sec on a more vocal path you wont hear null sec because the roar of high sec has the option in it to be ten times as loud.and that is the sad part. you admit that you put most of your effort into your personal project and not into what people voted you for. you aren't in the csm for your personal little pet project nor for doing cost-benefit calculations for ccp. they have people for that.since this csm is an obvious fail for the major part of the playerbase i will focus my time on finding a good group of high sec representing people.to break the hegemony of null sec loudmouths and bring the csm and ccp's attention to where the bigger part of the playerbase actually resides.high sec.p.s. yes this is an alt."
7/18/2011,"trebor thank you for your input. appreciate your honesty. with respect however it seems to me that the csm approach is inadequate. as you point out the csm represents the interests of only a small minority of players. i am certain ccp is aware of this. therefore ccp is quite rightly justified in disregarding the csms opinion. if the csm provides advice or priority lists to ccp based solely on the desires of the minority they represent, then ccp would be wise to take council elsewhere.regarding your point about hisec not being developed because it is not interesting, that is exactly the problem, and what the csm should be addressing with ccp. i'm not advocating cap ships, major fleet fights, or top tier anomalies. those belong in 0.0 however there does need to be some more attention paid to the interests of the hisec or more casual player, such as more interesting solo pve content like epic arcs, or changes to the way markets work to eliminate market bots and give casual players more of a chance."

7/19/2011,"let me see if i understand this correctly:1) csm offers a fireside chat with the playerbase to try and address questions/concerns they may have2) playerbase asks one questions3) chairman of csm says he doesn't care about that issue and doesn't care what the playerbase thinks.did i miss anything here? what kind of bad joke is this? shrug, account expires in 2-3 weeks then i'll stop posting. wait till some point in the future when ccp can be arsed to put some effort into eve instead of barbies."

7/19/2011,the aka system won't work...we went over this at length already. do you need more people saying so explicitly before you believe that all the silence on the thread is not us 'wondering if you are right' but us shaking our heads and wondering why you still think it will work? i really think that you should live in lowsec or nullsec a bit to realize that some aka will not work. the proof is shown in how people name their ships something different just to avoid getting primary targeted in big fleet battles. and it does work.
7/19/2011,"i understand many of the concerns in this thread. but allowing name changes is not such a big deal. especially if it was combined with character name history on public character sheet and automatically updating the name for any other player that has them saved as a contact or blocked contact. many players buying characters off the bazaar would love to change the name, but it is just one of the things you have to live with buying a character rather than creating one from scratch. personally i would like to change my name. not because of any reputation or history but just because nobody in voice chat can seem to pronounce it. my mistake for not thinking of that when i created the character but i have used this name in several different mmo's over the years. there are many players here with reasons why a character name change could be used as an exploit, but not changing the name of a character bought off the bazaar can be equally exploited. say for example a character well established and known in the game is sold. they have to notify their current corp that they are being sold, be in an npc corp when sold, etc. but what about past corps that the character was in, or contacts they have that the previous owner has earned the trust of? they may not know the character was sold. the new owner can use past character reputation for espionage, or to get into a big alliance, possibly with access to alliance assets granted based on the characters reputation. especially if the player buying the character knew that character in the past, new there history and how to pass themselves off as the original owner. they may have bought that character as much to exploit its reputation as for the skill points. in such a situation the seller and their friends would benefit from a mandatory renaming at character transfer. rather than giving the buyer a choice to rename a character or not i think character renaming when being transferred should be mandatory. the buyer should not benifit or suffer for the reputation of the previous owner. and the previous owners contacts should not suffer from the sale either. this can even come down to a hauling alt(freighter pilot) sold cheap on the bazaar that had a reputation for being very dependable and many players trusted that character enough to give them contracts at reduced collateral. then the new owner exploited that reputation and many stole billions of isk worth of assets(possibly more than they paid for the character to begin with) before other players stopped trusting them. although having mandatory character name changes on transfer could be exploited i truly believe that the exploits possible with not changing the name are far worse.consider another possible scenario. you played with a character a few years ago got along well. they were a great fc and a great asset to the alliance you were both in. for what ever reason you parted ways and have not seen them in game for over a year. you are now in a new alliance and have worked your way to the top. you then meet this old friend you have not seen in a year and offer them a position in your new alliance knowing how great of an asset they were in the past, you recommend them for immediate promotion. over the next month or so corp and alliance assets start to go missing, eventually some capital ships disappear from the poses they were left at. by the time you realize that this character is no longer the old friend you trusted they have stolen billions in assets from the alliance, and they blame you for bringing him in. had this player been forced to change the name at character transfer you would have known it was a different owner and not gotten exploited. yes having a mandatory name change at transfer could let players change their name simply by transferring that character to another account, but i believe the potential for exploits is a lot higher by not having names changed. it will do far more good than harm."
7/19/2011,"i can second that this does work, most of my haulers are named as a faction shuttle. it has gotten me ignored more times than targeted."
7/19/2011,"a good reputation can be exploited just as easy. for every character that would change there name to avoid a bad reputation there is another bought on the bazaar that is exploited for their good reputation that the new owner did not earn. make it so names can only be changed on character transfer, and can not be to an account that uses the the same e-mail/credit card/pay pal/isp etc. that should really limit the number of players transfer to an alt account just to change their name. but some one buying a character from the bazaar should not benefit or get punished for the reputation of the previous owner. really what is worse, not knowing right away that a contact is someone you hate, or not knowing that a trusted contact now belongs to a new owner. i think the later is much worse."
7/19/2011,"no, it went like this: you brought up a point flourished with pathos and i shot it down with logos. repeat. then you stopped because your silence was due to your lack of a point. just like this post, because...someone already posted the idea that a name changed should begin with the same letter as the original. see that? all your pathos shot down in one line of logos been there, done that. lets skip ethos, shall we? it wont be pleasant"

7/19/2011,thoughts:forum revamp topics 61 and 62 can be removed becouse the new forums will be deployed soon. a new topic about the state of the new forums shoud be voted up from the assembly hall. will not get votes anyways exept in the negative will delute votes.do you want the prioritization to reflect current state of game or prioritorization after the winter expansion/bbf stated items being worked on?soundwave has not responded to fw or gallente balancing. can you ask him to post on those issues before voting starts so they do not become black hole issues for votes. though they should be clear messaging about what prioritization means. your vote will show what you want ccp to worked on etc not i like/dislike this feature. will be used in this manner for meta purposes anyway but for the average player the messaging could be clearer.how many items can be voted to the bottom of the pile? none of the messaging has covered this topic.great work on the wiki.when will the messaging game wide start for this project. only forum and wiki warriers know about it so farmore after we get more feed back in this thread.are there going to be any of the current topics in the assembly hall voted on and added to the list?
7/19/2011,"i went through most of the points and offer some constructive criticism:duplicate issues: #7, #9, and #43. #19 and #20. #40 and #116. #57 and #59. #70 and #150. #108 and #109. #168 and #169.issues already (at least in a large part) implemented: #32, #37, #49 (made irrelevant by agent changes), #143, #180.#5 and #42 could potentially be merged.#28 seems to be a very specific suggestion of a new game mechanic, this contrasts with most of the other items and with the idea that the csm should help ccp in high-level decisions, not play backseat game designers.#36 i think covers many relatively unrelated items, could be split into several points.#45 already covers all of #44 and most of #46.#47 is a bug report, not a prioritization issue.#62 i think is no longer relevant.the implemention of #92 is according to the csm minutes very unlikely in the near future, i'd suggest removing it from the list.#136 is no longer relevant with the agent changes a while back (you can always access some l1 agents).#179 is an incredible o-m-g-wall-of-text.thanks for this initiative!"
7/19/2011,"the in-process list shows all the active (afaik) formally-passed csm items. so if you wanted to prioritize the art department, you need to raise an issue here in ah and get it taken up by the csm; it would then appear in a future prioritization.see above; if it wasn't voted on by the csm, it won't appear in the prioritization.good point, i will flag them for removal from the final list.current. afaik, gallente rebalancing is something tallest will be addressing after he finishes destroying supercapitals. fw is a much longer-term issue; i would not expect any love in the winter expansion.noted.not quite sure what you mean by this.manifest has promised massive pimpage shortly after the prioritization starts.nope, no time."

7/19/2011,is not clear how the against voting will work. i am assuming that we can put only 20 topics in a valid voting post and that we can vote against/ vote to be worked on last by either puting a minus in front of one of the number or are we using a seperate line or grouping feature to indicate that choice.edit number fu
7/19/2011,"noted as superseded and will be removed.marked as resolved, will be removed.will be moved to the needs-review section.i have a way of combining items into categories that i can do after the main results are in.my current plan is that you can put a - in front of an item number to vote against it.so:salpun,1,2,3,4,-5,-6,-7means votes for 1,2,3,4 and votes against 5,6,7. as with the last prioritization, you will have 20 points to allocate, voting for less than 20 items increases their weight (in this case, to 20/7), voting for more decreases their weight, with a max weight of 3 points per item. you can spend your points voting for or against, but each vote -- for or against -- costs you points.i'll write up a clearer explanation of the process in a day or so, but it will be very similar to last time. my focus is on making it as simple as possible to vote."
7/19/2011,thanks for the confirmation on the format.
7/19/2011,"there's a issue here ;voting against something at first can't workpeople need to know first what are the issues that people voted for.you can't vote against something where there is 180+ possibilities, cause you don't know what will appear, and if some that will appear look really bad for you.say for example that i don't want ccp to work on mining (64), cause i consider there's way too much others things to do.i have the choice of wote for something else, or vote against mining.but given i don't know if people will vote for mining i don't have much interest to vote against itmoreover i don't know if what i want will be voted a lot, so it's more sure to vote for itvoting against something is only interesting if you already know what the results of the vote will be.so i would suggest you to make 2 votes, at different times ; 1st round : everyone vote for his things2nd round : people, after looking at the current ranking, vote against things (or agaisnt / for things)(there's still issues here, but seems better)"
7/19/2011,"since you have to make at least 7 votes, then you can vote both for what you want and for what you specifically don't want. if you want them to work on faction warfare, then vote for it. if you think mining reform (as proposed) is the dumbest idea you've ever seen, then commit one of your votes to that.the outcome of the poll will be the aggregate of the votes that players cast. to continue the example above, if faction warfare reform is highly popular, it will have a large number of positive votes. if mining reform is highly unpopular, it will receive negative votes (probably expressed by negative numbers). if players don't care about a topic, it will receive few votes. ccp/csm can use each proposal's score/vote tally to assign it a level of priority among the developers."
7/19/2011,the issue with off line poses is a big one for me. i would really hate to see this bumped off until they do the complete pos revamp. all i ask for is that when a pos goes off line or is anchored without being onlined it should have no shields. i am not talking about the bubble but the shield hity points are still there when the bubble goes down. how could it still have shields if it has no power. a simple fix. i know many high sec pirates and small corps will actively seek out off line towers to pop if they had no shields making them 500% easier to kill.
7/19/2011,"what i'm trying to say is that on this configuration you have no reasons to lose vote by voting against something. it's always better to vote for something else.oh man do what you want, but i would be surprised if there much people using the against option here."
7/19/2011,"#32 seems to already be in the game. it would be nice if the contract notifications would automatically dismiss after you look at them though. i've forgotten a few times and gotten excited only to find that i failed to dismiss an old notification.#37 could've sworn ccp rewrote courier contracts along with the rest of the contracts, but this has some interesting suggestions that i don't think are in the game.#143 pretty sure we already can do that.#180 if this has already been implemented, they did a bad job of making it visible, because i can't find it. with the whole wis and the giant screens we now have, i would hope this will be a future use of the useless main screen.the suggestion in the may meeting minutes that moon goo was being reworked led me to cross my fingers harder that poss would also be reworked. i'm assuming this wall of text can be better summed up by simply linking to the farms & fields discussion here and i'm under the impression ccp already has this under the works for winter 2011 anyway."
7/19/2011,"cosmos is obsolete and left behind content that was developed in a time when eve didn't have dynamic agents nor epic mission arcs.this content could be revamped and integrated into the new systems that are now in place to support pve/missions: either making cosmos agents dynamic or rewriting the missions themselves as epic storyline missions. or both.it feels like an elegant move since this would merge all mission pve content under a common system, instead of having separate things that were developed with different mindsets.it's not a major thing but this should be low hanging fruit an easy to do. furthermore, perhaps revamping cosmos content is easier to do than adding new stuff, thus a quick win."
7/19/2011,supported cosmos is one of the original examples of a feature left to rot in favour of new shiny thingsccp seem to have a mindset that addressing old features is somehow a backward step. but mmos a lot more successful than eve have revamped old content to great acclaim.
7/19/2011,"yes. but you are daftly avoiding the fact that it is an in game advantage for aur, which is categorically wrong and disavowed by ccp, (no less after rioting in jita). your attempts at switching your argument that this will provide a solution to the lack of rd slots in highsec are a nice diversionary red herring. but a valid problem that deserves a different thread and a different solution."
7/19/2011,"for the record, there's nothing wrong with ingame advantage for aurum per se; and that's not what the protests were all about. the upheaval was over 'pay-to-win' items; in other words, items that give you an imgame advantage you could not otherwise obtain. the so-called 'golden ammo.' yet it seems now every time someone mentions aurum + advantage in the same senstence, people immediately go ballistic. with the anti-aurum sentiment going on now, i doubt people can really hear the difference, though.what elina proposes *does* give a player an ingame advantage; but not more so than buying a plex does. a simpler proposal, along the lines o'f 'r&d time for isk' would probably have been better, and not have triggered the aurum hysteria."
7/19/2011,it's still buying convenience. all this proposal is is a circumvention of the risks involved in putting up a pos.
7/19/2011,"if it has been beaten to death then it is obviously an issue that needs to be rectified, and has as of yet not been."
7/19/2011,the issue is that you haven't read the other threads and haven't realized that its not a problem at all.
7/19/2011,"no the issue has been brought up repeatedly by one or two random alt rejects, in which the community turned up in mass, and had been beaten it like a baby seal.thus,it has been beaten to death."
7/19/2011,"after reading the interviews regarding this idea suggested by ccp, i felt that it was a bad idea to even think about removing abc ores from wh space. read about the 0.0 and wh comparisons here.the same can be said about the ice belts.the only way i will support these changes (that appear to favor the 0.0 alliances) is if ccp implements at least one of the following changes in addition to their own:1. removal of local from 0.0 space.2. restricting technetium moons to wh space.3. restricting mercoxit to wh space.or4. restricting the 0.0 jump bridges to one per constellation instead one per system. (or remove them completely).if ccp is not willing to implement the above changes in addition to the idea of removing abc ores from wh space and limiting ice belts to 0.0, then this is just a clear indication that ccp will be padding the 0.0 alliance coffers while giving freelance industrialists the ****ty end of the stick."
7/19/2011,this seems to be a well thought out suggestion and not at all the petulant foot-stomping of a butthurt child. ccp should hire you and put you on their balancing team immediately.

7/19/2011,"i dunno, selling sp in as microtransactions doesnt feel that right, but at the same time the op have a point, the skill waitfest completely annihilates new players... i joined eve a few months ago and to be honest i feel so freaking useless... this is the second time when i sit down and ask my self if waiting all this time for a little fun in the end is worth my time...if you ask me they should give the players more control on the character progress, let us get x ammount of sp by doing this mission or achieving this goal...instead of money, lp and bonus money.... give us some sp as a bonus for doing a mission, or poping up an entire complex or killing someone in pvp..."
7/19/2011,"just think about what happened to the learning skills----in truth, everyone knew they are totally evil and unnecessary and it will bring only good to the game if they are removed, but the problem was never solved until someone found the solution of compensating free sp to the vets(the truth here is that it is not really a compensation because vets didn't actually lose anything----it is just extra free stuff for everyone), then the 'long term plan choice' and 'patience' arguments disappeared or ignored by the major without a conclusion in debate----the problem is never about right or wrong, it is about human nature and balance of vested interest.i also think it is a terrible gamedesign that players cannot do anything to enhance the character growth, it annihilates the motivation and joy to play the game, especially for noobs. but i really think op should give a more feasible way to implement it rather than just arguing about right or wrong. many are opposite to fix the problem not really because sth about correctness or necessity, but because they think this will somehow do harm to their interest----no matter whether the thought itself is true or right, the fact that vets think so is the problem.the problems were never solved by the right solution, they were solved by the solution that please majority.btw, i really think the solution i posted here is the most feasible one up to now: no more rules broken than character bazaar and well replaced it, nothing created from thin air, legal access to buy sp, newbies get rewarded(stimed) for hardwork. and everyone, more or less, can benefit."
7/19/2011,no
7/19/2011,"when people start playing, they won't put 500$ to have more sp, or to buy a character using the character bazar. do you really think people dumb enough to spend so much money in a game they don't know ?new players will just start the game like you did. they will run the tutorial, mine, run mission, make some money, train some skills, buy a cruiser, run mission, buy a battlecruiser then a very cool battleship. and then after few weeks, they will ask themself what do they want to do in eve ...then they will choose a path (pvp, pve, mining, industry, trade, ...). putting 30$ in it, to do a good start, won't affect the game in anyway, as soon as 30$ don't provide too much sp. would you feel affected if they had started the game 2months earlier ?"
7/19/2011,"this is by far the worst idea i've read.the argument that this will bring more ppl to the game to fastly enjoy it is crap. when you had pay for a large part of sp, you will just sit down in your supercap, waiting to something happens. you will not get happy by having 2 hours waiting before get in t2 cruiser,etc. the most important thing is that new players with mass of sp will just do nothing worth. they have to wait for someone experienced to make something. and guess what... ? they will cry to have a xp market where they can purchase real knowledge. when this will ofc not happen they will ragequit and tell other ppl this is a crap game with stealer in place of dev's (or wait ... xd).humpink, you take the fact that you are an old player as an argument. it will be no more an argument if you sell sp. so your (best) argument is crap. my last 2cents is that new players have a tons of other things to get in mind before been in a t1 tackler frig. use the ui, the basic game mechanic, market, industry, fleet, etc. in fact this kind of ""hierarchy"" between young and old players does give a role at moslty of them. seriously when you have 20 players with 3 month's game experience and they all fly a nyx, which one will accept to be in a tackler to get any target ? so you just broke the game, this role will be just blown up and this will be a drama to find someone to full fit that role, when a newbie will be very happy to follow old players in a supercap fight to see it. if you give value to a role with real money you give it less value with gameplay and experience.ccp will never allow that kind of sales cause this is a sandbox game. this is the base of this game, break that will simply result to break the game.the nearest way i see to this, in relation with background, sandbox etc, is to sale this with game money. let's say for the example: 10b isk to have cruiser at v. but to have this amount of money you need to be a old player (skill for plex, ship to do plex, wh etc), or a good trader (no need to have cruiser at v in this case imo).to conclude;giving opportunity to buy sp will favor ""rich"" irl ppl. so, a fact without any relationship with this game in that way. the current system does favor ppl who play the game and more long you play it, more favored you are by this system. the consequence is in the same logic than the cause. to compare, do you imagine one second if you earn xp in wow when logged off when others have to farm like chinese to have the same as you? :dso, 2 ways to have the sp/xp in a game is crap. you want a way to get faster xp/sp in eve with improving gameplay and asides?give some appropriate sp when getting some kill in pvp... (the rest of the game need to be fixed to work properly... so it's a dream or a nightmare )"
7/19/2011,"first, how can you think that everybody will buy a nyx and such sp ? how can you think that people will spend a thousand dollars ?secondly, you should open your eyes and be aware that it's allready possible, how it is affecting your fun ?i don't know anyone who enjoy wasting their money. if they use some $$$ to have a quick training, it's not to do dumb things. people who want a slight boost allready do it, by buying plex, and for the ""richer"", character.if there are bad sides, it's definitly not the one you are pointing. look at all other f2p, the average amount of $ spent and apply it to eve. all new players won't spent their month income in the game.irl or ingame ""rich"" people, can allready buy everything they want."
7/19/2011,"exactly why this is terrible idea. the whiners here for instant gratification are chinese wow xp farmers, and they are peeved that they can't make characters to sell quickly in eve. that is because the brilliant sp system that works as intended, which is, everyone trains at the same speed (mostly), so gamers that play 24 hours do not get any advantage over people who don't have the time nor inclination to play all day. (and thank god for that. as a trader, i don't log in more than a couple times a week). so this may be a problem if the skill tree was as shallow as 'other' mmos, but the skill tree is so deep in eve, that even people who have been playing (training) for years have not hit the ""max skill"" cap, nor can they be 'unbeatable' in game terms.this* is necessary in eve, because you have so many people who do professions that do not require you to be online all then time, but instead just make smarter use of their time online. (like trading, or industry) * a system that does not reward you 'xp' for time grinding online, but instead for choices in training path that you make, and whether you choose to train 'deep' and be a specialist, or 'breath' and be a generalist."
7/19/2011,"see? op? you can never win an argument against guys like this no matter whether you are correct or not. they can just keep pulling you down to their level by crapping like this----cuz they are players with such successful professions as to just login the game 'serval times a week' but fighting on forum 'everyday' to defend some advantages in the video game, as while as fantasizing their superiority to chinese."
7/19/2011,yes plz!
7/19/2011,"i regularly switch out my turrets based on an engagement, so i'd like to see this!+1 for (easy) quality of life improvements"
7/19/2011,"yes, bring the good sound back. also, the new mining laser effect is pretty lame. i like the crossing back and forth of the 2 beams, but it's so thin and pathetic looking...bring back the big fat rock melting goodness we're used to!"
7/19/2011,1
7/19/2011,"""instant gratification"" allready exists with the character bazar and plex. you can buy whatever you want in eve with real cash : ships, faction stuff, character ... the main (discutable?) argument against sp selling is that, using the character bazar, you dont ""create"" sp. sp has been trained. with this solution, this argument vanished.to balance this, storing sp in a pill, should also have a cost (in aurum or isk, whatever). i am totally convinced that sp selling, or sp transfer is a good thing for eve."
7/19/2011,"i dont think we are playing the same game.people should just stick with the rifter until they have clue or go play wow. i wish i felt like joking here.sp doesnt make you good in this game, thus any sp trade threads are 99% trolling 1% of not having a clue so any people making up this crap should be deducted 1 mil sp."
7/19/2011,"don't mean to argue, i just feel that as a player who thinks that 'sp means nothing and doesn't make you good', maybe you are trying too hard to defend your advantage on it.not only you, of course, interestingly."
7/19/2011,"doesn't create sp out of thin air, allows those of us who like our characters to develop them instead of the detachment the character bazaar promotes. sounds good to me.i'd prefer the simplicity of assuming a worst case conversion rate, but then having sp convert into a generic pool that can be applied to any skill."
7/19/2011,"this has come up many times. there was even supposed to be something done about it some time ago. the biggest problem as i understand it, is that an off line pos is as hard to kill as an on line pos. off line poses should have no shields. they have no fuel, no power, how can they still have full shields. the bubble disapears but they still have the full hitpoints from the shields."
7/19/2011,"i think after three to six months of being inactive, they should ""forget"" who owned them and allow anyone to unanchor them."
7/19/2011,"a tower has say25,000,000 shield hp, 1,000,000 armor, and 1,000,000 structure. an off line pos looses the force field bubble, but still has full shield hit points. this makes no sense to me as if it is off line with no fuel, there is no power, there should be no shield. if an off line pos lost its shield they would be much easier to pop. if you only needed to do 2 mil damage instead of 26-27 mil you would no longer need to spend 4-6 hours with a decent bs fleet to clear a dead pos in high sec. with the current system an off line pos is as hard to kill as a online pos so since you need to war dec it anyway to keep concord off you why not go after an online pos. better chance for loot, same effort, mild chance someone will show up to defend it. many high sec corps will pull down a pos if war deced, so if all you want is the spot the easiest way is to go after a on-line pos. i say again this makes no sense. make off line towers easy to kill simply by making the shields go offline when the pos does."
7/19/2011,"this gets my vote, surely its the best way to deal with old pos"
7/19/2011,how about having it go up for auction of some type. or let the person who wants it file a claim on the pos and pay a fee of some kind on the size of it and take it over free and clear.
7/19/2011,"ok, so you acknowledge the existence of dotlan and similar sites, yet refuse to use them because you want to go and catalogue all this stuff yourself? sure, its how you want to play the game, it will certainly soak up a lot of your time, but probing every moon in eve yourself to create your own database when one already exists: not a reason for anything except /wrists imo. but hey, if you get enjoyment out of it thats fine, but i don't see why ccp should pull code monkeys away from rebalancing supercaps or railguns or designing more items to flog to carebears and wow refugees, to pander to one player's playstyle.you are saying wormhole sig ids should be the same. but wormholes are transient things. so they move, within 23.5hrs of any downtime, guaranteed. meaning, all your effort in scanning them down is flushed down the toilet within 24hrs, and wherever that wormhole now exits to, it will have a new sig id anyway. maybe you need to learn to deal with this.so, seriously, what would be the point? the only time this is of any use is between downtime and when the wormhole naturally expires. and the only person it would be useful for is you. for signatures like gravs, you will have bookmarks. these sigs will last several days/weeks in a wormhole, but expire within 24hrs in k-space. so what if they change id? keep the bookmark, treasure it, collect them all if you feel the need. you make a point about 'on-board tools' vs 'off-board tools' which i take to mean web apps accessible via the igb. ok, a fair point, but the game already allows you to bookmark a sig once you've got it to 100%. after downtime, you can drop probes over the bm pin in the solar system map, and choose 'ignore signature' for the sig which turns up at that location. voila, you have organised your sigs with an on-board tool called the /ignore button. again, this has nothing to do with the sig id's and everything to do with player know-how, ingenuity and laziness."
7/19/2011,"is it really just one players style? i see potential to have a benefit to all eve-players by improving the handling of the game and the ingame information. is some ""board computer"" the right way? maybe, it<U+FFFD>s one of thousend ideas swirling around in this forum. the question is, are there ways to give something like that the potential for having a benefit to all. i<U+FFFD>m not aware of how many coders are planed for ""high, low sec, and nullsec stuff"" i bet nor do you (except you have some insider information). but even if you would - this would not lay on us to discuss that. there is no problem in dealing with it with already listed possibilities. you gave the factor: time!imagine you scan a system and in there are 8 signatures (3 wh, 5 other for example).lets say i<U+FFFD>m actually interessted in gravs (chance of 1-2 of 8?). scanned out my first sig at 70 or 80% or what ever. it<U+FFFD>s no grav. now i have to scan it to 100% to add a bookmark just to know next time i scan this system - that is not what i want. (downtime, ship change, client crash, just get some stuff from neighbour system - what else(dunno of these all resets scan results)). 8 sigs * 1-2 scans + bookmark + (eventually manage bokkmark) = losing timelosing time = well i think you know that yourself.a question of lazyness or of effectiveness?it started with a pro for static names of any signature as long as it lasts. already wiesma pointed on that in his entry post. i just throw in a ball for a system that imho would have the capability to improve multiple aspects of the game - for everyone. has to be worked out, sure.right now i<U+FFFD>m flooded with serval ideas how this could improve many aspects of eve.(just one of them: scan out system moons(not limited to), download the results on a datachip, copy that datachip in a (player)pos with copy center, sell those datachips (via contract) on the market, buyer imports those results, generating a data-map of a constallation, sells those)by this i wouldn<U+FFFD>t have to scan out every moon in eve. but that would be sound of the future. i<U+FFFD>m honest, i wasn<U+FFFD>t in a wormhole or nullsec already but i take all bets - gimme a bit time and more knowlege in there and there would be many ideas - based on such modification - for this part of the game as well."
7/19/2011,"i realize adding a logo is not a big change to make to the skin. but with the way it is currently set up every ship using a particular skin is exactly the same. there is no allotment in the current code for a logo block that would allow a logo change dependent on the pilot, or any allotment to use different skins for the same ship, on any of the current ship skins.(although this should be possible, and would be the best solution for server load, it is a huge amount of work) after changing the skin to add the logo it would have to be saved as a new skin,with a new name, other wise every ship in game that uses that skin would display that logo. so every corp wanting a logo would have to basically have there own skin for every ship they want there logo on. hundreds of skins for every ship in game. that would be a huge server load. the reason i believe it works like this is from the dev blog discussing the new ship color skins to be available soon through the nex. for it to work they basically need to have it set up as a new ship with a new skin. you pay aurum plus the basic ship and receive the new ship with a new skin on it. these will not be custom skins but just several different paint job options. i would love to see an option to allow for every player to customize the skin for there individual taste but i believe this would involve a complete revamp of the current ship rendering system, and would probably greatly increase lag in fleet battles as the custom skin of every ship on grid would have to be sent to every client that has a ship on grid. the more info passing between the server and the clients the more lag will be produced."
7/19/2011,"would they have to re-skin every ship? could the ""logo"" not be pasted on like a turret is added to a ship? the reskin would simply have to set a place for this logo to apear. turrets already use color matching so a logo should fit on any color ship. easy to oull the logo from the corp window and set it as a low draw priority..."
7/19/2011,if it was that easy why have they not already done it?oh yeah it is cpp...
7/19/2011,well that simplified. but the time to do the work is now when they are reskinning the models. re-skin them with this sort of thing in mind. this avoids being unable to do it lator or having to re-re-skin them.

7/19/2011,"perhaps i did not explained the functionality correctly, as this would be manual operation inside the listing where alts could be grouped to the member. it has nothing to do with api or account amount or anything. this is that you could compress the member listing by grouping person's alt characters to next column or nicely underneath the member in the list as marked [x] alt of x.sorry if this caused some confusion in the first run to readers."
7/19/2011,"the complete ignorance if someone who is supposed to represent the player base is astonishingreality check.wormholes are much more dangerous then most 0sec. the massive blue blobs are probebly the safest places in the eve universe. why dont we remove abc there? oh, wait, because mittani lives there. abc is mostly mined by bots. as said a 100 times, the amount of abc actually going out of a wormhole to empire space is minor. 2% of the players live in wormholes, and most dont do anything with the gravs as far as ive heard. so the amount of minerals comming from there is barely worth mentioning.it should be removed from class 1-4, maybe not 5 and 6. same mistake as saying 0sec is more dangerous then wormhole space. the shallow wormhole classes see a lot more traffic then class 5 and 6. youre confusing with what should be dangerous with what actually is dangerous. granted, comparing class 5 to blue nullsec is like comparing sivala to amamake. yes, class 5 is dangerous, but not nearly as bad as the shallow classesyou can mine abc 2 jumps from jita. and yes, mercoxit as well sometimes. well, you could, in theory. fact is, all lower classes are occupied, especially everything with a static highsec. go mine in the last piece of 0sec that isnt blue to you and then tell me its so much saferalso, the amount of jumps from a tradehub or main mission hub kind of dictates how much traffic you get. bring a hulk in a c2 close to jita, and youre 99% dead. the chance of being shot by residents is about 50%, the other 50% from empire people who come there the same way as you do. its just 2 from jita.im sorry, but this entire argument is invalid, badly supported and brought by people who have no clue what they are talking about. as far as i can see, they are only trying to secure more income for themselves. even though in this case it wouldnt make any difference."
7/19/2011,"rofl, i remember how the csm boasted about how knowledgeable they were about game mechanics etc.and now they prove they know jack ****."

7/19/2011,"all i hear is zero point zero.force all the underskilled and poor out into the low and null sec space to be fodder for the players who have superior skills and a blob to back them up.force all the underskilled and poor to mine crap low value ores reducing their options further in obtaining a pvp competitive ship...dont fly what you cant afford to lose.... well if you take away all the resources and play from highsec, how are people sposed to build up a bank to buy the pvp ship to take to lowsec... if you can only afford the buy one pvp ship a month, because the rest of your time is spent market/mining to get the isk to buy the hull and mods to fly to null, then by focusing on 0.0 constantly and nerfing highsec, your chewing off the arm that feeds the pvp machine.if anything highsec should become more lucrutive so noobs can generate more isk so they can actually afford to lose a few hulls to low/nullsec roams...losing ships in eve should have impact, you should feel bad about losing your ship, but you shouldnt have to spend so much time earning isk in game...why should someone spend half their months play time mining or grinding missions for 20 seconds of pvp lose?buff highsec ores or do something to make new players and even 1yo players earn more isk quicker so they can get out to where the 'real' game is, 0.0."
7/19/2011,"my advice is: don't run out to 0.0 without finding a blob to fly with first.superior skills do not make up for playing the game badly. it's deadly when you run into someone who both plays well and has the sp to back it up, but often you'll run into someone who has one or the other, or neither even (the most fun, you can laugh about it later).if i have money problems, i keep a mission-ready jump clone in high sec. nothing wrong with a little grind for some isk occasionally. i usually fly drake, so that's a few hours worth of work. yeah, it could get blown up in 5 minutes, and i could also log off and not play this game. i'd rather play it, i accept the possible outcomes.eve is all about risk vs. reward. tbh, unless you've got multiple people with you, you won't be making decent money in 0.0 unless you have a great true sec system (like -0.5 and lower). wh is another risk vs. reward scenario that can pay out big time, and will require finding people to fly with too."
7/19/2011,"people beat that drum because other than peer pressure, no one has a terribly good reason to go to null sec. i make more isk in empire with less risk. the only thing empire cannot provide me is a steady stream of pvp (pirating in low sec is 10 parts hunting and 1 part ganking a noob, which is not very satisfying to me), which can be obtained whether you live in null or not. the much vaunted ""part of something bigger"" has a bitter taste in my mouth after repeated changes ccp has made over the years benefiting old alliances to the detriment of newer alliances."
7/19/2011,"could someone explain why wets are so anoyed with highsec carebears?is it so gratifying to kill newbs so you cant wait for us to come to lowsec or 0.0for me it sounds like ufc champions who only wants to go against untrained foes, ehh cause you know we (atm) dont stand a chance :)for a new player low sec is just gankland, you will run in to gankgangs in their t2 (or better) fitts and whatever you bring as a new player you dont stand a chance.so that means that if you want some quality game time as a casual player, highsec it is cause otherwise you will spend 3-4 hours looking at your pod, and that to me is what wets is trying to sell to new players as the ""real eve"" :p"
7/19/2011,i think ccp did a good job of encouraging us to vote last round.ccp could create electorates so that % of players are represented.no reason why ccp couldn't directly contact players to be representatives based on a few algorithms.
7/19/2011,"to answer your first point, nothing, or at least nothing to the disadvantage of other sectors of the game. what i'm really going on about is what i perceive to be a move by certain parties in the csm to give 0.0 an unfair advantage over the rest of us and trying to get some kind of mechanism together to ensure that the likes of goonswarm do not dominate csm and skew the game for their benefit. hisec is notoriously hard to get a consensus in, in part i think, because of all the new players but also because it has people like me, who want to go their own way in small corps, run by themselves and not as a part of a mega alliance dancing to the tune of the senior members. remember bob?on your second point, my alts have never made more that isk 300 million between them. the two senior ones do have over 50 million sp between them though. that's why i play, to develop my characters, to find out how to do different things and to explore how far i can go with the skills i have. i lose ships and other stuff, especially drones and let me tell you a t2 heavy drone costs a fair bit to replace. so it's not all risk free; but that is my point, i play to relax, not be the next napoleon or bill gates. eve for all its virtues is after all only a game.what seems to be getting lost in all this is my main reason for starting this thread. to try and see if we can organise some sort of action to stop anyone biassing the game in their favour. i would welcome anyone interested in setting up such a mechanism to contact me ingame and i'll try and set something up."

7/19/2011,@oooooh aaaaah.it's becoming obvious that i am not making myself clear. i don't want to stop anyone doing whatever they like in eve. what does concern me is the apparent attempts to skew things to favour those sections of the playerbase that are in 0.0i'v
7/19/2011,there were a number of candidates that ran for the last election that would have tried to create a more balanced focus in the csm. sadly none of us that would have provided a high sec point of view were elected. until the general eve population takes an active interest in the csm elections you can expect the csm to be just the large powerblocks that can get their minions to vote.i hope some day the majority of eve players (casual pve types often derided as care bears) will realize the csm is a real force in the future of eve and they will actually get someone that would share their views of how eve should evolve elected. preferable someone that wouldn't get removed for nda breaches and that doesn't throw sporks when angered. :-)isslertwo time csm membervoice of reason candidate

7/19/2011,for some people isk=points. why should you be caring what they do or do not spend them on? maybe they just like the idea of racking them up.
7/19/2011,"let me see if i've got this straight: your arguing that hisec and nullsec are actually balanced against one another, and as evidence you cite that most nullsec players have alts in hisec to do the stuff there that they can't in 0.0.well damn son, why don't more hisec players have alts in nullsec then?quit dancing around the bush and just come right out and say it. here, i'll do it for you: ""themittani is a big meany-head who wants to ruin the game for everybody because that's all goons ever want to do.""""hai guise, there's a problem here and i demand that it be fixed. good luck coming up with a solution for me, i'll be over there."""
7/19/2011,"well thanks for making me post again, but as you seem to have nothing constructive to say, i'd better try and explain, again.i'm not saying that 0.0 and hisec are in competition with each other, just that there appears to be an attempt to skew the game in favour of 0.0 this affects whs as well. i can't say,never having been through a wormhole, yet, but reading posts from whs residents it seems as if things are tough enough there already without taking away the resources that are available to them abc ore for example.the reason i said that i would not post on this thread again is that i want time to go and do something about a situation that seem to me to be in danger of upsetting the balance of the game. if you take the time to read my posts you will see that i have no intention of going to 0.0. a good reason not to have an alt there, do you think?you don't know me so stop trying to put words in my mouth. you might think that's what i mean, i couldn't possibly comment. now if there is nothing else, i'll get back to try setting up some kind of organisation to see if we can get some hisec representatives onto the next csm.thank you"

7/19/2011,"the csm, like any elected body, is there to represent all the players of eve online, not just the people who voted for them.if polititions acted in the same way, only looking after a small minority of the people in their electorate, they would not get in in the next round of votes.the player run alliances and member corps would naturally have an advantage in any voting system, they are already organised and a policy of voting for alliance candidate x would be applied.for highsec there is no organisation, there are no highsec alliances or large corps based in highsec, so there is no organisation, there is no body of people to policy a candidate to the csm.if 70% of the player base is in highsec, then 70% of the effort and actions should be directed towards this area of the game.it is not sufficient for an elected body to claim that because the majority of their votes were from their alliance, that they should be representing the interests of that alliance alone.it is the responsibilty of the csm to represent all players of eve. else the csm is just a complete waste of time for all but 20% of the player base.eve needs more small and solo pvp where someone without 5 years of skills can actually be effective in some way.hmmmmm makes me annoyed and wondering why i sub'd for a year if the only improvments are going to null... ccp and the csm should be sponsoring the love around for all the players..."
7/19/2011,"i'm currently in 0.0 but typically spend most of my time in hisec. from what i've seen there are more game features available to those in nulsec than hisec (moon mining,cap ships,sov,officer rats, etc.). as a consequence it could be argued that those in nulsec have more fun - which is the reason for playing the game in the first place.eve is supposed to be a sandbox where players can do what they wish that suits their play style. it isn't correct to say that everyone is supposed to 'progress' from hisec to lowsec to 0.0. many people just don't like the lowsec playstyle which seems to be largely based around forming or surviving gatecamps.i believe there shoud be more varied content in hisec to keep the game interesting for the vast majority of players who may have no wish to move lowsec or nulsec, as is their choice.i play eve to have fun, not specifically to make isk. i'm not sure that either hisec/nulsec incomes need to be boosted/nerfed. basing arguments for that on gross carriacatures of rich players is a falacy (cap ship plexer in nulsec vs faction fitted golem pilot in hisec). both are a tiny minority of players and not representative of either constituency."

7/20/2011,"i like the idea from the first post (erf, daredevils will become the ""new dramiel""). but a few points are forgotten.railguns definitively need a dps bonus, at least for the pve side. lvl3 in brutixes/feroxes, lvl4 in mega/rokh/hyperion ? just a pain in the ass (the kronos and the vindicator are still usable).one of the main problems in hybrid balancing is the mix blaster+railgun range :blasters want a falloff bonus (only a few of the gallente hulls have one)railguns have a big optimal, which can't be really improved (tracking computer/enhancer). it's not that important, because nobody really cares about having a 255km optimal anymore -hi, useless caldari gunboat bonus-.the range bonus/malus for hybrid ammos is for the optimal only, with the exception of void (which makes this ammo good for caldari gunboat, ah).good luck balancing this hell. the javelin ammo (not the rockets !) is a disaster. crappy dps, no alpha, huge cap cons, and wtf is this range ? caldari antim is far ""superior"" (well it's still railguns).medium railguns have indeed a real problem with reloading. and hybrid charges aren't that small in the cargo...and why the rokh has a lot more cap problems than amarr bs ?"

7/20/2011,"pretty sure i have never posted this in ah, if so i apologize.something that has always bothered me with the mining system we have now is that it is too tree-huggery. mankind's methodology for extracting ore has always been: nuke everything and sift through the rubble. but eve has surgical lasers gentle enticing rocks to hand over their valuables?i propose we base it on one of the greatest games ever created: asteroids! not only does it make more sense, but it will make militarized mining ops viable and mining in general more ""fun"".basic concept;- all rocks break apart when subjected to brute force. once they are gravel/dust they can be collected.- any force (dps) will do. strip miners are attributed 1k dps or there about. gravel/dust clouds dissipate over time.- [new module] wide tractor field array.exactly what it says on the tin, not strong enough to move larger solid objects (cans/wrecks), covers a conical area in target direction.- wtfa are only usable on rorqual/orca and t1/t2 mining barge's. rorqual/orca are given bonuses to the size/speed of the field in place of or in addition to regular tractor bonuses.extra/optional: - [new bomb] gravitational shear bomb.designed to tear apart porous solid objects (refined metal = ships = denser). honours the age-old tradition of throwing explosives at a problem.and there it is, outline anyway. protection details need never be bored to tears (probably still bored though), rorqual's get a reason to join the belt parties and door is opened for hostile's to burn the fields."
7/20/2011,i think they should just allow the roqual to use a capital tractor beam to tractor entire roids directly into the hold. then compress/gind them into blocks small enough to refine.
7/20/2011,"sure why not. after all many dead space mission sights have abandoned or derelict stations in them. if outposts and poses can only be anchored near planets and moons respectively how did those deep space stations get there. even in the eve lore there is hidden deep space stations and stargates nobody knows about. why not be able to anchor poses and even outposts in deep space for say a 20% power grid/cpu penalty. it would be awesome for large null sec alliances to be able to build an outpost in deep space that does not show up on overview because it is in deep space. you could have to get a book mark from someone who knows where it is before you can warp to it. it would fit well with the lore. according to lore there are pirate, jove, and sansha deep space stations, and stargates that are not on star charts(don't show on overview) that you can only find by stumbling across them or getting coordinates from someone who knows where they are. not even scanable. currently these are only in game in mission dead space pockets, why not allow players to build them as well, at of course a significant penalty/increase in cost over the standard planet/moon anchored ones. calling the deep space ones t2 versions will make it easy to bring into game without breaking anything. just start with t2 poses that can be anchored in deep space(but not in belts or anomalies) and see how it goes. i really like the idea of player owned complexes with acceleration gates to access them. t2 outposts could be added later if it works out well."

7/20/2011,i must confess that this is a good way of making eafs useful but won't affect scs in anyway because the support fleet will maul the eafs on sight. increase the cost of scs to 40bil and your good.
7/20/2011,adds up to this
7/20/2011,"cost has already been proven to be a horrible way of balancing ships. if a cost of 15 bill doesn't deter people from buying them as fast as csaas can **** them out then what makes you think that doubling or tripling that cost will have any effect?the point of marlona's very interesting proposal is to ensure that supercaps need a support fleet. a supercap fleet that attacks without support can quickly be crippled,. a supercap fleet that loses its support is in grave danger. iow, this stops superfleets being an i-win button that is unanswerable by anything other than ""more supercaps""giving the long-neglected eas class an interesting and useful role is merely a bonus, although a very welcome one.although eas are horribly vulnerable, it's worth noting that all carriers and motherships have huge hangers, and can easily bring along spares for the eas pilots to reship.additionally, eas are a fairly accessible class to new players. so this proposal would give a genuinely meaningful role to newer players in fleet fights.edit: btw you can easily tweak the relative utility of eas to stop the kitsune being too powerful by increasing the sensor strength of fighters and fbs."
7/20/2011,"yeah, it's a good change for eafs but it doesn't really help with the supercap problem at all. even ignoring a support fleet that will instantly nuke all eafs on the field, the supercarriers can just whack them with warriors or, if they're really proving to be a problem (and if they're not being a problem then they're pointless), then the titans just dd them. you might think that using a dd on a frigate is, er, excessive, but if eafs are effective at neutralising supercaps then, by definition, it will be worth killing them.the fundamental problem with the eaf-as-supercap-counter idea is that you don't solve supercapitals' problem of a complete lack of vulnerability to subcaps by giving them a vulnerability to a single, extremely fragile and relatively expensive subcapital. and this applies to every single ""let's make this class of ships into supercap counters, although at least it's far more sensible than the insane ""blackops as supercap counters"" idea. if you want supercaps to be vulnerable to subcapitals and make them require a support fleet, then you need to make them vulnerable to all subcapitals. that means removing their warp scramble immunity and limiting them to fbs only. and making dds and remote ecm bursts work only on capitals. but in that model, there is still a place for making supercaps vulnerable to eafs' ewar. so the eaf changes would be a good idea in conjunction with other changes."
7/20/2011,"as i've suggested before, i'd be more than happy with eas's simply directing affecting supercaps as their role bonus. nevermind distributing the effect to drones - the ships themselves are the issue. passing the effect on just creates more server-side processing and doesn't address the fact that titans are the main threat to sub-caps.tired of a titan blowing up your subcaps? tracking disrupt it.don't want fifty plus supercarriers remote repping each other? ecm them.want to hold down hostile supercaps until more support arrives? points and webs from frigate-sized ships are key.eas are fragile as hell and can be easily taken out by a competant supporting fleet, just like dictors. the key to balancing supercaps is to ensure that they're at risk when they're not accompanied by enough proper support, and can't just be thrown around in a helicopter-**** fashion.hics were added as an exception to the ewar-immune rule back in the days of the aoe dd. now it's time for for a new exception."
7/20/2011,"i dont like this idea much, since it will hit a small capfleet very hard, but large supercap fleets wont feel these.think about it, fights that have a handful of scs in them arent so much the problem, instead they have the potential to be good fun and epic - its the growing number of f*** off supers that are. in such a situation no destroyer or frigate could hold up to make a difference."
7/20/2011,"um... just because someone suggested a 'semi' fix doesn't make it the defacto 'i win' in the argument. you really should stop assuming that silence is our collective acknowledgement of a point conceded in favour of your argument. for instance, having the new name start with the same letter is a pathetic plug in the leaky damn of logic in this proposal. the point was that any change that would make it harder for someone to spot a name in a list won't be acceptable. if you accept this premise, then having a psuedoname starting with the same letter won't cut it. i thought that pretty obvious so didn't feel the need to point out that the ball was still in your court to fix this hole."
7/20/2011,"hi eve o7this thread has nothing to do with all the ""buff hybrids !"" topics.currently 2 races (amarr and caldari) have a secondary weapon that is only used on a few ships.khanids aka ""the black missile boats"" : inquisitor (fregate t1), vengeance (as t2), anathema (covert, split weapon system), purifier (sb), malediction (inty), heretic (dictor), sacrilege (has), curse (force recon, but not really a missile boat), legion (with the assault optimization sub), damnation (fleet command ship).caldari gunboats : ibis (rookie), merlin (fregate t1, split weapon system), cormorant (destroyer), moa (cruiser t1), eagle (has), ferox (battlecruiser), vulture (fleet command ship), tengu (with the mag bassin sub), harpy (as), raptor (inty), osprey (cruiser t1, no bonus), blackbird (cruiser t1, no bonus), falcon (recon, not a gunboat), scorpion (t1 bs, no bonus), rokh (t1/tiers 3 bs).so what ?amarr missileboats : great until you want to go bs-size, with a lack for t1 cruiser/battlecruiser. and no missile rookie ship.caldari : almost all the subcapital ships are available, the only missing link i see is the lack of a proper t1 freg.problems : khanid high-end ships are the legion, the damnation and somewhat the sacrilege. no bs t1/t2, no dread, no titan. absolutely no navy ships.you want to play capital online ? you must cross-train caldari, or train lasers.you want to play with missile pirate ships ? good luck training gallente and caldari.it's the same thing with caldari's (okay they have the scorp and the rokh, both ships known to be powerfull gunb--- oh wait). high-end ship ? the vulture has 5 turrets slots, the hybrid sub for the tengu is a joke.you trained hybrid and caldari and you want to :- have access to nice gunboats while using your caldari racial spaceship skills ? train-cross amarr and lasers for the sanshas ships.- play capital online ? train missiles or gallente.- want some navy ships ? sorry, no one since the hookbill was changed.- have access to nice gunboats while using your hybrid skills ? train cross gallente and minmatar.meh. proposition :add 2 missile rookie ships (amarr and caldari).add at least 2 ships for the amarr selection from the list : t1 cruiser/t1 bc/t1 bs.add one real high end ship for the two races : black ops ? dread ? a decent t3 ?plug the two missing pirate combinations : amarr/gallente (not sure what it should be) and minmatar/caldari (definitively hybrid ships).add a caldari navy gunboat (or correct the poor navy osprey). add a navy khanid ship."
7/20/2011,"i don't think you understand the intended weapons focus of the races.as i understand it, it is something like this;amarr- primary- laser / secondary- missile/dronesminmatar- primary - projectiles / secondary- missiles/dronescaldari- primary- missiles / secondary- hybrids/dronesgallente- primary- drones / secondary- hybrid/missiles each race has most of there ships with bonuses to their primary weapon system and a couple with a bonus to a secondary weapon. i think this is why hybrid weapons suck so bad, they were not meant to be primary weapon for any race, although there are some caldari/gallente gun bouts meant to use them they are not that races specialty. you can cross train weapons and use them on any ship with the right slots, at the cost of losing the racial bonuses. many players do this, but if you have a preferred weapon type you will find it easiest to go with a race that specializes in that weapon and find that races best ship for that weapon. for example if you like missiles, caldari do have the best missile boats. aside from faction ships like the dram only gallente frigates can use drones, ect."
7/20/2011,"no.no. no ! it's just a sb and a recon with a split weapon !no. hybrid weapons are the primary weapon of the gallente race, drones are only the second -but since hybrid guns have too many drawbacks, gallente drone boats are more common-.saying that drones are the secondary weapon of caldari ships is just so wrong. maybe you're talking about gurista ships ? well, why not saying lasers are the secondary weapon then, because of the sanshas ?drone gallente fregs : ishkur ishkur ishkur ishkur ishkur imicus ishkur ishkur. that's not a very good point... and putting aside the dramiel/worm/comet lost me.the arbitrator/curse/legion are drone boats too, it's not only about gallente.i'm pretty sure you don't. thanks for the input anyway, but you missed my point : eve has two lineups that were forgotten years ago."
7/20/2011,"ok scratch drones as i believe every ship above frigate/destroyer class can use drones. but the only weapons a minmatar ship receives bonuses for are projectiles and a few ships have missile bonuses. so the other two are right. again, fine scratch drones, but show me a caldari ship with a weapon bonus other than missiles or hybrids? yeah i guess you can scratch missiles, i can't think of a gallente ship with a missile bonus other than the sb. however gallente are absolutely meant to be the drone specialist race. they are the only race that has t1 frigates that can use drones. they have the best drone boats of any race. the faction frigates that use drones such as the dramel require gallentine frigate skills to fly.well pirate faction ships are cross race, that is why they require skills from mutiple race backgrouds to fly. i use the dramel as an example only because that is one of my favorite ships. it is a t1 pirate faction frigate, it requires minmatar and gallente skills to fly. ability to use drones comes from the gallente technology.the dramel is not gallente but is a pirate faction frig that requires gallentine skills to fly. all frigates with drone bays require gallentine skills, because the gallentine race specializes in drones.i was talking about frigates not cruisers. but i understand if that was over your head. show me a frigate that can use drones that is not gallente or pirate faction requiring gallente skills that can use drones. sorry dude. hybrids are not a specialty weapon for any race, they are shared between the caldari and gallente as a secondary weapon. caldari primary focus is on missiles giving them the best missile boats. gallentine primary focus is on drones giving them the best drone boats. neither caldari or gallente has a hybrid platform that is meant to be a focused ship. they just have average power gunboats, no superior gun boat fits focused on hybrids. you will see this is intended if you read up on the lore. try doing some research rather than pulling facts out of your a$$."
7/20/2011,"damnit, you're totally missing my point. the wrong part was in bold. there is no problem saying that missiles are the minmatar secondary weapon.bold.you're forgetting the 3 other rookie ships, the heron, the crucifier, the magnate, the tormentor, the bantam, the griffin, the probe and the vigil. yes i know, it hurts.show me a cruiser-size drone boat which can get solo kills ? vexor/ishtar ? yes but they are certainly worst for this job than the arbitrator/curse/pilgrim.stating the obvious. did you read the part where i stated that in order to use pirate ships when you have khanid/caldapewpew skills, you must cross-train twice ? nothing wrong with a cross-training.^ see the list.gallente drone boats = ishkur vexor ishtar myrmi dominix sin (thanatos) (nyx).gallente hybrid boats = almost everything else.my bottom is fine, thanks you. now, about the subject ?"
7/20/2011,lol
7/20/2011,"khanid apoc anyone? 8 launchers with torpedo dmg, armour resist + torpedo rof and cap recharge bonuses ????i know folks dont like the idea of that but i think it would be totaly ****ing awesome :-p"
7/20/2011,"the dps of that thing would be a bit too much. just add some range missile rigs and you got your minidread. the raven has only 6 launchers and the rof bonus, and it's already one of the best bs to shoot at poses."
7/20/2011,"i guess you missed my point as much as i missed yours. i'm not saying there is no need for an update. but if you read the lore, gallente weapons development is drone focused. drones are meant to be the gallente specialized weapon. i always thought that they should split gallente and caldari focus one specialize in blasters and the other in rails but that doesn't follow the lore. i agree that hybrid turrets do need some major love. but i do not agree that gallente should be given a missile boat that can out perform the comparable caldari since caldari are, according to lore, supposed to be the missile specialists.there is supposed to be a complete revamp of all ships for balance but only one or two at a time per update, and with a focus on making less popular ships more appealing.sorry for posting with the wrong toon last time. alexia is me.if you want to ask for a new gallente ship you need to keep it in line with the lore or it will never be considered."
7/20/2011,it always helps if you undock to go see yourself instead of sitting in station and watching holoreels. it's called getting field experience.
7/20/2011,"very true, but ccp developers will never do anything that goes against the lore. so no point in even asking."
7/20/2011,"click the in-game clock.the minutes state that the art team is tied up and no new art assets will be made anytime soon. the suggestion clearly requires those.thanks for taking my input into consideration.edit, question: what exactly does a negative vote mean? is it ""i do not think this item should be a high priority"", or ""i do not think this item should be implemented at all, as i think it would be bad for the game""?"
7/20/2011,"my understanding is that each topic will be prioritized based on the number of positive or negative votes it receives; high positive numbers mean 'we really want this', numbers approaching zero mean 'we don't care about this one way or the other' and high negative numbers mean 'we hate this, don't even think about implementing it'.i'm not sure how else they could work it, based on how they've explained it so far."
7/20/2011,"marked as resolved with a note that a new issue can be raised if it needs tweaking.marked as resolved.ccp wants to redo pos's, but it is a big job and as always, :resources:. so not in 2011."
7/20/2011,"pretty much this. a + vote means ""i really want ccp to work on this"", no vote means ""meh, who cares"", and a - vote means ""i really don't want ccp to work on this"".my plan is to run the numbers in multiple ways, both with and without negative votes."
7/20/2011,negative votes are best described as wait on working on that item till last votes. while it can also mean i do not like this item. the question is when do we work on this topic? (sooner or later) not do we want ccp to work on this at all. that was the purpose of the csm up/down vote.while including a vote for a needs review item might be a like/ dislike vote for simplicity lets treat all votes as a work on this feature now/ later so everyone votes with the same state of mind based on the core question. trebor can comment if i am right or not edit beat me
7/20/2011,"there is a huge mishmash of things here. some of them are trivial bugs that should be routinely fixed through a bug report, some are trivial things that should take 10 minutes to implement, some of them are discussional (mining) with no definate objective, some of them are posturing (commit to excellence) and encapsulate ethos not effort, some of them are major reworks that would be a significant part of a 6 month expansion cycle. tbh, it would be better to break up biglonglist into categories, based on the resource level needed to work them and have seperate votes in each group. in particular break out the set of things that would take 50% or more of a release cycle to do into a separate list.... otherwise how the hell can you compare ""rework mining"" and ""drones are bugged"" sanely?"

7/20/2011,"you are on the right track, but i would say that 1% is a little strange, as you force people to do some quick math in their head everytime they change an order in order not to get rejected because it is under the limit. which is bad.better would be to have a tick ladder of min isk changes. in following rl they should represent a basis point, which is 1/100 of a percent. floored by 0.01 isk. ieprice range ==> tick size1-999 ==>0.01 isk1000-9999 ==>0.1 isk10,000-99,999 ==>1 isk100,000-999,999==>10 isk1mil-99mil ==>100 isk100mil-999mil ==>1000 isketc...i realize this isn't a complete solution. the 0.01 botters will soon adjust so that they make the minimum increase required. but at least that increase will be significant enough that the price will indeed move a bit more than 0.01 isk on large orders.negative on the changing of order time to 30min though. we do not want to penalize those who actually want to spend all day updating their orders."
7/20/2011,"stupid idea for several *billion* reasons....the entire concept is wrong- if ccp cant eliminate ""all"" bots they should accept/control/manage them? yea that wouldnt work. it could make it even harder to catch (other, still illegal)botstoo much potential for abuse. allowing market bots would (almost immediately) crash the wholesale/retail spread (profit margins would be a fraction of a percent)- but if you combined a hauler bot in there hmmmmmmthis bot is allowed but this other bot isnt? i realize some ppl are going to use them anyway but once you legitimize a bot it will open a botting floodgate why would you even want this? isnt the purpose of a game- to be played? sure you would have to configure the bot- but can a few mins and let it run for days/weeks be called playing?"
7/20/2011,"i'm going to assume you didn't read the large part of this thread. this 'bot' you are referring to would be an in game order bumper. perhaps only in certain hubs (like jita). this is not a 3rd party bot. it will be in game. lot's of stuff happen in game already without player attention after setup. r&d, manufacturing, skill training. and at the risk of repeating what i and others have already said in this thread, an auto order bumping system isn't an iwin button. in fact, it will probably lose more than win as real humans will exploit bots like a bad chess ai.anyway, this is not a we need this asap thread, so please take your animosity and testosterone elsewhere if you have excess of either. it's a discussion thread. we are looking for pros, cons, what potential changes it will make to the way the market works, and if it would be a bad or good thing overall.

7/20/2011,"ok, it goes like this.evils mcpirate is -10 sec status and camping a gate. he has not shot anything yet so no gcc. gate guns will not fire. fluffer mcwhorrealt is not -10, and is sitting in a ship with rr. they hear there is a tasty target about to jump through. so fluffer starts rring evils mcpirate, setting up a massive spider tank circle-jerk rep chain before combat starts. this makes evils mcpirate basically invincible to his intended target, or to anyone who sees evil mcpirates is -10 and is therefore free to take a potshot at him with no gate gun response - in which case evils mcpirate is free to respond without gate gun aggro because he's not gcc. he game mechanic as it stands is to prevent this type of behaviour, of people lurking gates in lowsec in -10 characters supported by massive rr chains.imo, sucks to be you if you are too lame to pirate without rr. man up."

7/20/2011,"it isn't really the same. isk is bought through plex which has a fundamental supply and demand basis which drives the price to equilibrium. the last thing that ccp wants is for people to be buying aur to get game advantages, no matter to what degree. why?because people who buy vanity items that have no game value are rich people who are buying plex with isk to get the aurum to buy these goods with.people who would buy game enhancing items are more likely the hardcore gamers who are trying to maximize every single element of the game in order to give themselves an advantage. these same people are the kind of people who would pay real usd to get the plex to change to isk or aur to improve their game.ccp intends the nex to be used for the former not the latter. the former drains isk from the system, while the latter doesn't.in summary, isk for plex was invented for the sole reason to allow people to be able to play the game for free. therefore they needed to sell plex for isk. but with that, came the double edged sword that you can get isk for plex (ain't economics a b***h?). i believe that ccp have been trying to mitigate this problem for a long time. of course, they can't just stop plex sales, too many players depend on it to pay their subscription fees. so how better to than to create an isk sink for those with too much isk? (in buying aur). it has a side effect of allowing people to buy plex just to buy aur, but as long as aur cannot be used for anything that poor people may want to use to improve their game it's okay. the instant this isn't true, then aur sales will shoot up and you will have a flood of people buying plex with usd, which is not what ccp wants, nor is it what established players in the game want. it would be terrible to have 'yet another' way by which you can get better at the game by using rm."

7/20/2011,"i never thought learning skills were a bad idea. but then i was never stupid enough to only train learning for my first couple months. i maybe trained one learning skill to about four to six regular skills, and later on i trained higher level learning skills during extended downtimes (mine, not eve's).learning rewarded me with faster training of other skills. long term thinking rewarded = good in a long term game like eve. i was happy. and people who didn't want to train learning skills much or even not at all, got their short term benefit too - they got more non-learning skills trained to begin with. win win. thinking long term or short term - it was all good. and people who hadn't bothered with learning at first could always pick it up later. it wasn't a big deal, unless you had crippling ocd over potential lost sps.but then the whingers finally won, eve was nerfed and now everyone gains sps at the same base rate *joy at the lowest common denominator winning out*but that wasn't enough for them. nor was being able to buy high level characters if they couldn't wait to get a cap ship blown up. nope. thus we get stupid threads like this one, where the whingers moan that they can't compete with people who have been playing for years (or even more stupidly, they ***** about not being able to immediately do [insert high level skill here]).somehow they always manage to totally ignore the rich opportunities for players with low to mid-level skills. nope - they just can't feel fulfilled unless they're flying a capital in 0.0... weird. i still don't fly a capital, nor do i spend much time in 0.0, yet somehow i have heaps of fun in eve, and find plenty of people to fly with.utter rubbish, if not blatant lie (if i'm feeling uncharitable). we had learning (but you whinged and got that taken away), and we still have implants and attribute remaps and skill plans (but that requires long term thinking and planning, so i guess that's out for the instant gratification crowd).in short: stop trying to get instant gratification, and start playing eve. you might actually enjoy it. or if you can't, then *shock* *horror* this might not be the right game for you. wow! what a concept! instead of whinging and trying to turn eve into your version of short term fun and ruining it for others, maybe you could realise eve is not for you and move on! holy sh!t! my mind is blown! what an amazing idea! instead of p<U+FFFD>ssing in everyone else's pool, you act like an adult and go find something that does suit you! *in awe at this revolutionary concept*but no, that'll never happen. you'd have to actually exercise some personal responsibility."

7/20/2011,"i personally am adamantly opposed to buying skill points, either with real life cash, aurum, or isk. i would still consider myself a new player. even my main is only a little over 20 mil skill points. i don't get on a lot which fits very well with the design of eve. i do not get punished for not playing 23/7 my character still keep training as long as i get on to add skills to the que when needed. it is frustrating for some noobs to know that you can never really catch up to the veterans, but really how can you expect to start playing a game, play for 6 months, and have everything that someone playing for +7 years has achieved. it makes no sense. yes, this does happen in other games where once you reach max level you are on par with the vets except for maybe some elite raid gear you have not got your hands on yet. but those games have a lot of trouble keeps subs up for more than a few years. in eve character growth never stops, there is no max level. the more skill points you have the less advantage a veteran may have over you but even a 5 mil sp character can kill a 200 mil skill point vet with the right fit and circumstances. eve is not about levels, endgame content, or any of that crap many other mmo's focus on. that being said, it would be nice if players, new and old alike, that do have time to play should not be limited to the same character development as someone who only logs in once in a while to update skill que's. it takes isk to truly develop a character, and time playing to be able to put any of those trained skills to good use. i would support having some sort of mission agent that you could run skill based missions for to get a skill point boost to that skills training. for example, extend the training missions for stuff like exploration, but rather than an isk/item reward, when the mission is complete you get a bonus of skill points added to that skill. make agents for every basic support skill. many level 5 skills take a month or more to train, with this agent system logging in and running missions for the agent for that particular skill every day would say cut the training time in half for that skill. this would fit with the lore as you are actually getting experience using that skill and benefiting from that experience by training that skill faster. much like doing the missions for research agents doubles your daily accumulation of points. but you would have to run missions for the skill agent that matches the skill you are actively training and receive a % bonus that would basically double the skill points earned for that skill for that day based on the rate of skill point accumulation you are getting at the time of mission completion. everything currently in the game for skill point accumulation would be left unchanged, but any character could double there skill point accumulation by running the skill agent missions. this would even be great for veterans, want to train to fly that titan your alliance is building, run missions for a spaceship command agent every day and cut that several months training time in half. if you have already trained for a titan, well there has to be some really long training time skills you have not trained yet that would be worth training if you could do it in half the time.veterans would probably appreciate this more than new players as they are the ones training skills that take 2-3 months to complete. just an idea, but it would add the option to everyone of training skills faster by investing actually time playing the game into it ( a skill grinding option)without changing any of the current mechanics. no butt hurt for the vets as this requires investing time to reap the benefits, time which could be spent (and was spent by the vets) doing other things. it would still take 4 years for a noob to catch up to an 8 year vet and only if the vet did not do any skill training missions."
7/20/2011,i was poking around wondering if this has been inquired about before. as a result i found this:
7/20/2011,1
7/20/2011,1
7/20/2011,i want a space parrot with a bubble helmet which squawks yarrr in local. will settle for eye patches or viking helmets.
7/20/2011,things like that would give to the shop the right of being.
7/20/2011,some people here miss the idea of eve lore. go play wow if u want a parrot.
7/20/2011,can i become space pirate with parrot in wow?
7/20/2011,"yarr we need pets. peg legs, and olts of other pirate'y stuff.a space pirate wouldn't have a parrot, they'd have some little alien blobby thing that farts and spits at people. like the little shape shifter thing the space pirate in treasure planet had."
7/20/2011,"most of you are forgetting that sp need not just be used to get piloting 'that new shiny t2 ship'. if that was the only problem it still would be a pretty bad idea... but the more damaging one that i see is that sp is the fabric that holds all character progression in the game at a common playing field. you have a lot of professions which are specialized like trading, mining, invention etc, and the only thing that makes a character who does this as their livelihood feasible is the fact that they sacrificed a good amount of their training time to get good at pi or exploration, or trading etc. if you open up sp to anyone who wants to pay for it, you basically ruin their livelihood and means of living by flooding the market with newbie wet-nosed traders, specialty miners, manufacturers etc, who didn't have to sacrifice anything to gain those specialized skills. this is categorically bad.it's essentially the same as saying, you can earn a university degree in 4 years, by paying tuition, and doing the coursework, or you can bribe the dean and get a degree in 1 day. making that bad situation worse, you will then flood the market with unqualified, doctors and dentists who have no idea how to take a patients temperature, or clean tartar."
7/20/2011,"i'd point out the obvious flaws but, simply by failing to see them in the first place, you've demonstrated yourself to be beyond such things as basic common sense, so i shan't bother."
7/20/2011,sorry but ... no!i honor you made some serious thoughts there but still no...
7/20/2011,"as ceo and cheif dunce of vogon demolitions, a corporation made up of alts in afkgeddons and afkdomi's, we don't mind paying 2m to dec the corps behind offline poss in hisec. sure, it takes time, but when you have nothing else to do you just turn up, press f1 and walk away from your computer; the rest is simply a matter of time. my corporation has cleared a half dozen moons of pos trash so far, and we accept contracts.if there is a need, someone in eve will find a way to make money off it. or at least killmails."
7/20/2011,"wouldn't it be so much easier if those off line poses did not still have full shield hit points. you might as well just war dec and attack a online pos. a least then you can scoop the modules once the pos is destroyed. i don't think there is much better chance of someone showing up to defend the pos in high sec even if it is online. if they could deffend it, it probably would not be in high sec.i would love to be able to unanchor and scoop them, or claim them as my own with some high tier hacking skill they could add, but next best is just make them have only armor/structure for defense and loose the huge shield buffer when off line."
7/20/2011,"increase the cost of sc to 40bil... case solved. dreads already deal titan dps, so you can't ask for more and sc were made to wtfpwn dreads and co."
7/20/2011,"having to organize refueling after a long-distance jump will effectively reduce their power projection capabilties considerably.given the amount of fuel that would be needed for a moderately sized supercarrier fleet going by the op proposal, that would leave that fleet in a very vulnerable position after deployment at maximum jump range.and yes, it will have a huge effect on their pockets. look at the numbers on typical killmails with supercarriers involved, you'll see 20+ regularly.to jump a fleet of 20 to their maximum range, it would cost the respective alliance 6 billion.now imagine a larger engagement with 60 supers on each side. and keep in mind the loser might not only find his supers pulling the emergency logoff, but also stranded with the need to bring in massive quantities of fuel to hostile space.good idea, not sure if it needs to be that extreme, but the fuel cost definitely should be increased a whole lot and the fuel logistics made more important."
7/20/2011,/signed awesome idea
7/20/2011,"seeing so many supports to this idea is extremely depressing, and demonstrates exactly how these imbalances arise in the first place. ship balance cannot be achieved through cost-based nerfs, and this is especially true when the ships are so prevalent ingame already. the reason titans were so imbalanced the first time around is because ccp assumed that their cost would keep numbers low, with occasional ship deaths to keep balance. in fact it just served to enable the rich to buy more and keep maintain the status quo by never losing titans.the logistical aspect of this change becomes more of an annoyance than a nerf. established groups and alliances already have plenty of suitable logistics support, and there is no real risk as the underlying balance issues of supercaps versus everything else is not addressed.the overall effect of a change like this would be:1) established and well-funded groups with many supercaps will be unaffected. they will cover the fuel costs with an alliance wallet and use their numbers to dominate nearby territory - further increasing their strength by taking high value moons and similar assets.2) smaller groups with less cash will find themselves struggling even more to use their prized flagships. many will simply opt to sell them onto the richer groups mentioned above.3) null-sec space in general will become more stagnant, as alliances leave their supercap fleets at home due to cost of movement. wars are then degraded to attacking sub-caps and capitals versus defending supercaps - which is still as broken as ever.fix the underlying balance issues, don't just slap a new price tag on and call it fixed"
7/20/2011,"supported, this as a part to make the use of scs more expensive is a good way to decrease ridicolous usage of them. include a much increased cost of fighters and fighterbomber, doomsday fuel cost and maybe even remote ecm cost."
7/20/2011,"this, its ******ed that one capital ship cant tackle another one, also change the triage module to effect only the repair/hit points of the ship itself not for remote repair.rp hat, carrier points sc (maybe not titan?), pushes the triage button and survives at least long enough to do some good. hp buff to the carrier itself would need to be significant (i don't know what that would be, 400% off of the top of my head). add into that a massive boost to self rep and all of a sudden you have the chance of a fleet of 20 1bil ships at least holding there own against a handful of 20bil ones.with an eye on the longevity of eve it's much easier for the ""little guy"" to aspire to a carrier (i'm talking players less than a year) and to feel like they have a chance against the big boys. no aspiring alliance is going to risk to go and take a foothold in nullsec if they don't feel they compete at any level. come up with a counter over a nerf any day, guaranteed to **** less people off and add more interest to the game. you can add but you cant take away as they say...."
7/20/2011,"greetings to all,skipping pleasantries, i have brought the issues i would like you to flesh out.1 - captain's quarters monitor- on ""science and industry"" control panel, under ""planets"" tab, insert column with planetary production status or description of activity, ex: - working (green) - inactive or no activity (red)than, show status on ""planetary monitor"" in the captain's quarters.- when an alliance or a corporation are on war with someone, show a red flag or a red message on the ""corporation monitor"" in the captain's quarters.2 - drones give us a chance to recover the drones when they are very far away, after a ""re-login"" due to crash-account.3- aurone nighthawk t2 fitted + insurance = one men's 'field marshall' coatwhy? i do not understand the comparison between the values <U+200B><U+200B>of the objects. in real life it would be a theft.because on this way i'll never buy nothing, not even a sock. would not it be better to have a real cost of goods?thank you for the work you do, you are all mythical."
7/20/2011,"lol, doesn't matter. you prooved you're a complete ass, mission accomplished."
7/20/2011,"still no spellchecker, huh?and wow - no one noticed how you just pretended not to notice that for it's length your thread is just about the worst supported in eve forum history. bravo on your excellent misdirection there! bravo sir! well played! :-d"
7/20/2011,"agreed. there should me a way, but standings for orders isn't it.standings for distribution missions or trade missions should suffice no? i mean, they are trade missions afterall.though personally, i would like to see the mission isk rewards for trade missions to be higher, i mean, you have to pay for the items, so they should take into account that you are just earning a thin spread."
7/20/2011,"i didn't make you do anything. you're an autonomous agent capable of free will and decision making. you chose to post. gj btw.the two halves of that statement are mutually incompatable. either nullsec is in competition with hisec, or there's no danger of one being ""skewed"" (which seems to be your favorite word) over the other.a very good reason indeed. you've just made my case for me.good luck with that. i expect you'll be posting again soon."
7/20/2011,"short of a ccp implementing a method for players to join and form political parties, and even probably limiting them to a certain number i honestly can't see rallying the hisec players behind select candidates. hisec players are by nature disjointed and spread out in all 'walks' of life no eve mail or chat can reach large segments of them like alliance mail can to direct them to vote or look at candidate x.at best a dedicated group of players could feasibly form a 'party' out of game and promote it on the forums in game and with limited scope through a corp/alliance though that just presents a target. such a dedicated 'team' could nominate, endorse and support select candidates that present a balanced view but are of course going to favor certain non gameplay breaking/nerfing positions. a model for some policies is the vote match site:"
7/20/2011,"i believe alot of you people who actually think 80% of the people who play this game play in highsec don't really fully understand the game. that number is a lie, most people who play in nullsec use alts. whether they be mission alts, trade alts, data core alt, freighter alts, combat alts in training. i was not the one who said this, but it rings extremely true.""people in nullsec know what goes on in highsec. people in highsec don't have a clue what goes on in nullsec.""also who in there right mind would call moon mining ""fun""??!?!"
7/20/2011,i would like to offer up for the csm a couple of thoughts on how to better spread out the population from hi-sec. 1 - hi-sec players do not generally go to the low-sec areas because of the massive amount of it that is claimed by the big block alliances. possible solution: big block alliances can only claim 3 or 4 low-sec/0.0 solar systems per member corporation. a non-alliance based corporation can claim only 1 or 2 low-sec/0.0 solar systems.please note that i am a hi-sec player not an alt and i do vote.
7/20/2011,1 - it isn't claimed space since you can't claim lowsec like null sec. you can only try to control it.my suggestion would be more along the lines that supercarriers can't jump to low sec. since for low sec and high sec entities it's much less viable to have a big chunk of supercaps than for big null sec alliances. this would open more normal carrier and dreadfighting in which the table was less easy turned into the null sec residents advantage as it is now.make supercarriers null sec only vessels and the whole low sec issue becomes a whole new ballpark to play in.
7/20/2011,"the csm does not care about high sec. it does not fall under one of the mittani's 'chest sucking wounds' agendas. the only changes the csm wants for high sec, low sec and wormhole space will be nerfs."
7/20/2011,instead of using capslock or shouting at people you could try to wake up your brain and put something constructive in any thread.sadly enough your just another wanna be populist who shouts a lot into the void without ever offering something usefull to improve stuff.
7/20/2011,"well it seems that i really wasn't as clear in my wording and that has resulted in readers not being able to following my suggestion above. my thinking on the claiming by the low-sec/0.0 alliances was more along the idea that when i a hi-sec/corporation player, would be trying to establish a presence in low-sec/0.0 and then have to deal with both the rats (that have bigger dps) and the alliance roving bands who want to protect what they have/are claiming as theirs, tends to be a bit more than the hi-sec player/corporation can deal with. in order to just get setup and dealing with the rats in low-sec/0.0 is more than enough to start with. i am quite sure this last thought will not find a strong agreement among this forums readers/commentors.the idea was that there would be a learning the ropes of this part of eve before being hammered by every passer by."
7/20/2011,"i dont need you to watch me walking inside my quarter like a (limping?) idiot. me myself is just enough to feel depressed.there is a big mirror, what is it for ? of course to see myself in poses and have a sexy walk. i personally do care about this and i really hope its coming fast, i really like to spend half of my real life salary on aurums just to get this fixed.and yes, you are welcome to visit me inside my bedroom and check out if it tickles or not.(twinkle eye)who really needs new content in eve when we can have a sexy walk ?"
7/20/2011,actually making a mirror reflection of a virtual object is quite awsome if you stop and think about it for a second. you should cheer up and not be depressed when you are looking at your character in the mirror. now if you are depressed when you look at your character in the mirror well then that is another problem.
7/20/2011,they will never be able to make it run multiple clients with the cq as well as it was on the same spec machines.anyone who thinks it can be done should feel free to donate whatever they are smoking to me.
7/20/2011,"ok, i haven't actually 'walked' in stations for a bit of time as im now temporarily playing on my laptop that cant cope with it. but i had a few days of experience on my pc b4 i put it in storage so sorry if i get something wrong.however, i would like to have a choice of loading locations. ie. i can choose to load on my balcony, or sitting on my couch (locations where functionality is at your finger tips) rather than standing aimlessly in a room or door. i really enjoyed chilling on the sofa, seeing the world go by and chatting to corpies, while being able to see my ship and edit it/my cargo easily.a lot of my other desires i know are on the way and i can only hope they are quicker about it, such as customizability, better on screen interfaces for pi and corp (and the ability to choose what the screens show (id like to see my current build and research jobs up on the screen)another rather cool thing to do would be to enable crome (their in game browser) to have flash playing on the main screen so we can watch vids? maybe? but certainly it would make me happier than having to alt-tab out to watch linked vids sent by friends?i am disappointed that establishments have to be corp owned. i can see their reasons for it, but often this encourages players to set up their own mini corps and staying in them to play dolls houses (happens with pos's too) rather than getting in big corps and having side industries running along side them being in corps."
7/21/2011,"ok ill bite. lets say we give black ops the covert cloak.now we have a ship that has the ability to enter a system completely undetected save by the local count increasing (because you jumped in to your covert cyno), no intel on how you got in or where you landed(the cyno is invisible unless you're on grid), no indication of where you went after you arrived (because you covert cloak) and no way to catch you unless you're the kind of idiot who makes cletus the slack jawed yokel look like stephen ****ing hawking. oh and you can do all of this starting from a system light years away because you're jump capable, in ships that can easily get 1000dps from a combat focused fit.and to top it all off if things are too tough for you solo just bring some friends, they dont even have to worry about getting into the target system thanks to the handy jump portal you can make for them."
7/21/2011,"further imagine that it's 100 guys and not one. i like the idea of covert cloaks on them, but larger groups of them i feel would be game breaking. and as we all know small groups is not the current paradigm."
7/21/2011,"guess what, there's these things called wormholes. wuuurm. hoooles. so, your argument is that blops can enter a system undetected except for +1 local, and this unbalances the game how? you can do this with recons, t3's already, if you live in w-space. its not an auto-win button by a long shot. for a start, local is too much of a crutch for you crybaby nullsec carebears. oh, sorry, i mean hardass pvp deathdozers. when we lived in a c3 with k346 null static, we'd jump into system, hit d-scan. 5 drakes, wrecks. 10s later, either local has cleared (logoffski's) or d-scan has cleared (warp to safe, cloak). then, if your carebears are desperate for cash and the mafioso they pay rent to are bored, you have 10-30+ dudes turn up in local and it all turns to pup tents, kumbayah and smoky barbeque. they find your wormhole, and light a cyno, and you've got 3 aeons camping a wormhole exit. yeah, a cloaky-warping bs is going to unbalance that right there!you then go on to complain that blops are a force multiplier which allows you to leverage multiple frinds from a system far, far away. like some kind of darth vader special weapon. except, your average nullbear schoolgirl insta-safe pos-hugging my little pony tribute ratter will more than likely have the ability to port cap ships and supercaps.if you think i'm kidding, you clearly don't know nullsec. its a hive of weenies, cowards and is safer than highsec these days because you can't be caught by neutral rr because there's no such thing. imo, the more they free up black ops, the better it will make pvp in nullsec. you'd be better off complaining aboutthe upcoming degradation of local channel functionality in un-upgraded space. then you'll be at risk for the first time ever."
7/21/2011,"can you create a wormhole on demand in any system you chose for a few hundred units of ice products? a wormhole that is impossible to detect unless the person making it is a total idiot and cant be camped because it only exists for a few minutes? didnt think so. trying to compare wormholes to covert cynos is missing the point on an epic scale. you also make the mistake of assuming i'm only talking about nullsec, although your comments about the timidity of a lot of the people who live there are fair. my alliance has been running lowsec black ops gangs for months and we're well aware of how powerful they can be.the simple fact is that the black ops does not need any extra capabilitites to be a powerful and viable ship, what it needs is a boost to the things it can already do ie. extra jump range and increased fuel bay size."
7/21/2011,do u even are fimiliar with the cyno mechanics? how do u cyno in a undetecable? u realize u need a cyna alt yes? would he be blue? (thats retorical question)
7/21/2011,"regards, lax"
7/21/2011,+1one player currency and dont force this upon me
7/21/2011,"i don't believe i have supported this yet.station environments really need to be seperated from the old hanger environment properly so that we have the old functionality and hanger environment, then a new station environment where those that choose to deploy to station don't have to minimise chat, hanger, station windows in order to see anything."
7/21/2011,awsome idea
7/21/2011,"fluff, fluffagain, i wrote that i'm educating people, that means there is an ignorant predisposition present.again, i wrote that sound logic is the only way i would quit, not a skewed vote"
7/21/2011,"unfortunately this discussion cannot be resolved with sound logic my dear. the problem is that there are disagreements on the relative usefulness of the premise. you're arguments are rooted solely on the basis that adding a bit of inconvenience to everyone in the game who needs to identify people at a glance is ok in exchange for giving the convenience of name changes for those who want it. this is not resolvable by logic, as it is simply an opinion of who agrees which added inconvenience is worth any added convenience, for the greater good (read population)so popular vote is the only way, i'm afraid. (think about it, if logic would work here, why do you think we have politicians? edit: or democracies."
7/21/2011,i agree with this one hundred percent.
7/21/2011,"lol, seriously. scientifically speaking, if you yourself veiw it more than once, you've skewed your own hypothesis. i've viewed it a few times and, scientifically speaking, the laws of probability will back up my supposition that you and i are not alone in our multiple views.seriously though, why the hate on gallente pilots? matar were rebalanced to their great fortune. and as a side note to ccp, i've crosstrained into amarr and matar, so now you're free to rebalance gallente."
7/21/2011,"there is no hate. i am a student of scientific method, so i just would prefer to hear the logic behind the rebalance instead of going on the votes of people who may be having problems with their fits and just assume that there is a problem. honestly, i don't know which are which. popular vote may be skewed buy non-expert votes. i would love to see the opinions of hardened pvp vets on the matter, that's all :)i also am a fan of varied game balance. what that mean is that i do not believe balance on a ship by ship comparison should be a goal. i like games like starcraft where each race dictated a different set of tactics and playing styles. so i suppose i am biased, in that from my tiny perspective, the races seem pretty 'balanced'. as part of my nullsec corp, the ship spread seems pretty equal. amarrian guardians are the best logisamarrian battleships are more popular than the restcaldari have the bombers and drakesgallente thanatos and nyx is the carriers of choiceminmatar for cruisers.i just want to point out that forums like these may be read by say, only gallente frigate or cruiser pilots, so they feel that their entire race needs a rebalance. i would just like to see some actual evidence of where the imbalances lay, taken as a whole race."
7/21/2011,"though this forum page doesn't display it, i'm sure its a simple task for ccp to do to filter out duplicate reads by same users so that a very clear read-not-support/not-care vs supported ratio can be found."
7/21/2011,"some of the reason why fewer people are joining eve is because they feel that they can't catch up on skillpoints to those of us who have been in eve for years.i know this is the case, i have had people who joined and then left because of this.it is a serious issue. it is likely a real reason why we have less people joining eve now.so there should be mt to allow people to speed up skill acquisition on their characters. maybe even give them the accelerator. limit it to 'new accounts' (ones less than 1 year old).some argue that people can already get high skill point characters if they buy them on the character market. well, i don't care about the character market. that isn't part of the game, it doesn't add anything to eve, it detracts. additionally, a lot of people are attached to their 'main'. so not allowing increased skilling speed for new accounts directly harms new players joining eve (while does nothing for veterans, who already have a main and can just purchase on the character market a high sp alt).so please csm, introduce to ccp that there should be increased training speed in the mt store."
7/21/2011,counter-proposal: drink bleach.
7/21/2011,no.
7/21/2011,"i laughed out loud, was that bad? op, you idea is based on the false assumption regarding catching up.not supported."
7/21/2011,"i know you're just trolling, but for good measure:eve is a game based entirely on progression. sp, isk, relationships, etc. all things you build up over time.it is right and proper that new players forever lag behind veteran players in several ways. every measure taken against this concept is a denial of the very reason people play eve."
7/21/2011,biomass your characters and never come back.
7/21/2011,"i agree in part with the op. i know a lot also that never started up eve cause of the sp gap. got a lot of other mmo's that have double xp ideas in place to help out with just that. vets still will be vets, can't buy real experience in how to play the games, items you have gathered thoughout the years etc. but i think it should be geared more towards middle of the run players. ones that know what they are doing and just waiting for skills to finish so they can get into that new shinny ship or just to be able to use the one they got better. someone playing the game for a few months into a carrier or such is just crazy. but as more and more vets leave the game, is the ones that have been playing only a few years that will be the future of eve."
7/21/2011,"once upon a time, i joined the game and flew with players who had 10x my sp. i thought ""i'll never catch up..."" then i focused on attaining specific goals for myself ""fly this ship"" ""use the t2 version of that"" ""max that skill"" and suddenly i wasn't worried about it. now, i hear people say ""i'll never catch up to you"" and i chuckle a little, then help them set goals for themselves like a good corpmate/alliancemate/friend."
7/21/2011,"the old ""specialize"" your training arguement again. sure at first it is very good to specialize your training to even be somewhat useful in any corp / alliance. but one thing the bitter vets always will have is non specialize training, for how many ships they can fly, fit them all well and be very useful in any corp / alliance. i've been ridiculed in prior corps / alliances for the lack of ships i can fly and how i can fit them. a lot of others have to and to be frank, a lot are tired of it and i know some that have quit the game over it cause of the sp gap. or others that will never start playing eve cause of it. so a few bitter vets will quit if ccp ever does something like this, but would probably get more new players and retain others out of it. i say good, and wave to the bitter vets as they leave."
7/21/2011,wouldn't really improve mining as an occupation though
7/21/2011,"jeez, just listen to yourself.""i want a pos i can anchor at a deep safe, which acts like a deadspace pocket, and which i can put a stealth emitter array (or similar) on, making it nigh on impossible to get a lock on, with more ehp."" that won't unbalance the game and make the current crop of warp-to-safe-and-cloak bots even safer, nor will it unbalance the risk/reward structure of sov space because its now impossible to blow up people's candy or even begin a siege because you can anchor this somewhere that they can't detect except perhaps mid-warp with a lucky stab of the d-scan. this is seriously the most idiotic proposal i have seen.you say finding an available moon in hisec is not an easy thing. well, neither is finding an empty tech moon either. tough cookies; eve isn't set up such that everyone gets an equal opportunity at getting everything. without resource allocation inequalities we would not have conflict, and this includes highsec moon jousting. if you want a moon in a system, just dec the guys with the offline one and hire mercs. the last thing we need is bigger, tougher poss. take wormhole space, notably the low-end systems which cannot get cap ship transits. fumigating systems of their human rats and poss is hard enough as it is. this type of pos would result in people being able to camp unrestricted in basically invulnerable unscannable deathstar poss without even the clue of showing up in local to tip someone off that players may inhabit the system. yeah, fantastic idea."
7/21/2011,"this is an internet spaceship game, focus on internet spa......wait, did you say boobie physics?+1"
7/21/2011,why doesn't this surprise me.
7/21/2011,"um no. your argument as quoted was defeated. now youre retracting and arguing the proposal as a whole.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------i thought it was pretty obvious that i didnt need to point out that you better get your message straight:is that a ball in your hands? why yes, it is! whatever, im obviously arguing as the defense here-----------------------------------------------------------------------------finally after cutting through all the flourishes and we arrive at the single actual line of your post: then dedicate yourself to get rid of character transfers. it is a fact that name changing is an alternative to the character transfers where it is impossible to spot a name in a list. name changing isnt making more disreputable people out of air, but channeling the existing ones to a system where their identity is accountable. does that agrument sound familiar? oh yeah, because ive argued it before (pass!) and you went"
7/21/2011,"i went '...' because i didn't think that you could miss such an obvious fact, and any further explanation would be superfluous. also i don't like to repeat myself. but i'll make an exception here.yes. we were here before, and you simply refused to accept that as you have just agreed that character transfer is 'bad' then why make it easier for people to farm and sell alts. no name change keeps the number of people doing that down.the logic you can't seem to accept is this:-character transfers == escaping reputation (you seem to understand this)-name changing == more character transfers (you seem not to understand this logic, why?)i will spell it out to you again.why would you or joe smith hesitate to buy a character today?1) he doesn't want to be called ""mrs. pms"", it's just too silly.2) he worries that even if he was okay with the name, ""mrs. pms"" may have a bad rep that he may inherit.so you take those 2 things away with name changes and you get more character transfers.get it?"
7/21/2011,as long as there's name history on character sheet and api it's okay if you can change name for plex/aurum whatever jew gold it is.it matters very little on battlefield who is who. just pew pew.
7/21/2011,"i support the idea of a khanid bs with missiles, in the very least. it does make sense since the khanid ships are missile boats, as pointed out by the op. suggesting it be a khanid navy apoc with 8 torps is disingenuous in the least (besides, thats called a golem); the op as far as i'm aware is saying if ccp releases more ship variations in this class, the amarr bs variation would preferably be a missile boat. the difficulty is in providing a solution that is more than just a phallic raven and doesn't outmatch the cnr or golem. eg, khanid bs8 high slots: 5 launchers, 5 turret (aka minimum 2 utility)5 mids6 lows5% bonus to cruise/torp missile damage, 5% capacitor recharge bonusthis would create essentially a bs with comparable dps to a raven (given the ability to jam more bcu's in the lows) and the ability to either mwd around (cap bonus) or fit an effective armour tank. just an idea."
7/21/2011,"i never talk about gallente ships. it's about amarr&caldari !a gallente missile boat is a silly idea.ah, thanks.i'm looking for inputs from khanid/pewpewcaldari pilots, i know they are rare and hunted and mocked, but maybe we could cry a bit together :)"
7/21/2011,"only gallente firgs can use drones?don't forget the heron.also, missiles are a secondary for gallente. if some of its ships use a different type of weapon besdes the primary, it becomes secondary.--> tristan, celestis, nemesis, lachesis"
7/21/2011,"me too, i like to post in a thread without reading it."
7/21/2011,"well, i don't think ccp will introduce any new ships. best shot for a khanid battleship could be to turn the redeemer into a khanid ship.et voila, khanid bb, without the danger to create an overpowered beast like an 8-torp double damage bonus abbadon.as for black amarr hulls with hybrid guns. there are the eom ships. iirc they are shield tanked, too. there you have your amarr/caldari crossbreed with hybrid bonus. (but why would you want a crappy hybrid ship, if you can get a tachyon boat with marauder layout, shield tank and godly tracking bonus ?)but one thing would be nice: removal of the crappy split weapons on merlin. four turrets pls. oh yeah, and caldari turret dread would be great, too. (for whatever they are good in this day and age)"
7/21/2011,"oh, they will not. they still must do these t3 ""freg/bs/whatever"" and the tornado. and patch the game. and balancing.it's not that i made this thread to discuss what could be these new ships. i just want to be heard, and i'm sure i'm not the only one.i'm a caldari hybrid pilot, i fly my ferox and my rokh with t2 mods, i could use a tengu or an eagle but... no sorry. the only thing left for me is to skill up to the vulture, and large railgun specialization lvl5. with only 7 months of sp. nice catch. :pccp would say : ""but you must skill for it and build'em ! c'mon kid look at these ! it's p i r a t e ships with long range ! c'mon it's awesome ! ""i want one ! small hybrids (at least the blasters) are still usable. basically it's a t1 harpy without the +5% dps but +5% shield, it would become the new rifter.but +1 turret slot for the merlin... wow, i really would love that.and a phoenix with more turret slots is making me dizzy"
7/21/2011,24- in work by team bff118- second half of suggestion impleminted.29- jump distance indicated in game not sure if it fullfills the objective of the topic.27- can some one test this one. as all my characters are in wh space i can not test this.111- improvements over what as already been done not possible per ccp.105- in work by team bff.
7/21/2011,"24,105: not removed because no guarantee they will hit game. 118: updated to note partial completion. 27: need someone to check this. 111: source?"
7/21/2011,"gm lelouch1) our goal with the skill queue was to make skill training more manageable for players who cannot find the time to micro-manage their skill training 23/7, especially when it comes to shorter skills which can now be queued up en-masse. we had concerns at the time that a longer skill queue might result in decreased player activity which is the reason for the limitations.2) there are currently plans for this.3) skill training needs to be paused due to the possibility of the character's attributes changing due to implants in either jump clone.4) answered by ccp grayscale here."
7/21/2011,"i can answer as a jump capable pilot: eve currently displays a sphere with the radius equal to your jump range - i.e. encompassing the area you can jump to. however, using the 3d map, and especially in cluttered regions, it is difficult to see which systems - especially at the borders - are still covered in the sphere.a graphical red/green indication would be much clearer. additionally the suggestion offers several improvements, such as fuel consumption per jump. i would like to keep the item.going off on a tagent, what i would *really* love to see would be some kind of a measuring tool, which would allow you to see the distance between systems (both in ly and in jumps) without having to be in one of the systems yourself. i don't see ccp implementing a dotlan-style complex jump planner, but at least a simple yes/no ""can i jump from a to b"" could be easily answered only using the starmap."
7/21/2011,thanks for the answer trying to get some movement on this thread to help the csm out.nda hurting you much trebor.
7/21/2011,get out of high-sec or learn to loot quicker. moar tears indeed.
7/21/2011,"stfu, you don't like our play style, big deal. doesn't change the fact that its broken. and seriously, get rid of the ugly ass pink make up."
7/21/2011,damn this is a hopping post. glad i brought it here via akita's suggestion.
7/21/2011,"this made me laugh, as i just said something very similar in f&i. great minds and all that."
7/21/2011,"great trolls think alike. this is about a mechanics issue. not you should go somewhere else issue. if you have a point to make on topic please do, if not please gtfo."
7/21/2011,"it's not your can or loot, so you need to improve your loot collecting abilities."
7/21/2011,"ok, troll lets try it this way. currently the mechanics say its not my loot. in all honestly its who ever takes the loot, the point of the thread is to allow a mechanics change to all the victim, his corp, and the aggressor to gain rights on the can. i agree if i want loot i should move faster towards the can, that isnt the issue, i want kill rights on people who take loot from the can i created. more death in eve, means a better eve.please give any other reason other than the its not your loot why its not a good idea."
7/21/2011,"don't agree with you = troll amirite? you've still not given a good reason why, you should have any rights on the loot."
7/21/2011,"right, this way you can make sure after a suicide gank, you don't have to stress out beating the scavengers to the loot.which i can fully understand your position, been in that position myself, however the current first come first serve situation is working out just fine.fit tractor beams to your ships, have a dude in a noctis, do something that might require rubbing two brain cells together rather than asking ccp to change mechanics and **** up things more than it is now."
7/21/2011,"you clearly dont understand the thread. ok if you suicide gank, you are dead and you cannot pick up loot for 15 mins, so anyone could grab it and dock in plenty of time. next time read the thread, understand the thread then comment."
7/21/2011,"trolling is saying the same thing over and over again. i should have rights on it for more death and destruction. maybe he steals and i kill him, maybe he steals it and gets away, maybe he steals it i attack him and he kills me. either way more combat."
7/21/2011,"there is already pvp involved with the current loot mechanic. simply saying i should or i want, is not a valid reason why the system should be altered in your favour.maybe if you actually came up with a good argument as to why you should have those rights granted, we wouldn't need to keep asking the same questions."
7/21/2011,i have said good reasons over and over. noob corp loot stealers have no threat. it can be a 3 day old alt that just does that to harrass and follow empire pvpers.
7/21/2011,sup!!
7/21/2011,1
7/21/2011,"1. if an issue is brought up it should be discussed baised on merit not ignorance, or bias.2. this is my main account and i only have 1 toon per account.3. i have been in a couple of corps since coming back from my vacation, and each one has been war deced because people saw us mining, and or in lowbie ships and decided that we where easy targets, so instead of trying to pick a fight with someone who can actually handle them they pick newbie corps to pad thier stats with easy kills. this is not pvp it is griefing. if this isn't an issue to you it is to the new blood that this game needs to keep it from becoming the next star wars galaxies. i can rember a time when ccp proudly displayed the number of active accounts they have on the home page, i haven't seen it there for a while. granted the number of signed in is displayed but that number i am sure is still displayed because it hasn't decreased as much. but if this issue doesn't get fixed swtor is coming soon."
7/21/2011,yes to removal of local from nullsec. nothing i'd enjoy more then a nullsec exit from w-space without local to give me away. then we can just take our abc from the twisted wrecked hulls of nullsec mining bots.
7/21/2011,1) plexes and missions - offer the same amount of loyalty points for both! 2) make it that systems can only be captured by completing a certain amount of both plexes and missions.3) make it that stations in a system cannot be accessed by members of opposing factions.4) add two new factions - sansha's nations and concord. sansha's nation faction can capture systems in all four existing faction areas. if sansha's capture a system it is locked down and all stations inaccessible to anybody exept sansha's faction or characters who have a positive rating with sansha's faction. all sansha's nation members gain an automatic -10 security status upon joining. offer some good new faction mods for loyalty points gained.members of concord faction must have security rating of +4 or higher to join. they cannot hold systems but can help flip sansha occupied systems to their original owners by doing plexes and missions there. also concord are allowed to dock in all stations in faction systems apart from any occupied by sansha's. again they can gain loyalty points with access to new concord faction mods.these simple changes would breath new life into faction warfare imo.
7/21/2011,"how did i feel when i could no longer make choices and tradeoffs with learning skills, and it became a shallower experience with less rewards for long term planning? pretty ****ty. does that please you?"
7/21/2011,no no no no no no no
7/21/2011,"i'd just like to add that one of the nice things about eve, is you can get 90% as effective as those vets in [insert skill here], in 10% of the time it took them to get to max level. so while you may not be able to reach vet's skill levels very fast, you can become competitive in a decent amount of time.it's still not going to be right now, and some skills like cap ships will still take a very long time, but t2 frigates and cruisers, and a whole bunch of other t2 fitting skills taken to level iv are still easily doable in the newbie's second month.in case anyone think vets are somehow unbeatable, i've seen more than one vet get toasted by a newer player with lesser skills. having all that high level polish with every relevant skill taken to five or four makes a difference, yes, but it doesn't make you invulnerable."
7/21/2011,"what i don't get is some in this thread that says, buy sp? nooooo, go buy a toon off the char market. well isn't that buying sp? people get attached to their mains and even some alts. they want to see them progress through the game but also a lot i know hate the sp gap. so if your saying to go buy a toon that has a lot of sp, why not have a way to get more sp for your toon faster. to me, just a bunch of hypocrites that troll these forums."
7/21/2011,"open up the code or make tools for user created content. ie. ships, missions artwork eve has a ton of tallent that would work for free just to make the game better. i searched for this in other topics and was really shocked i couldn't find anything. i'm sure this has been brought up in the past but if it has i think it should be brought up again. just think about the possibilities. just have the devs decidcide on what to release and what not to."
7/21/2011,just think of all the time devs would have to spend making sure people weren't inserting pen15 into that game and moderating content and checking for python scripts!
7/21/2011,true but if they used a tool set like some other games i have played they wouldnt have to worry about some things. i know its a huge labor intensive investment but in the long run it would pay off i think. yes you would need more devs looking over the content but you would need less devs creating content.
7/21/2011,no disscution at all? :(i quite like this idea.
7/21/2011,"supported conditionally.if implemented, it should be implemented as part of a package of changes to missions and/or to pvp that also makes missionrunning fits viable in pvp."
7/21/2011,topic starts @ 2009.10.25just look t how mutch ccp have done so far ..
7/21/2011,"sure, why not?though, i just have fittings saved and load fittings from the list each time, which sort of makes me ambivalent to this."
7/21/2011,its just like the cyno/gate/cloak effect update in apocrypha. here is a selection of posts after seeing the cyno effect.pre-apoc: dude! that is awesome! (from local)post-apoc: lol that was pathetic. (from corp chat)edit: supportz
7/21/2011,it seems they did this to bore miners even more. possibly to make it easier to find the macro users. i support this thread either way.
7/21/2011,arrr
7/21/2011,yo-ho!yo-ho!a pirates life for me! yaaaaaaaaar!
7/21/2011,bump it. support it. love it.
7/21/2011,"roughly estimated 30% or even more of 0.0 systems are empty. there are no players in it.yesterday i was flying around 0.0 and i have seen more then 30 emtpy systems without sov.in between some good systems full with 0.0 players, but statistically 0.0 is empty, as far as i have seen. so go there and be part of it.ccp has messed 0.0 in a bad way so there is really no need to buff highsec anymore."
7/21/2011,"it seems to me majority of players are still in hi sec and will remain so unless hi sec carebearing including industry is going to get hit by serious nerfbat.more isk doesnt make anyone want to go for pvp, it's fundamentally flawed thinking. pvp is cheap, you only need rifter or rupture whatever tech 1 crap shi and you can kill ****. if you can't manage to do even that you are not going to bring out tengu for pvp."
7/21/2011,"so what? i'm not in the business of telling other people what to do and neither should anyone else be. play pvp if you like, it's no affair of mine, but i have noticed a tendency from certain sections of the player base who insist that there is only one true way. if someone wants to ponce around in a tengu in 0.9 or higher, let them. eve is a *game* not a cult or religion. if someone gets a kick out of preying on newbie frigates and blowing them to bits, they may be objectionable and a pain, but that is their right.please stop trying for a one-size-fits-all approach. after all we play eve because, presumably, we like doing so and part of the attraction is the open ended nature of the game. you never know, someone might be a minister of religion in rl but in eve the baddest and worst pirate imaginable, if so, good on them. if the industry in hisec is to be cut down to size as you suggest who's going to provide the ships, ammunition, rigs etc. if 0.0 and nullsec are so seriously disadvantaged as you seem to be suggesting. a lot of 0.0 residents also have alts in hisec in order to provide the material used in the mega fights we keep hearing about."
7/21/2011,"i agree entirely. i don't think that hisec corps/alliances have the motivation to move to 0.0 because of the entrenched positions of the incumbants. and why should they be forced to? eve is, i have always assumed, a sandbox where you can play any way you want. if you are happy roaming around inventing doing pi etc.in hisec why should you be forced to move either to losec or 0.0?what a lot of people in 0.0 seem to be saying is that they want to have their cake and eat it too. have a presence in 0.0 so as to form blobs and knock the living daylights out of other blobs and at the same time keep one foot in hisec so that they can make, and develop the materiel need for the blob fights. i read once that bob, remember them, had a major manufacturing base in alentene, where's that? hisec of course. note this quote here if this is not the most contradictory statement in a long time i do not know what is. of course trolls are always with us and it maybe that this is a glaring example but from what i have seen reported about statements made by csm in their ""fireside chat"" this attitude would appear to be widespread.i'm not going to bang the drum about the attempt i am making to organise some kind of slate of hisec candidiates for the next csm election but if anyone is interested they can contact me ingame."
7/21/2011,"your perfectly right; a high sec player who wants to invent or manufacture shouldn't be forced to go into low/nullsec. but by the same token, a nullsec player who wants to manufacture/invent shouldn't be forced to go to highsec, which at the moment they are.as you point out yourself: did you know, an industrialist in my alliance (that is goonswarm, just so you know, since that seems to be a target of your dislike) pointed out that if every single manufacturing slot in deklein (the 0.0 region we live in), was devoted entirely to the invention and production of t2 ammunition, one full fleet (thats 256 people) could expend the entire production capacity for a full month in just one hour of continuous firing.thats why we in 0.0 are looking to get some parity in 0.0/highsec production. we don't want to take anything away from you. however, if 0.0 is supposed to be about creating empires, it is somewhat ludicrous that we can't even produce our own ammunition, let alone ships, modules, and infrastructure. you say we want to exist in nullsec and 0.0 simultaniously? thats the point, we don't, we want the complete opposite. this char i'm posting with is a purely highsec character (she's my hauler alt to get things i need from highsec). i don't want to have to have this char, but at present i do to get the items i need."
7/21/2011,"can you explain how and why nullsec players are forced to do their research/industry in highsec? then can you tell me why there are so few stations in that region as it seems the capacity is lacking if that many people can and do expend that much ammunition in such a short time frame, assuming it was needed etc.i'd also ask what happens when/if your supply lines/infrastructure/logistics are interrupted/fail/betrayed do you fall into oblivion without the resources you need or do you log on that highsec alt who'll always be there to bail you out? if you go from null imports 80% of their 'goods' to importing 5% then that is taking away from other people who used to be supplying them out there and now don't have those people to trade with. the same is true for things that happen in 00 to other parts of space like moon goo it is a null only good so why should people not in null have to deal with null players to get it, how about some parity there? you can't 'boost' one area without taking something away from another the more you boost it the more you take away. if we go for 'balancing' we are messing with the way these different groups and areas interact with each other and if done enough we ruin it.i tend to think the idea that you could take a handful of supplies and rebuild the 'civilized' world in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a few tools is ludicrous. if the point is to go out into nowhere and have nothing to do with the rest of the game then eve doesn't need to be on one shard and the point of the game is destroyed if there are fewer and fewer ties to different groups of players in different parts of space. the dependencies is what makes the whole single shard universe work and meaningful. there can and may need to be tweaks here and there but to make it so nullsec dwellers can do whatever they want without ever needing to trade with other areas or make use of any other part of space, low, wh, high is stupid."
7/21/2011,"sov nullsec has the ability to increase it's manufacturing capacity. in the time i have lived there i have not seen then exhaust mineral supply or mined out belts. i won't contest the fact of nullsec being dependent on highsec manufacture, but there are ways around it in current game mechanics (pos slots, outposts, upgrades). also, while living in null, one issue i never had was not being able to find an empty manufacturing slot. if current resources aren't being used to their fullest, why should other areas of the game that are using them be punished?"
7/21/2011,"to make it clear, imho i am the most beautiful person here in station, just the way of walking is not like it should be.sometimes i am thinking of just shooting into the mirror. i need a gun."
7/21/2011,"a button forward to regular email would be all i need. i would never touch the evemail window again then.also i do not need the eve ingame browser, i am very happy with firefox. time spended into this apps is wasted.same with eve-voice, i prefer teamspeak.ccp likes to redevelope the wheel again and again instead of bringing us new content for the eve universe."
7/22/2011,"not supported.i love incarna; and i love to see more of it, soon. and fixing old stuff first? sorry to say, but nothing i do is broken, so i'm good. maybe there's some sovereignty sh*t going on in 0.0; but, frankly, i don't care about that. those alliances are mostly botting rmt-ers to begin with; so, far as i'm concerned, none of ccp's extra time should be spent on them anyway."
7/22/2011,this is what i thought incarna would be from the beginning. i was disappointed. that doesn't mean i think it was a bad step. i just think they skipped a lot of the finer details. this is a perfect idea!
7/22/2011,"dear, i was going to let it pass, but if you mustdo you need your argument validated that badly that you wanted to skew the terms? yes, thats why i quoted that particular segment:if people dont care then they wont mind the outcome which is in my favor. and just what do you think politicians do? they debate amongst a controlled number of representation. in other words, i would have an opportunity to reach and educate each person voting. contingent on the terms described above, i would be all for it!"
7/22/2011,"then go for it. put a vote and keep on bumping. i feel confident the solid reasons against this have all been already stated on this thread.my comment on government was to attack your logic that only a irrefutable logical argument can silence you. but i hope you do see that there is no more logic to be argued here. and what do politicians do? yes, i will use your own analogy. the debate is finished. i think politicians have a vote after the debate, i believe . there is no new things to be said. your bump is only an attempt at generating new readers and hopefully (for you) new supporters.both of which can be better achieved by you posting a vote thread, which, incidentally, was my suggestion 2 posts back.(we are now entering meta-debate, so i think i don't need to say anything more)"
7/22/2011,why kill a mosquito with a rocket launcher?the solution to your problem is for new hairstyles to be added. simple.(and perhaps coming soon to a nex near you! )
7/22/2011,"agree with you on most points.though you mistake my wish, i just want to see facts of this nerfbat that gallente got hit with. not just rely on anecdotal evidences. as mine and your opinion on ships both can differ given our experiences in the game, so can the opinions of people who each think that it's not balanced.so what was the thing that ccp that nerf'd gallente, and only gallente?i'm just wary that this is an endless cycle, if taken overboard. and we will all be here in 1 years time crying ""rebalance amarr"" next.i'm for rebalancing. but also use of caution in doing so.besides just because nobody calls for a proteus, doesn't necessarily mean that a proteus can't whoop a tengu's nose if fitted for it. the capability of the ship has a lot to do with the fitter, and this is really just an argument for maxxed out lvl5 optimal dps&ehp fit vs optimal lvl5 dps&ehp fit right? i also think its possible that fcs don't call for certain ships because they favour certain tactics that they know. differences may demand them to adapt and do something different. for example, the very fact that gallent bcs aren't that popular means that they are cheaper. so from certain perspectives for a isk tight gang, being gallente pilots could mean they spend less isk for their warchest. these are just some potential positive effects that differentiation gives us. it's not always good to think of optimal lvl5 toe to toe shoot out comparisons in a 'real' economy like eve. another thing to consider is that although matari ships rule in spec comparisons, traning a good matari pilot takes much longer than an equivalent gallentean or caldari. they have to train projectiles, armor tanking and shield tanking, and missles. other races, especially amarr have much less places to spread their sp to be proficient in a wide range of ships.dear me... but i digress."
7/22/2011,"that is not really true. you can fit next to any ships fitted with missiles wit neuts to. amarr and caldari both have pure turret and missile ships and some hulls that need tank cross skilling to be effective(at scorp, shield harbinger / curse etc.).gallente are just as much as a split st/at race as minmatar today and also require high sp amounts in lots of combat related(drones, guns) as well as in support categories(tank, speed, cap) to work."
7/22/2011,"gallente ships originally fielded drones much like carriers do - extra drone per level. the server couldn't keep up with it so that's why there's a hard limit of 5 drones per sub-capital ship. drone hp and dps got buffed to compensate, but this was way before my time so i'm unsure of the specifics.blasters got nerfed by way of two things. first, 'nanoing' ships was nerfed, again unsure of the specifics due to it being in eve's age of antiquity. this meant that you could no longer out fit a heavily armored gallente ship in such a way whereby it could still dictate range and disengage. then again you could get ridiculous things like a 1200m/s dominix... blasters were also hard hit by the web nerf. look at a vindicator or vigilant to see the only effective web/blaster ships for reference.gallente ships were hard-hit by the ability of warp scrams to shut down microwarp drives. this means that within 10k - incidentally the range of the primary gallente weapons system - the ship once again can't dictate range.gallente ships were hit bad by the explosive hole - i'm lead to believe at once point armor had low thermal resistance instead of explosive resistance. hybrids no longer do 'good' damage.i'm sure someone who has been here since ""the beginning"" can expand upon these points/verify them and offer up new ones, but these are the ones i've heard about. nobody calls for a proteus because it isn't a good ship. it's most effective role is as an armor brick mini-megathron or as a cloaky u-boat. it is nerfed on drones, it is crippled by railguns and who in their right mind would take a 1.5bln isk ship into scram range???? the fits are simply too situational to offer any kind of tactical flexibility and it makes too much of a juicy target to bother taking on roams. it's e-war fit suffers from the idiotic state of gallente e-war bonuses (bonus to jammers, wot?) that won't stack properly.that is an incredibly weak argument when you're talking about a difference of 1-3mln isk, tops. either way, the isk doesn't matter as much as the fact that you can't get on killmails and you're more likely to die. by the time you are using these ships on roams, chances are you don't want to spend 20m buying modules and parts then burning through 20 gates to catch up to where the action is. better to just bring a useful ship which fits with the fc's tactical doctrine.gallente are out in fleet fights for much the same reasons... the only ship that is ever called for is a lachesis and it's a distance second to a huginn anyhow.the gallente pilot has to train everything the matari pilot does, with the caveat that hybrid skills are so useless most train projectiles anyway and fit them (unbonused) onto gallente hulls. then there's the necessity of near-perfect support skills so your ship won't cap out, or drone skills to take advantage of the droneboats. the sp cost is massive for very little gain."
7/22/2011,"my first training was gallente, but i wanted to pvp, so i cross-trained amarr. zealot is a great ship, i prefer pilgrim to arazu and curse to lachesis. harbinger over myrmidon, apoc over mega, abaddon over hyperion. and personally i prefer amarr caps over gallente caps. players who fly amarr do very well, thankyou. good fc's are good fc's because they know the capabilities of they ships they want in a fleet and the capabilities of the ships they might face. if a player doesn't know how to best use a myrmidon, he's not an fc more than once. fc's have one simple rule when calling a fleet- ""i want the best combination of dps, logistics and support i can possibly field- leave your megathrons at home."" i actually had respect for your arguments until you said this. seriously? it's an advantage to have a ****ty ship beacuse it's cheaper than a good one? it make's financial sense? i can only shake my head. it reminds me of when canadian soldiers were deployed to afghanistan in their forest camo because the government of the day wouldn't buy desert camo. ""it tricks the eye,"" they said. one of the good gallente ships is the ishtar, but for it to be any more than a mission runner it needs to be shield tanked, therefore a gallente pvper trains shield. myrmidon, dominix and ishtar are all drone boats- exclusively. gallente need to train drones, but not just drones because the diemost, brutix and mega are all hybrid platforms, gallente must train hybrid with the same support skills required by matar. matar need to only train projectiles, and don't jump in with missile boats- each race has one or two of them, except the caldari- they have mostly missile boats with one or 2 hybrid platforms."
7/22/2011,"+1 for removing nasty aur, at least from the balance pop-up."
7/22/2011,"the issue is that most stay for a week or two and never convert from the trial account and never stick around long enough to start being involved.additionally, skills plays a huge role for the semi-solo highsec carebear which a lot of players are. these are important people for making the economy work/etc, even if they don't do much with the interesting parts of the game. and it is from these that some of the itnreesting people come."
7/22/2011,"you seem to be thinking along my lines:neural remaps for plexand the rationale is sound. so, yes, supported.edit: and expounding a bit on the rationale in full: the gist of it."
7/22/2011,"nah, you see you set goals, planned ahead, thought long term (long term in eve being mere months, not years). this is beyond people like the op. because they fail at eve they insist on everyone being able to cheat."
7/22/2011,reported for sticky
7/22/2011,"we already have the option to buy skill points basically by buying a higher trained character.if anything its not the skill point time that drives new players from the game. its griefing and the lack of options when your first starting out.we need instead of speeding up the skill training or allowing folks to buy skill points better tutorials for the new players that help them learn the different aspects of the game. including remapping, overview settings, and pvp. better warnings in the tutorials on how to avoid or minimize getting griefed ect, and most importantly more things for the new players to get involved in. more missions like the sisters of eve epic arc, more dynamic missions that help teach and guide new players on skill plans and help them find what they enjoy in the game. more things that allow the new players to go out with lets say an npc fleet to get used to fleet mechanics ect.rather then try to fix something by breaking something else lets improve the game and fix it at the same time. all the above adds to the game, will help improve the new players experience and actually get them going on something they enjoy and hopefully keep them in the game."
7/22/2011,rofli shot coffee out of my nose there.
7/22/2011,"uh, please op, do us all a favor and search the forum and read the related topics before you start yaspc thread.i hate repeating myself, so i'm not going to say again all the reasons why the proponents of this line of reasoning is wrong, illogical, amounting to 'cheatcode' console gamer logic. search and read the other threads on this topic to read the arguments that have already been said.instead, i will add my obligatory 1 comment for this yaspc. the sp system in eve works because it keeps the game fun for everyone; those who only play casually are not at a severe disadvantage to those who are hardcore live in parents basement gamers who can play 23/7. in other games those who hack more sheep or spend more time training get better faster. this is fine for those 'other mmos'. not for eve. eve has lasted 8+ years because of its unique -never reach a level max/cap- way of handling xp in the sp system.those new players that eve loses because they can't get with this program, or learn to have fun without 'maxxing out skills' first should go away and play something else**, we really don't want you here. new eden would be just fine without you.*yet another skillpoint cheat**i hear star wars old republic is out!!"
7/22/2011,"as much as i never thought i'd feel this way about this subject, i'm kind of on the fence about it lately. the op does have a valid point. my first break from eve was in part due to this very thing...i felt i could never catch up with those who started earlier. i oppose the idea that it should be no big deal to speed up your training, but what if there were consequences? what if there was a booster that would do it for a short period of time, but had the possibility to bring severe consequences of some sort (maybe there could be a chance based side-effect that by taking it you would lose a skill level or two on a random skill instead of it working as intended)? or maybe you could only use such a booster once or twice a year, to dire consequences of some kind if you tried more often? i feel that offering a slight boost to skill training speed via methods like the above might not be as game breaking as some think. and i feel it would at least offer a glimmer of hope that even though you've not been playing 8 years, you're not entirely locked out of the race to the top (though it will cost you a lot of aur and some risk to be able to take advantage of this).just some crazy thoughts..."
7/22/2011,"but the problem wasn't that you couldn't catch up, it was your mistaken perception that there was an issue in the first place."
7/22/2011,"i never thought that it was a deal breaker...as i said, it was only a part of why i took a break. still, i feel that the skill system is genius, but not perfect, primarily because of this issue."
7/22/2011,"ok, for all those who are worried about ""catching up"" answer me this question:how many skill points does it require to be an ace assault frigate pilot with max weapon, tackle and tank skills?i'll give you a hint:exactly the same number as anyone else with the same skills, regardless of when they started playing.and that is the beauty of the eve skill system. you can catch up, just not in the way you're thinking about it. you view the total number of skill points like it's some kind of magical talisman, when, in relaity, at any given time, 75 - 80% of that number is completely useless.consider this:if i'm flying an amarrian freighter, the 8 million skill points i have in gunnerythe 5 million in missilesthe million or so in t3 subsystemsthe millions in caldari and minmatar, not to mention capital shipsthe millions in dronesall of those arecompletelytotallyutterlyuseless.just like everyone else.more skill points give your character more options and that's all."
7/22/2011,"it is definitely perception. and it is some reality. for a new player to have the same opportunities as me, they would have to buy a ton of accounts and wait months or would have to buy a new character.and i am not suggesting that people can 'buy' a ton of sp. just that they can 'accelerate' it for the first year. i am not threatening your 100m sp characters.whether that is by the accelerator (which already exists for new characters) or by remaps.note that it has nothing to do with me. i have multiple characters over 40m sp and have run out of things interesting to train on a number of characters.i would have no intention of using this myself. it would just be to help new players."
7/22/2011,"the issue is not a matter of skill points, its a matter of having things for new players to do while they wait for there skills to train that makes the game fun and exciting for them. already a new player gets two remaps when they are first starting out and this helps speed there training up a lot already. specialize in something remap to match it to be useful, then remap and plan a training plan for the next year. what you ask for is already in place for new players with that two remaps a year. secondly speeding it up anymore will actually hurt the game far more then it would help. when you start making it easier what happens is you get a bunch of insta gratification players. slowly but surly they take over the game and it changes from being something challenging to do, to super easy with no actual work or player skill to accomplish anything. after that the game dies as folks get bored with it and leave. much like a few other mmo's that have died out."
7/22/2011,"./agree ./signed ./supported. it's up to the eve community to stop all things that will break/ruin the sand box and if you don't like it ""here is the door""."
7/22/2011,"i'm proposing granting corporations the ability to own and maintain capital ships as a corporation vehicle. here is a list of changes that would go along with my proposal:members with the role to purchase corporation goods could purchase capital ships for the corporationcorporation ships could be handled by authorized pilots via a flight contractwhen the flight contract ends, the pilot will lose access to the capital shipthe flight contract can include collateral to help ensure a pilot returns the ship to the proper locationthis way, if you don't have the right pilots online, you might be able to get backup pilots more easily. (depending on how much you trust them)"
7/22/2011,which has been resolved already:get it?
7/22/2011,"i start a new character, change the name immediately to mr.badguy. farm, make sp, make enemies. sell the character. it reverts to the original clean name. but you thought of that already right? you probably just forgot to cover that case.and you mildly brushed off the main reason against you, which is how it will make fcs job and local scanning suck. (no, please don't rehash the aka alias again without some miraculous retrofitting that addresses this) and yes, you have to address this problem, not skirt around it, or make it seem like its not really that bad of a problem. if you want to debate whether its that big of a deal, only a consensus vote can vindicate you."
7/22/2011,"well, i can understand your pain. my first ever battleship was a rokh. and i used to love harpy and vulture. i've got max skills (ah well, minus drone skills) with all of them. siege warfare spec 5 and all that useless crap. truth is i get better results flying minmatar or amarr ships. now of course i would kill for a 7-turret ferox and vulture, or an ishukone (or better yet mordus') scorp. (boxy-ship-with-gray-camo-fetish)the mordus scorp is my wet dream. scorpion + gray camo + marauder layout + hybrid damage bonus + resistance bonus and enough midslots for full tackle. now of course that won't ever happen... would even skill up frog ships for that."
7/22/2011,"would you marry me ? :3the scorpion hull could indeed be an amazing turretboat, like the npc gurista scorpion. sadly they made the navy scorp a navy raven-bis. mordu rokh -now we're talking-."
7/22/2011,"for all the time and effort gone into the new turret system, it would have been nice to have battleship turrets easier to spot... in relation to the size of the ship...it's not an urgent issue and i suppose it's probably an art dpt thing, but their far too small!"

7/22/2011,"the fact of the matter is, you already got a kill, be it from a wardec or can flipping or how ever it is you got the kill. more combat is not a good enough reason to change it. there is a ton of combat in the game as is. new players in high sec have plenty of risk as is. sooner or later your going to probably kill them. there are plenty of ways to track it without adding in what your asking for.provide some valid reasons why this should change other then more pew pew. we want actual factual reasons other then he stole my loots and i want to kill him crying."

7/22/2011,"which is wrong, they are flagged to the dead guy (who owns the can) and his corp.no, what you are asking for is 'stealing without recourse' but in your favour. under some misguided self entitlement argument.but here's a thought. lying about the current mechanics over and over, doesn't this make you a troll by your own definition?"
7/22/2011,its not stealing if its a war. well atleast it shouldnt be.
7/22/2011,waiting to see how badly it goes for me.
7/22/2011,"ok. ""loot""boxing title belt match. one boxer wins, fan runs into the ring takes ""belt"" runs away, what exactly do you think the boxer is going to do? he is going to beat the guy down.war. country invades another country, the invading country wins gets to have its way with the ""spoils of war"". if another country tries to step in, they either fight and the invaders and win or die to stop the ""spoils of war' being taken.business. a corporate take over happens. company a does a hostile take over of company b. during the company c illegally trys to steal ""assets"" of company b after the hostile take over takes place. company a and c now have a legal dispute and take it to the courts to decide.animal kingdom, lion kills a ""antelope"" a hyena wants to eat the ""antelope"". hyena comes in to get some taste meat, the lion splits his skull and now has two meals.in your eve universe currentlly what is allow is...the fan who stole the ""belt"" is now the heavy weight champion.the thrid party country who came in got the ""spoils of war"" while protected by the un.company c gets a stern talking to but is encouraged to continue to steal since there is no real action that can be taken against them.the lion doesnt get to eat, dies, no more lions. hyena poplulation swells to the point they starve out due to there not being any lions to kill their food for them."
7/22/2011,"it must be a new forum record, for the most fail rl analogies in one thread.congrats."
7/22/2011,"wow, seriously?first off the belt is not owned by either boxer it is owned by the boxing commission and it is loaned to the winner of the fight till he looses a title match to another boxer, at that point it is loaned to the new champ. secondly the fan who steals the belt and gets away is going to be charged with theft by the boxing commission. if the boxer that wins beats him down then the boxer is going to be charged with assault and punished accordingly.to put all this in game terms for you.you fight another player and win, on your way to go grab the loot some newb pops in and steals it from the wreck, btw it is not your wreck it belongs to the person you just killed. if you attack the newb concord comes in and blasts you outa space for assault. much like the police would do to the boxer if he attacked the fan. the owner of the wreck now has kill rights on the thief, much like the boxing commission would have rights to press theft charges against the fan for stealing that belt.you fail to provide a reason why the loot belongs to you at all, and you fail to provide valid reasons to why you should be able to shoot them.look at your options to be able to retaliate against them and you will see that you have options, put them on your watch list, declare war against there corp, suicide gank them. move down to low or null sec and live where you can protect the wrecks of folks you kill so that you can loot them."
7/22/2011,"wrong the fighter gets to keep the belt, he loses the title."
7/22/2011,lol i like how they are fail since you cannot dispute them.
7/22/2011,"dispute rl analogies to a game of internet spaceships, yea i'll get right on it."
7/22/2011,"no,it has been presented in a intellectually dishonest, ignorant,self centered point of view. congratulations....and? and christ stop using ""toon"" if you want to be taken seriously. i am in a one man corp, so what. learn what griefing is, apparently you have no clue as it pertains to this game.really? this has been this way from the start and eve has not died, but has grown."
7/22/2011,"newsflash... issues only have merit if people give it merit. if people believe it does not have this, either due to ignorance or bias, then it will not have any (it works like this in rl too... you think people become friends or hire you for a job based on merit alone?).you are posting on a forum, open for all players to see, and presenting that a change is needed. you need to convince us. not according to ccp. unless someone (or a group of people) actively hunts you down over a prolonged period of time and follows you no matter where you go in the game for no other reason than ""just because,"" they are not ""griefing.""no... you are at war. stop being a victim, get into cheap t1 frigates/cruisers with a bunch of friends, and take the fight to them.not every game is for every person. some people like the cutthroat ""you-are-never-safe-anywhere"" ethos of eve, some prefer a more chill, laid back, consensual atmosphere where they can be left alone and unmolested unless, and only unless, they voluntarily choose otherwise. to each their own. the problems start when people from one group or the other venture into the others' ""territory"" and then claim ""things need to change because my type of people want enjoyment too."" and it just doesn't work like that because the two ideas (""cutthroat"" vs. ""consensual only"") are more or less mutually exclusive."
7/22/2011,"this goes too far, essentially getting rid of war decs altogether. it would prevent, for example, a pve missioning corp from declaring war on an opposing corp of regular ninja salvagers.good idea, but more than double for wars against a non-allied corp, say 20m/week.it already works this way (sort of), at least when the aggressor is losing. aggressors who attack a 'carebear' corp/alliance looking for easy kills, but end up losing ships instead, almost always let the war expire, or better yet retract it asap. the end that needs fixing is when the defending corp is losing; as it stands the war can drag on forever, no matter how much the defenders lose. you can pay ransom to the aggressors to leave you alone, but when word gets out that you paid up, a flurry of new dec'ers will likely pounce on you. worse yet, the original aggressor could break his word and keep the war going, even after you pay.your proposal is a sort of enforceable war ransom system, which is interesting. that kind of idea might work, if it somehow deters new aggressors from jumping on a target after they pay. maybe a corp that pays ransom costs more to attack, for a certain period of time."
7/22/2011,"this is a non-issue and does not have merit. i am not biased. i am in an industry-focused corp. war decs are core to preventing eve from being hello kitty online or worse, wow."
7/22/2011,i agree you shouldn't be able to leave alliance or corp while in war
7/22/2011,ugh...roleplayers are the worst

7/22/2011,"1) plex's are generally a lot easier than missions, doubt they would ever consider giving the same lp's for both. but some lp's would be good in line with how much easier plex's are.2) good idea. would need to change how missions are generated. would be a pain having to hope the mission is in the right system. may be we could have plex's with mission style objectives. you warp in and get a message what to do.3) oooo nasty. be pretty bad if you lost your system when it was your base with all your stuffz. however, might be too 0.0'y for ccp.4) again maybe too close to incursions to do right now? but when they move on away from incursions, might be a good way to ""put it to bed"". sansha are pushed to a low-sec area next to concord space. sansha vs concord fw continues long after eve has moved on.i agree with you something needs to be done. there are not enough corps who want care-free pvp to keep fw at the level it needs.your ideas about making rewards for plexing worthwhile are right.cash and lp rewards for plexing. how about system wide bonuses and in-station benifits if your faction own the system? the control bunker acts as a warfare linked commandship giving you bonus'. prices at the station for repairs etc are reduced 10%. pos's in system require 10% less fuel and........ the gate and station guns work for you! may be that last one is a step too far. how about alliances in fw?however, i'm sure many of these ideas were put to ccp at the round-table discussion on the subject at fanfest...... what? ccp forgot to send anyone to it? oh......"
7/22/2011,isn't that csms job? facilitate communication between ccp and the players?
7/22/2011,"1. the way it works is, you grind complexes and get tags. someone else grinds missions and gets lp's. if you want to create, say, a faction item, you need lp's and tags and a blank to cook it. therefore, you need people doing complexes and missions to make stuffs. what you propose would upset this dynamic, and people would drift more towards fw complexes because they'd get their cake and eat it too.2. this has merit, but the last thing we need is to make fw more complex. 3. what's next, gate guns shoot at opposing factions? 4. more factions sounds ok, but i don't know sansha/concord would be the way to go. for a start, you'd need hisec and lowsec areas held by sansha in order to have this work, or you'd just end up out in stain getting vaped by pl supercap fleets. maybe throwing open conflicts between serpentis/gallente or khanid/blood would mix it up a bit in the peripheral lowsec areas - and especially in khanid as there's not much life in derelik or khanid regions right now."
7/22/2011,"1. farmville in space.2. need to revamp mission system to allow for targeted assaults. good idea though (which is why missions also play a part in my vision).3. never going to happen, ccp doesn't like the idea of arbitrary restrictions. also leaves you with a rather big explanation problem in regards to multinationals bending over for rag-tag militia's.best you can probably hope for is denial of service for hostile members.4. screw sansha and double that for concord. bloods, serps and guristas are all a lot more interesting rp wise .. rp is the reason you added it right (don't bother answering, i know its only for lp whoring purposes).the potential for a pirate expansion to fw is one of the reasons why i want it revamped, adding them now when it is broken as hell does no good.one out of four. on par for fw threads, guess that is ok .. par is pretty low though so doesn't mean much but 'meh'"
7/22/2011,"1) some lp for plexes would be nice but no where near the amount you get from missions.2) mission are finished in 2-3 mins, there would be no time to counter them.3) i like this idea but with one change, if you already own an office in the station you can always dock there - you're paying for the docking rights too. may get more militia to start basing in low sec to defend system/areas.4) other pirates, not sansha or concord. spread the love around to others.my 3 ideas...a) nice and simple, remove all navy npcs from plexs. you'd have more pvp as people would be more willing to fight 1v1 in them instead of waiting 5-10 mins trying to get support that can tank the navy while rest fight. (no one like going into caldari plexs just to get ecmd all the time and die. rp wise - navy needed in high sec due to incursions so down to militia to carry on the war.b) fix the dt spawning of plexs. since the start of fw it's been a case of if you can't login and plex right after dt then you've lost because the system just won't spawn every completed plex at the next spawn tick. using a) you don't need faction specific plexs like now as no npcs, complete a plex (basically a control timer point behind an accel gate) in black rise it respawns anywhere in black rise right away.again would lead to more pvp as it wouldn't matter what time zone you're in anymore.c) how about when a system goes vulnerable it also becomes cyno jammed? rp- faction's last attempt to hold on to the system. stops none fw players deciding to just hot drop more sc than the total number in a militia fleet in for easy kills. you'd still be able to have caps in there of course, you'd just have to move them in ahead of time."
7/22/2011,actually it was the roleplay aspect. wanted to give pirates a faction to join and obviously a polar opposite is needed to counter them so i though concord would be apropriate. however i'd happily go along the serpentis/guristas route as new factions added to the mix.
7/22/2011,"this has been an issue for years, and unfortunately has not ""always"" been an issue. there was a point in time when it actually worked perfectly then for some reason it got ****ed up.to set anything in the overview you have to ""customize"" it like crazy just to get it to show anything properly. lets say you want to only see people in your fleet and you have [x]pilot is in your fleet, well if he had good standing but you have that unchecked, well then you can't see him in the overview. same thing with wartargets. even if you check [x]pilot is at war with your corporation/alliance. if he met the criteria of something else you have unchecked then they won't show on the overview.i'm sorry but i just want the overview working like it did in the past.p.s don't know if this was brought up before also but i was too lazy to find it and bump it. so heres a new one."

7/22/2011,"ah, because one (imperfect, expensive and unpopular) way (that relies on actual characters being trained at the usual speed and paid for) is already available for silly people who think it's some kind of 'i win button', we should totally destroy eve by allowing selling of sps? gee, i totally see your logic there... (actually i doubt you could even define 'logic')i really - that's your argument? ok, i recommend thinking before you post again. it could help."
7/22/2011,why? lazy? selfish? ignorant? malicious intent towards eve's future? unaware of the fun that comes from actually winning at a game without resorting to cheats?speak up.
7/22/2011,training is time-based; and time is something eve is running out of. simple as that.
7/22/2011,"so lazy?eve is hardly running out of time. it's the only mmo i'm aware off that's been updated so much since launch, with the stated intent of keeping it going and competitive with new games for as long as possible.eve's subscriber and record total concurrent user numbers have done nothing but rise year over year. really - try to have some clue what you're on about, before you post."
7/22/2011,"no one wants to force anyone to do pvp or move to nullsec. the problem is balancing of risk vs reward - or better: effort vs. reward, since there's not much risk in sitting in blob and shooting at primaries in a a ship that is going to be reimbursed by the alliance.people in nullsec have to build an own infrastructure, pay sovbills, upgrade their space and defend it after they conquered it - and for what? to get plexes that are on par with highsec l4s if they happen to hold space with decent trusec or worse if they don't? ridiculous industrialist opportunities compared to highsec? moongoo may be an exception, but the typical grunt wont see much from that.shoot red crosses in absolute safety without ever having made any effort to achieve said safety all day long if you want, but adjust the payout accordingly."
7/22/2011,"rofl, plexing and running sanctums in 0.0 makes way more isk than running lvl 4's.if you only manage to make as much there as in lvl 4's you might want to scratch behind your own ears first.you want people in empire punished financially because they chose to remain there only because you feel punished in your wallet in 0.0but didn't you choose to go there with all consequences?"
7/22/2011,"systems with sanctums are badly nerfed. most system dont have sanctums anymore, you heared about that ?"
7/22/2011,"good luck trying to find sanctums in places like providence. and if you make less money in l4s than in havens, you should check your lp to isk conversion rates.nobody ever mentioned financially punishing anyone. the csm logs and the upcoming 0.0 changes are aimed at buffing nullsecs industrial capabilities so it's not entirely dependent on highsec. as living in highsec doesn't require any effort or coordination at all, income possibilities should reflect that. this can either be acheived by buffing nullsec income or nerfing highsec income, but wasn't matter of debate either in this thread or the csm summit, except for said long overdue buff for nullsec industry.i don't live in nullsec - would be pretty ******ed, given the current income distribution."
7/22/2011,"right on man. got a wife and two kids to feed at home, right? **** playin this game for fun, you got bills to pay!people on both sides of this argument need to get their heads out of their asses. this shouldnt be about bloo bloo my space money! it should be about making every playstyle enjoyable. nullsec is being revamped because current mechanics, esp. sov and scaps, are ****. nobody gives a **** about your anoms. and to the glorious wh whiners on the other end: deal wiz it. you don't need ark in c1 w-space. grow the **** up and get into a big-boy wormhole if you want high-ends and good sites. there was no discussion of removing high-end roids from c4-6, so the serious wh folks are not going to care. just the ******s building carriers in their c1 for no reason."
7/22/2011,"the problem with null sec isn't the game or the mechanics or ccp. its the leadership. they got their sandbox and this is what they made. ccp has tried to straighten some stuff out but that doesn't change the people. if null wants to sort out the problem, they should start by looking in the mirror."
7/22/2011,"the csm meeting minutes actually stated the csm wanted c1-4 abc removed, so no, apparently c4 dwellers are not serious enough for the csm to care about. i even lived in a c3 for a few months. the issue i have is the csm trying to nerf all other play styles into oblivion so that nullsec has a ""fair"" reward for the effort they put forth. and while i agree they are right, between moon mining/abc's/ded 7-10plexs and other null sites/anoms(admittedly nerfed, but not for everyone)/officer spawns/etc, i'd have to think the issues with null aren't fixed by nerfing other areas of the game, but by making the rewards already there more accessible. so what if someone takes a hulk in a c1 2 jumps from jita. is there a grav sig there at the time? how do you think it will fare when a ship with weapons comes through the same hole?c1's are not safe, regardless of the system the entry point is in, this only took me 1 time to learn."
7/22/2011,"agree with op, but in a literal sense we need another forum, a separate forum. what goes on in high sec is the meat and potatoes of this game. we shouldn't even have to talk to those people. those people are annoying and mess with my relaxation time. those people are just awful. i don't know whats wrong with those people. its like their fingers are attached to their butt that they speak out of. yes those people should be in a different game, a whole different server even. banish them to singularity. give those people singularity forum. since isk flows like water for them, playing with 100 isk ships out to be like being on a level playing field for those people. those people could maybe even get monocles for 100 isk. we could also ask for forum features to filter out those people. those people just make noise. they are like children with a new bell. maybe null sec should be the children's section."
7/22/2011,"in retrospect. can you explain why high sec players should be forced to null sec?rofl, there are enough production slots in null sec if the pos setups would also run manufacturing setups propperly.but as it is most pos in null sec are either for jumpbridges, stagingpoints, moonmining and sc and titan building.it's not asif there aren't anymore moons left for other production setups.people moving to null sec knew and know that stationless systems which aren't npc space can have only 1 outpost.people moving to null sec knew and know that the infrastructure of empirespace isn't in place there and most likely won't be in space there.these are facts those moving to nullsec knew and know and yet they complain about it. isn't that a result of a choice?just like it's a result that a high sec player can't find officer spawns, mine moongoo, mine abc's or run sanctums.each side made their choices and now both sides complain about the lack of contents the other side does have. hmmm, one of the most heard quotes in null sec is that you have to be able to defend what you have. if you can't defend it then you shouldn't have it.it's space where the might of the strongest prevails. a fact every null sec resident is aware of or at the very least should be aware of.in high sec it isn't much different with the contant wardecs. corporations being decced by griefer or merc corporations and disrupting the usual gameplay. don't you think such a corporation can survive for a longer period of time without the use of alts?if you can't maintain your supplylines, be it in null sec or in high sec you are doomed to withdraw and rebuild elsewhere. i don't think you give marketeers enough credits. those who can't adapt are forced to other ways. those who can't will perish.isn't that the normal way in eve?as stated previous. you can't 'boost' one area without taking something away from another the more you boost it the more you take away. if we go for 'balancing' we are messing with the way these different groups and areas interact with each other and if done enough we ruin it.i tend to think the idea that you could take a handful of supplies and rebuild the 'civilized' world in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a few tools is ludicrous. if the point is to go out into nowhere and have nothing to do with the rest of the game then eve doesn't need to be on one shard and the point of the game is destroyed if there are fewer and fewer ties to different groups of players in different parts of space. the dependencies is what makes the whole single shard universe work and meaningful. there can and may need to be tweaks here and there but to make it so nullsec dwellers can do whatever they want without ever needing to trade with other areas or make use of any other part of space, low, wh, high is stupid."
7/22/2011,"i'd bet that a full 90% of players who consider 0.0 to be their home have multiple alt-characters sitting in high sec, whether those characters are actively being used or are just sitting around.i'd bet that 100% of new pilots start out in high sec, many of which never even go to 0.0 before moving on to other games - meaning that they haven't experienced enough of eve to say which parts are in the most urgent need of help.not saying that high sec doesn't need help, but using population statistics in a game based around the use of alts, is beyond ridiculous. how about just stating what you feel needs fixing in high sec... often using many different alts?"
7/22/2011,"i have 1 character in null, 3 in low sec, 7 in high sec. my four accounts voted for people who have null sec's best interests at heart, despite an overwhelming number of the characters being in high sec. you will find this is common for most of null sec, so it should come as no shock that though many characters are in high sec, their accounts vote/support null sec issues."
7/22/2011,"perhaps if high sec carebears bothered to vote, they would not be in this pickle.look there have been alot of stuff for carebears in the last few expansions so it's time null sec get's some attention. better luck next year."
7/22/2011,"i never said they should, however listening/reading ccp soundwave in his interviews ccp's general attitude about high sec and reading the may csm minutes i am concerned that is what will happen. ccp using their stick once again to direct players to where they think they should be and play as they think they should play.i surmised as much but the other person made the point that null couldn't create their own goods and the capacity they had was inadequate so i asked why that was seeking to get them to tell me who exactly was stopping/forcing them to not have that ability to show it wasn't a design flaw or not possible. i don't complain when i am in a wh i can't use stargates or run to jita right quick, or in empire that i can't find abc to mine etc. i asked because the other poster said they'd like to not 'need' their high sec alt to get what they need to make the point that they'd 'always' need their alt when things get dark. the only way to never need that alt is to sunder the one universe so the alt can't bring stuff in for them. making it better/easier just does that it won't make it perfect and the idea that you'd never want/need to deal with other parts of the game is stupid as it destroys the point of eve.again if buffs were made to nerf the relationship from high to null there would then be too many producers with too few consumers only if the null boosts were not 'good' enough that the goods from high would still be profitable to lug back there to sell would the trade from high to null continue. general trading would probably still work and be viable to compete with null industry but also with the now tougher production market. producers would perish in this competition, most likely small time and new players w/o the means to survive the drought or haul their crap out to 00/find someone to do so for them.you and i seem to agree on just about everything that was covered, though it seems you have the wrong idea as to where i am coming from"
7/22/2011,"will the next csm actually give a **** about the game as a whole and not just their own personal agenda?from what i have heard and seen, the current one is far to concerned about their own personal agenda and could care less about the game. the only thing they seem to push for is whatever boosts their play style the most and cries out for nerfs to the rest of the game that does not tickle their fancy.it seems like most of the csm is simply nonexistent. they seem to only become active when it's free trip to iceland time. why do the other csm's tolerate this behavior? maybe they don't care either as long as they get their free trip on. it what was the second longest time to deliver basic meeting minutes, i do not see the csm improving on delivery time anytime soon. it is painfully obvious their treasured new technique on conducting such things is not working. do they care enough about the game and the players enough to actually put forth real effort into what they said they would do during all the forum and local spam to be elected?this csm is indeed one of the worst groups put together to represent the players since it's inception. do everyone a favor and start actually doing the job you said you would do or resign as soon as possible. you wanted to be on the football team and prance around with the jersey on, but you don't want to contribute when it comes time to get in the game and do something. the funny thing is your sit on the bench in all the games wondering why no one will come up and ask for your autographs. so pathetic.your current form is an absolute disgrace. essentially your free trips and paid accounts are paid for by us, the players. it is time for you to man up and earn it don't you think, instead of asking for knee jerk nerfs to things you don't understand and telling other players to kill themselves when they don't agree with everything you say."
7/22/2011,i remember your previous post when you suggested that all the characters in eve should be reset to 0 skill points... after that post i have doughts about matters you bring up
7/22/2011,"it seems you are complaining for absolutly nothing and you ran out of arguments to rant on. and the worse part of all is that you started this thread, you are the initiator of this so you should of foreseen ahead this lack of arguments in the first place. shame on you."
7/23/2011,"crowdsourcing has been completed!results have been posted!update: some answers to questions posted here, here, here and here.wabbit season! duck season! wabbit season! duck season! prioritization season!several times a year, the csm enlists the aid of the community in helping us prioritize the issues that csm has raised with ccp. the results of this crowdsourcing effort helps guide the csm's efforts during not only our regular summit meetings, but also the all-important ccp release planning process. this is your chance to tell us which csm issues you think are the most important and deserving of ccp's attention.here's how it works:visit the july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcing wiki page. there you will find a list of about 170 open csm issues.pick the items that you believe are most important, and create a single-line ballot in the following format:<your player name>,pick#1,pick#2,pick#3,pick#4,...,pick#nfor example:bugshunter bunny,1,7,19,24,25,3,99,27,44,57please use commas to separate each entries, and make each entry numeric; after your character name, the only valid characters are digits, commas and (new this time, see below) the minus sign.then post your ballot in this thread.keep in mind:* picks do not need to be any order; each pick is given equal weight.* duplicate picks will be ignored. you may vote once per active account you have, but please don't vote more than once per account (ccp can detect this, but removing these votes is annoying, and the wrath of ccp fallout is a terrible thing).* make sure the name on your ballot matches the name of the character posting, and the ballot is on a line by itself in your post, because that's how we detect and extract the votes. apart from this restriction, please free to discuss the crowdsourcing in the thread.* each ballot is worth 20 points, divided equally between the items selected. no item can get more than 3 points per ballot, so pick at least 7 to ensure all your points are used. in the example above, bugshunter bunny picked 10 items, so each of his selections will receive 2 points. if he picked 40 items, each would receive 1/2 of a point.* based on player feedback on previous prioritizations, this time around you can also vote against items. to do this, just put a ""-"" in front of an item you want to vote against. for example:negativity duck,1,7,19,24,25,3,99,-27,-44,-57in this case, 10 votes are being cast, so each is worth 2 points, but 7 of them will add 2 points and 3 of them will subtract two points. note that casting negative votes makes your positive votes less powerful!* since we will be looking at the results both with and without negative votes, please make sure you pick at least 7 positive vote items to ensure that your votes get full weight when only positive votes are considered.you may wish to consult the august 2010 and november 2010 prioritization results to refresh your memory of the results of that process. you'll see that more than a few of the most popular items on those lists have already been fixed."

7/23/2011,"i think the most important thing as far as getting black ops to be used more is not to buff the ships themselves, but rather to buff the black ops actions which they are designed to be used for.so what i'm saying is, instead of trying to upgrade their stats, there should be changes to gameplay outside of the ships that make using them a much more popular strategy."
7/23/2011,"the only things that black ops need are better tracking (explosion radius,velocity, and torp speed. for the widow.). and covert ops cloak. not so it can jump in and warp undetected. but so it can also warp around the system undetected.we waited in belt so long once, i actually fell asleep! once i finally make contact yes. black ops is adzactly a wtf pawn mobile in 1v1 situations. as well it should be when it cost more than a carrier. but you add a couple more ships and it can quickly become a trophy kill to even the noobest pvp gang. as it is now just bring a buddy to rat in the belt your in, and wait until somone takes the bait. now you have even more mid slots for ecm, and some backup.covert cloak isn't overpowered because of the saftey in numbers philosophy that already neutralizes the black ops today. it just gives the pilot more pvp opportunities. some of which will cost him a billion isk.if you can afford to pvp in that everyday you deserve to. and no a large % of people cannot afford to do it. now where's my blops carrier?!? it could be a regular carrier that can still use drones while cloaked. that's all.oh yeah the compromise could be that the blops could only cloak from 0 to 3/4 warp speed making it scannable withought making it impractical. and as far as jumping in a fleet why not just give it a mass limit like wh's? say enough for a fleet of 6 bombers? or mabe a stealth carrier? hmmm?until then... if you warp in on me ratting ""alone"" in a lach, dont bother calling for backup, don't waste time trying to run. my alts are flying a widow, and a command loki. my lach doubles as a cyno straight to my triage mom fleets teet; and for you it's already way too late."
7/23/2011,in a recent interview. ccp soundwave suggested that they will be repurposing the black ops like they did with the bombers. any hopes and maybe speculation on what they might turn into in the near future?
7/23/2011,"this !ccp, you're doing things that are usually great and all, and thank you for that. but still, it takes you years to change some stats regarded as ""overly stupid"" ! how hard would it be to see that black ops are underused ? then, how hard would it be to change like, 3 or so values and to see what happens ? it's not like eve's going to collapse if you buffed then a bit too much.really, two versions of the bo. that would fix everything. the combat black op for quick ""i'm in ! i'm ganking you and oohh session change timer is done, i killed you, i'm jumping out !""t2 resistancesshield/armor/structure hp according to it's ""combat battleship"" statusabout the same dps as right now (more or less, 1k per ship)more powergrid (+2k on every bos), seriously. the sin have 11000 at max skills, you can't even fit 4 neutron blasters without needing any pwg module. that is awfull.less stupid bonuses (agility, speed ?). in my humble opinion : panther =>battleship bonus : 5% damage, 5% rofbo bonus : 10% bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers, 10% web rangethat would prevent the target from going away. at lvl 5, that would be a 15km web range with t2, and something like 19.5km web range with t2 and overload.redeemer =>battleship bonus : 10% reduction to cap use, 5% rofbo bonus : 20% reduction to neutralizers cap usage, 15% reduction to neutralizers duration.those bonuses would allow fast (reduction to neuts duration :)) neutralization capabilities, but without using too much cap, as capacitor is needed to jump out afterward.sin =>battleship bonus : 5% damage, 10% drone hitpoints and damagebo bonus : 15% bonus to warp scramblers/disruptors range, 10% remote sensor dampeners efficiency.looks like a big arazu with a jump drive. can scramble at 18.9km with t2 and overload.widow => battleship bonus : 10% bonus to missile velocity, 10% bonus to explosion velocity and signature radiusbo bonus : 30% bonus to ecm target jammer strength, and an other one, maybe like target painter bonus ?nothing to say here. except that, with bos being sturdier, less ecmslots will be needed, and that makes room for target painters.and the second version, more like covert gang support, and that means : t2 resistancesactual shield/armor/structure hppoor dps (like, a good cruiser's dps) but good ewar capabilitiesno covert ops cloacking, it's already really difficult to catch.increased jump rangedramatically increased fuel bay capacity (10k. or reduce the fuel needed per ton, that would fix the problem aswell)special command bonuses (maybe create a new set of bonuses, like things that would be usefull to cloacky ships ? scan resolution ? reduced ""delay before locking"" for recon cruisers ?)that would successfully create a ship that can jump and bridge ships for quite a long time, that can jump on the field (covert cyno is 30s, bridge is 20s, so you can actually get on the field right after your covertmates, so you can give them bonuses !also, dps would be so poor that it wouldn't be used as a combat ship (cloacky t3 would be cheaper and would have the same tank/dps)and, just in the end, i would allow this version of the black op battleship to have a fitting service. it doesn't sounds too powerfull to me, since the black op is supposed to be an undercover mobile base of operation for covert gangs.finally, it's all about cost/capabilities. for such an expensive and skill intensive ship, that's what i would want to get in the end."
7/23/2011,"you missed the point on all counts:on voting and the ambivalent: there are always exponentially more reads than replies and since my contingent terms  as you quoted  were to have those reads on my side (since they dont care enough to reply they wont care enough about the outcome either; silence implies consent) i would be guaranteed a meaningless victory. still want to?on the analogy: i have not nor is it physically possible for me to debate with every eve player (debate isnt a one sided read and post but an exchange). as you said, a vote can only be had after a debateyknow, i can be crass too, but i have enough respect for how thoughtfully and level-headed you used to post. as usual, tell me if i missed anything, as in the past you did provide me with valuable insight on how name changing should evolve"
7/23/2011,this is a great idea....a 4 year old never-subbed account has no value to the user that created it or to ccp. let active users take those names and corps.

7/23/2011,supported
7/23/2011,yes
7/23/2011,supporting a popular idea that ccp doesn't give a **** about for the 1000th time
7/23/2011,"at the very least the wallet isk balance should be able to be moved back to the left so the 0 aur amount doesn't take up an extra line of blank space. let's keep this topic on the front page till ccp sorts this silliness out. why they ever thought that much more blank space thanks to the 0 aur would be ok, is beyond me."
7/23/2011,"i see your point, op, but allowing any sort of increased training speed for ""new people"" would ultimately be abused more than it was actually used. furthermore, anyone who quits eve because they don't have enough sp really never took the time to understand this game anyway. it is not at all difficult for a new player to play with the big boys pretty quickly in this game, in fact that is one way in which eve contrasts from almost every other mmo out there (that i've heard of, anyway). in a lot of games, you have to play all the way to the end-game just to be viable to participate in end-game stuff. in eve, training is not linear, but rather branched out. you can train one area pretty well in anywhere from a week to a couple years, depending on the area of focus. and when you're done with that (or before you're done), you can branch out and work toward something else.i think what we should be doing is making sure new pilots are aware of what they can do to join in playing with the veteran community. they need to understand that battleships are not ultimately better than frigates, or that running level 4 missions and/or mining veldspar are not the primary sources of income in this game. once people get past those and other misconceptions like those, they will be much more ready and able to enjoy this great game."
7/23/2011,"indeed. as i've stated in the other irritating sp for mt threads, one of the great things about eve is you can get 90% as good as the vets in a particular skill, in only 10% of the time it took them to max it out.in fact most players i know rarely get tier two and higher skills above level four (at least till they have every other faster training skill they want), so they have more time to branch out, rather than spend ages getting that final 10% improvement.i've only has this particular character for 14 months, yet i can fly every race's bcers, minmatar bs (i fly the typhoon fleet issue which is the most sp dependent t1 bs there is - it requires three weapon systems - drones, projectiles and missiles, and it has a damn tight fit), every race's weapons and ewar are at t1 or better, i have t2 scout drones (and the rest at t1), almost every mod my bs uses at t2, i fly t2 mining exhumers and can fit all highsec t2 crystals, gallente transports and freighters, covert ops cloak, run five r&d agents at once, 10 r&d jobs at once, can have 129 open market orders, social skills are all at iv, exploration skills are good enough i can run any site out there, i can fit +4 implants, fly a noctis at level iv, and there's stuff i'm sure i'm forgetting, as well as stuff i tried but didn't get into.this guy is my high/lowsec/wh generalist. otoh i have some specialist toons that have become extremely good at one job in a fraction of the time it took toovhon to become a highsec jack of all trades.yes you'll never be able to rush your way to flying cap ships in just a couple months. but you can get into t2 frigates and cruisers and be 90% as good as vets in that time. that's leaving aside that t1 ships hardly become useless even at high levels. but back on point - with t2 frigates and cruisers you've heaps of options in 0.0 warfare, and if a mere two months is too long to wait, well - eve is definitely not the game for you."
7/23/2011,"if you want new players to stay, put an alt in the help channels, they need ui help, a friend, an invitation to a corp and usually a friendly ultimatum that they must subscribe to be brought on. its not much more complicated than this. specialization is important in the beginning, early introduction to fleets and pvp even at the frigate level. fleets and ewar are force multipliers that can balance skill points. detract from greed pve isolation with team fleet activities that pay more or are more fun.i think i will use this argument with them if it comes upthanks d, very simple!"
7/23/2011,you can already buy skillpoints herethe people that are too stupid to realize the character bazaar is there to facilitate quicker sps aren't going to do well in eve and quit anyways.
7/23/2011,"already addressed.people are tied to their mains. this is true for everyone. it isn't the number of skill points, it is (for many) who you identify with to begin with.the character bazaar is not some part of the game or something we should defend.and yes, i know and you know that in just 3-4 months the player can have a useful number of skill points for all sorts of things.but what matters is the players perception at 1-4 weeks.and face it, some players want their mains to be the ones doing things.you all are just as bad as those who said that removing learning would kill eve."
7/23/2011,"its not the skill points that are the issue though man, its the fact that most new players when they try the game have no clue what to do. when i started out, i had no clue about focusing my skill training, or how to remap my stats properly.i had a few friends that i met that actually started helping me out and including me in doing things with them. that made the game fun. we as a community need to make the new player experience better by helping them and including them in activities. the game needs to improve on the new player experience by adding things to help them out and provide enjoyment for them while they train as well.mainly its on the community not the game mechanics that will keep or drive players away from the game, and we need to step up to the plate and actively try to keep these players by showing them what is out there in the game and help them with setting up training ques for what they want to do."
7/23/2011,no it does not...people spend lots of time training up chars to sell them...if anything make the character bazzar apart of the arum store....
7/23/2011,"i agree, the ball is not all in ccp's hands at all is it? does anything come to your mind to try to sway others to this point? we have a good amount that try to uphold the cold harsh world idea but its almost exclusive as if treating a noob friendly is a sign of weakness. the schools we have are good but i'm not sure they address the 2 to 4 week hump as well as personal welcoming. i think the shaping we do in the beginning is important too. surprise noob ganking only seems to make them greedy withdrawn pve'ers.i've drifted off topic, perhaps we need a proposal for the players instead of ccp."

7/23/2011,"this would make more sense with supers than basic caps. dreads, however, should be alliance level ships."

7/23/2011,"but a boxing match is between consenting participants. a hauler that gets ganked by a heavily armed battlecruiser is not an opponent in the ring of honour, but more like a mugging victim in a dark alleyway. and the battlecruiser pilot would be the mugger who beats up the victim and then complains when another thief shows up out of nowhere and runs off with the victim's wallet.to use another analogy... let's say that jimmy was playing with his toy car in a nursery, but then he started crying because he remembered that mummy and daddy had been shouting at each other and then he heard the sound of smashing glass, then mummy ran off with blood streaming down her neck and the police came to take daddy away. then sarah shows up and takes his toy car away from him, so he gives sarah a lecture of the theory and ethics of property ownership. then a lion and an antelope appear."

7/23/2011,"not mad in any way. i am suprised at the stupidity of some of the eve community, but not mad at all. dont think two characters that dont do empire warfare and a character that doesnt undock have any idea what i am talking about. its very clear you do not. thank you for your posts clearing up the matter that you dont understand but this is about empire war mechanics.ask yourself with current mechanics is there any way to kill a noob corp loot stealer? noob corp thrashers is 250m from the ship before it pops. it dies, he scoops he warps. he can stay docked for 15mins or return to the field where the can creator is knowing the can creator will kill anyone that can kill him over can the can flag. lets say the victims corp gets in fleet to come kill the noob corp loot stealer. they land on the battlefield and have two targets one that fits guns and is a pvp ship that shoots back or a speed thrasher with salvagers on. which one is attacked. again the thrasher has already dropped off the loot he stole. as stated before, no ""realistic"" threat to them."
7/23/2011,"what you are asking for is the ability to steal and not be stolen from. its part of the risk of being a high sec war dec corp.the loot thief already has to deal with the agro timer for the loot he stole from the owner of the ship and his corp.once again as you can not seem to get this threw your thick skull. the loot does not belong to you, it belongs to the owner of the ship that you killed. as such they get retaliation rights not you.you want to own the loot then go mission, you want to be able to shoot at folks that steals the loot outa a wreck of a player you just killed then get out of high sec. its that simple."
7/23/2011,no
7/23/2011,moar tears please.
7/23/2011,"a wild alt appeared!active repping is ok for solo pvp if you fit the ship right but has inadequate utility outside of 1v1's for the following reasons:*active tankers generally requires multiple repping modules, capacitor injectors, nano pumps and nano membranes to work properly, which makes them vulnerable to alphas and lacking dps. so they are unsuitable for group roams where passive tanked dps ships are superior.*at relies heavily on capacitor boosters which can be used up in a matter of minutes, giving at ships a serious lack of stamina on roams. cap boosters aren't for sale everywhere, but on the other hand most systems have a station with a repair service, which is all passive tanked ships need, or else they can ask their logi for reps. the at's are too logistically intensive.*with the present game mechanics it's logically impossible to balance them anyway. you can't make it so that active tankers can take enough dps to compete in gang fights while still being balanced in 1v1 encounters. that's because armour reps only have two relevant attributes, armour rep amount and time cycle between reps. so here's my attempt at suggesting a fix for armor tanking. firstly compare the gallenge myrmidon battlecruiser with the amarr vengeance frigate. the myrmidon has mediocre resistances meaning that a single active repping module doesn't achieve much at reducing incoming dps, but players fit two or three armour reps on the myrmidon and simply plow through the dps of their opponent. this necessitates the use of double cap injectors, rigs, all low slots dedicated to the active tanking (so no damage modules) and non-racial guns (the ubiquitous autocannons) to save cap and fitting requirements. the active tanking myrmidon ends up as a niche ship with lacklustre dps and low cap-stamina that can certainly grind down individual opponents but isn't much good for anything else. a lot of people just ignore the ship bonuses and shield-tank it.the vengeance on the other hand has great armor resistances which naturally reduce incoming dps. this allows players to fit a small armour repairer to take advantage of that fact and you'll see many vengeance frigates which run active tanks, without all of the hassle a myrmidon has to go through. they can fit damage mods and rigs and don't rely on capacitor boosters. furthermore a vengeance can roam about at will just as well as any passive-tanked frigate. the difference here is that the vengeance is not forced into a niche fit in order to active tank.obviously one is a frigate and one is a battlecruiser and there are many differences in that regard, but i hope people would agree that active tanking ships should be more similar to the vengeance than the myrmidon.that's why i suggest that you should recieve resistance bonuses in addition to repairs. this would obviously need balancing and you could go about that in a variety of ways, you could tweak the ratio of resistances to armour rep, add stacking penalties, increase fitting requirements of armor rep modules. as i pointed out it's presently impossible to balance active tanking between solo and group fights, because all you can do is adjust the amount of raw dps that gets repaired. but what's key here is that you can adjust resistances and armour rep amount.obviously this would increase the durability of active tankers vs multiple opponents, as the increased resistances would tank far more damage than the armour repairing would. against solo players a reduction in armour repair amount per/sec would be needed to balance it out in solo fights (the resistance bonus would have a similar effect to an armour rep bonus anyway). active tanking would not replace passive tanking with nano membranes etc because it's still cap intensive."
7/23/2011,"it would also make active tankers troublesome to kill when they have logi support, giving them much-needed extra durability in fleets. additionally if players were using a single repping module instead of multiple mods their cap boosters would last much longer making them less of a logistical headache on roams. they might also feel more at liberty to fit damage mods like the vengeance does (or an armour plate/extender, obviously they should only be able to fit smaller plates/extenders than passive tankers) which would further increase their utility in fleet fights. the amount of low/mid slots on some ships would need to be revisited.ideally, a certain amount of armor rep amount per/sec would be transferred to armour resistances so that a ship was similar to the way it was before in solo fights, but also better at tanking greater damage in larger battles. for example, i imagine that a hyperion could fit a single large armour repairer to improve it's resistances and then a 1600 plate, so that it was more comparable in fleet durability to a passive-tanked abaddon while not being a copy of it. i think that the upper limit on how much raw dps you can tank should be reduced in solo encounters, which could allow for reducing the cargo space needed to hold cap boosters.of course amarr and caldari already have resistance bonuses on their ships, which are much more useful than the repair bonuses of gallente and some minmatar ships. that's tricky."
7/23/2011,you are comparing a battlecruiser to a frigateyou are comparing a tech i ship to a tech iione of those ships has a resistance bonus.
7/23/2011,"obviously. but i only compare them to try and make the point that i think resistance bonuses might be the way forwards for active tanking. it's an anecdote about the differences in how you fit those ships and sort of sacrifices needed to active tank them, not a serious analysis of a vengeance vs a myrmidon."
7/23/2011,"an active tanked vengeance has an insane tank. it's one of the few things going for it but to suggest this should be a standard for active tanking in general would just make things ludicrous. plates do not provide resists, reps/boosters do not provide resists, either tank style needs to consider use of resist modules and not everything has to be fleet viable.i don't want to sound overly negative about your suggestion but i don't think there is much merit in improving resist profile / active tanking. i do however agree that passive tanks currently offer too much ehp. i wasn't exactly over the moon when ccp buffed ehp across the board since it impacts on solo and small gang guerilla tactics."
7/23/2011,"i think you focusing too much on the vengeance example. i wasn't necessarily suggesting that active tanking ships would all have resistances on par with a vengeance. and just because those things you pointed out don't provide resist bonuses now, does not mean that ccp could not choose to make them provide resists in the future.*ack, spelling"
7/23/2011,there is already an easy answer to this!the 7.5% to rep amount should include incomming repsthere fixed... 5% to resists make internal and external reps better... but 7.5% to internal is only good for internal... so make it so the 7.5% includes incomming reps... presto fixed...
7/23/2011,"you missed the point. my logi shouldn't get gcc when he reps me in a lvl 5 (yes we carebear it up on the side) or someone shouldn't get gcc when they give my gallente fail guns a tracking link boost. so what you're basically saying is that because i'm -10 i should have gate/station guns shoot me 23/7 just because i have outlaw status? you heard the man ccp, make lowsec even emptier."
7/23/2011,"the ship turrets look great!but the icons are terrible...just terrible. i can't tell whats what without hovering my mouse over modules and its been a month or so already.please revert icons, or lighten the contrast on the new ones. dark icons against a dark background...really?"
7/23/2011,the new turrets are awesome.
7/23/2011,"the icons appear to be an afterthought.""hey, let's grab the image for each turret and resize it in ps and use it for the hud icons""this takes an hour or so of work for all the modules, as opposed to have to spend days re-creating the icons. never mind that the original ones were just fine.with the failures seen in the icons, and the problems with cq, and with the dismal quality of nex store items, it seems that the one thing that ccp is really missing right now, is a good graphics artist."
7/23/2011,"well....i don't like the idea of t2 bpo's and would prefer invention for bpc's.the players with the t2 bpo should be compensated accordingly and not just get 100 run copies. but the removal of bpo's would be good for eve today, tomorrow, and 5 years from now.--------no i don't own any t2 bpo's, but i did stay at a holiday inn express last night."
7/23/2011,"@op you just have to learn how to fly a rifter. i know it's a big sp leap for some of us, but it's a worthwhile trick for those of us in mining corporations. (or anyone really, for that matter)"
7/23/2011,"@op: i think your ideas are absurd. but i also think removing abc from wh space is also absurd.i am in favor of greatly reducing the amount of mercoxit found in 0.0, and perhaps significantly reducing the abc found in weak sissy wh systems. it's so cheap "
7/23/2011,"hi all,if ccp had a reason for doing what they did or someone can levelheadedly explain why this happened i'll revoke the proposal.basically with incursion ccp added 20 more storyline missions. as far as i can tell there is a total of 1 storyline which is where most, if not all of the mindlinks in the game come from. this kind of skyrocketed the price up as it used to cost maybe 100 million isk to buy all five (10 million * 4 + 50 for the mining one). now the mining one cost 380 million, which in comparison is the price of a capital ships skillbook and the other 4 total about 125 million at 47 46 30 and 1. i'm guessing ccp did this to nerf mission bots or they just weren't thinking too much when they added the missions in to please the mission runners with new content. i wouldn't know. as my security agents always give me transaction data delivery, materials for war preparation, or a new one where you deliver lock breaker hybrid ammo.i know this sounds like a whine about pricing, because it is. i can see the one nanite book costing so much because it only spawns in 1 a couple of sites, one of which is cosmos, and everyone is fine with that as its how it always was. but right now cs pilots are getting screwed over for the cost of a full set of plus four implants for the combat links, and the mining link sets you back 380 to 450 million. all this seems to just be because ccp didn't check their facts, or if they did they didn't tell anyone.it has been mentioned that they could have did this to make it so you need multiple cs pilots instead of just one good one to swap links. but that would be a nerf to titans, motherships, carriers, orcas, rorquals, tech iiis, commandships, and battlecruisers. thats one epic stealth nerf.thanks, feel free to flame or support or whatever.-cyrus"
7/23/2011,"if anyone gets me the proper number of storyline missions that i should take into account i'll redo the math. i'm on dialup though currently and internet browsing is too painful to want to really hardcore forum warrior.here's the numbers to show why mission runners shouldn't be too ****ed and people who don't like the missions, but do love the bonuses mind links give should support me as if they were more available and cheaper more people would use themi assume storyline agents do not have to give their division's missions as i have had courier (transaction data delivery) and mining (materials for war preperation) come from a security storyline which i got running nothing but security missions.if this is the case i have had 3 different missions out of dozens pulled over my time. the two mentioned and one where i have to transport lockbreaker hybrid ammo. ccp said they have added 20 new storylines in incursion, and the one mission gives the mindlinks. this means you have 1 in 24 missions give you the thing for a 4.2 percent chance of getting that mission.so if you were to follow long statistics and say that out of 1000's of samples you will ultimately be rather close to that 4.2 percent that means that you have to run 288 standard missions each time to get a link. at 7500 lp per mission which is easy to attain in low sec you get 2.16 million lp by time you get that mission. everyone gloats they can make 1000 isk per lp. so you have at this point made 2.16 billion isk off lp alone.following another statistical assumption the pricing minimums reflect that 380 / 47 mean that you seem to be around 5 to 8 times more likely to get something other then a mining link. so to get the coveted 380 mil mining link you would in the long run have to run 5 to 8 sets of 288 missions generating 10.5 to 17.25 billion isk from lp only before you get that good reward.this puts your mindlink to total profit margin at 2 percent. or for the mining link, 3.7 percent on the low end and 2 on the high end of the 5 to 8 spread.i'll be honest. my math is bad so the isk values may be off on how much they will make. and i assume there is more then 24 storylines total. so really they most likely have to run more then 288 missions long term to get the 1 storyline.pick your tl;dr:tl;dr missioners, for mission runners its only like 2 percent of your total profit.tl;dr non missioners, look how much they make, don't let them whine about taking a 50 mil loss on 2.16 billion made in lp alone.tl;dr cs pilots, sucks to be us right now."
7/23/2011,seems the whole courier/implant thing is causing some inflation thats seeping down to the plex level. have you looked at nomad implant prices. its the opposite side of the courier mission equation. agility directly affects travel time and the capacity for churning missions.i certainly hope plus 4's stay affordable enough to pvp in them.
7/23/2011,as i am unaware of any bad things that would come of making these implants cost less you have my support.i miss being able to switch out a combat implant for a mining one for mining ops.

7/23/2011,"until last summer we experienced regular issues with mass hacking a couple of times a year, usually around christmas and then again in the middle of summer. nowadays, this is pretty much constant with hundreds of accounts being targeted every day. many of those are old trial accounts or accounts that have been disabled for years and don't hold anything of value to the rmt types. unfortunately, there are still a lot of accounts that do have assets and isk that end up being cleaned out - even the characters themselves being sold off. the damages are sadly not repairable in some cases."

7/23/2011,"welp, i goofed. i have to stand against removing high ends from c4's because that makes no logical sense.i don't think the csm is carrying this charge. soundwave is convinced there's too much love in eve atm and he's right. the agenda, as far as i can tell, is to appropriately disperse some resources to generate more compeition, conflict, and player-driven gameplay. nullsec is taking it's lumps too so i really can't imagine you'd think wh's are being targeted and nobody else. i think the lucky hulk pilot is a stupid example, sorry mittens. a more apt description of the problem is permanent residents in these low-class wh's reaping nullsec level benefits when the mass limit of the in-routs dont allow for an equal capital-heavy response. you could argue the dangerous nature of operating there out-weighs this safty for your pos, but i think that's grabbing at straws tbh. i've seen wh corps build multipul carriers in a c1 just to *****, show off, and basically make an offensive of their little nugget an impossible task for all but the most determined foe with many many days to kill. it just doesn't make sense to allow for that when the other resources present are already great income.as i said, it's not so much a matter of being safe in space as it is being relatively hard to remove completely from said space. i think low class wormholes have a lot to offer aside from the high end ore. i really don't see their removal as a line in the sand worth fussing about."
7/23/2011,"my personal position in the matter of wh and abc is that removal from c1's and c2's would probably only affect their target audience of ""daytrippers"" and those who are abusing the limitations, so i'm really not opposed there, but between my alts and myself i have and will again live in a c3 as a small group. i do not see c3's as a place where abc needs removed and would rather see the entrances reconfigured not to spawn in highsec than discourage long-term dwellers in c3/4's.that being said, the bulk of my discontent with the csm opinions is the idea of essentially nerfing non 0.0 play to make 0.0 more attractive. wh's are one example of this. additionally there was talk of nerfing highsec industry or making certain universal parts of industry nullsec only activities. i'm not a wh only advocate. i am however against ccp or the csm making everyone outside of 0.0 miserable to make null seem more attractive by comparison instead of fixing it.null has significant isk earning opportunities that no other area in the game has. even after the nerfs, 0.0 is still in my opinion undervalued and underutilized. with a few good changes it could be great while leaving the rest of the game intact.as far as soundwave goes, he's fighting human nature. no game mechanic in the world can beat that."
7/23/2011,"you lost me there.first, i live in npc 00 with good truesec most of the time. null has great opportunities to be exploited sure, but you live under the gun for it. i am sometimes cut off from my farming areas for days or weeks because of sov. warfare and i don't even take part in it. my experience in w-space was similar, except for the unique feature that i rarely had to batton down the hatches for half as long. the worst thing ever to happen to me in my c2 wh was when a small gang of wh roamers re-enforced my pos and forced me to invite one of my mates to help me drive them off while i pos gunned. they quickly dispersed after finding out my pos wouldn't simply kick-off at their leisure.my simple point is this: i think the risk and reward mantra is what they want to project here. i don't see a huge armageddon coming on because high ends cease to be in c1-3 wormholes (although i'll repeat they do belong in c4's per my judgement, take it for what that's worth) or because ice leaves highsec. assuming the worst case scenario where nullsec/high class w-space becomes the bottle-neck for all industrial ventures in eve we will just see even more vigorous attempts to colonize these areas and replenish the starved marketplace which will undoubtedly be in high demand for the materials in question."
7/23/2011,"to op, vote in this thread and don't include any null sec votes. some nice work is being done. if csm goes against hard numbers, ccp can always dismiss their direction as detrimental to the company. null csm's will represent their voters but here is a chance to let csm evolve."
7/23/2011,super post!hi i live in highsec too (i only play for icarna). can we attach our fingers to each others butts in the future?
7/23/2011,"but dude, your lips are so real they belong in null sec"
7/23/2011,"the statistic that 80% of players are in hisec is provided by ccp so presumably has some basis. personally i would expect the numbers are skewed not only by hisec alts of 0.0 players, but also hisec based daytrippers into lowsec or nulsec and scout alts of hisec based players. while there may be uncertainty in the exact fraction of players who a based in hisec i don't think there is any doubt they constitute the vast majority of the player base.i want to see more attention paid to hisec, not to make hisec players richer, but to make the game more interesting for them.i've been playing the game over 3 years now. recently i've noticed that many of the players i grew up with in eve, ie who were newbs at the same time are leaving, playing less, or giving up their second account. talking to them they say that they've been getting tired of the game. these are guys who have been around for a while, have been in 0.0 roams or ratting, setup wormhole ops, etc, but remained based in hisec and spent most of their time missionruning or mining. the issue seems to be that once you've mastered l4s they become stale pretty fast. and if you are not going to move to 0.0 because you are a casual player/have rl commitments or it doesn't suit your play style then there isn't all that much else to do (incursions are a good recent addition to the universe).providing more interesting hisec gameplay will benefit many players and should benefit ccp by giving them better player retention. i'm not wanting to see hisec boosted to the disadvantage of nulsec, just for a fair portion of ccps development effort going to enhance the game for the silent majority."
7/23/2011,"was just reading the assembly hall where the csm chairman has confirmed he only represents the interests of his 'constituents', presumably goonswarm, and has been generally bad mouthing those with a differnt playstyle."
7/23/2011,"no, the chairman is supposed to direct the meeting. they have an extremely heavy hand in which topics meetings actually discuss. they also shape the flow and they are free to shape it for their own ends. i wouldn't say they are to represent all the people, that would be impossible.the csm's were elected on their platforms, imo they should try to stick to their platforms if they want to represent the people that voted them in. with mittens in charge, goonswarm will play ccp from both ends.what ccp doesn't see is that influences like goonswarm create a unique player base adapted to respond rather than create. think of how new players perceive this. just how evil and dark is the average science fiction buff. the loud noises are the vocal minority. a few babies bawling in a restaurant full of peopple ruin it for everybody.i'm convinced null sec is filled with spoiled rich bawling children that are used to getting their way by throwing tantrums.turn it all into high sec."
7/23/2011,i beg to differ. according to the ccp document defining the function of the csm it is to address issues in the context of 'the greatest good for the greater player base'. the various statements made my csm members would suggest that their objective is infact the opposite of their job description.see page 2 of the linked document under 'scope of csm'.
7/23/2011,"the current csm doesn't care about the foundation of the csm. because that would make them look at the ""boring"" stuff and we already read that this isn't really what they want to do.personal projects have a higher priority and the high sec playerbase is to blame for this. high sec has enough players in it, which aren't null sec alts, to blockvote in atleast 2 or 3 csm members and even blockvote the chairman/woman.yet the lack of interrest in bothering to set up a propper campaign, cohersion and the ability to be vocal when it matters is what turned the whole csm into a null sec promdance.even if we would get some good high sec candidates the high sec population would be too lazy or unfocussed to vote because it's so much easier to complain afterwards. be it on the forums or in their corpchats.also getting a few serious candidates without bickering between eachother is a harder task than meets the eye.a pure high sec player would also not be the ideal representative. he or she should atleast have some experience in low/null sec to have a somewhat more balanced vieuw."
7/23/2011,we control your game now
7/23/2011,from readings of the last emergency meeting from the csm it is clear they did talked for the player base and i dont know how you can rant about their work for us.
7/23/2011,"what exactly is not correct with cq? the devs said at first with cq we would not do much more then walk around the captain quarters and that is what cq has been released. i am shure there is much more exciting features to be released in the future that will make us forget incarna limitations.as of lag, it's pretty amazing to consider that eve server is in the top 500 servers in the world and this for a video game. every patch ccp works on lag issues but devs have also suggested to players to add ram to their machines to reduce client side lag. so complaining about lag when you have a pentium 3 with 2 gigs of rams doesent make any sense."
7/23/2011,"i think the point is cq should have been left out of this expansion and introduced with the whole station walking thang when ready. cq is utterly pointless as you cant do anything of worth atm. so while you are correct in saying cq is as cq was promised, do you honestly believe it was worth releasing in it's severely limited state? then there's the fact that cq ret@rds just about everything that was so easy in the hanger.as for lag... not everyone is going to have the land required to keep 2 gigs of rams let alone the sheep dogs needed to keep them under control. i did love eve for 2 years but the ***** cheated on me so i dumped her. 11pm tomorrow my last account expires and i'm not going to miss it one bit. what's happening now is naff, and what's likely to happen is even worse. have fun."

7/24/2011,normally i would give my vote to fw issues as well but there are so many now and so many duplicates (and ccp cares so little apparently) it is futile to vote on them. the csm should do some cleanup and merge them.where is the 'boost gallente' issue ?having to lose positive points to downvote issues is an idiotic mechanism.

7/24/2011,"i don't think so. you can raise this in ah but likely it would be rejected due to the cost of all the database accesses required to display that info. however, as a manual ""get damage report"" option it might have a chance.crowdsourcing provides input to ccp that is helpful in adjusting priorities. if you look at the most popular items in previous crowdsourcings, you'll see that more than a few ended up getting implemented -- in particular smaller items that are easy to fit into schedules.we tried to trim the list and caught a lot of these, but there are always going to be some mistakes. if you find one, email me at trebor-csm@animeigo.com with an explanation of why you think the item should not be on the list, and i'll update the wiki.i plan to do a recategorization of the csm wiki entries in the fall.hey, it means your votes count for more. what do you think of the idea of selling extra votes for aurum, btw? i solicited for help doing a filtering pass, i guess you missed it (it was stickied). we eliminated 20-30 items from the list.i can combine items after the votes are in, so if you have suggestions for items that should be combined, or general categories of related items (like ""ui"", ""balancing"", etc), then contact me."

7/24/2011,it was rejected becouse the issue is so big that any specific advise about a fix would not be helpful and a succesful fix would require a lot of work.csm instead of voteing for a specific fix pushed for a ship balance team/ dev and once the larger issue supercaps gets fixed he will work on hybrids soon after.

7/24/2011,"holy hell yes. blops have so much promise to be such an awesome fun toy to use in game, but they're currently sooooo limited, sooooo overpriced and soooooo underpowered.for example, the widow vs the scorpion has:less structureless shieldsless armorless targeting rangeless rig slotsless pgno turret hards (-4)more thermal resist (10%more)smaller sigbetter scan res12 more m/s1 more high (used for cloak)10 more cpu (used for cloak)1 more launcher hardit's just not a good tradeoff for the money. scorpion is roughly 50m, maybe 70m fitted. widow is nearly a billion fitted.so, for the price of a dozen scorpions, i can have a scorpion that has some awesome nifty abilities...but it fundamentally less good than the scorpion? no thank you."
7/24/2011,this point may have been raised already. any buff or review should seriously consider the fact that it takes considerable time training skills up to be an effective blops pilot yet the class is largely something of a gimmick or novelty due to its ineffectiveness unless blobbing with them or used as a poor mans titan.
7/24/2011,"here is the thing folks. if you don't want to get ganked....don't put your haulers/hulks right next to low sec space. i guess what people fail to remember about eve, is that the ruthless and most clever are always the ones who come out on top. this isn't world of warcraft. there are no safe zones. if someone war decs your corp, are you going to come on here and cry about that two or just sit docked up for a week ? as for ship insurance...why wouldn't it pay out ? insurance should be through a private company in no way based on concord. the guy that said, ""carebears are ruining eve"" is right. damn straight they are. every time i watch ccp give way to more and more of their stupid requests, i say goodbye to a little more of what eve was. why not just make eve all high security space. maybe then the qq will stop...."

7/24/2011,"why not use the ""mines"" from the old tie fighter/x-wing games? if you're not familiar with them, they are essentially sentry drones with proximity activation. in a mass field they can be dangerous, but one by itself is just a nuisance. it made it possible to pick off the mines one at a time with some good aim and stand-off piloting. plug in a new mine skill using the sentry drone skill tree, geared to max number anchored, and an anchoring distance skill tied to it and anchoring. the maxed skills would allow you to anchor bubbles close, but not overlapping, minefields. add in a minimum distance from celestials/anchored objects and each other. just a thought."
7/24/2011,the most fitting fix then would be to put back the drone buff once ccp gets servers that can handle it.
7/24/2011,"thank you everyone who took the time to elaborate the details of the nerfs. they all seem to be innocent by themselves, addressing different issues but as a whole they affected gallente most. but they all seem to affect fleet pvp exclusively. i would support then some selective buffs to a couple of ships to make them fill some holes in a fleet composition, but not a broad based racial wide buff ( unless it's the aforementioned drone one ) his is because i am comfortable with an imbalance in the sense that some races are better at fleet battles ( or any other single aspect of eve ) than others, so long as they enjoy an advantage elsewhere in the game, for example, solo pve, or pirate ships. i dont know if factional war is such an example, but the fact that gallente leads fw scoreboards may indicate something there, or maybe not."
7/24/2011,"you may well be right. but all i am saying is that as long as it's good at something unique, then it's a difference that adds character to the game. perhaps if uboat strategy comes into demand, the proteuses will be called for. ( i'm speaking generally )i don't think that each ( for instance ) t3 ship should be equal to others in terms of functionality or effectiveness for something specific like dps or ehp. if that were the case then we can argue about why matari frieghters are the weakest, and how everyone prefers gallente iterons. as long as gallente ships give something unique, then it's okay, just because their abilities don't make them too useful at the moment in fleets, isn't a good reason to make some large-scale buff that may cause other imbalances elsewhere. that being said, buffing the speed of some fleet geared gallente ships or boost their drones some how would be acceptable"

7/24/2011,"that is actually a good point.there were already two sources of 'mt' in eve prior to the aurum store:1. plex2. character bazaarboth impact the game, about as much as allowing characters in accounts less than 1 year old buy the accelerator implant."
7/24/2011,"taken individually, sure, but if you add skill acceleration, then you make a explosive disruption in the game more than any one of these individually can make.(you institutionalize character farming and make it very easy)also those other 2 means have legitamate uses, (allowing people to play for free, or sell their subscription time, and splitting accounts respectively. sp cheating's only use is to get ahead of others for mt."
7/24/2011,"well beg to differ on that, when you buy a char from the bazaar you are buying the sp, not the toon. people don't go looking to buy a char cause of the name or race etc. they buy it cause it has the sp they want. to fly the ships and mods they want. yes someone has done the time in training on it, but the person bought it cause they didn't want to do the training. no matter where the sp came from they are buying sp. so if ccp does ever do this service in any form, just is an extension to what already exists. just would be another way for anyone to get the sp, whether they use just isk or buy plexes to achieve it. this way just opens up more ways of getting to your goal."
7/24/2011,"problem:since the keyboard shortcut revamp the ctrl key's behaviour has been atrocious. not even simply unintuitive, it is working it's damnedest against the player. there were several bugs / fixes to it which made me believe it was going to be 'fixed' back to how it was before the shortcut updates but it's evident now that the current functionality is 'intended'.the old behaviour for the control key was as a modifier for other actions. for example, ctrl + lmb on the overview or a bracket would lock that target. this is how the key is normally used by 99% of software and is how people expect it to behave.ctrl on its own would freeze up the overview so target selection was easier on a busy grid where the overview could jump about as new targets appear / come into range etc. this was intuitive and practical in it's behaviour.the new behaviour is a disaster. yes, ctrl + lmb still will target a ship you select but now, ctrl on it's own will target whatever bracket or overview target has focus. this is causing problems for a lot of people. furthermore there are many other keyboard shortcuts that rely on hitting ctrl and another key. with the current behaviour there's a very good chance you will end up not only activating the shortcut you wanted, but also targetting a stargate, or random ship.why is it a problem?aside from the fact it is frustrating, in a combat, or even in a pve environment this works against you and can even lead to you getting killed. targeting a stargate or non-hostile by mistake is undesirable not only because you are wasting one of your target slots, you could shoot at the wrong thing. even simply yellow-boxing the wrong hostile ship in a fleet situation can lead to you getting primaried. yes mistakes happen and you can easily do this yourself accidentally but to have the games keyboard shortcuts working directly against you is simply poor interface design.this is unacceptable and needs to be reverted.furthermore, the alt key as default for 'look at' interferes with anyone that runs several client or even wishes to alt tab to a browser window from time to time. fortunately this can be disabled simply enough but it is another example of the poor 'improvements' that were made.in closing i propose the ctrl key is reverted to its former functionality where on it's own it would freeze the overview, and ctrl + left mouse click was needed in order to actually lock a target.thank you for reading."
7/24/2011,"supported.maybe they fixed it, because it wasn't broken?"
7/24/2011,"supported in principle, but i do not support the specific backstep to the old functionality. as an alternative, i propose the following:if the user-specified shortcut is only a modifier key or a combination of modifier keys......then the designated action should only be performed when the left mouse button is clicked on a valid target while the modifier key combination is being held. this will be irrespective of wether the background has focus or the overview has focus, since the act of left-mouse-clicking simultaneously sets the focus, anyway.for example, the user designates control as toggle lock target. overview has focus, and something was previously clicked in the overview. pressing control, or pressing and holding control, should do nothing. pressing and holding control and then left-mouse-clicking something in the overview should lock the target.if the user-specified shortcut includes a non-modifier key......then the designated action should be performed when the key combination is pressed and released while a target is pre-selected or when the key combination is pressed and held and then followed by a left-mouse-click on a valid target. this should be made to work regardless of whether the background or the overview has focus.for example, the user designates a as align to and w as warp to. the user emerges from olbra stargate(jondik), that is, the user just jumped from jondik into olbra and is holding gatecloak. the user then left-mouse-clicks and releases on the bracket-in-space for stargate(eystur) so that stargate(eystur) is selected and the background has focus. the user then presses and releases a; this should make the ship align to stargate(eystur). the user then presses and holds w; because w is still being held, this is not a complete command, and the ship does nothing.the user can then either release w, which is a command to warp to stargate(eystur), or keep holding w and left-mouse-click-and-release in the overview on the row for stargate(altrinur), which is a command to warp to stargate(altrinur); obviously, this will take time, since the ship wasn't aligned to stargate(altrinur)."
7/24/2011,"kinda hard to follow sd but the warp to on release sets off a lot of bells and whistles.pressing a key should activate a function, releasing a key should cease a function, so as to stay consistent. you realize if you press your w key to preload a warp and your fc cancels warp that your kinda in a pickle? when you release that key something is going to happen. this idea might work real nice on your personal programmed keyboard. don't think its good for the masses though.big fan of kiss. things should be no more complicated than they need to be. i think ui team tried to add some slick functionality like you described but its better for inteligent keyboards and such. we need intuitive response on the ui before programable. even with programmable keyboards, functions are difficult to sort and standardize.something should be done though. ive read a few of these threads and still find myself flying in odd direction, not targeting who i want as ls mentioned. i'm generally flailing like a noob. once something worked that was slick, probably worked as intended. just as your warp on release key could be nice for certain.revert would be better than nothing, ccp documentation would be nice too. does any exist anywhere?"

7/24/2011,no. and this seals it. op has no clue.if you want free mindlink go do missions. few hundred mil for mindlink should be next to nothing for a guy who can use it.
7/24/2011,"1. post with your main. it's hard to take a five month old character seriously on this subject when you have 0 kills and are young enough that you could not even have the ability to use all five of the mind links. your corp has a total of 1 kill you were not on. i'll also go out on a limb here and say that if you are a corp that only recruits finns that play minmatar with no sp requirements you probably have not had a lot of help learning about this game from corp mates. though it could just be it could be there from before you joined and you left it.2. i admitted to not knowing exactly and not being able to forum warrior properly or it would take me days. i do now know that the nanite control book spawns from two sites. one which is cosmos area based, and another which can show up at random in low or 0.0. and even with me being wrong on the location. that does not detract from the fact that except for the one bug, which was quickly fixed, allowed a level 1 mission to drop them for a while they have never had their availability changed.3. nighthawk and damnation, which are arguably the two most used cs ships in the game only cost about 200 million and 180 million respectively. the implant to get it to do its job properly should not cost as much as a capital mod.4. the links were excellent when they were cheap. you could swap them out quickly if you need to jump from one cs to another if you were going from say an armor fleet to shield fleet and maybe be out 5-10 mil if you were in a bad spot marketwise. with current prices you are either buying a new cs in implants every 4 swaps. or you are telling your fleets that they have to wait 24 hours whenever they change tactics and need a different cs.i'm pretty sure i do have a clue."
7/24/2011,4. i think you pretty much figured it out now. links are good and ppl keep switching them like monkeys so obviously price goes up since they still can afford them.
7/24/2011,"thanks for responding with your main.the price didn't go up though because people are switching them. people have switched them for ages. and if that was the case the price would have at least risen well before incursion. it forces the assumption that either the price went up solely because ccp decided to add missions in and diluted the availability to the point the price rose 10 times from what it was. or suddenly at the same time the missions were added, the amount of mind links received per day stayed the same but the amount of people using them went up tenfold. i do admit people fly around in cs ships more now, but for solo work there are things much better you could use slot ten for then a mindlink. those are the extremes of the possibilities and the answer most likely lies somewhere in the middle.i will give you that ccp may have done it so more people have to fly cs instead of just one person being good at all of them. but usually when they make a change that drastic to fleet tactics you hear of it from them in some blog that generates a threadnaught. as far as i can tell the only thing ccp ever said on it was that they were adding the missions."

7/24/2011,"problem: two missions in the soe epic arc--""chasing shadows"" and ""our man dagan"" require new players to face relatively difficult npcs and retrieve a mission item from the wrecks. since many new players lack the skills, fitting, and experience to deal with these npcs alone, it is common for them to seek assistance in local. other players offer assistance, and in turn steal the required mission item. the mission will not reset since the target npc has been destroyed (please correct and mock me if it, in fact, does reset).note that there is little potential for profit from the majority of players requesting help in killing these npcs. furthermore, the penalty for being unable to complete the mission is higher than, say, having your damsel in distress stolen, and involves a massive loss in potential standings gain, significant (for a new player) isk, and a 3-month wait to attempt the arc again. experienced players rarely, if ever, require help or fall victim to this trap. while some may view it as valuable to introduce players to the mechanic of mission item theft, i submit that there are better places, times, and mechanisms with which to do it.solution: redesign ""chasing shadows"" and ""our man dagan"" to not require the retrieval of a mission item. the subsequent mission requiring the delivery of dagan's corpse should grant the mission item, with a slight ""flavor text"" rewrite to say that his corpse was retrieved by others. nothing else need be changed.pros+improves new player experience, increases player retention+eliminates small source of petitions, decreasing gm workload+encourages players to get their first taste of fleeting+benefits an overwhelming percentage of new players (both those that would have been victims, and the rest that get to enjoy an improved soe experience), for a small amount of resourcescons-one step closer to ""instanced"" missions-expends small amount of resources on a very specific part of the game-nerfs sheroo griefing, boo!tl;drstealing kritsan/dagan corpses is pretty profitless and hurts the new player experience. make those two missions not require an item to be collected."

7/24/2011,"back when the initial call went out this year for things for csm 6 to discuss with ccp, i made a thread about the alliance logo process, and how it was flawed and should be fixed. here we stand today, with the july 2011 crowdsourcing thread up, and yet there isnt even an option to vote for a fix (which, interestingly, was on the ballot for the last two, and has been suspiciously removed from this one). i decided to bring this up in a new thread instead of the crowdsourcing thread because i felt it may spark a discussion and that is not what that thread is for.ccp and csm, please fix the alliance logo process to allow the players more freedom in thier logo choices. incarna and future expansions are all about the social aspect of eve, and yet hundreds, if not thousands of alliances have exactly the same logo because the current process is too flawed. evegate and walking in stations is all about players interacting with each other in new and interesting ways, and yet many alliances have the same default logo for one reason or another, and are unable to differentiate themselves by creating a ""brand image"" so to speak around thier logo.this has been an issue brought up since csm 3, each of the csm's, 3, 4, and 5 have voted unanimously for ccp to fix this issue, and yet the only change was to make the community approve logos before ccp denies them the same way they did before (at least that's the only change i can see), and alliances still wait extended periods of time before thier logo is implemented (some as long as two years! i'm sure many an alliance has disbanded before thier logo was approved).alliance directors should be able to add thier own logos to thier alliance and it should follow the standard set by corp and player bios where you can report the logo as inappropriate, at which point ccp reviews and removes those logos, possibly with a graduated punishment system to prevent people from uploading the same logo again.at least give this issue a chance and discuss it! it may not seem important to those alliances whose logos are already in the game but the rest of us would like the process to work better so we can add our own logo."

7/24/2011,"problem: eve pve content is boring, repetitive, scripted and non-fun.fix: add more types of missions with more varied or unpredictable playspecifically, missions not tied to a specific location in game, with longer-term duration. current missions allow a pilot to take a mission, complete it, turn it in and collect a reward, all within the span of a few minutes or hours.i think it would add a new and fun element to the game to allow missions that spanned days or even weeks in duration, but operated differently than current mission types.instead of having a set location that the player warps to one time, completes and is then done with, have a mission with a non-locational basis. the mission would spawn objectives or enemies over time wherever the player went and the player would simply rack up points on the mission as he went, eventually turning in the mission for a reward when a certain quota was reached.for example, the player could receive notices of plex-like spawns in his system or nearby systems (within a couple jumps), or the player could have small spawns spawn on grid with him at random intervals.additionally, it could be fun to have 'chase' portions of missions, where the player would need to kill a particular spawn, which would warp away from them and need to actually be tackled, perhaps going as far as jumping to other systems, or spawning reinforcements to help it escape."

7/24/2011,"[proposal] corprate wallet accounting managementthe multi-wallet divisions for the corporate wall are all well and good however could use some upgrades to make them more corporatly functional.1. have management system so that player taxes for bounties and mission rewards can be assigned to: a) the players assigned corporate wallet division b) fixed corporate wallet divsion for all staff.2. automatic funds transfer (wallet to wallet)allow for the setup of automatic funds transfer from one wallet division to another division based on pre-set dollar figure or based on a % of another accounts funds. example: new recruit is assigned to wallet division 5 if the funds in wallet division 5 exceed 10 million transfer any access to wallet division 4 etc, etc[pros]the account management function would allow for easier management of finances for all players. existing corps would be able to assign new members to a lower financed walled which would allow them to manage ""trial"" periods for any corporate members, allowing them access to the corporate funds, including those directly earned by that player without accessing all of the corporate monies or manual management."

7/24/2011,"well, since you ask i actually have an athlon 64 dual core with 4 gb ram.i was speaking from a personal perspective when i said things had changed. when i first started playing eve i had about the same experience as everyone else as far as performance went, since then i have upgraded my main box to the spec. above but, like a lot of other applications, the devs seem to have been more interested in adding new features and thus expanding the code base rather than optimising performance. now i'm more or less forced to run the graphics on my machine at minimum levels of detail just so the game stays playable. i know that this is partly my fault for running under linux and that there are things i can do to increase performance but money is tight just now and i would have expected that with the setup i do have things should be better than they are. for me cq is unusable as it runs so slowly, as i say that is partly due to the decision i made regarding choice of os, but to insist on everyone using it is unfortunate. i would like to have the choice to go back to ship spinning. something i hear may be reintroduced, so that may, in time solve that problem. the other thing is, to me, the perceived lag in the client. stations, jump gates and distance updates etc.seem to be very slow and sometimes do not appear at all. now i know that this may be due to my setup and/or the pathetic broadband i have, but i can only speak about what i see. that is not to say that things have not changed for the better, they most defintely have. the playing experience is richer, has a better introduction to the game, there are more things to do and explore and so on. all in all a game i would be loath to stop playing. but just because things are mostly going in the right direction does not mean to say that you should not speak out when you think things could be improved. after all that's why mass tests are run from time to time but having the full user base looking at things should always bring to light areas of the game that could usefully be tweaked."
7/24/2011,"- the devs having announced to make it non-optional in the future.i have a decent rig (quad core intel cpu @3ghz, geforce gtx 570, 8 gigs of ram), but cq eats my system ressources like nothing and makes my gpu fan howl.yes - i can run 2 clients @1920*1200"

7/25/2011,supporting this discussion~
7/25/2011,"problem will be the minefields themselves. think about it. you can literally spam a gate with 1000s of mines if you have like 100 minelaying hulls. well actually you will drop like 10000s of mines if it can be done. this will cause 2 big problems:1- with suggested damage amount, for example half a damage of bomb it is like 50 bombs triggered to explode. that **** is extremelly powerful if you give them a very long aoe range. like if its 30km you'll literally dd the gate and all who enter. i can see 2 possible solutions though. a- if their trigger range is like 30km, first ship decloacks should ignite the full minefield and only the first uncloaked ship should take the damage. (it will be like that as others are not moved and gate cloaked at that moment.) b- or mines should only explode if there is a ship in 1km proximity of themselves with a blast radius of 1km. so 1 ship can try to dodge minefield. or at least not dd'ed in the instant it jumped to system. and also it will some how pain the jumping in fleet but not dd everything at an instant ruining the game for attackers.2nd problem is the great lag it will generate. as you know u can't spam containers around a gate to create lag as it is a known exploit. think about it. any sizeable alliance can spam 1000 maybe more mines around gate.. well even it is on the grid it should work lagwise. it will definitively give the processor something to calculate as proximity and damage wise..in conclusion, if you want minefields they should created like that you can't mass them in an area. maybe to cover a gate you can put down 10 of them at most. a minefield may and should hold of a lone or very small enemy gang. but it shouldn't be the new titan with aoe damage. it wasn't fun at all. if you want system defense another good idea is paying bills for gate sentry guns and even faction npc guards. they will create some defense + isk sink which is much needed anyway.and to add the insult of minefields they shouldn't generate kill mails. so ppl shouldn't randomly minefield every gate in 0.0 to get afk mails... for one, i will lay fields every f***ing gate as long as it will generate kms :p"
7/25/2011,"thus my tie fighter mine idea. they're just like sentry drones. they fire lasers, projectiles, missiles. there is no aoe or bomb-like effect. large numbers could be devestating to a single ship, which is the point, but a well tanked group could survive. in tie fighter the real game mechanic point of the mine fields was to eat into your tank a bit and soften you up."
7/25/2011,"i guess i didn't describe this properly. the minefield would be an anchorable module, much like the mobile warp disruption bubbles, they would also have an ammo bay, with a limited number of mines, these are not launched into space, they just vanish from the ammo bay as the minefield damages a target. they are aoe only within the minefield and effect everyone, friend or foe. the module can be targeted and destroyed just like bubbles. the minefields come in three sizes, small, medium and large (just like the mobile warp disruption bubbles) each minefield would have three settings: dense field(uses half of the onboard ammo, 50%, you get a max of two attacks) normal field(uses one fifth of the onboard ammo, 20%, you get a max of five attacks)small field(uses one tenth of the onboard ammo, 10%, you get a max of ten attacks)these would not be a new dd, they would just make certain routes more secure. yes you could close off an entire system, mine every gate, but you'd be unable to leave. as for the spamming around a gate, they can't be within reaction range of each other as that would set off the other field/fields. there are limits to their effectiveness, damage reduction as with bombs, and limited number of uses, and should be comparable to bomb mineral regs for each mine, and mwdb for the fields. i don't remember do smartbombs and ecm bursts hit gate cloaked ships? i want to say they do but it's been a long time since i've run into them.i think no killmails for the owner of the minefield would be best as well.as i've said before the lag issues bug me, that is why i've tried to stick to only mechanics that are already in game, mwdb=minefield, bombs=mines, damage style=recon(part 3) it's a level 4 mission that i'm sure most of us have done.let me know if i missed something."
7/25/2011,*sniffle* i guess i'm not part of the discussion. they'll never go for aoe mines. aoe is just too easy mode.
7/25/2011,"does the person who lays the mines take aggro when it attacks/explodes/whatever?in the past, the issue of mine aggro was cause for all sorts of drama."

7/25/2011,"no on this! this would buff caldari as well. yes on making some gallente ships better in ways like using rails or speed bonuses or something racially congruent. the list of gallente ships used in fleets looks longer than caldari ones :)not to mention the proteus and myrm are popular ships for wormhole corps i hear, so it seems there as uses for gallente ships, just not null sec fleets. instead of balancing the traditional (linear and boring) way why not give gallente a bonus related to their advanced automation technology? if ships had crew this could be used in a very story congruent way. gallente ships need fewer crew, minmatar the most etc. just an idea. in fact i'll start a new thread on it."

7/25/2011,"that's correct, they can't. i only started a year or so ago, i'm having fun. you don't need to be able to fly titans to enjoy this game. i like the way the skill system statifies players into capabilities based on skill level. even a week old noob can find important stuff to do in 0.0 warfare, after several months you should be able to handle anything pve, with a group if necessary.you don't need to buy sp to have fun in this game, and that's why we play, to have fun.the only one thing i would like to see is neural remaps for plex, as few as 1 remap per year for a plex would be good enough. beyond that, no sp buying."

7/25/2011,"(note: vote yes if you believe there should be unique rewards for fw vp).(edit 2: ok, so you guys brought up some good points, lets narrow the discussion on how plexes themselves can be redesigned to 1) promote pvp through mechanics that reward staying and fighting rather than warping off a stabbed condor/atron/executioner and just running another plex elsewhere, 2) how rewards can be implemented along with the above to avoid exploitation, 3) meaningful occupancy besides herpa derpa deny docking rights/missions lets think about something thats outside the box the whole denying docking rights/station services/missions has been beaten with a stick over and over again.currently there are no rewards for obtaining victory points nor is there a reward (beyond the initial standings boost) to participate in the fw (faction war) ""occupancy war"" by means of capturing plexes. the initial standings boost is not enough to create incentive to create any long-term involvement with fw plexing. there should be long term rewards for plexing and participating in fw. one way to accomplish this is to offer unique incentives to participate in fw plexing. new faction ships/items should cost enough vp that at least a considerable amount (i.e. those involved in actual occupancy war) of effort had to be put forth to obtain such rewards to avoid ""farming"" from those not directly involved with fw.some ideas (these are just a suggestion) for adding new ships for vp:navy ewar cruisers (as there are none in game)navy destroyers (as these are not in the game as well)navy battle cruisers (as there are none in game)i don't have any ideas for anything else, but the proposal is that there should be unique rewards (so they do not affect highsec missioning or normal fw lp stores).i know a lot needs changed for fw but this is just one step. i'm sure once ccp gets around to it they will add more than just one small change and will hopefully revamp fw."
7/25/2011,"i definitely think this idea is worthy of discussion and so gave it some support.however ccp would need to make plexing involve more pvp. i know you don't want to discuss those other changes but that sort of ties our hands in this discussion. if plexing were to remain exactly the way it is except you could then buy navy ships for doing them, i would not support the topic.if they improve plexing making it more pvp then i would be very much in favor of something like this."
7/25/2011,pretty much what this guy said.
7/25/2011,"why should there be such rewards for plexing in the first place? i'd much rather see militia wide benefits when securing systems than individual payouts which inevitably leads to massive abuse (as witnessed with current missions).as for the ships:navy destroyers are not really needed and would beyond a doubt be a significant hit to af/ceptor/frig viability. revamping existing destroyers to sport the few guns/high bonus paradigm to cut operational costs would benefit everyone without breaking anything how ever.- navy ewar cruisers would be awesome. they should remove the low-tier navy crap (osprey/aurogor/exequror/scythe) and replace them with these. bonuses should remain as is but they should get the ""standard"" navy boost.- navy bcs. even if you base them on the tier1 models there is simply not enough 'room' to fit such a thing in below tier1 bs.only way would be to make them not follow the navy-boost system (+ehp, slot and performance) which makes them much less desirable and thus porbably redundant.either way, if vp is ever to be part of the rewards system the access to them has to be heavily revised. plexing game is all about who has the most alts or the biggest blob post-dt which makes this proposal nonsensical without first tackling the underlying mechanics (ie. what the others said )"
7/25/2011,new ships for no other reason than to bandaid the broken fw system?not supported.
7/25/2011,"ok, so, as far as plexing mechanics go. i think everyone can agree that shooting npcs is not pvp (as well as the imbalances between them dismotivate pvp). the current ""king of the hill""-type system can be exploited with an army of alts with an after burner fitted frig, but on the other side fw plexing offers one thing unique to just about the rest of eve (cosmos plexes aside), ship size restricted arenas of combat, giving opportunities for players of all ages and ship size preferences thier own niche. i think this mechanic should be the core of any new plexxing/occupancy system. i think we should focus on reducing the available area to fight over (at any given point in time) to promote pvp.the problem with the current system that is the population density of fw is so low that people capture plexes and more often than not, dont see a soul or is too remote for the opposing faction to scout you, to return to their base to reship appropiately for the size of plex, get back, and get some pvp, in addition to the issue where even if you do get back, often times the other side will blueball you (either it be alt, or main) and will just run a plex elsewhere. the solution is to make the available areas for militia to combat eachother for occupancy condensed. i do believe hirana and others have suggested ""fronts"" (the concept that only systems that border eachother of opposing occupancies can be targeted), i think the idea is good, but with so many ""fronts"" as militias push just a little into eachothers sovreign systems, that i think the same underlying issue will surface with many people just avoiding pvp and going for occupancy objectives where the opposing side is not since the available systems that can be attacked will increase and massive blueballing will ensue. so, i think that the available area to be fought over should be condensed even further. (tweaking to the fronts concept, or even random constellation focused typed stuff, or whatever else) lets discuss how we can condense militia objectives (whatever they may become in the future) to promote pvp."
7/25/2011,no one see this as a problem?
7/25/2011,"this has been complained about in the forums. i think it was mentioned as ""to be addressed"" in a dev blog or in the info that came out of the emergency meeting a bit fuzzy on where i remember reading it though. the addition of more clicking than needed, especially when there had been less prior to incarna is a problem that needs to be addressed though."
7/25/2011,supported~
7/25/2011,"i really think we should just accept that csm will not be much help for fw. nor should they. they do not play fw and didn't run on that platform. having them try to do homework to figure out what ccp already knows directly is not a good use of their time. fw is very good in several ways:1) the missions are an excellent way to do low sec missions. it is much better than any player had ever proposed in the past.2) the idea of having ship restricted plexes to fight in was a great idea.3) the special lp store for fw participants and unique items was a good idea. (although many of the items are pretty worthless amarr armor plates anyone?)the big problem is that the occpancy plexing mechanics is mostly a pve activity - when it was supposed to involve lots of fun small scale pvp. understanding why that is is and how to correct it is not as easy as proposals like ""give blasters better tracking"" the csm members play in null sec because they like null sec. this is fine but their solutions will likely involve making fw more like what they enjoy  null sec. this will make eve less diverse. people in fw often are not in null sec for a reason. moreover asking people what they do in fw isn't really helpful. ok people do allot of missions, and very little occupancy plexing. does that mean ccp should give up occupancy plexing and only work on missions since that is what the players are interested in? no. the rework of fw will require: 1) figuring out what sort of gameplay ccp wants to create - which hopefully will involve ccp wondering what sort of game play is missing from eve as a whole. here i would suggest eve is missing a way to find quality small scale pvp quickly.2) figure out how they can develop mechanics to promote the gameplay they want to create."
7/25/2011,thanks for the support so far. not a massive issue but i'd imagine a lot agree that they could look a little bigger?
7/25/2011,"i don't really fly bs, but it would make sense to see some big honking guns on them. they should look menacing."
7/25/2011,"commenting in the other thread is not really practical, so i'll just put in here that #124 is already in game and although #32 and #145 are sort of duplicates i voted for both of them."
7/25/2011,i'm unable to find anything about railgun or hybrid rebalancing on the list. what is the status of this issue in regards to the crowdsourcing?
7/25/2011,"as we all know, you lose security standing with concord when you knowingly aggress (pirate) an innocent player. it quickly affects your security status causing you to be unable to enter high security areas. i'd like to propose that ccp give players security standing improvements and bonuses for fighting and killing eve's most wanted players. not only does it give purpose to pirate hunting, but makes it more rewarding and fun. this is a win-win for the eve community, and something i think could be fairly easily implemented. i'd appreciate the players and the csm's support on this issue.purpose:to give empire pvp'ers and lowsec players another way to improve their security status, and to promote more pvp in these areas.pros:encourages more pvp in low-secimproves players security standings so they don't have to waste time ratting in empire/nullsecgives pirate hunters and bounty hunters new lifecons:pirates die more often and become afraid to yarr! (yeah right)."
7/25/2011,add in tradable kill rights and you may have the groundwork for a working bounty hunting system
7/25/2011,"shooting blinkies doesn't hurt sec status as it is in low sec. maybe a sec status boost on a kill, that could work."
7/25/2011,this subject is up for review by the csm.
7/25/2011,proof? oh an 42 posts and no one is supporting it. says a lot.
7/25/2011,well since the csm subjects are points based and the subject doesnt effect many people at all i can understand that.
7/25/2011,"bolded the important part. ccp won't make such a drastic change in eve just for a small handful of people.the current csm is still discussing things with ccp that that first csm discussed with them *cough* poses and corp management for example. hell everyone is still trying to get ccp to make the font larger as it's next to impossible to read on bigger monitors and/or higher resolutions.while i do not support your idea, i wish you the best on your endeavor for it!"
7/25/2011,"just becasuse it doesnt effect alot of people doesnt mean it doesnt need to change. while on the subject, when you kill a npc, whos loot is it? if someone steals the npcs loot you can kill them right?"
7/25/2011,"you do have a point with this. however i believe the rp backstory behind it is that since npcs have bounties on them which are paid by concord, that concord allows you to claim the loot for killing them.now if concord is going to start paying me for every player i kill, i can see your point."
7/25/2011,so if it is sanctioned by concord all is good? hmmm interesting.
7/25/2011,"no. also, if anything, rring should cause aggression timers too."
7/25/2011,if you do lvl5s then you can find this very annoying but it is fair imo. if you use pirate to tank/dps then you can just ignore the loss of standings with empire faction (not like you can go high sec anyway). make choice between lose sec status on your alt by remote pirate or lose empire standings on non-pie while use the pirate to rr.
7/25/2011,please add two topics to crowd sourcing vote:173. rebalance gallente hulls174. rebalance hybrid weapons systems
7/25/2011,perhaps add each mindlink to the respective lp store for militias. that would bring prices down a ton. in addition to adding another isk sink.
7/25/2011,"compared to other implants, mindlinks are still incredibly cheap relative to the advantage they give. they are also cheap compared to the ship classes required to deploy them with full effect (fleet command ships or t3s)""they used to be cheaper"" doesn't seem in and of itself to be an adequate argument for making them cheaper."
7/25/2011,i think the current price is fair apart from them mining one i guess. maybe add another couple storyline missions which drop it (lvl5s?) but when you compare mindlinks to hardwires and faction implants you get very good benefit for relatively low isk.
7/25/2011,"kva-2000: adds +5% to the shield hp of one ship. market price: ~140 million iskseige warefare mindlink: adds +15% to the shield hp of 2-256 ships. increases the power of seige gang warfare links by 50%.market price: ~45 million isk.if anything, a simple comparison indicates that mindlinks are still considerably underpriced compared to their utility. why should a mindlink cost less than 10% per point of bonus given than a standard skill hardwiring?"
7/25/2011,"+1, less monie for mission runners."
7/25/2011,supported
7/25/2011,it's a no brainer. fully supported.
7/25/2011,"playing the game of eve online as ceo of a mining corporation, i have been in need of an improved corporate wallet system that includes greater flexibility and functionality with particular emphasis on divisional wallets and their limited use.the mining corporation and its organizational structure as i have conceptualized it, is consisted of multiple mining crews, each of which is assigned to one of the six remaining divisions, (div. 2 thru div. 7), whereby division 1 serves as the central command or corporate headquarters.at each of the division levels in this corporation, i have assigned a squad leader, whom is typically the orca pilot in each of the separate mining squads or crews. as a matter of corporate agenda, i have always intended that each squad leader in this corporation be allowed to have full control over and assume full responsibility for, his or her entire assigned division within the corporation.to this extent, i happy to say the organizational structure of this corporation is basically sound and it works out pretty well for us in every aspect but one, and that one aspect is the limited functionality of the divisional wallets.case in point: over the last three months i have been developing a new mining division as outlined above and assigned a corp. member to div. 7 as its squad leader. upon that assignment, i deposited $500 mil isk from this corporations master wallet into the divisional wallet belonging to division 7.now, as things currently stand with the divisional wallets in eve online my appointed squad leader is not allowedpurely by game design or a lack of it to make purchases over the open market directly from the divisional wallet. this is in every waya very stark contrast in correlation to how ceos and assigned directors of all corporations in this gameare able to or have been afforded the ability toconduct needed financial operations within ones own corporation; however and by whatever means that corporation is comprised.when my squad leader opens his divisional wallet, he is afforded only four options as a means of financial transaction for his division. they are as follows:[give money] / [take isk] / [transfer isk] / [change division]so if my appointed squad leader wishes to purchase needed skill books; (that is his/her assigned leadership responsibility), for the purpose of training present & future squad members; (also his/her assigned leadership responsibility)the appointed squad leader must first transfer isks from the divisional wallet into his/her personal wallet before he or she can make a corporate purchase, with corporate funds, for corporate purposes. surely, we can incorporate something into the divisional wallet system of conducting corporate business with a little more finesseshall we say?"
7/25/2011,i already answered this in your thread in the features and ideas forum.the person has to go into the corp wallet and then click the change division button and select the division he has the roles for. now he can use the corp wallet to buy/sell.

7/25/2011,"this proposal is to re-establish security status as a working game mechanic again.security status of all characters and accounts from the same ip address share the same security status. if a player plays at home and at work, then the security status will be that of the lowest.this change will squash those who recycle alts for suicide ganking, help improve the low sec market and help get more players out of high sec."
7/25/2011,"and make it so if one character's corp/alliance gets wardecced, all characters can be attacked freely!or in other words, no"
7/25/2011,"-1i dont want someone else that uses the same isp affecting my eve experience! i dont have, and cannot get a static ip address, and every few days the ip address i get from my isp could change.also until ip6 is common place, the sharing of ip addresses by"
7/25/2011,well what about my dynamic ip? also vpn's are very cheap you can even get a 3 hour trial at some long enough to gank someone. also what happen's if i play at a friends house?
7/25/2011,"terrible idea. heart is in the right place though, mind is elsewhere."
7/25/2011,need more thumbs up guys.
7/25/2011,horrible idea.
7/25/2011,doing anything based on source ip address is stupid. come back when u get a clue.
7/25/2011,"clearly, the op doesn't understand the meaning of ""recycle"" when it comes to an alt in eve. it means to recycle the character slot, not the character, by killing the alt and making a new one to replace it. just to clear up the confusion."
7/25/2011,"i use a laptop.i have good sec status anyway, just sayin'. my ip isn't fixed."
7/25/2011,"if you are correct, this is the part that needs fixing imo. it should reset on the next downtime (and may already do so), in which case the newbie who gets his item stolen is inconvenienced, but not totally screwed.edit: on second thought, even if the item doesn't respawn, it could be obtained on contracts or by pulling the same scam on another player. maybe no fix is needed, just better informing new players of their options."
7/25/2011,qft
7/25/2011,"not supported.mission loot can always be found on contracts. and stealing them for resale is a profession for some.i didn't do too many mission when i started, but i did this one and i didn't find it too hard, though it did take me several tries before getting a fit that worked."
7/25/2011,"as the soe epic arc is classified as for new players, it is my understanding that you can have the mission reset by petition. this means the player gets the item back. i'm sure gms would have a problem with a player petitioning for a reset repeatedly though. it would make sense for these missions to be reworked for the sanity of the gms."
7/25/2011,stop the dockinggames please..
7/25/2011,1) boosting loyalty points for plexes is a good idea if plexing was done right. but its not now. the other militia needs to know when they are entered so pvp can take place there.2) this goes in the opposite direction of where occupancy needs to go. occupancy is already too much of a pve game. it needs to be more of a pve game.3) bad idea. this will just lead to large blobs at the front lines instead of the many pockets of small gangs we get in fw. moreover people would just pile on the winning side.now if you were to say you can't dock in the other militias stations then that isn't so bad. so if a system was occupied by amarr then a minmatar militia pilot wouldn't be able to dock in a 24th crusade owned station in that system. 4) well i think they need to fix the mechanics first. adding factions just gives us more of the same. but yeah after they fix the mechanics and fw is truly great and the militias are packed then start adding more factions.
7/25/2011,"i like the idea of restricting docking to enemy militia based on the control of the system but i can see that being problematic code wise as you'd need to switch stations from tlf to 24th every time a system changed hands. each militia should have a home system which can never be flipped, but there should be a large incentive to capture and hold a system."
7/25/2011,"specifically all forum spammers who recently started the 'we are umbrella group' posts; from the sheer numbers, they are likely bots anyway."
7/25/2011,"the odd thing is, they didnt spam much in c&p where it would have made the most sense"
7/25/2011,"the topic was removed becouse the process for submiting new logos was revamped and the wiki for the topic was updated. as ccp is not going to allow just anyone to submit an alliane logo. the rules are very strict about who can even have one. while we might soon get custom tatoos,which will be moderated the way you want for a.l. logos becouse they are linked to so many players will always stay very restricted.the submission back log was getting very long. with the new processes that has hopefully been fixed and the format rules are easer to understand. while what you want would be good there are a whole lot of other topics that need working on first before logos have another set of changes."
7/25/2011,"soundwave is right. the problem is that much of that love is focused on incurions. i've run lvl 4s and 5s as a mission runner. 4s are solid, risk free income. i've run sanctums and they are riskier but a bit better income. however, when i get into a good incursion fleet, i make laughably over-the-top income that puts all other income faucets in the game to shame. no risk, no investment in sov or standings, just join a fleet with the right people and laugh all the way to the bank.ccp makes new content, then takes the carrots/sticks concept of getting people to use them to an extreme. older players have seen the trend and follow it to their financial advantage while new players are still scrambling to get in on the income source that by then is so last expansion.as to whs, the problem with whs has always been the ability to stronghold them. not only is it easy to close up incoming whs that can bring risk to your space, but you can build up caps to defend the space which would require a long time with concerted effort for an opposing force to build up the fleet needed to take the residents on. at this rate, whs are going to become more stagnant than null used to be."
7/25/2011,"easily adjusted if they like. change the pay-out (it's static afterall), lp, or lp store itself. but, i agree it's over the top atm.malcanis' law in action. no change can ever benefit newbies more than vets in this game.that was exactly my point and the reason why i agreed lower class wh space shouldn't have high-ends. it's simply too much incentive to entrench in them and that's exactly what we've been seeing. it makes perfect sense in a c6 where cap invasions are not just possible, but a matter of time, but the low class wormholes should be solely given over to transient life, subcaps, etc. there should be no happy corner to hole up in and reap rewards whist garunteeing that you will out-gun your opponents due to game mechanics."
7/25/2011,highsec peons should know their place.
7/25/2011,"hey guys, i need some help with wording for a proposal i want to bring up in the assembly hall.here's the long version: right now, when flying in space your camera stays static relative to, well, space. your ship spins and turns beneath you and your camera doesn't move unless you move it. this is all well and good, but i find myself using a lot of mouse clicks to make my camera face forward relative to my ship, because i'm ocd like that, and i like that view. it feels more natural to me.so i'd like a simple option that lets me tell my camera drone to stay put relative to my ship, and let the rest of the universe twirl away as it will. kind of like the...unique...maneuver the shuttle pulls at the very beginning of this:"
7/25/2011,corrected that typo for you.
7/25/2011,considering they didn't bother to learn a damned thing about wormholes then started calling for their nerfs when they learned their bots didn't have exclusive abc access...
7/25/2011,"the current csm suffors the socalled "" carpal tunnel syndrom ""this narrows their vieuws in just one focussed direction without a broader perspective.now they have this [csm] july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcing.why bother to look where the most people gave their complaints and suggestions and actually do some of the work they were elected for?they just open a poll so people select it for them so all they have to do is look for ways to adapt it in a fashion they have to put in a minimal effort. unless it suits their own purposes.we wouldn't want them to do any boring stuff would we.the csm is effectivly avoiding any of the real issues and focussing on their own projects. which they can do because their pets blockvoted them in.this csm will never be a csm for all players but a csm for the loudest mouths. which in this case are the null sec carebears that want it easier.more income.more targets ( easier targets ofcourse too)more infrastructure because high sec has that so they want that too.nerf high sec to death and force people into their arms because they need fresh blood to sustain their outcries for more. specially with new elections they will have to blockvote their candidates in again and that only works if you have the people to blockvote.i wouldn't be surprised if krutoj holds chair next csm. there are enough alliances in 0.0 now who owe him thanks for their new parkingspaces in venal and surroundings so white noise and raiden will most likely deliver a lot of votes towards that goal.i am expecting a countermove from the goons to get their mittani in the chair soon enough.they will already be plotting in that regard.csm is just as much about metagaming as playing in 0.0"

7/26/2011,bumping for great justice.
7/26/2011,"it's trivial to fit a hulk to have ~30k ehp (more if you can arrange gang bonuses), in which case, 3 thrashers would have died to concord long before killing his hulk. furthermore, if they got his pod in hi-sec, then he must have either been afk or he never even tried to warp his pod out.conclusion: untanked hulk was killed while the pilot was afk.you can't balance game mechanics around people who make no effort whatsoever to protect themselves."
7/26/2011,"i agree to both points here.you should protect yourself more, else you are asking for it. but fitting to defend like a tank in hisec shouldn't be the norm.insurance should not pay for concorded ships. not at least the standard insurer. perhaps make a commune pirate insurance fund that is funded and operated by pirate players if you want 'pirate' insurance."
7/26/2011,"so, now a measely 30k ehp makes you able to defend yourself against gankers? lol. if only. and so what if they lose a couple of trashers? that's the definition of 'suicide' ganking, remember? :)and besides, a 30k ehp hulk is a very inefficient hulk. it's not really a viable setup (other than used by some posters in their htfu responses).you can, however, balance game mechanics around people who are allowed to kill with near impunity, and get paid out by concord for their losses upon doing so. especially if it's high-sec."
7/26/2011,"preys take all the risks and predators lose nothing even if they fail the gank? quite a hello kitty world to the pirates.concord blow up your ship and then pay for it is just absurd.i simply suggest the solution of removing all insurance pay to ship loss within criminal countdown, no matter by concord or by other player, and self-destruction.but since the blog in 2008 alrady said ""it will be fixed in near future"",why is nothing done yet?"
7/26/2011,"3x t2 strip miners aren't a viable setup? really? why not, may i ask? to me that seems pretty decent. yeah, you dont get to fill all your low slots with mlus. well boo hoo, i dont get to fill all my lowslots with damage mods either.miners can chose to take the risk of fitting minimal tank in order to gain extra reward, but the flip side of that is that if they fit more tank, they reduce both. gosh, it's almost as if they have to make a choice based on their playstyle, what the sec status of their chosen system is, etc.at the end of the day, the eve economy depends on ship destruction. everyone takes their turn and there's no reason that miners alone should be exempt from this - especially as they're the ultimate beneficiary. the idea that miners should be able to sit, untanked and safe, in hi-sec churning out minerals without fear of ship loss is as obviously foolish and unbalanced as the idea that there should be pvp ships with 100% resists for people who dont like the idea of losing fights.fyi a hulk with 3x t2 strips can be fitted to have over 39k ehp with a gang booster in system. that's tanked to the level where two battleships would probably fail to kill it, especially if the hulk pilot used a few trivial tactics like orbiting his can (t1 1400s have appalling tracking and hulks are small).but the idea that the game should be balanced to suit people who refuse to fit any tank, refuse to actively pilot their ships and refuse to accept that they are at risk them same as anyone else when they undock is simply whining for special treatment.ps as an exercise for the interested student: what do you think might happen to low-end mineral prices if hi-sec mining was made safe?"
7/26/2011,"ah you want ""realistic"" insurance. i will repeat the offer i have made many times: i will support more realistic insurance if you will support more realistic police. you know, ones that don't turn up within 30 seconds, always get the right guy and always win every fight, and don't charge anything for their services.to date, no-one has accepted my offer. no idea why. if i wasn't constantly being assured that concord have no deterrent effect, that punishments for aggroing are essentially zero, and that hi-sec is more dangerous than 0.0, i might start to assume that people just want the game to be ""realistic"" when it suits them and dont care at all about game balance."
7/26/2011,"maybe nobody responded to you because you didn't really give 1 proposal but as laundry basket of griefs with some so impractical that cannot be implemented effectively. if you want to implement a tax system so that the police are paid, or have a way for the police to 'investigate' crimes then at least you will have a proposal, instead of just a sarcastic rebuttal to a thread.i too would like a working 'crimimal justice system' and i even went as far as suggested some foundations for its implementation in past threads (search for 'money laundering' and lowsec fixes), but the short answer is that its impractical with present technology, unfortunately."
7/26/2011,"what you are saying are all conceptually true, but you have to make a provision for beginners, who really are just learning their way in the game in highsec and should be entitled to a gank free existence. (though beginners would not likely be flying a hulk) given they are helping the economy that you are benefiting from in the end. without miners, you would be paying ever increasing costs for your mods and ships, so you should cut them a little proverbial slack. eventually, a depression would occur if all the miners were thinned out.that being said, yes they should be thinking more about how to balance their defence vs profit ratio.but all that being as it were... pend insurance should not pay for ships loss under criminal flag. its a simple, easy to implement distinction. criminals should be penalized for 'farming' in highsec. they are not losing much anyway, as these are suicide attempts anyway, and they won't be in expensive ships. in lowsec, insurance will pay, as you are not criminally flagged ganking.this is fair to both sides."
7/26/2011,i believe someone made a law about using that argument.
7/26/2011,"1. u said so yourself that beginners don't fly hulks so how would suicide gank nerfing help them? it doesn't; it only helps the non-beginners who r still too scared to use the same space they farm their killmails in.2. funny, the many hulks in high sec belts, overabundance of minerals and their low prices say otherwise. how did u come up with this ""depression""? is this occurring in some alternate universe of yours?care to explain that part 'cause in case u didn't know, gcc still happens in low sec."
7/26/2011,"well if we boost concord the macroers will go wild. all players must be in position of being possibly killed. dont break the sandbox idea.don not boost concord, nerf security status cleaning. now it is possible to get from -10 to 2 in one day in a bomber in just one day. adjust it to the timer, not to the systems (like isk rewards).cutting insurance is quit stupid. besides 200 000 isks of insurance for one thrasher wont change anything. and bigger gankers are dependent on security status, just nerf security status."
7/26/2011,"(cosmetic only)if ccp manages to get some more revenue in vanity items that's fine by me. everyone is entitled to spend their money has they think its best and if some player wishes to have a monacle and a golden bs i don't care, as long as that won't give a player an unfair advantage over other's. if on the other hand this items affect the gameplay in any other way other than visual then ccp's eula and their stance on macro user's and isk farmers will have no meaning at all.in business you ""never change a winning horse"". for eve this basicly reflects what the players love most about this game which is the sandbox and the fact that you have to earn everything you have in game."
7/26/2011,"+1brilliant idea! ccp, please read op :)"
7/26/2011,+1 to the op and +1 to this amendment :)
7/26/2011,supported!

7/26/2011,"why not they go for aoe warp bubbles, it's the same thing, but instead of scramming you, they just damage you, a lot.i would say the anchorable kind would need to be launched for corp/alliance, no drama llama here, move along ."
7/26/2011,do you have any thoughts about the mine types i mentioned? or is it aoe or nothing?
7/26/2011,you can't catchup. that is the point. can you catchup to people in real life? can a freshmen catchup to a senior in uni? can you catchup to your siblings?
7/26/2011,"not supported just because even if you can't catch up skill points wise, you can become deadly if you understand what your current skills can do and if you understand game mechanicsalso you can buy characters from others which basicaly means catching up and most times even surpasing most characters. so basicaly there is already a very nice and clean way to do what you want to do."
7/26/2011,annoying as hell !
7/26/2011,still working as intended? :(
7/26/2011,"seriously? why the hell did i make my alt's breasts so huge if they're not even going to jiggle? and, can anyone tell me what are the hot keys for making my busty alt take off her shirt in cq? it's not like someone is watching!!!"
7/26/2011,"c'mmon ccp this is all about immersion!!! voluptuous breasts immersed in nano-elastic bra's that adapt to gravity shifts! nex implants for all sizes! nipple piercings... realistic feed-back with pupil dilatation and pants bulging, while cloth deforms realistically to accommodate the new volume. small wrinkle's forming on t-shirts as the jugs jiggle... plastic surgery as a new profession, with those superstensile plastix finally finding their buyers on the market. nanopaste implant repair for modules damaged during sharp corners or abrupt drops out of warp that smash the delicate pilot face-first into the pod.just imagine ganking that freighter to find it was full of plastic implants... and as the last shot ruptures the plastic wrap they all drift into space... an hemorrhage of fake boobies floating in zero g. and as they float towards the speechless passer-by and enter the near field of view those 3d glasses finally start to make sense as you see the little ball-shaped objects wizzing by your head. it's all in the details folks! one innocent feature altering eve forever and having more gameplay impact than all the identical cqs superimposed into a manyfold! srsly... this wasn't even up for voting in the croudsourcing eve is real! make boobs real!!!"
7/26/2011,if ccp implemented a system where everyone in the militias knew when plexes were entered (and got rid of the stupid npcs) then i would be in favor of giving rewards for plexing. this thread goes into considerable detail about the nitty gritty pros and cons of very many proposed changes.
7/26/2011,"awesome idea, i totally support this!"
7/26/2011,"the devs already said they would bring station spinning back in an upcoming patch, so just wait for it."
7/26/2011,\o/ nice idea
7/26/2011,supported for scale~
7/26/2011,supported. my paladin deserves bigger tachyons.
7/26/2011,"in case of turrets, bigger is better"
7/26/2011,"wonderful, another argument based on real lifetm logic. for a sci fi spaceship game. wonderful.these arguments inevitably lead to anime like stupidity like this: yamatoand i would rather not allow eve to degenerate into yet another gundam game.can you see the turrets on a star destroyer? no, and so it should be.edit: not to mention, rl battleships were not much bigger than a small eve cruiser, or destroyer. exactly where you think the sizes looked 'right'."
7/26/2011,"the problem with scale is that it's deceptive without reference. just because a ship is bigger dose not mean that the turret needs to be larger. the picture posted in the thread of the us battleship 'uss iowa', has a calibre size on it's main guns of 410mm, almost half the size of minmatar medium artillery. many of the ships in eve online have totally borked scale. maybe ccp can confirm this, but i don't know if the turrets have been modelled to scale or not. however, this might well be a case of the ships in eve online are just so much bigger than even the largest of sea fairing warships afloat today."
7/26/2011,scale is what makes them appear undersized. not supported
7/26/2011,"yes, my apoc looks pathetic. i can't even zoom in enough to see the guns.this needs to be done"
7/26/2011,actually...yes you can.your just not looking in the right spots.: o p
7/26/2011,it was retained as a issue becouse while fixed the second generation changes = carbon ui broke funtinality and needs tobe tweaking again.
7/26/2011,"too late now, but the fw issues need to be reviewed. there are many duplicate ones that need to be merged.this way the issues will be underrepresented as votes for the same issue will be spread out over several more or less identical issues."
7/26/2011,"for some reason, what i typed didn't show up. i'm not sure i understand your post. this is exactly what i'm suggesting?"
7/26/2011,i agree. it doesn't make any sense it is easier to gain sec status in 0.0 when you can't even loose sec status there.boost brosec.
7/26/2011,"basically, the new player you just allowed to manufacture stuff in one of your pos, can now end the build timer on the almost completed titan. this is not right."
7/26/2011,"install, deliver, and cancel should be 3 separate permissions."
7/26/2011,"if you allow a new player into your corp that is building titans and give him factory manager role, you deserve to have every running job cancelled!edit: also supporting the op, or even better arushia's idea."
7/26/2011,"this should be one of the many permissions issues fixed in upcoming patches, along with pos permissions and one that allows only corpies with it to access fleet fit ship corp hangars"
7/26/2011,1
7/26/2011,"supported.also, it should visually expand as you mine like a pufferfish."
7/26/2011,this is indeed broken.
7/26/2011,proposal each ship class has a maximum number of ships (of any class) that can red box it at a given time.interceptor / t1 frigate - 2assaulty frigate - 3cruiser - 4 battlecruiser - 6battleship - 8whywill make blobbing more difficult/pointless and create better fights.exceptionsjoining a fleet stops this mechanic so an fleet/fleet fight will not be constraigned by these rules.expolitsmanipulating this mechanic e.g. moving about in an intercptor red boxed by two alts is considered an exploit and will get you banned.sketchy idea far from a finished proposal but if something like this mechanic had been in from the start we would probably now see a better game for the solo/small gang players.
7/26/2011,"the option to blob should remain and not be removed outright. several ways to encourage smaller fleets, like:- gangboosters on squad/wing basis. - negative gang bonuses as size increases.- mechanics favouring small over large (objective based sovereignty).- ""chatter"" intel, huge fleets 'detectable' from afar (read: neighbouring systems) due to comms traffic.yes to mechanics that discourage excessive force, no to mechanics that arbitrarily removes it as option."
7/26/2011,"1) you just made pretty nuch anything bc-sized or bigger invulnerable, because logistics can fix it much faster than 8 people can shoot.2) you also just made most ewar ships pointless, as in most cases it wouldn't multiply force projection enough to pay for one less dps ship.3) you are opening fleets for griefing from spies, who can just put one crappy gun on the targets and prevent a significant amout of dps.4) why those arbitrary numbers, and why not a different set of arbitrary numbers?i don't see how having to micromanage what is every single person in a 250 man fleet shooting would create better fights in any way.so, basically, this mechanic will never come to effect? since, you know, most of the time, when two people fly together they form a fleet.how would you monitor and police this?"
7/26/2011,"the blobs will just join a fleet. also, very vulnerable to griefing."
7/26/2011,i really like perpetueum mechanics. blobs get reduction in scan res and some other stuff (not really important stats for fleet fights) and also aoe on death. i don't think they would put it in but it would be nice just for a change.
7/26/2011,"really should just give formations that favor small gangs with agility/speed/sig bonuses, as those would be the benefits of a small fleet in a fight. however, there really isn't a way to prevent people from just making a bunch of fleets, each with the max pilots to still get the bonus. there really isn't a way to stop people from bringing more by restrictions, sticks, or carrots. the fighting mechanics need to change so the benefit isn't overwhelmingly in the favor of putting more pilots in one location. this really works out to the need for a sov overhaul."
7/26/2011,"not supportedthis is a sandbox, not the game for fair pre-arranged fights. linear rules of engagement are for wow, wot and others that are not truly massive. go back to wow, or empire."
7/26/2011,"1) no.2) according to csm minutes, local intel is being revamped so its probably best to wait what comes out of that."
7/26/2011,anyone thinking what the black ops ships need is a covert-ops cloak is blatantly clueless as to their application.
7/26/2011,people want to use them to ninja rat rather than pvp. mostly because they are pretty bad at both. it would be nice if they were more useful. i'd prefer pvp though.
7/26/2011,^thisalso blackops and fleet mentioned together. another one is not blackops and that's not blackops.
7/26/2011,"care to share?1) generic cloak usage + cloaked speed boost + no targeting delay = warp visibly to grid, then cloak up. should the target arrive out of range, motor closer before dropping cloak and firing.so i get there first, and hope my prey comes to me.2) covert jump bridge = the ability to send other troops spies into battlefield.3) covert / generic jump drive = the ability to follow spies/troops into battle. of course, unless there's a cyno back home waiting for you, you're going to be visible the whole way back. while your covops compatriots can cloak through all the camps along the way.so yeah... looks like a black ops should get -close- to the battlefield. then send a recon ahead to light cyno. then he sends more covops into the fray. finally, he turns around, and goes home.what?"
7/26/2011,"while i dont mind t2 bpos, your comparison with limited issue ships is really just stupid. they are, as their name suggests, limited. selling them is a one time business. bpos on the other hand continually produce revenue and if not stupidly lost will do so forever."
7/26/2011,so op did this thread turn out the way you wanted or have u applied to hello kitty online?
7/26/2011,1. your ignorance in this matter is the problem. and your bias towards you not wanting to be war decced is the problem. if you declare war on someone they don't get to choose if it is valid or not. you declared it...period.2. who cares.3. if you don't want to be war decced then don't join a player corp. that simple. stay in the newbie corp and you can't be war decced. don't like that answer? too bad. that is how the game has always been...that is how the players as a whole want it. you...are a minority and probably one of the very very few that think the way you do.in closing...there is no probblem except your misguided belief that something should change because you don't like it. not everybody agrees with you. as far as i can tell nobody that has posted to this thread as of yet has agreed with you.
7/26/2011,"hello all.after incarna was deployed, i gave my character a new outfit. but after i clonejumped, she wear the old one. every single time i have to re-costimation her.it's a little problem and maybe most of you aren't bothered by that, but there should be a option to customize all clones at once. maybe a button like ""adapt clones""cheersernesto"
7/26/2011,oopss sorry error!! delete pls
7/26/2011,"personally i think destroyers are pretty boring ships. just get allot more guns and tank than a frigate. no real tactics or planning. even if you like them there are only 4, and really only 1 that works well. minors would just be thrashers online if you excluded all faction ships. there are very few t1 frigate fits that have a chance against a decent destroyer. but yes i do support this change since its just pirates ships excluded. the problem is allot of this is theory crafting since very little pvp goes on in plexes anyway."
7/26/2011,"if you are, like me, completely overwhelmed by the long list of topics to vote for and have no idea what to vote for, there is an easy solution:follow this link to random.org and copy the numbers to the voting thread. for example:3, 9, 16, 32, 119, 168, 172now all you have to do is make sure your vote adheres to the required format, so you'll have to add your name in front of the list and remove the spaces, like this:example name,3,9,16,32,119,168,172and you're all done!(remember to stick to the rules of the vote: only one vote per active account and the name on the ballot must match the name of the character making the post.)happy voting!"

7/26/2011,is this when crowd sourcing is going wrong?
7/26/2011,re-posted (minus permission) from a thread on the forums of eve university (in all of its insignificance).
7/26/2011,"dear all,i have read in the dev answers threat that it is not possible to rehaul the pos mainly because the art team has stuff to do for a whole year. i am sure there are a few other things of course.the only thing that could be keeping the art team busy for a year is incarna, and i want to say this clearly: players have been demanding an overhaul of pos for more than 5 years.it is far more important that station environment. it is affecting a huge part of the player base, unlike stations which are only for leisure when there is nothing else to do.why are you wasting time on something that will impact 10% of the players in a miscellaneous way and leaving something that is severely impacting at least 60% of the players?do you realize that the difficulty of handling the game is among the main reasons that stops many players from joining after their trial is the extreme unnecessary complexity of interface based things, such as ui, pos, skill training among so many things. virtual goods is an extra source of income when you have a large enough player base on a very stable and accessible game, it's a luxury. the most important aspect of any game is to have a user friendly handling/interface! i suggest that csm raise this issue to ccp."

7/27/2011,"you are obviously not following me when i said depression. which is perhaps my fault for assuming that it's obvious to anyone with a knowledge of econ that if you thin out the miners, workers, farmers, proletariat, you will get price inflation, which will cause a run on the banks, (in eve that would be a buying frenzy on ships and mods and fuel) which will cause the economy to stall as you get a 'flight to quality' in assets. average joes cannot afford bread anymore, and you get a depression, like the one in 1930. get it?gcc? gnu c compiler?"
7/27/2011,"agreed. we can go the sec status route, it deserves its own thread. true true, the pend payouts are small for thrashers, but think about the other ships that one may get criminal flagged in, and the cases where this could happen."
7/27/2011,agreed empire space is policed criminal should not be rewarded.-10 sec status character should also be podded by gate guns and concord on sight !
7/27/2011,"honestly, it might be best if you refrained from making suggestions and comparisons in this thread until you know at least the basics of the subject being discussed.gcc = general criminal countdown. pirating in low sec generates a gcc, just the same as doing it in hi-sec does. the only difference is that there is no concord response in lo-sec. if you jump into hi-sec after committing a crime in lo-sec, you will be concorded."
7/27/2011,"you are so amusing.and no sense of humor.my point only is that if you get killed in lowsec, criminals under gcc still get paid. said in another way, insurance won't pay only if you get concorded. faction police, npc, any other way, it will pay. (including lowsec)"
7/27/2011,"u r obviously mentally incapable of simple reading comprehension. re-read the part where the many hulks in high sec belts, overabundance of minerals and their low prices contradict the alternate universe u're describing. derp. get it? or would u like an explanation in terms even u can understand?and what's your reasoning behind that point? oh other than an alternate universe u're dreading which isn't occurring in eve. i'd normally suggest to step away from the screen but in your case, u might want to alt-tab to the correct one, u know, the one for tranquility; that way, u won't easily mistake some other game for eve."
7/27/2011,worth for ccp to take a look at!
7/27/2011,"i support this proposal. i don't want to see suicide ganking nerfed, but i don't believe criminal actions should get insurance paybacks. rl insurances wouldn't do it for criminals. it shouldn't be any different in eve."
7/27/2011,"on the rag aren't we? i'm going to ignore your ad hominem comments as it only serves to erode your credibility. calm down.at any case back to econ 101, the current state of the universe (overabundance of hulks and minerals whatnot) is supporting the current prices yeah?, so if you reduce the supply, then you get higher prices, et cetera. you could argue that that may not be a bad thing, and maybe you would be right, but any sudden large destabilizing change to the market is a bad thing."
7/27/2011,how to fix mineral/isk sources and sinks is another story and should be viewed in that regard. just make a new assembly hall thread and discuss it there - it shouldnt be fixed by players suicide ganking.imo hulkageddon is a huge excuse for an event thats just a cover for some fun in a sandbox.
7/27/2011,"alas, i can only read what you write. if you mean death by concord, say so. if you mean criminally flagged, say that. they're different things. if you mean one but say the other, then it's hardly another's fault for not catching your meaning is it?"
7/27/2011,supported.
7/27/2011,supported.
7/27/2011,"this is a long time problem ccp needs to address. i support this proposal. i like to see a queue for onlining, offlining, and unachoring pos modules. i also would like to see ccp fix the problem where i type in my pos password and not see my parked ships get launched 200-300k away. that really sucks. why would i park my ships inside my shields and see them get launched out when i type password to get back inside the shields? doesn't make sense. at least give me the option to launch ships out my pos. i've had 3 orcas launched out my pos because of the game mechanic. i wanted to setup a pos seperate from my corp pos to protect my important capital ships from theft. with launching ships, i can't manage to do that."
7/27/2011,"reactors and siloses shouldn't require starbase config , it is just silly."
7/27/2011,"good proposal, agreed."
7/27/2011,agreed. there are features i got excited about that never went anywhere great (namely faction warfare and exploration). i want them to stop making the equivalent of in-game mini-games and instead take a long hard look at everything we have already and fatten those features up.argus
7/27/2011,they never listen. they'll just add to their nex.
7/27/2011,i support this proposal. i see this more profitable than their nex that ccp has recently done. i think there a larger base of player who might want to change their names than buy a $70 eye patch ccp offers in their nex.
7/27/2011,this ties in with another proposal to remove all ancient trial accounts and what have you to free up names. supported.
7/27/2011,"i dont think you get the bit where the op is proposing deleting old and unactivated trial accounts. i support this generally, and support it additionally because of my own situation. i dont consider deleting trial accounts that are unused and have been unused for 5 years or more to even possibly inconvenience the modern playerbase.now ofcourse you are going to explain to me how exactly having several thousand unused trial accounts from ~2006 on database provides any positive's to ccp (except for that sole one where they boast about how many accounts they have) or the playerbase. ofcourse, if you decide not to explain this, kindly gtfo"
7/27/2011,"i support this proposal. especially on trial accounts. for people that haven't been on awhile and were not trial accounts, maybe a different proposal. i suggest those have their names stripped away from their characters and not deleted. if they decide to come back, they would have to make a new name but not lose assets or skill points. i know a lot of people that just want to take breaks from eve. just a suggestion on that matter. trial accounts though, delete them all."
7/27/2011,"if i understand it correctly, please keep in mind that i haven't played the game, but they sound an awful lot like laser towers from x3. which in ones or twos weren't an issue but got dangerous in larger groups, though it mostly depended on ship type.those could be useful, almost like personal gate guns, the only thing i could see being an issue with that style is overuse/lagging, though if it required a certain sov upgrade than it would work, max around one gate or something."
7/27/2011,"i thinks would be a interesting. i believe you should be able to use them, but only in certain areas in the game. i think should limited to where you can use them, like anywhere that is 0.0 space. there should also be a counter to the mines as well. either make a new ship type, minesweeper, or make modules that can dectect and destroy them. plus there should be some kind of limit on how many you can use or something. if mines do come back into play, there should be a lot careful thought on how they are suppose work. this is a very tricky area."
7/27/2011,"you need to redesign your proposal. as the guy above said, its too tricky. make your idea less vague with an application in the eve universe. maybe i just dont understand what you mean. what reason is there to include a new weapon system into eve?just for variety of weapon systems?"
7/27/2011,"when it comes to real life and real world business, some people will beat others in spite of the time factors involved. hehe. :di've been unable to get some friends into eve, mostly because of a mindset against any games that have been around for a long time. they get into games when they're new and then stick around to become uber vets, they refuse to be noobs in a game that's already got big boys etc. i don't think that faster training times would change that mentality.personally, i do not find eve's training time a deterrent. it's a very interesting game. if i get to a point where the training time is making me jump up and down, i'll do something else while the training gets where i want it to be.i understand the plex and character trading (micro) transactions to be a mechanism that counters illegal gold farmers/character trading outfits. i don't regard these to be products of the eve economy, although that's a smooth rationalization. both plex and character purchases give tangible ingame benefit for real world money. still ccp benefits, goldfarmers lose, and it could keep eve online thriving in bad economical times. so that's enough for me.sapph"
7/27/2011,"i dont support this proposal. no newplayer should be able to come in and just have it easy. i for one wish my characters could catch up to other players with higher sp, but i also know they had their accounts longer than i and had the time and patience to have that high sp. new players should just learn to wait for things like the rest of the community or go play world of warcraft where there is a level cap."
7/27/2011,"supported.i target at least 3 acceleration gates a night. i never noticed that the overview froze when ctrl was pressed before, but considering how insanely handy that is, i can't believe they got rid of it.dunno how relevant it is, but having to click back outside the drone window for drone commands to be comprehended is also pretty annoying. at least let the drone hotkeys still work when the drone window is highlighted..."
7/27/2011,"+1in a mission, i double click the next accel gate to approach it, then start the ctrl+click down the overview to lock enemies.oops, locked the gate too, now my hot weapons want to start pounding the accel gate and i've wasted a targeting slot.please fix."
7/27/2011,thank you for the support so far people. it's clear this affects people from all walks of life.
7/27/2011,going to give this another nudge back to the front page. it is a very fair and balanced proposal. need some more thumbs up for this guys.
7/27/2011,thanks for bumping. forgot to chime in on this.no support.will make non blockade runner indies even more gankable.
7/27/2011,"use a orca with a cloak. thats what i do. anywho, a cloaky pos does sound cool though trinkets. makes it all stargate atlantis lol. i like a cloaky pos, but i don't want them really in the game."
7/27/2011,"personally owned structures have been requested for quite some time. since the pos of today are more of a corporate owned structure, with far greater upkeep and maintenance than the average player should be required to spend.we can anchor a secure container in deep space, with nothing required to maintain it, other than poking it with a stick once a month.so why not allow much smaller and far more manageable ""pos"".outposts, and no not the big ones...- amarr refining outpost- amarr repair outpost- amarr tactical outpost- caldari refining outpost- caldari repair outpost- caldari tactical outpost- gallente outpost- minmatar refining outpost- minmatar repair outpost- minmatar tactical outpostthe models are already in game, all ccp needs to do is put 2 and 2 together and give people small structures for their own use.whose to say these small outposts could even support external defenses like a pos? or even a force field bubble bigger than a single ship?"
7/27/2011,"anything that helps pos's be better than their current boring, soul destroyingly boring, and even more boring not to mention ugly and uninspiring selves..."
7/27/2011,i think it's worth looking into.
7/27/2011,i support boobies!! i'm ready to launch a in-game campaign if i must. my full 100% support.
7/27/2011,"we should all wear i <3 boobies bracelets to show our support for jiggling breasts.also, we should fix shadows, they're horrifying. didn't ccp develop soft shadows? my computer can handle it, do want."
7/27/2011,please please please!!!!!!!!!! fix gallante boats and hybrid turrets!!!!!!!!!!!
7/27/2011,"fyi, the csm has several active proposals concerning fw, and they can be voted for (by you) via their current crowdsourcing prioritization.see the dev bog for info... i highly recommend putting in votes for the fw issues if you care about getting changes."
7/27/2011,"boo hooshame what x gallentius has to say is the most interesting, and frankly only noteworthy contribution to this thread (lol yes even mine now hurr durr); and yet you wish to dismiss it."
7/27/2011,aren't there enough mechanics where you shoot red x's in eve already? why not make fw occupancy the *one* mechanic in all of eve that promotes small gang and solo pvp? plus i think giving bonuses to the winning side will just make everyone pile on the winning side.
7/27/2011,"sure, why not i suppose. i support ya. nothing wrong with studying and reviewing fw."
7/27/2011,"a star destroyer has a bunch of little guns on the sides and all around (i know this because i am a nerd). thats more of choice of guns and roles then saying that arbitrary a large ship doesn't need larger cannons. lots of small guns might be better for smaller targets (frigs and fighters of the rebels, it is called a destroyer after all). and i think the ship might not have the largest guns because it is also has more of a role of a carrier. star destroyers if you watched the movies are used for transporting many tie fighters, troopers and even those giant 4 footed walkers, and the smaller 2 footed ones. ever noticed that before the empire does anything on the ground a fleet of star destroyers are in space? so it isn't a literal battleship, if you think about it. the galatic empire engineers could have chosen to have the same hull, get rid of the large cargo/troop/fighter bays and opt for larger reactors or ammo storage to power 8 large main cannons able to blast equally impressive holes in the largest of ships. furthermore for big ship on other big ship combat it makes more sense to have the largest caliber guns, for piercing shields or armor. use a pea shooter that is normally used for swating flies and its just going to bounce. just seroulsy look at real battleships, the 'main' guns are decently sized. not all guns are but those are secondary weapons and doorstops, not to be confused with main armament (secondary weapons eve does not really deal with save rockets, only main guns are counted with a hard limit of 8).not only does having decently sized guns on a ship make it look cooler. it adds a bit of realism. furtherpoint the presence of other things out of scale is only a further sign that more things should defiantly be fixed in that department.on the same subject frig guns should maybe be reduced in size (though personally i think while maybe a bit too large are still more in scale then others for being main weapons). and defiantly carriers should be five times larger then they are currently (so 5 times larger then a battleship), and super carriers should be 10 times as massive as a regular carrier."
7/27/2011,star destroyer isn't a battleship? what battleships does the empire use then?... wait... i'm not going to let you draw me into a fictitious sci-fi argument that will end up in a star destroyer vs enterprise debate. the point is that you only get ridiculous sized (proportionally) guns in japanese anime. your real life example doesn't apply because you eve cruisers are bigger than the uss iowa.
7/27/2011,"exactly my point.you can't see them without looking for them, (with a microscope). as it should be."
7/27/2011,star destroyer suck. end of discussion.ot: i fully approve this idea. and taking a look at this is imo worth it before i have to start explaining it again.
7/27/2011,battleship turrets look like they're at the correct scale on cruisers or battle cruisers. so supported.
7/27/2011,speaking of the yamato and iowa.
7/27/2011,made a comparison myself.the 800mms are bigger then the 1400mms...
7/27/2011,what happened to hybrids ??
7/27/2011,yes. long overdue.
7/27/2011,signed
7/27/2011,as long as it doesn't give an easy grind for killing -10's noob ships or whatever then this suggestion has merit. encouraging anti-piracy would be a geniue stroke by ccp (or people like the op).
7/27/2011,"your heart is in the right place, but there is a big loophole here. pirates will shoot their own alts to boost up their standings. unless you make it so that you also have to have a positive standing in order to benefit from this, but that just means that pirates will try to keep their status around 0, and have a -10 alt around to 'farm sec status' with.funny you mentioned the bounty system. as this is exactly the problem with the current bounty system."
7/27/2011,"as with all things, nothing is unexploitable. i do both appreciate and welcome you're input. it only helps this issue become more viable and closer to being considered by the csm and ccp."
7/27/2011,"for the record, while i understand your reasons for wanting this change, i still disagree with the merits of your arguments in favor of this change. i continue to support the current theft flagging mechanics unless a better idea can be proposed.edit: just had a thought. i remember someone proposing an alternative in the thread that begat this one, wherein the wardec'ing corporation pays extra for exclusive loot rights. also, another alternative i just thought of and like even better, perhaps a non-interference clause in the yulai conventions that give the wardec'ing corporation the right to a discounted and/or shorter-timed war-dec on the thief's corporation or on just the thief himself. (still with paying for the right to the short single pilot aggression timer.)"
7/27/2011,mine would be easier. very clear. you steal there are reprcussions. not like now.
7/27/2011,it's like that now. you steal from the owner and there are repercussions.
7/27/2011,"so wait, what?adam and bob get into a fight, with chuck sitting on the sidelines watching.adam blows up bob's ship.bob's wreck belongs to bob's corp.but since adam already has aggro to bob's corp, he can take the loot without problems.if chuck takes the loot from bob's wreck, he will gain aggro to bob's corp.so when bob and his corp get back to the wreck, they can continue shooting at adam, and can start shooting at chuck as well.sounds like repercussions already exist.hence why this thread has zero support so far. concord is not your mommy, for you to run to saying ""he stole my cookie!""concord is your dad, saying ""well, kick his ass and get your cookie back!"""
7/27/2011,"you either cannot read or dont understand.i pay concord for a war dec on a corp/alliance. i kill a pilot in that corp. while killing his other corpmate a noob corp loot stealer flies in takes the loot from the first pilots wreck. he then warps and docks in his 1 million isk thrasher. he is able to undock fly to the gate i am sitting on and stay there safely due to the fact i cannot shoot him because concord currently wont let me and the corp i am at war with cannot come because i there protecting the loot theif. concord is your dad, saying ""well, kick his ass and get your cookie back!"" yeah i am trying to get the rights to get my cookie back. as for not getting zero support. its up for review by the csm. appearently a few empire war people think its important."
7/27/2011,so we have some people saying it's a fair mechanic about it being empire still and all that jazz. i'm still going back to my original comment about being able to pod my corp mate in highsec but i can't receive a remote sensor boost from him or reps outside the being gcc. kinda seems broken too me. just sayin
7/27/2011,"distraction tactic? :-)that's a completely different topic and comparing 'unfairness' factors are not fruitful in debates.incidentally, that tactics main legitimate use is for wargames and fleet exercises within corps."
7/27/2011,i don't support this proposal. i don't believe in fair fights.
7/27/2011,"continually produce revenue, yes. but so do t1 bpos.the amount that a t2 bpo can make is the price of the bpc copy. either you save yourself from having to buy it in the production of your part, or you just make and sell these bpcs. it's not that bad because the price of these are controlled by people using invention to make their own bpcs.is it a bit of an advantage over someone who has to resort to invention or buying a bpc? yes, a bit, but it's nowhere near the money factory that you think it is. it's advantage is almost completely nullifiable by the invention profession. if you despise them, then start an invention guild and undercut their bpc prices."
7/27/2011,itt: people whining about t2 bpos while technetium moon owners are the ones creaming 90% of the profit from the t2 supply chain.
7/27/2011,hell yea we are.
7/27/2011,"why buy a t2 bpo if doesn't hold some kind of advantage over copy/inventing? people spend billions for t2 bpos for a reason, because of its significant advantage. invention works just fine. t2 bpos should be removed from the game."
7/27/2011,what does the competition regulation say to t2 bpo holdings?
7/27/2011,"currently, ship bonuses are not applying to drones (ie damage/hp). there is a hideous work around which is logging off and back on again whilst in a station or in space (waiting for your ship to disappear) which is supposed to fix the issue but i find this rarely works. this means i (or anyone else who uses drone boats) can not pvp at all. i have no idea until it's too late whether or not my ship is performing how it should.please csm. apply pressure to ccp to get this fixed asap instead of messing with the stupid ****ing nex store that has nothing to do with gameplay!"
7/27/2011,lets bring attention to this.i dont have droneboats so everything is fine for me.
7/27/2011,"..with exception to leaving the system. if you probed out a wormhole, for example, and left it without bookmarking it you should be able to warp back to it from your solar system map. alternatively add the ability to ""trace your steps"" and warp back to the point you entered warp from"
7/27/2011,waste dev time because you are too lazy to bookmark ?no tx
7/27/2011,next time you will learn to bookmark your sigs. should be a lesson learned and not repeated. i consider this a waste of dev time myself. i don't support this proposal.
7/27/2011,"actually...so long as you haven't switched ships yet, your scanner window will still have the last set of signatures you'd picked up.also, when you visit a wormhole, it will put an ""unstable wormhole"" marker on your solar system map. so you could just drop probes again, and scan that location to get the sig hit.oh, and bm next time."
7/27/2011,"lmao. who hasn't been griefed from other corps? cry me a river and go play wow and complain to them about unfairness. better yet girlie, go play hko."
7/27/2011,"i like it the way it is right now, but i may like limiting mercoxit to wh space though."
7/27/2011,"two i can think of. your standard skill hardwiring affects 1 pilot. i'll be honest, i don't really ask whats in my comrades heads but i bet no one other then the supercarriers run that implant a lot. i'm guessing supply for that item is low as the demand is low, but when someone does want one they are willing to afford it for their supercapital and / or 5 some odd billion x-type full officer fit mission golem / rattlesnake / stupid expensive fit shield thing. so really your implant is once again my argument that a cs pilot to do his job has to blow the equivalent of a capital ship mod to do the role of a battlecruiser. in the case of the golem or whatever that thing is a trophy ship. they want to stick the biggest, most expensive crap on there and have the isk to burn to do it. comparing a cs pilot wanting to be helpful to a mission carebear is apples to a steak dinner. orange doesn't work cause as they are both fruits its still in the ballpark.the second is the rate people pod cs pilots. in the jumbo fleet fights it is lower, but i could still safely say that its greater then they pod bs's or whatever as the enemy doesn't want the pilot to fly over to a offgrid carrier (offensive) or dock (defensive) and just hop in another damnation as you can fit a few per carrier and infinite in a outpost. in a little fight you always try to pod him as your gatecamp, roam, whatever is still going though there do to the want to screw over your enemies and drain them. with the exception of maybe a claymore (cs), huggin (combat recon), and arazu (force recon) in the fleet where the claymore better be running the information warfare mod the opposing team will pod the cs knowing that if he wanted to do his job properly hes got at least 50 mil in that skull.arguably you could say that well the supercaptials run slave implants or things like your kva-2000 and get podded too. i'd then ask you to look at a sc only pilot and ask how many times he gets killed and podded in relation to a cs, and also the percentage of their implants to the ship"
7/27/2011,why not put them in loyalty point stores?
7/27/2011,"organizing contacts in folders isn't a new idea. matter of fact, ccp allowed you to organize your contacts in folder before they came up with their new system of keeping contacts. as you are aware, ccp lets you add a contact by giving them a personal standing to yourself. this is great, but i wish they never got rid of being able to use folders as well. i use to be able to organize my contacts on why i added them to my contacts. i like to keep contacts organized on why i want to keep in contact with them. by either wanting to kill them, minining, keep a eye on known enemy titan pilots, or business and trade partners. i like the individual standing, but i want to see folder intergrated back into contacts."
7/27/2011,hell yes. i like to see a dev road map.
7/27/2011,"i would like to request that the export feature be brought back as well, it saves a lot of time & hassle.also would like to second the idea that ccp's response was dismal, surely the game should be to players wishes?"
7/27/2011,yes...loot log export was a vital part of the payroll process for my corp. needs to be returned badly.
7/27/2011,this needs to come back!
7/27/2011,"to whom it may concern,i would concur with the op on this. eve engineering has been using the loot export feature basiclly since it was added to automaticlly process mining operations accounting, billing, invoicing, performance metrics and audits. it was one of the primary inputing into our mining tracking systems that feeds to our bank software. since it's removal we have had to type in the loot history manually on a daily basis. i have lessed the pain by writing a loot history data entry program that assumes alot of data for you but the old way of right click export was way better. i have filed bug reports and petition with no success. i would perfer to see it logged just like any other chat channel so the file is written to automaticlly on a disconnect or session change. that file could then be picked up, compared, parsed, and inserted directly into the database with no human work needed. that way miners could have a physdo real time statistics on their operations. i could bring back the isk/hour meter to the ingame browser.and why is ccp soundwave not a fan of export features? this troubles me. for the general web developer and industrialist i could not see any reason not to have more exportable data. in fact ccp devs could take this opertunity to better the feature and make us all happy. -respectfullycomdscxo ee"
7/27/2011,i support this proposal.
7/27/2011,"i moved this out of the main crowd-sourcing page so my vote could be counted.34,143: docking timers should be changed for aggressors. corporations issuing war decs should also be given a longer docking timer. they are the ones wanting a war and should not be able to play docking games if the war is not going their way. i see no point in someone war decing and then turtleing up, or allowing an attempted ganker, who fails, the chance to dock up right away.47,171: mining system wide, comets. this will help in keeping belts from drying up to fast, and the ability for ice and minerals to come from comets. also ccp can add some danger to mining from rogue rocks or debris flying around the belt and off the comet. the rocks and debris are able to be targeted and shot at, or slow so you can move your ship out of the way."
7/27/2011,good post. you mad?
7/27/2011,i really doubt the mittani needs any help trolling these forums..
7/27/2011,"to skip over the whole mass limit for a hulk in a c1 issue (because that should be obvious). i'd mainly like to say that from actually living in a wormhole, though my play time is poop all at the moment, the risk will actually increase if you were to try to mine in a wormhole that close to jita.the logic being that when you get a high concentration of players in one area the chance that one of them is in the mood to go wormhole diving is increased, and that you end up having a very bad day.to remove these ores from any wormhole is a very silly idea, and my best suggestion is for the csms who have never lived in w space to do a bit more research before anything like this happens. i'm pretty sure they would be high on the list of people who would tell me to do the same if i started to comment on 0.0 and sov mechanics and started making elementary mistakes."

7/28/2011,for black ops range i completely disagree :in 0.0 you already what we can call a ghost camp who sometimes can decide to be on and scramble one ship and activate is cyno to jump and destroy you.for the moment the only way to counter that is to also ghost camp system where are the possible bo and fleet to attack you.so if a guy can jump through the whole universe no fun.other situation you want to do a roaming or solo pvp (which is almost impossible nowadays) if you take a target somewhere he can covert cyno you from i don't know where.i think it's a bit unfair situation for that too so no more range or get a titanor please if you do that allow cap and super cap to jump through gate
7/28/2011,"for the gun why not include a setting except for launcher.this setting should include soemthing like ratio range dps tracking with some emphasis among the races.for exemple you can gain more tracking on a hybrid, more range on a projectile, more dps on laser ?something like that and of course this setting should be done in station.the other parts of those change should be done in the same way on ships.more dps, more pg need, less tankmore range less tankmore tracking, more cpu less fast like this it add a bit of surprise on the fleet config and lead to the need of more stategies in real time."
7/28/2011,"t1 cruisers are quite craptastic because they can't fit into any roles in fleets. they need to have substantial bonus to one narrow area to compare with t2. for example give omen 10% greater range than zealot, stabber 10% faster than vagabond.generally i think t1 cruisers should have more range because they aren't fast enough to evade dmg or have big enough tank to take dmg. battlecruisers are kinda the bane for cruisers cause they are just too good or have the right qualities for fleets.so i'd go with something like remove one cruiser 'per level' bonus and give them static +50% optimal/speed/falloff bonus. noob friendly and role giving fix. offcource to fit the long range guns they need wsome other fixes too but here's the general idea. and not every cruiser needs those bonuses...like the ewar cruisers."
7/28/2011,"- remove the tier system and buff the underdog t1 cruisers.- nerf battlecruisers so they don't obsolete cruisers to such a ridiculous degree. - increase cruiser mobility across the board, right now the speed gap between t1 cruisers and battlecruisers is w"
7/28/2011,"ccp needs to go back to the roots to the beginning of eve look how things where back then look at what ships had which roles look at the doctrine of all the races and sub races,pirate factions and then look at how the new things got added what has been changed to what effect and how those changes evolved though time and the following patches by doing this patch by patch, change by change there will eventually be balance amen"
7/28/2011,"mea culpa.okay, so then back to the argument, are you in accordance with me? does it sound fair/sound not to pay insurance to those concorded? i mean, i loath to use rl justifications normally, but our own car insurance doesn't pay if you crash your getaway car while heisting a bank :)"
7/28/2011,i agree its bad game design. i would like to see a nerf of that mechanic.most people are saying it should be still possible to gank but with much more effort.
7/28/2011,"yes, i would agree with that sentiment. i'm not trying to get rid of gankers, i'm just trying to make crime not pay in that way. you will still have thrasher ganks, and that's fine. (its eve afterall) but you will make a criminal think twice about ganking a freighter with a bs gang, unless they are sure of the loot drop will make it worth it. and that's all i'm trying to say, and steven levitt said it best, no life insurance for suicide bombers!**actually his quote was more like ""why do suicide bombers not have life insurance?"""
7/28/2011,"i think it's worth remembering that eve ""insurance"" is a ship replacement mechanism in a game, not a contractually agreed payment made by a legal entity working in a framework of laws that closely resembles the one we live in. it bears only the most superficial resemblence to the financial service we call insurance in our real lives.insurance for gankers does seem nonsensical at first sight, but it isn't more nonsensical than concord is in the first place. it's certainly a lot less nonsensical than an ""insurance"" company that only requires a single 30% premium.paying insurance to gankers is no more unrealistic than paying insurance to pirates, mission-runners, people in wars, people who live in 0.0 or any other common ship loss scenario. no ""real"" insurance company would pay a single cent on at least 99% of the ship losses in eve. why pick out suicide gankers for special treatment?perhaps the simplest fix would be to rename the service from ""insurance"" to ""pre-paid hull salvaging contract"" or some such, and change the message to ""pend salvage drones have recovered sufficient material from your ships hull to pay you xyz isk"". then people wouldn't get all bent out of shape about the apparent contradictions of calling a ship replacement mechanism ""insurance""."
7/28/2011,"except that concord rules explicitly state that break it's laws and your ship is forfeit. i'm not going to argue the inconsistencies in concord or their mandate. but just because something doesn't make sense isn't a good reason to make it more non sensical. not getting paid by insurance is in line with the ""intended"" concord philosophy, which is that aggressing in high sec will cost you. you cannot mitigate these costs by running away from concord nor should you be able to insure away your ship. at any rate, the cost of most ships are less than the mods on them but anyway, it's the principle that's worth discussing. :)"
7/28/2011,"and what do u define as a ""large destabilizing change""? and be sure to use past events, not events that u ""magically predict"" is gonna suddenly happen when nothing has changed for years. if anyone's on the rag, it's u, seeing as how u're still so butthurt over suicide ganking.that's not what he was getting at. he's pointing out that u're fixated and crying against suicide ganking only while using a flimsy cover of ""criminal"", most likely because u don't get that that ""criminal"" covers more than suicide ganking. u want realism? how about no insurance for bringing your vehicle into a war zone?see above.actually, u're doing exactly that after that sentence. try again plz because self-dictating what's ""intended"" or what others should or shouldn't do to suit your liking is such a convincing argument just to change what u don't like..."
7/28/2011,"supported. however, it isn't concord that pays out insurance. also insurance should not cover self-destructs and losses in null/w-sec... there is no concord communications network to record what happens there. there is in lowsec."
7/28/2011,"some of the problems i see folks repeating a lot in this thread (and i myself agree with):mining is not profitable in nullsec due to risk vs. reward.nullsec imports almost all low-end minerals from highsec.nullsec mining is almost completely done in gravimetric sites, negating the risk/reward aspect of nullsec when it comes to mining.tech 2 production is not viable in nullsec.solutions:increase yield of all ore for lowsec and nullsec.increase low-end mineral yield of high-end ores.increase ore yield specifically in the belts, make them more profitable than the gravimetric sites.allow players to anchor poss near asteroid belts, say, 200km away. this would give miners some cover fire and a place to warp to quickly in the event hostiles enter system.provide research agents in nullsec.how to prevent these solutions from nerfing highsec:balance overall ore yield bonus for being in nullsec such that mining in nullsec is profitable enough to cover the risk, but that a substantial amount of minerals still come from highsec.keep low-end mineral yield from high-end ores lower than yield from low-end ores. example: spodumain could yield, say, 100x as much tritanium/pyerite--which makes it a significant amount, but leaves it lower than veldspar/scordite. spodumain also yields some megacyte, making it useful to mine.provide research agents with the pirate factions, thus making them more difficult to access, but make them more profitable datacores-wise. easier high-sec agents will still be much used."
7/28/2011,"i also think we should make rorquals something that has to be defended. perhaps pilots still get boosts from a booster in the same system who is off-grid, but only half as much. so if you have your rorqual out there in the belt, you get twice the boost from it.as far as putting the rorqual into a pos at the belt, perhaps instead of a normal pos at belts, there could be a specific defensive facility made for belt anchoring. it would be much smaller and cheaper than a pos (so you could have lots of them in one system), but it wouldn't have a big shield around it. instead it would only provide cover fire, and maybe some mineral storage room."
7/28/2011,"what exactly am i meant to be supporting?yes i want improvements to 0.0 and while the idea of having ""small-gang targets beyond sov structures"" sounds good, seeing is believing.besides in 0.0 these days small gang is considered 1000 drakes / maels / supercarriers"
7/28/2011,no
7/28/2011,it never gets old
7/28/2011,this is ccp's commitment to excellence.
7/28/2011,"i'm only going to respond to this one as the others don't deserve any further response and will only serve to spin the discussion further and further off topic. needless to say my point is that the logical debate is over. (how many new arguments have you seen posted in the last while? right. so qed. time for the vote.silence does not imply consent. i would shiver to imagine the country that you would govern if the laws were written that way. it's a fairly simple task for the forum mods to tally reads and not count re-reads by same posters right? this is your motion, so the onus is on you to prove majority support, ambivalent votes to not count as supporting you, they count against you as the people didn't care enough to click a button to support it. so where is the vote thread already? quit stalling :)edit: my personal stance just to remind you, actually is that this would be fine so long as you can address all the accountability problems surrounding it. i personally have nothing against it, just that there are too many negative side effects to outweigh any positives. another one to consider is that forum posts are done by name, and forum posts are very important for investment auditors in gauging the ability of the bond issuer to make good on their debts. this would add extra complexity to their tasks. (not all issuers like to give out their api), and another potential complication to put on the con side of the scale when you weigh the pros and the cons of this proposal."
7/28/2011,friendly bump for new support.
7/28/2011,oh i find the reason behind this amusing.i would only agree unter above ruleset.i pity you
7/28/2011,"welcome to any country that votes. the populace that does vote never equals the total populace that could vote, but you don't see them waiting around. the ambivalent are therefore mine since these non-voters would not be counted against any legislation meh, youd have to ask someone at ccp about that, but i doubt they keep data that specific. sounds like you want them to monitor ip addresses and do statistical work for one lowly proposal i thought you were all against inconveniences and unprofitable work... see the above and all the posts prior and youll realize that you still dont have coherent terms or the concept of voting. that and the fact that it wont even result in anything. and that it is way too soon; i don't even have a complete proposal, it's evolving and i havent reached nearly enough people (now whos being selective in her arguments?)yep, the onus is mine and im handling it. i actually do have a plan keep posting these negative side effects and accountability problems and ill keep enlightening you the tools will be there to verify an entity without using api (the aka system). even more so, in the current situation that gray zone is inhabited by entirely unverifiable character transfers. if youre loaning out money and not doing your research, well been keeping up with the us economy?"
7/28/2011,"they are meant to be used to defend gates, both allies and enemies will be hit with them, they can be anchored, targeted and destroyed as with mwdb, or you can simply throw a few suicide frigates or drones at them to set the field off. these are not the old single placement mines. they are a minefield, a bubble of space where there are mines, entering that area sets them off, dealing damage to everything in the bubble, the bubble would be just a graphic showing the outline of the field, maybe just a sphere of red dots or something simple, no need for distortion field used with the mwdbs. meant to be used with mwdbs, to so a target can't just warp out. the image i have of them is put two bubbles up covering most of the gate area in an anti warp field, around the edges of the warp bubbles place minefields, so exiting the bubble means entering the minefield.the reason for a new weapon system is to just shake up 0.0 alliances, old tactics are old, add something new into the mix. supercaps would find it hard to enter the system when their cyno ships can't make it past the gates. open the cyno in the bubble? sure, then the cap will bounce off the gate straight into the minefields."
7/28/2011,you probably just explained why ccp took the mines out the game in the first place.
7/28/2011,"you are probably right, but i still think they would be a welcome change up to nullsec."

7/28/2011,"i thought the advantage of being a capsuleer was that this advanced jovian technology permitted one person to pilot a ship that normally requires a full crew. the lore is that capsuleers are special because the way they train skills and pilot a pod permits their one brain to replace an entire ship's crew.in short, the capsule is the advanced automation.i agree with you on buffing the gallente ships and not just hybrids in general. more pg, tracking bonuses... give me that and i'll find a way to make the ship faster."
7/28/2011,"actually checkout the article in the latest eon. crew has always been there in your ship. yes as a capsuleer you need less crew but there is crew nevertheless. ccp have not released 'official' numbers as likely they want to keep the freedom to change the numbers for play balance once they do release the 'populus' patch (ccp, i'm taking credit for naming this patch if you use it!:)but here are some round figures they released as guidelines:class/ minimum crew (npc )/minimum crew (capsuleer)shuttle 1-2 0frigate 2-10 1-3destroyer 10-30 6-20cruiser 20-75 10-50bc 40-170 15-100bs 200-550 100-300carrier 700-1500 350-700dread 600-1200 300-800supercarrier 1500-3000 1000-1700titan 6000-10000 3000-6000"

7/28/2011,"the imperial star destroyer is a carrier strictly used to enforce imperial law in an area.theyre guns are not small, just theyre turbo laser banks, the big ones, are mounted on the sides because they are most often employed in broadsides, episode 4 (or a new hope, depending on how old of a fan you are) the laser that were shooting at the tantive 4 (a cruiser more or less) were regular laser cannons that are mounted all over the destroyer for small-ship engagement, if the isd had used its main cannons the tantive 4 would have been ripped in half.also, going to the point of size, the ""battleships"" employed by the empire would be more along the lines of victory-class cruisers, which are about one fifth the size of a isd but covered in turbo-lasers, and the acclamator class, slightly smaller and used as a light-battleship to suport the victory-class. so yeah, battleship guns need to be bigger, and carriers should be larger.in arguement to your original arguement, the battleship iowa has big guns for killing big ships (and bombarding entire enemy fleets, and the bigger a ship is, the bigger its guns have to be in order to counter other ships of the same weight class, in other words, a decent battleship cannon (whether laser or artillery or wahtnot) should look as if it would have the ability to rip a smaller ship in half without effort (not saying it should be able to, just as far as appearance wise, because lets face it, shields and armor can do funny things)"
7/28/2011,"not biting here. you have an impressive knowledge about sw lore, which means you have an impressive collection of sw fan literature. congrats. (so 200 turbolasers* on a isd and still a ""carrier""? hmm, i think that the lucasarts games created to date** would disagree with you) but fiction justifications*** aside, do you actually have any real numbers on the sizes of the turbolasers? i would have thought that this would be the most obvious argument you can use. ok, let me google that for you, and end your argument with a picture. gee, looks about the same (tiny) sizes as eve ships huh. funny that.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.* according to thesemodel specs, why the stress? because sw lore is full of inconsitencies often which stir up a lot of fan debates. non of which is our primary concern here, so don't use these for any basis of argument, just illustrating how futile a fictional lore argument can be.** star wars empire at war, star wars rebellion, to name 2 that i know. victory class, acclimator class are just inferior isds in every way (according to fictional specs). *** unless you speak for lucasarts/lucasfilms, you should not be commenting on what you think the roles of sw ships are, or their design methodologies, or their functions. going down this path will turn this debate into a lore vs lore discussion, which should be left in the realm of sw geeks, as they rarely result in any meaningful conclusions."
7/28/2011,"first off, the link is just them trying to use the type of special effects used in the movie to create ideas about the lasers, and you cut out half my arguement, and that is, that in rl, cannons on a ship are designed to defeat other ships of specific weight classes, as in, a us navy destroyers little artillery piece would take for-frakkin ever to do seveere structural damage to a battleship (unless you get a lucky shot off at at either fuel or ammunition storage), while a battleships cannons are designed to take out anything they can hit.my whole point is that small cannons, regardless of the size of the ship they are equipped to, can only take down targets of an appropriate weight class, and considering that on a ship the size of a, lets say, abbadon, armor plating on a ship that size, just to ensure structural integrity, would be prettyd amn thick, meaning only really big ass guns would be able to punch a significant hole in it, so it just doesnt look right that battleship cannons are that small. the cannons, at the size they are at now, look like they could at most punch a couple tiny holes in another battleship, which doesnt even seem threatening, realistically, a gun that would do significant damage to an abbadon or appriopriate weight-classs ship would ahve to be massive, same with capital ships. theres a reason why battleships had the 4 (or 5, depending on what style battleship your talking about) had those huge artyillery cannons on them, while destroyers even today only have a couple single-barrel, artillery turrets."
7/28/2011,"did you actually read it instead of summarily assuming that i didn't? hint jump to the part with the following line.""it is also interesting to note that an early concept drawing of an imperator class star destroyer by geoffrey mandel describes three different sizes of laser cannons. also note that there are a total of 200 tl cannons mounted on the vessel."" i was just providing it as a reference, like any good debater does. :) just google for the rest if you want to read up on the other stuff about sw tls. because your argement is silly. you are using real life logic to try to justify things in a science fiction genre. essentially you are saying to all the film makers and sci-fi creators of the world that their artistic decision isn't practical*. (exception being the anime genre, which i have previously pointed out)well, the reason i refuse to engage you on this 'fiction argument' is because it can lead to no where. if you want to argue real life ships, then do so on another (non-eve) forum, if you want to argue sw physics then as long as you stay within lucasarts fictional canon of laws then we can discuss that, but it is a fallacy to make arguments that span fictional universes and/or reality to justify propositions in others.(and besides your reality argument doesn't even hold water in the sw universe. isds and sw capital ships all have proportionally small turrets and they do in fact shoot each other to pieces, as anybody who has seen any sw movies can attest to.)edit * and who are you to decide what is 'practical'? this is science fiction, not science fact."
7/28/2011,can we now move on without star wars?
7/28/2011,"no, we can't.fakt ist that a stardestroyer (empire class) is armed with: 60 turbo lazors, 60 ion cannonz and all the tie fighters.my battleship only got 16 guns. so they have to be big!"
7/28/2011,"oh, you should have imo big guns on your battleship, but never reason with star wars (in any form) in eve ever."
7/28/2011,"i think turrets are in scale to the ship when compared to their caliber. so i don't support any rescaling without a changing the caliber or rescaling the ships themselves. with the new mauler being the first (and thus at the moment the only) ship that is in scale, ccp indirectly admitted that current ship models are not in scale, whereas i feel like the turrets could be. when measuring and calculating the relations some are too big, some are too small, however overall turret scale seems to be believable...the 800m autocannon is 14m long. on a 1000m long mach this is just 1,4% of the ships length. the problem is not the cannons being too small, it's rather a mismatch between shipsize and caliber, as the turrets are in scale (more or less). if you just make the canons bigger it breaks the scale, the muzzle of a 1200mm artie is supposed to be 1,2m in diameter - not 12m or 120m even.i will support this, if you add the demand to rework the calibers to stay in scale with the bigger turrets and the (future?) ship sizes."
7/28/2011,"oh i already made the shipsize caliber comparison showing the scale is used from real life naval bs'. its from this thread.comparing pictures of the bismarck and the hurricane with 720mm will show you that the turrets are not in scale as intended, because they are supposed to look bigger.can you accept this explanation?i admit that all that talk is difficult without having something like the ""international prototype meter"" in eve."
7/28/2011,"in the future, would it be possible to break the list down into basic sections? mining, manufacturing, ui, null sec, misc., wh space, empire, drones, balancing, etc.i'm trying to go through and narrow down what i want but i'm finding myself staring at this giant list of stuff."

7/28/2011,"hmmm.... i've been copying to my alts the bookmarks that i've been collecting. i'm now noticing that in a mass-import-to-people&places operation for bookmarks, it takes about 14 seconds for each bookmark to be imported. my alt has 13000 bookmarks (thirteen thousand), and it looks like importing another thousand bookmarks is taking four hours."
7/28/2011,bookmark system is in terrible need of an overhaul.
7/28/2011,"hello,we've all had times when we've spotted someone in wh space, but they were gone / cloaked up before you could get their name. i am proposing a tweak to the wh local mechanics in that if you spot someone in the system, they get added to the local member list.now, here's the twist: they are only added to your local. if you are the only one that spots someone, they do not show up on your corpmates local or anybody else in system. and obviously, you won't know when the player leaves system, just like it is today if you speak in local.i think this would be a valuable feature for intel-gathering, while not compromising the secrecy of wh space. this would also make it easier to add people who show up to contacts and watchlist, since you won't have to type their name out and can just drag them to your contacts list. again, you will not show up on local unless you are spotted uncloaked, and even then you only show up on the spotters local.thoughts?"

7/28/2011,"i like it, sounds hard to encode. +1 for them to look into it though."
7/28/2011,"no that's dumb.it's perfectly fine the way it is. if you can't find someone in time to see who they are from your fleeting glimpse as they warp off, then to bad.def do not support adding any sort of extra intel features in wspace local. one of the main attractions of wspace for a lot of people is the complete lack of local functionality so long as you don't speak.you want good intel, learn to cov ops better, or go back to kspace.also, why would you make a post supporting you own suggestion right below it. remember to switch to your alt next time."
7/28/2011,"not much of a twist at all is it. you'll just drag their name into corp chat from your local chat and say spotted this guy. you're basically asking for, exactly what local wasn't meant to be in wh space, an intel tool."
7/28/2011,"so now you can just park your scout on an active wh and walk away?as a karate expert, i do not support this.who does this? right click on target in overview, show info, add contact, done."

7/28/2011,i agree. it's not like your ship's sensors can't record this data when you aren't paying attention.

7/28/2011,"okay, so this isn't a new idea, but a summary of my thoughts on it's potential implementation and how it can both add new depth to the game, while at the same time allowing for some rebalancing issues that gallente players have been whining about for a while. crew. yes it's not my idea. it has been around for a bit. i'm not going to go into the details of the proposals already out there on the topic, as the credit for them belong to others. the most popular to date wasthe one by greg vaganza which made crew gives bonuses to modsmy proposal is aligned to the one where crew affect the performance of your modules on your ship. each ship needs a complement of crew, which you can buy on the market. price should differ depending on region as npc corps will sell crew just like skillbooks. now here is the other point. crew will not boost any existing performance of a module, it will instead become a requirement for modules to function at 100% spec. lose crew and your modules start underperforming. game terms this will be penalties applied to mods due to losing crew. but kael, you ask, this will gimp people as is and add a 'fuel' to the use of modules, in a manner of speaking. well, yes, it does in a way, but the alternative is more dangerous. having crew add bonuses to existing modules may break existing game balances of module performances. okay it's a risk either way, but i'm leaning on the making crew necessary as opposed to a optional bonus. the reasons for this hopefully will be obvious later on in the post. when your ship gets structure damage you will start losing crew lives. hardy crew may be able to withstand more damage before dying where weaker breeds of crew will dies quickly. perhaps base this on crew experience which cab be earned. ( making players attached to their veteran crew) perhaps veteran crew can even give bonuses to select modules or overheating mechanics.)the gallente problem. gallente pilots complain all the time about their ships being 'generally' unfavorable when compared against their racial equivalents. these arguements while flawed because they always come from people speaking purely from a pvp and fleet battle perspective, still have a bit of merit after the web nerf. the common response is to buff hybrids. but this is a messy solution as it will also affect caldari causing a potential buffnerf tailspin to infinity. why not instead give gallente ships a very small crew complement requirement? they are the lords of drones and automation afterall. minmatar should require the most crew or have system failure penalties higher than other ships, they are made quite flimsy afterall. but kaelie what about wormholers? yes they will have to now carry some extra crew with them into wormholes. it's a but of a hit, and i'm hoping others may have some good ideas on how to mitigate this. side effects to game mechanics:battleships, with lots of crew can take a lot of structure damage ( and resulting crew deaths ) without much affect to their performance. frigates on the otherhand, will suffer the most from loss of crews as they have small composites and cannot afford to lose too many. this potentially opens up a new type of tank, the crew tank. ships that can suffer huge crew losses without much penalties to their performance. other possibilities:weapons that attack and kill crew. essentially inflicting damage on the enemy ships performance while leaving the ship itself undamaged. minmatar crew can be used in place of amarrian crew for amarrian ships. emp damage to stucture does not harm crew. this is just a rough idea thread, and stands on the shoulders of many older crew proposals. but i felt the need to put my thoughts on this with the angle of using it to 'bring balance to gallente' without changing any other game balance, using this tunable mechanic which adds depth to the game, involves the market as a commodity, and fits within the gallente story somewhat."
7/28/2011,"also to the hybrid lobbyists out there, the fact that hybrids cannot use onboard guidance systems most often quoted as a gripe about hybrids vs projectiles, actually becomes a boon with crew dynamics. not using inboard tracking means losing crew doesn't affect hybrid tracking! while on the other hand, kill off enough of a matari crew and the projectile tracking speeds get a serious penalty. as do lasers, and missile rate of fires etc. i'm thinking along the lines of each module having a crew requirement, and unless your ships has the excess crew available to man the module, you won't be able to online the mod, something like cpu or grid requirements. as you lose crew in mods or structure damage you can refill the mods with crew if you have excess in the ship, or live with reduced mod performance. the inspiration for this idea came from starcontrol. for those of you too young to remember, google it. starcon ships hitpoints were it's crew complement :) the crew served no other purpose other than as a tactical target for your enemies to exploit, thus you need to protect them if you want your ship to continue functioning. currently eve has no damage mechanics. ( damage does not affect your ability to fight, besides thermo damage which is binary ). crew gives the possibility of this new dynamic and tactics that will come from it."
7/28/2011,"i like some of the ideas and general direction, adding a lot of depth to ships. for the most part crew on ships are their to maintain and repair systems, they are not manually reloading missiles as such all of this is being done by automation and controlled by computer systems on your ship. so crew dying only is really going to effect the ability to maintain and repair systems. all of the core functions of the ship are controlled by the capsuleer. with this in mind you could have it so modules take damage like when you overload them. the damage they take is dependent on the incoming damage to your ship. the more crew you have a live and or the better trained the crew the longer they can repair module damage and keep them from burning out. so what happens when you actually want to overload? you do away with thermodynamics and heat system, replacing it with ship crew. when you overload, your push your systems beyond 100% they will burn out and fail after a certain amount of time like they do now, however the quality of your crew allows you to run them for longer before a burn out, replacing the 25% heat damage from thermodynamics. the other nice thing would be crew repair modules over time like nanite paste. so crew has a peak performance to repair modules, better trained crews have higher peak performance allowing you to take more module damage or overload for longer before the crew is overcome and unable to keep the module working and it burns out. then ad a new aspect to the game and treat crew a little like bpo's where you can research them and improve their production quality. you can buy cheap crew hands at any station but they wont be highly trained, a rag tag crew of misfits. however, you might invest training your crew. it would allow you to train and sell crew on the market, better longer trained crews selling for more money obviously. other rare or not so rare items might be combined with the training to specialise them making faction navy crews or whatever and these crews might sell for a lot more isk but be way better training or even specialise in certain areas where you might get a bonus to heat and or operation of the modules."
7/28/2011,"i like your crew training idea.though i'm not convinced on the getting rid of thermodynamics mechanic completely. i wanted to keep the proposal as minimally disruptive to existing play balance as possible, which means not uprooting any existing system which may upset balance. but i'm willing to bow to the popular opinion on this. it is a valid variant to the idea.i don't think its necessary have the crew only just to repair things. the capsuleer may control everything, but the performance of the mods can very easily depend on crew. for instance, you have a turret with 0.4 rad/s tracking. you have always taken for granted that it works at 0.4. but the unsaid fact is that it works as designed when sufficiently crewed. if you lose sufficient crew for the turret, then it starts to under perform. the only diff between a capsuleer ship with this turret and an npc ship with the same turret is that the npc boat will need much more crew for the turret to work @ spec. (basing from some of the arguments put forth in the latest eon article on crew)."
7/28/2011,"so that doesn't help gallente at all, it just makes them cheaper?"
7/28/2011,i..
7/28/2011,"i don't understand why it's not possible to use a t1 ship in the game except for mission ?i mean except bs and bc there is no use of t1 ship is it possible to rebalance bonus of ship or create new role for those ships ?second if you look at the 20 best ship in the game why is there any gallente ?in pvp world at the moment you have four kinds of fleet.nano ships (i run more faster than you) (ishtar nano hum no range)alpha fleet (hum i have 500 tempest you will die primary) (megathron railgun ... lol dps)baddon fleet (no ammo, big dps, good range, good tank) (megathron blaster lol range, lol tank **** you are more than 500m !)cap fleet ( cool, cyno open ... 5s later station down ""bye noob we are too strong for you) (thana, nyx erebus).so except nyx and erebus where are gallente ships in all of that ?? and moreover where is the balance between all races ? between all kinds of ships ?"
7/28/2011,this belongs to assembly hall because ________ ?
7/28/2011,"the problem with the lack of gallente and caldari ships is that hybrids are underpowered and non-turret weapons aren't popular in fleet pvp. as far as tech 1 frigates and destroyers not being used, that's usually just because almost any pilot can afford and bring at least a battlecruiser. tech 2 frigates are about as cheap if not cheaper than the pilots who fly them, so nobody cares much for joe cadet and his atron.i will say this, however: electronic warfare has a way of making small ships suck. if your opponent is using any kind, it makes you perform disproportionately better in larger ships. i believe therefore that electronic warfare should be revamped such that it doesn't single out small ships as much. * make medium and large stasis webifiers, which have slightly reduced effect when used against small ships. they should still be effective against small ships, but it's a bit unfair when your frigate becomes a sitting duck because a guy in a hyperion used 3 webifiers on you (your frigate likely doesn't even have 3 midslots!), and now he can hit you with large railguns. likewise, small webifiers should be less effective on larger ships, since it's equally unfair when his hyperion can now be hit by dreadnoughts just because you put 3 webifiers on your cheapo rifter. larger webifiers should also have a slightly longer range. bhaalgorns shouldn't be the only battleship that can put webs on a slippery target. big ships can't move much, so their weapons have longer range. ewar should do the same.here's some possible stats:small webifier: - 8km rangemedium webifier: - 12km rangelarge webifier: - 16km rangesmall webifier vs large ship, or large webifier vs small ship - 60% effectivenessmedium webifier vs small or large ship, or small or large webifier vs medium ship - 80% effectiveness----webifiers, like target painters, should have a diminishing return when several are used. it should not be possible for opponents to slow you down to 8% speed. a frigate cannot even take cruiser weapon fire very well. it doesn't need to be vulnerable to battleship fire to go down quickly. this change by itself might fix webs, without the above mentioned change.just food for thought."
7/28/2011,an easy way to reduce blobs is to make game mechanics where pilots need to be at several distant places at once in different types of ships. fw almost had this right in its plexing mechanic but ccp screwed it up by putting a bunch of npcs in there and not letting players know when plexes were being taken.
7/28/2011,"i think the answer is not to restrict people from blobbing, but to give solo pilots more tools for dealing with groups. wider-range aoe or ecm pulse weapons might do it. multiple-warhead missiles. chain attacks (think mutalisks from starcraft; no advantage over a lone enemy, but good for hurting several close enemies). launchable decoys.however this will likely just delay the inevitable.it's a drawback of fighting in 360 degree open space... if this were earth terrain you could break up enemy hordes by using choke points and geographic barriers. in space there's nothing you can use, you will ultimately need to bring your own swarm if you want to win engagements with swarms."
7/28/2011,"i think it's good to make minor disadvantages for huge fleets, and there should not be extra bonuses for it either. bigger fleets should tend to win, but a 100-player unskilled fleet should not tend to beat an 80-player skilled fleet. do this and drake blobs will become a noobish tactic, overshadowed by well planned fleets with mostly ships that aren't drakes."

7/28/2011,"maybe you misunderstood the purpose of this forum. this should normally be used for topics that require debate or discussion. if its a bug, then i think reporting it is good enough. i wouldn't bother going through csm (which is more of a mediary party to discuss player ideas before proposing to ccp) for a bug when you are likely going to get faster response in forums which ccp reads more directly. or making a bug report petition, which will be the quickest i think."

7/28/2011,*fap fap fap fap*so glad i voted for him
7/28/2011,"i don't know if it is possible but could we have a recall vote on mitanni? it's pretty obvious that he does not have the interests of the majority of eve players in mind. on the contrary he appears to hold most in some sort of contempt. if he is openly stating that the sole reason for his running for election was in the interest of a narrow, exclusive part of the game, is he a fit and proper person to be sitting on the csm? obviously i won't be holding my breath on this, just saying."
7/28/2011,"where do you draw that conclusion from?1. this forum's consenus holds no weight. it is not representive of any eve community at large. for one, many players do not participate with any forums, whatsoever. second, there is a large percentage of bittervets and nullsec players that avoid these forums on account of their inconceivable levels of stupid.2. nullsec is not narrow or exclusive. you too, can play in nullsec, if you wanted. whether or not you want to is irrelevant. there are many, many people playing the nullsec game and many of these people have more than two accounts. some of these accounts are based in high-sec, vastly inflating the 'high-sec' majority of players.the mittani had the lions share of votes from accounts that bothered to vote. its pretty simple really."
7/28/2011,"well if the discussions about hisec representation have not convinced you by now that we need to put up a slate of hisec candidates fro the next csm perhaps the following diatribe from mittani might. well, ""arrogant"" is one way of putting it, contemptuous of and derelict in his duty to all the players of eve, self-serving, self-righteous might be a few more that he might like to add to his cv. as for the number of votes cast in his favour as p.t. barnum is reputed to have said ""you can fool some of the people all the time ..."" those people who voted for candidates from 0.0 and are now being ignored, or worse, might like to reconsider who they cast a vote for next time."
7/28/2011,"there are no ""hi-sec"" representatives in the csm, because there were no ""hi-sec"" candidates that were as voteworthy as the 9 best ""0.0"" candidates."
7/28/2011,"leave it to a carpal tunnel syndrome victim to come with an answer like that.there might be that other reason that 0.0 blockvoted like mad to get their candidates in and due to the fact there were too many high sec candidates, which couldn't get a blockvote, the dispersion of votes there kept em out."
7/28/2011,my point exactly. we need to have a slate of credible hisec candidates to ensure that we are adequately represented on the next csm to ensure that the our interests are adequately protected. which with the current csm is not going to happen.
7/28/2011,"a ""credible,"" highsec candidate would have to be campeigning long before anyone else due to the fact he or she would essentially be rallying a playerbase that is incredibly diverse, lazy, and fearful.hazarding a glance at the ""highsec,"" forum names that would have a shot at garnering such support i don't see anyone who's game to do it. so if you want your opinions better represented and you're tired of our 0.0 politics hogging the show, i suggest you get out there and find a candidate who's willing to take on this task and be damned sure they're good at e-politics."
7/28/2011,"thank you for making me smile.actually roar with laughter.looking at the current "" representatives "" i can say that being good at e-politics is the last thing one can say of them."
7/28/2011,"say what you will about the mittani, but he has pretty much won eve politics.people who don't know very much about eve like to spout off about the nullsec block of sheep voting for their alliance leader overlords. but each one of those sheep is a real person (with 5 or 6 accounts most likely) who is genuinely interested in nullsec affairs and on average, far more organized than the average high-sec dweller. voting for an alliance leader doesn't make a nullsec player any less of an individual, just a smarter, self-interested one.nullsec needs to offer a far more gratifying reward than high-sec, that's the risk vs reward mentality of eve. the fact that players congregate into large blocs to mitigate that risk is the natural outcome of our species' politcal nature.why shouldn't these large alliances of people, who are forced to work together in a game where trust is nigh impossible be given greater access to resources than a person who logs in for a few hours a week to play a single player game?"
7/28/2011,"the current reps were elected by voting blocks at the alliance/coalition level so their need to politik is not as dire as someone who's representing a veritable hoard of un-related mission runners, miners, traders, industrialist, suicide gankers, wardecers, explorers, and whatever else the highsec carebears do. i wouldn't go so far as to say they're politically inept, mittens seems to have a much larger fan-base than just gs and co. evidenced by the fact he got many more votes than were cast by his constituents.but yes, any rep. for the squalid masses is going to need massive e-political clout on the level of chribba to even begin to draw out the numbers needed to compete with nullsec blocks. since i more often than not find myself agreeing with the alliance reps i don't really care if this happens or not, but i'm really skeptical of anyone who suggests it could happen."
7/28/2011,"well if you had bothered to read the whole thread it may have given you a clue that this is what it is all about. i'm not saying that getting hisec organised behind a slate of credible candidates is going to be easy. it is true that the people in hisec are individualistic in temperament and not easy to organise. i refute your implication that we are ""lazy, and fearful."" the ""socialistic"" nature of 0.0 is not something that appeals to me and i suspect many others. why work for the priviledge of fitting someone else out with a titan? no, the contempt and disdain that it obvious in the utterances of people connected with 0.0 seems to me to be a more than convincing argument for getting a counterweight to the self-serving attitude of the 0.0 representatives on the current csm. anyone wanting to contact me in game is more than welcome. this is going to be hard to pull off, but it needs to be done for the sake of the game."
7/28/2011,"look out nullsec, jaxon grylls is on the case."
7/28/2011,"is that kinda like bear grylls, but in highsex?"
7/28/2011,"good luck with that. if being ""social,"" doesn't appeal to you though, i'm almost certain you're off to a poor start. of course, stranger people have been elected."
7/28/2011,"i am fairly certain i roamed null sec before mittens even thought about starting in eve.i have done about anything eve has to offer, from missionrunning to sov war, small pvp, solo pvp, industry in all aspects, trade etc.the null sec players however have to realise that they can nerf high sec to hell but that will mean they will nerf their 0.0 game too, since high sec can't exist without null sec and visa versa.null sec messed up a lot of the null sec life themselves but instead at looking how they themselves fecked things up it's easier to point in other directions.ccp made it possible to blue a lot of other alliances and corporations so they blue eachother to death in a few big coalitions and then they cry that 0.0 becomes stagnant.there are enough options to increase a commercial infrastructure in null sec, but the very nature of null sec dwellers messes that up for themselves.ow and yes you can look at my kb stats and find them wanting a lot, but guess what, those stats mean jack cause they tell only a small insignificant part of the whole picture."
7/28/2011,"go read up on game theory and come back when your done.alliance bloc proliferation is unavoidable in a sandbox, especially as the game grows."
7/28/2011,the only thing thats keeping the art team busy is world of darkness and possibly dust.
7/28/2011,"yes, i think debingjos has it right. cq is only a symptom of what is going on in the background. it looks to me as if ccp are trying to kill two, or more, birds with one stone. buff eve and at the same time reuse the artwork for dust etc. no wonder the art dept. are busy!"

7/29/2011,"maybe it would be wise to address and add some gameplay features before fixing the ships?-add new modules. for example burst warp: immediately warp 50km forward draining 75% of max cap.-give guns accuracy and ships hit area so that fewer shots hit if target is further away or if ship is smaller-add stuff to grids, asteroid 150km from a gate, station 150km from that gate and asteroid, concord base 200km away from all those other elemens. you can then warp around between those points during combat.-cooldown based modules would make the game more exciting and tactical than just activate and watch it roll forever. for example ecm effect duration 4sec, cooldown 20sec = no more complete lockdown. mwd(with more powerful acceleration) 15sec duration, 60sec cooldown.there are hundreds of ways to make combat more exciting just look at other games. maybe it's just me but i think eve pvp is just waiting for an hour and then target, set orbit and fire."
7/29/2011,"careful anna, your ad hominem arguments (if i can even call them that) are not becoming you. and indeed showing lack of objectivity on your part, detracting credibility from any sound argument that you may have made in the past. i'm going to ignore your points as they were nothing more than unsubstantiated personal jibes directed at me from an uneducated position, made to illicit some emotion response. :)though on your war zone point. corps pay concord to be able to fight wars, and fighting a war is not against the rules of concord.**destabilizing change is a sudden jump in mineral prices. but anyway this was a digression. a point i made only to inform one previous poster (wasn't you i believe) that if you killed all the miners, everyone in new eden is affected."
7/29/2011,"go right ahead; after all, that is what someone does when she can't refute it. once again, u're not mentally capable of getting the fact that ignoring everything isn't gonna get your self-serving idea considered but hey, maybe u're the one trying to troll so go right ahead. neither is allowing insurance for criminal losses in high sec or low sec; u just simply don't like the high sec part.actually, u stated to me the same thing in an earlier post to which i stated time and time again, whatever ""depression"" scenario u're describing isn't the case with eve, which makes your scenario the digression as u even stated. like i said before, ignoring everything isn't gonna get your idea through but u're here to try and troll, then continue--i'd love to hear it."
7/29/2011,"no, actually, continually to make meta/personal arguments is exactly what one does when they run out of logical ones, like what you are doing. please do go on though.i would like to point out that just because you said that my depression scenario won't work, doesn't mean its true without some backup facts to your counter postulate, for which i am still waiting for. so what is your reasoning that this won't happen in eve again? is it (now i'm doing your work for you here by trying to guess what you meant) because eve has 'infinite' minerals? if so, then your argument is on shaky ground, because without miners, all the unmined minerals in the universe can't keep the prices from shooting up. if you do have any other reason that you think so, please do share."
7/29/2011,"i think ccp should implement an afk mechanic, and anyone who goes afk from not moving their mouse or doing anything for a while will be decloaked. if you're actually sitting there looking at your screen when it happens, no problem, just re-cloak. afk decloaking should not activate the re-cloak timer.that way, people have to at least check up on their afk cloaky once in a while. it's one thing to hold up a system, it's another thing entirely to go to the bar while your character holds up a system."
7/29/2011,"i think the solution is quite obvious. sov 0.0 needs an upgrade that raises the sec status of the system, so people can bot in peace, protected by concord. there still might be problems with suicide-gankers though, but i'm sure that another system upgrade involving increasing ship resists to 100% would solve that.after all, eve is supposed to be a sandbox, so if people want nullsec to be an effort-free, perfectly safe carebear paradise, then ccp must respect their wishes."
7/29/2011,"fine by me, and i presume all the alk cloakers out there. thanks for the solution!i'll just leave this herenerf-cloak whiners need to stfu. protect your space if you want it nice and safe. don't cry to you mom demanding that ccp changes the game to make it easiuer for you."
7/29/2011,"i don't live in 0.0 so forgive me if this suggestion is naive, but here goes ...an alliance could create its own afk cloaker insurance fund. everyone pays a modest premium, and on the rare occasion that an afk cloaker actually decloaks and kills a ship or two, the owners get a full refund. therefore, if you see an afk cloaker on local, you could still keep mining, ratting or whatever without worrying, since you'll get all your stuff back even if he comes after you.this is one way to adapt to afk cloakers without any kind of rule change by ccp."
7/29/2011,"i dont know what exactly is being done with ccp on this subject but i know they are doing something about it. i don't have the exact source but 1 dev wrote somewhere here that they are working on the problem. i don't know if it will be out on the winter expansion but it will go out.and yes, i agree something should be done about this since theres no counter whatsoever about this afk cloaky.my guess is they will make sure that cloaky will appear on scan when using probes i guess but really idk what they will do."
7/29/2011,"they are doing something about it? where is your source?this is all by the by now anyway, as a nerf to local is incoming with many changes to be made.as it is local that is the issue here, not the cloak."
7/29/2011,"i see no problem here. sticking a cloaked alt in another system to monitor what is happening there is the same as using a spy or recon unit in real warfare to find out what your enemies are up to.most big alliances and any serious null sec fleet commander uses these to watch for counter attacks coming from neighboring systems.there are some players that leave alts logged in 23/7 sitting cloaked in a system just to grieve the locals. but this is not really an issue. once you know who these are you can just ignore them. if they are afk they are no threat. they can not attack you, they can not tell anyone else you are there. if they do attack you, or tell there intel channel they you are in that system, then they are obviously not afk. the players that exploit this mechanic are not a threat as they are afk. the players that are a threat, are obviously not afk and thus not exploiting, using this mechanic as intended, for stealth, covert ops, and spying."
7/29/2011,"actually one idea that might actually fix this.if players were removed from local chat while they are cloaked. this will actually increase the covert ops side of the game that spys could be in system without being seen until they make a hostile action. at the same time afk cloakers will not be able to grieve because if nobody knows they are there and they do nothing hostile, they will just be ignored as they should be. in order to balance this however they should add some sort of anti covert ops mechanic. a way that someone can specialize in tracking down a covert ops vessel. the whole point of covert ops is that knowbody knows you are there until you attack. but if they go to the point of removing all non aggressed covert ops cloaked pilots from local we need to have a way of detecting them by actively looking for them when we suspect they are in the system."
7/29/2011,"""since theres no counter whatsoever about this afk cloaky""??? are you on drugs? or just really, really lame? you can't think of anything nullsec players can do to defend against a lone afk cloaker?may i please know which nullsec system you inhabit? i'd like to run my covert ops ship out there, and perma-cloak on an alt since it obviously scares the crap out of you :-d this is so cool - i can shut down a system with one ship and apparently nothing can be done about it! whoop!meanwhile back in reality if you can't think of a single way to deal with a lone afk cloaker, you're either a carebear botter renting a 0.0 system, or have never actually been in 0.0 yourself. either way - wouldn't a game like wow be better suited for you?"
7/29/2011,can you say insurance fraud?
7/29/2011,"in this discussion, cowards are ground to inactivity by a single unseen ship and expect ccp to come and hold their hands for them in what is deemed dangerous space."
7/29/2011,"cosmetic only. or no. either way, i'm not saying yes, and i want my vote to count against those who do say yes."
7/29/2011,"oh my god yes!when ccp release a full wis multiplayer environment, people will use it. however it still needs to be optional as suggested by the op.why would i go through all the process of having my pod removed from the center of my ship, go through the annoyance of being ejected from my pod, showering off the goo and getting dressed in my $1000 japanese boutique jeans, to get a bit of ammo put into my cargo hold."

7/29/2011,i see no reason why you shouldn't be able to change your name so long as you retain all standings and have an alias history similar to corp and alliance history. if it is a tool used to avoid negative consequences then there is a problem.
7/29/2011,no one has been able to refute this as yet.
7/29/2011,"i had a long response to each one of your 'points' but i've reached the extent of my 'caring' to argue any more of your trivial nit-picky half justified retorts. they will only serve to drag me into a tooth and nails catfight of a debate, which no longer is serving any purpose or reason. (hey, that's why i said call a vote already!) you seem to revel in debating every moot point to the level of absurdity making any counter argument (logical, or otherwise) that anyone may give only adding to the massive digression from the topic at hand, and us further from any satisfactory conclusion.you have many who have stated in very clear terms the problems with your proposal, and problems with the proposed 'solutions' you offered to the problem. unless you have any new ideas, this thread is dead to me. ask for a vote, or not, i really do not care either way, or continue to bump your own thread with no new insights until you get tired of it. the nays have spoken. the ball is in your court.the fact that you have taken to arguing with me with personal vigor, is proof enough that you feel that if you can somehow trump me then everyone will rally for your cause. in truth, it's just serving to show how dead this debate is, and how you have completely lost your objectivity. pointing that out to you, is my parting gift to you, for your valiant show of tenacity. only a vote will reveal if you have managed to convince anyone of merit of this proposal's worth. kael"
7/29/2011,this is a debate forum----------------------------------------------------------i take it you're ignoring my post?
7/29/2011,that brings a tear to my eye jagga . friendly bump for support.
7/29/2011,i think it is more that people just don't care to refute your constant ignorance that you show in every thread you post to.
7/29/2011,"i don't know how you got so much support, but i think your proposal is absurd. firstly, your point that someone with implants wouldn't want to jump clone out to do nullsec roams has debunked itself. people with implants can and do go outside of highsec...by using jump clones. i do it all the time. having implants in most of the time is great, but taking a few hours (weeks even) in nullsec can totally be worth it.it's all choosing how best you use what you have. removing the implants removes that choice. you may as well force players to fly the race of ship that matches their character, that'll make everything a lot simpler."
7/29/2011,"i dont only like this, i love this!more money-circulation, more things to craft and possible more null-sec visits from alot of players. but please, make those ladar-cites spawn in lowsec more often.+1"
7/29/2011,"i'm curious to know where you got that impression. i was just doing my due diligence in questioning oversights i see in the proposal. i'm a little confused though, at how you have gone from your original plan of to remove just the basic non pirate ones.okay, if we are to work with your new proposal (just remove the non pirate ones) then how does this solve your original problem of highsec people not wanting to go to null for fear of losing them? especially when they are orders of magnitude more than the regular 1-5 implants? if i'm missing something, do let me know, but it seems a little in-congruent.to more directly answer your perceived problem though, and forgive me if someone said it already, is to use jumpclones. they are easy to get, and any highsec person will get one for null sec playtime. i therefore counter propose that any perceived problem of highsec'ers afraid of nullsec, or nullsec'ers not training fast enough is not a real problem with jumpclones."
7/29/2011,"yea! i've been presumed by many on the forums to be many things, but never pvp until now! i'll add that to my collection of baseless accusations i have gotten. truth is, i argue on the side of reason and balance, whichever it may be."
7/29/2011,"+1as a player who spent most of his time pvping in null sec i have mostly used +3 and +4 implants only. the difference this makes over the 4 years i played could be well over 6 million skill points.carebears have all the advantages of safety in high sec, "
7/29/2011,i support this idea however i'd peraonally would like to see them removed completely without a replacement apart from giving everyone +5 in attributes. it would be the easier solution and would still have the same benifit without adding a slightly strange new mechanic to the game.
7/29/2011,how would i go about doing that? i'm sure there are 0.0 fix me threads out there... i'll try to find one.
7/29/2011,i support anything that means more monocles are destroyed
7/29/2011,"i haven't reached the server-side limit of 50 fittings yet, but only because i'm too damn lazy to import my hundred fittings from eft.i can understand the frustration this is causing people."
7/29/2011,"+1completely support this.i also think it's unreasonable to think they can sell extra fitting space. if you want us to pay money then give us something of value worth paying above our subscriptions, not for cheap limitations."
7/29/2011,"let the players modify a little the ship apparel ,add decals and colors...and please don't add aur madness to this."
7/29/2011,"why not aur? i mean rationally speaking, its a vanity thing, and also, having a custom job will require some more server power on ccp side for storing the extra bitmaps for each player which means a cost for them. i think they are justified in asking you to pay for it. don't get me wrong, i would love it if it were free, but arguing for capitalism sake, i see that this would actually be something that the could sell for aur that people may actually buy, which won't peeve off the anti-rm activists."
7/29/2011,fully supoported.... i really don't understand why it was changed. it was working just fine as it was.
7/29/2011,absolutely support. the change to ctrl key functionality is horrible.
7/29/2011,thank you spank for speaking up for truth and justice.
7/29/2011,"why wouldn't a person just open the escape menu, select the shortcut tab, select the combat tab, select the lock target shortcut and click the clear shortcut button?a person can change it to any other key if the targeting with keyboard is still needed.unless the control key still causes problems when it isn't set as a shortcut?"
7/29/2011,this would stop the random locking of ships when using a ctrl+'whatever' shortcut.what it wouldn't fix is the usability that existed prior to the keyboard shortcut changes and you just end up with a different key with has exactly the same problems.1. cannot freeze overview without risk of locking a random ship2. cannot 'function key' + left click to targets ships of your choosing without risk of a random object being locked.
7/29/2011,"it doesn't randomly lock ships, it locks whatever you have selected in the overview if the overview has ""focus"". if you haven't clicked in the overview and click out in space or some other window first so the overview isn't ""in focus"" then you can ctrl+left click stuff in space.or are we just talking about just having a shortcut that freezes the overview?"
7/29/2011,we are talking about both. it is poorly implemented at present.it might be acceptable for someone in a mission running corp such as yourself but even so there are plenty of mission runners that also find this frustrating. in a pvp situation it is highly unintuitive and liable to get you killed.
7/29/2011,"ok, so am i to understand that the freezing ability and the locking ability come as a package with this shortcut?"
7/29/2011,can we haz a fix please?
7/29/2011,"ctrl and alt... both modifier keys should act ""on release"" if commands are programmed directly to them.also option to disable entire ""apply functions to item which is selectd from overview"" would be really kewl."
7/29/2011,+1i'll come back in six months and see if they fixed it or not.
7/29/2011,please explain why it is important for a hauled to be able to recharge their capacitor while cloaked.unless your trolling of course.
7/29/2011,not empty quoting.
7/29/2011,"spoken like someone whoes never warped across resbroko :pthe idea is good, but 100% is ott a 50-75% decrease would be nice though,"
7/29/2011,this! :)and sometimes i like to be able to reengage my mwd after i drop cloak. why do you need a cap recharge while cloaked?
7/29/2011,those who need cap after decloak just have to fit a cap booster.one less highslot? the better! for what those highslots anyway on a non combatal ship. and the combatal? less dps. fine as well. they want to cloack? they have to accept penalties.alternative: fly in fleet and there is no need to cloak right?-100% cap reload while cloacked is fine. there is no problem as long as it been dealed the right way!
7/29/2011,"and this a bad thing because everyone should have the ability to haul goods through dangerous space at no risk other than the cargo?the raison d'etre of blockade runners is to fill this niche, why bother with br at all if it can be done in dirt cheap flying cans?why should system size matter at all? if it is big you have a long warp in which to regen, if it is small the warp-initialization takes an insignificant amount.if it is so big that your cloaky hauler cannot make it in one warp (after a mwd burst) then your problem is that you are not using the proper ship for the job or fitted it to compensate (bet even a small battery is enough to account for lost regen) .. isn't that is after all what eve is all about."
7/29/2011,"it's like when you're a parent and your two griping kids won't give up on fighting over candy, then one of them says they can settle it if you buy licorice for one and mint for the other.supported, because i don't see any problems with it and somebody else wants it."
7/29/2011,i am glad i am not the only one that want's to see this happen. i think if ccp is going to make a claim for the most realism possible then they shouldn't fall short by forgetting boobs and fat in general.
7/29/2011,"the problemt1 cruisers are largely obsolete for pvp, because of the simple fact battlecruisers exist. battlecruisers offer only slightly less mobility (no loss, in the case of the nanocane) for better firepower and defence, and thanks to insurance a rather insignificant price gap. the result of this is that the majority of tech 1 cruisers have no real role, compared to the equivilent battlecruiser.another contributing factor is that the tier system and general ccp fail has rendered a number of cruisers seriously sub-par. this proposal aims to go some way to rectifying both problems, through fairly simple changes. the overall intended end result is a situation where both cruisers and battlecruisers have a role, and that someone with the money for either would actually have to think for a minute before picking their ship rather than going straight for the tier 2 bc. i'd also like to stress - battlecruisers stomping cruisers in a 1v1 is fine. nerfing battlecruisersfirst step - nerf insurance payouts, at least on the tier 2s. the big problem with pricing on cruisers vs battlecruisers is that they use the same mods and rigs, in very similar quantities, but that the cruisers get a few mil in insurance wheras the bcs get 20ish.as an example, a while ago a friend and i did some price comparisons (using the rens markets at the time) and the difference between a kitted out rupture and cyclone, factoring insurance, was a laughable 4 million. so, as a first step, nerf insurance to make battlecruisers as pricey as their performance should require. i'm well aware that price is not an overall factor in balancing, but this should actually give a price gap to consider, in addition to the other factors.secondly, reduce bc mobility. their speed can stay (see below for why) but slightly nerf their agility to widen the gap with cruisers.thirdly, this does not apply to all bcs, but their stats are getting slightly absurd in places. the drake for example isn't far off being a battleship in ehp (and dps, with hams). i'd swap out the shield bonus for missile velocity (or even precision). this brings the ehp down to the level of the others without gimping it.frankly i'm in favour of nerfing the tier 2s down to the level of the tier 1s all round, but that's outside the scope of this post.buffing cruisersthe first major change i'd make is upping cruiser mobility across the board. the main reason to pick a cruiser should ideally be their mobility, but right now their stats don't quite back this up. a moa is a mere 200m/s faster than a drake and the agility isn't far off either. the hurricane is the biggest offender here, going easily around 1.4km/s.so, buff cruisers to be faster than bcs all-round. right now cruisers average 1.2-1.5km/s without being speed fitted, up this to around 1.5 at the slowest and 1.9 max.combined with the bc nerf, this means a cruiser gang has significantly higher mobility than an equivilent group of battlecruisers, but the hurricane is still a workable option where faster gangs are concerned.next, give the finger to the tier system and start buffing. i won't go into too much detail but the omen, caracal, moa and thorax (to varying extents) all need a grid and/or cpu buff. the stabber's slot layout makes it a complete joke at the moment compared to the rupture, so give it another low and a few more drones (say 20m/3 bay.)as for the maller, give it a damage bonus rather than cap as well as some drones, but keep the speed way down. omen for a faster laser platform, maller for a tank/gank ship. the ideal end result: - cruisers are lighter, faster, and more economically viable compared to battlecruisers and also have a greater number of viable classes.- battlecruisers are slightly toned down but maintain their role as anti-cruiser, and generally higher dps/tank platforms for gangs where speed is less of an issue.thoughts?"
7/29/2011,up the warp speed.3ua/s for all the t1 cruisers... i would like to see 4 or 5ua/s.
7/29/2011,i like it. that'd work nicely.
7/29/2011,"play balance tweaks are rarely as simple as you put them. moving things around rarely only affect the things you are moving.some things you may not have considered:making cruisers faster, will this mean that cruisers will go faster than some frigates/destroyers?nerfing insurance payouts. this won't do at all. did you think about the fact that battlecruisers are much more often ganked in lowsec and null than cruisers? this is because they have bigger sig rads and can be found easier in plexes. nerf the insurance payouts and you make happy days for pirates. not to mention having insurance payouts differ by ship is just too technologically complicated. its a bazooka vs fly scenario.200m/s faster is a great deal faster, (are you talking about maxxed out with mwd speeds?), battlecruisers are supposed to be slightly modified cruisers afterall.curious to hear why you think they are not economically viable presently vs battlecruisers. a caracal is 3.5m and a drake is 10x that. you can get a caracal up to 20k ehp, and a drake to 30k.sounds economically viable to me."
7/29/2011,"increasing speed is not the key problem in cruisers as i see them but it's a nice and working buff anyway. the thing is, even with that speed cruisers can't compete vs anything else but vs frigs and destroyers.but if cruisers had range they'd be completely viable as a gang vs battlecruiser gang. or as a part of a sniper hac or bc gang. it would just open so many possibilities."
7/29/2011,"i don't think we need to nerf battlecruisers, also i don't feel that drake dps is something to be desired. drakes seem to be the least powerful battlecruiser (aside from the ferox, which can't be made to function properly). i think the problem with drakes is that their damage isn't low enough for the incredible tank they have. i'd just leave the bonuses the same on the drake and lower its base shield by a small amount. also, battlecruisers have higher insurance payouts because they cost more.command ships are quite a bit cooler than any tech 2 cruiser. but they're not overpowered when you consider how much they cost, the skills required to fly them, and mainly the fact that they don't really hit all that hard, they just have high ehp so they don't die while boosting buddies.you're right about mobility however. most cruisers diaf because they're not significantly faster than battlecruisers. given that the average tech 1 cruiser has around half the powergrid and maybe 2/3rds the slot options (bringing its slot options nearly in line with heavy frigates), they should be substantially more mobile. instead, they are sitting ducks that can't dish out much of any help.i propose all cruisers have max velocity increased by at least 10%, and perhaps signature radius decreased by 10%. it won't make them a ship of choice, but it'll make them useful within niches or when you want to save cash.----------------------------------lastly, i want to strongly iterate that the stabber is in no way underpowered. in fact, i would propose that its powergrid be reduced by like a hundred. with six high slots and mobility more than befitting a cruiser, this thing is just a larger version of the destroyer. it should not be capable of fitting 4x 425mm autocannons and 2x ham launchers and still have room for a good nano+tank fit. in fact the main reason a fit like that is overpowered is that autocannons have excellent tracking, meaning this thing can nano and hit at the same time while using full-size weapons. it should be using 220mms or 180mms.i think the moa and ferox could perhaps use a powergrid buff. they can't fit their intended weapons at full size, let alone put on a good tank. the thorax definitely needs a powergrid buff. it's the exact opposite of the stabber, being either able to nano or to dps without any room to do both, and its tank isn't much either. don't forget it's intended as a blaster ship, so it's not very good if it can't get into target range. i see thoraxes mostly used to catch people off guard, warping in right where their opponent will be and using webifiers to prevent them from getting away. it certainly doesn't chase very well, as i found out when i outran one in a webbed stabber. its drones got me because i didn't get out of webifier range in time. in seconds i'd have been home free, as i have seen medium drones have quite a bit of difficulty hitting me in a stabber when i'm not webbed.i haven't flown amarr cruisers so i can't speak for them."
7/29/2011,"then i believe the problem is not that the turrets are incorrectly scaled, but its the ships that are incorrectly scaled? i mean, i can be 2500m away from a can, and it sure doesn't look like it can fit 5 hurricanes in between me and the can. the scaling is just bungled."
7/29/2011,"so we now have a rough understanding of the scaling in eve. its messed up not only in the guns department. we dont know how ccp measure scale in the game. i'd sure like to know, because commenting on this topic gets hard as it goes into a vague direction.this topic needs more clarification on what is all to be fixed. some kind of conclusion imo.i have some ideas, but no time right now. i'll maybe write something down in the next few days."
7/29/2011,"i think this is a great idea. in fact, ccp could elect representatives who would get together with representatives from several other top games and share players around for mutual benefit. these representatives could study what makes various types of players like what about a game, and identify these traits in the player base. players who like microtransactions or who want highsec to be buffed can be gently led to hello kitty island adventure. likewise, players in hello kitty island adventure who believe their gaming skills and ability to mash face against keyboard for hours on end are being wasted, those players can be lead to world of warcraft. and similarly, players in world of warcraft that exhibit such tendencies as being able to make a viable non-cookie cutter character or correctly counting items in the guild bank could be led to eve online, where they will have a much more fulfilling experience.overall, i think this rebalancing of players will greatly increase game morale, and keep the masses paying out of pocket for these great games. supported!"
7/29/2011,"oh my! thanks for the giggles.i support this in spirit. though as i believe you are sort of saying this tongue in cheek, it's funny and worth a discussion.i personally think that no official process need exist though, these people eventually get bored and leave the game. (yay!) or they get frustrated an leave the game (yay!). i'm confident that ccp and csm have enough knowledgeable folk that nobody really gives any such posts any credence. what we can do is to keep a list of them on a sticky so that we can all ignore their posts without having to waste time reading them. you get on the list by posting 3 of such requests, and you get off the list by publicly renouncing your ways."
7/29/2011,"is ""small azeotropic ward salubrity"" meta 4 or was it "" small f-s9 regolith shield induction""?is ""hardwiring zainu snapshot zmt30000"" the one for missile range or is it for afterburner cap usage?the problem:there are hundreds of items in eve that sound like sci-fi but do nothing other than add an unnecessary clutter of disorganized text.i've been playing this game for 4 years yet even now i often have a hard time figuring out which item is what meta and which hardwiring is for what.and i can say with great confidence that there is a huge number of players who would like this problem solved.this is especially bad for new players who are faced with things that look so much more difficult than they are.the solution:rename most of the items into something useful, for example180mm light auto cannon i180mm light auto cannon meta 1180mm light auto cannon meta 3180mm light auto cannon iirename the hard wirings and implants in a similar fashionhardwiring: turrets projectile large rof 1 (for rof 1%)hardwiring: turrets pulse large fo 3 (for fall off 1%)you can keep all that sci-fi sounding stuff because it's cool, just put it in the description instead of title.i am aware that there are items without meta and strange variations. i suggest verifying how often these items are used and possibly remove them completely.i know that in my 4 years over 4 accounts in all aspects of the game, i have never used one of those items nor seen them fit on any pvp ship.pros:tremendous improvement to organizing and handling the market.huge improvement for new players.might be a good chance to clean up some of the useless items in game.cons:will be manual boring work. however it's simply changing text, there is no new content or calculations of programming new things here."
7/29/2011,"the problem:on planets with a large number of processing facilities (especially lower tier) comes the click fest of routing from every storage to every facility. consider when you have to link 2-3 storage to 20-40 facilities, then again from each to the final storage, and then do this on 6 planets. the result will be hours of pointless clicking.solution:do the same thing like you did with extractors!make a factory control unit for each tier (basic, advanced and high-tech) and then all the processors linked to it.each fcu will have 1 schematic selected. the routing will only need to be done from the storage to the fcu and then to the output storage. pros:reduce click fest by 90%.make pi less intimidating, and easier to manage.clearer overview of colonies.easier to plan and calculate.cons:none that i can think of."
7/29/2011,"i present to you, the double-click. there are many places in pi where you can replace all that bothersome clicking of buttons simply by double-clicking something. it really doesn't take me all that long to setup factories. about 10 seconds per factory total, no biggie."
7/29/2011,ever tried running factory planets where you have to put like 40 facilities? and why on earth would you oppose making things more organized and less useless?
7/29/2011,"hiding in npc corp is unfair on mission runners. make it bad to be in npc corp for everyone equally not just mission runnersmining 10% reduction in yield in npc corp.industrial/freight 10% reduction in align time npc corp.pvp 10% reduction in warp scram/disrupter range npc corp.wardedcs as they are you have to deck dumb people. all members can just jump to new corp. you can't effect peoples earning in high sec. when a war is issued you should be stuck in your corp for 7 days then you have 1 day to leave or your stuck for another 7 days. this would make corp hoping to avoid decks mean something.even if you deck a alliance the freighter or pve alts/pilots will just leave and still earn during the war. what is the point of a wardec if the other side can avoid it?legitimate ways to avoid the wars should be stay in npc corp, stay dock, logoff. remember you have to pay for a war so you should get something for your money. options to kill someone in high sec are wardec but you can corp hop to avoid, join there corp and kill but you can be kicked in space while shooting them, suicide ganking is the only real option."
7/29/2011,"agreed, wardecs need new mechanics. paying for wardecs then seeing there members jump to a new corp is pathetic, wasting isk in the process.make wardecs free or put something in place to make wardecs better, for the better of eve."
7/29/2011,"for the better of your eve maybe.stop pretending you're a ""leet pvper"" becuase you station camp defenceless carebears. you're the pathetic one. stop wardecing people for the purpose of griefing, and they'll stop corp hopping. i know plenty of corps that get war-deced regularly, and quite enjoy the experience."
7/29/2011,well why should i pay for a dec which is ineffective. everywhere in eve is ment to have risk or should we turn off pvp in high sec?
7/29/2011,"wow, with all the well thought out and compelling arguments against the wardec system how people continually abuse it to pick random highsec corps to dec just so that they can hover around jita to shoot people, i never thought i would see an argument to change the system to make it easier for griefers.wardecing costs what, 2mil isk? seriously, if this is a dent in your wallet then you should find a new profession. i think the other arguments were proposing to make this even higher. highsec is for carebears really. with all the other problems that eve faces today, like a harsh new player experience, and steep learning curve, do you really want to make it even more unfriendly to carebears or newbies? i'm of the feeling that constant griefers should just man up and move on to lowsec or null sec if they want to pvp. or do fw. hovering around trade hubs to shoot people in highsec is so... like kicking homeless people."
7/29/2011,"stop decing 10 man corps who have no intrest in pvp and no real ties to being in their corp. pick a target that can't be disbanded so easily.essentially the targets you're decing that all just drop corp because they have no ties to the corp, and it means nothing to them to just form a new one.find a corp with assets, pos's, higher player numbers, a corp for whom disbanding will have ramifications, and dec them. you'll get a better fight, and that's what you're looking for right? good fights?i mean, there's no chance you're decing corps with 5-15 2 month old nubs just so you can grief them, right.ie; wardec works fine, pick targets right and you'll get wars. try and grief nubs and they'll just disband."
7/29/2011,"want leet pvp, get out of highsec. seriously.risk exists in empire, just concord and empire police responds."
7/29/2011,it's funny when griefers cry about not being able to exploit newbs/bears..... go to low/null sec u baddies l2playvideogameslikearealman.ps i support hiking wardec fees to 100 mil a week for individual corps and 250 mil a week for alliances. pss i just fueled some of my missiles with your griefer tears danka
7/29/2011,that's what i said! :)
7/29/2011,"update: i am a bad and there is already a thread on this that i missed when scanning for dupes... please show your support in this thread, the sentiment is the same.many people use more than a handful of ships and when you have a couple of different fits for each of these ships it is very easy to exceed the current limit of 50 fittings. this is especially true for those that provide help and advice to groups of pilots and regularly need to have a variety of fittings for a variety of ships on hand to pass on to others. regardless of ones reason for wanting more slots, the current limit is far too restrictive and there is absolutely no merit to imposing a restriction.when they moved the fittings server-side it made little sense to anyone. perhaps for corporate-wide fittings it was logical but certainly not for personal fittings. when the fearless internal document was leaked it was indicated that charging for more fittings slots was a possibility. the document has been claimed merely to be a test-bed for controversial opinions and to open debate on some issues but the simple indication that they would be willing to charge extra for what was previously a free feature is just too insulting to ignore.it is clear that the only way they could justify a limit on fittings is by claiming it was a strain on resources. something that would not be true were fittings to remain client side. there was no other reason why this change was necessary.i am disgusted that this game is being deliberately gimped in order to try and grab more money from our wallets.allow us to keep as many client-side fittings as we wish and stop trying to money-grub. it's pathetic, cheap and insulting.in closing: return personal fittings to a client-side feature and remove the arbitrary limit of 50 fittings."
7/29/2011,"oh dear, forgot to support"
7/29/2011,another whiny complaint thread from lady spank...nothing new here btw...there are already several threads about this very same request.
7/29/2011,boo-hoo.
7/29/2011,"indeed, add a fitting tool incorporated to the game so players can think of which fits he should do."
7/29/2011,"absolutely support. there was no reason to take that from us other then, as spank said, grubbing $ off us for extra fitting slots.there are games in which this sort of thing is acceptable ccp. league of legends, buying extra rune pages for example. but i don't pay a monthly sub to play lol.i do pay a monthly sub for eve, 3 of them in fact. i don't see how you can possibly justify taking an existing feature from paying customers, and then offering to sell it back to them later.remove head from anus ccp. seriously."
7/29/2011,"wormsholes should show local when ccp allows capital ships to cyno in as well as remove mass restrictions from active wormholes.the rest of us have to deal with gristle in the gravy, why should you be special?"
7/29/2011,"it has nothing to do with sensors. if you read the background lore, its everything to do with lack of the fluid communication network in w-space."
7/29/2011,"short answer: no.long answer: nooooooo...more serious answer: wormhole space isn't like dusting crops in known space, boy. we don't want or need a local channel that provides free intel for any and all that can't or won't use the tools the rest of us make do with. that is all."
7/29/2011,end of line.
7/29/2011,"no.i can speak for my corp when i say that we in no way, shape or form would or could support this idea.k-space and wh-space are different and unique. leave them that way."
7/29/2011,"doubt it can be coded to apply to individual clients, even so merely seeing a ship should not be enough.minimum should be ""show info"" on pilot, a completed lock on his ship or a wh 'tag' command that perhaps requires a specific pos module."
7/29/2011,no multiplied by all the isk in eve
7/29/2011,absolutely not
7/29/2011,"i propose four things:a) allow gms to delete character's aur balances if we petition asking for that. or better yet allow players to do this themselves. saying we can buy nex store items and then delete said items is not good enough - we do not want to give ccp metrics supporting mt in eve.b) make future free aur be a time limited redeemable gift like other free gifts have been. i find the current situation insulting, as i do not support mt in a subscription sandbox mmo with a player run economy, and thus do not want a positive - or better yet any aur balance showing in my wallet.c) allow users to disable aur balance display in the wallet.d) move the isk balance back to the left so the stupid pointless aur balance doesn't take up another wasted blank line at the top of the wallet. even if you give us (c) i'd still like the isk balance back where it belongs. ccp - we westerners read left to right. it is natural to look first top left for info."
7/29/2011,"update: a gm just deleted my free aur :-) so it can be done, and i encourage everyone against mt in eve to petition for aur deletion as well! yay!"
7/29/2011,"hey us asians read right to left, so let's not be too racially biased here. (and eve is coming to japan this year!)"
7/29/2011,"counter suggestion. if they are going to offer a gift, make it something that isn't merely a cheap attempt to coerce the playerbase into using a crap feature."
7/29/2011,"ccp should give everyone a few aur. then most of us players will be able to sell that aur for isk, while people who have too much isk would be able to buy discount aur for a while."
7/29/2011,"the current rendering of ships looks good but gets old fast and needs more diversity. there are a lot of ships around stations and the zoom is close enough that you can see the rendering on them normally. what i suggest has already suggested by many but with a slightly different method of integrating it into the system. first, is the addition of decals. i have read what some people have to say about painting their ships and the decal idea is nice for wearing your badge on your sleeve so to speak. militia, alliance, corporation decals, etc. someone else mentioned that you can use them as a badge of service for being in the militia or for loyalty to a corporation. you can set standing limits for being able to use these decals as a reward for hard work. so long as the list of decals is managably short, i believe that a lot of people would love to wear their colors. the second is for the people wanting to stand out more, the addition of multiple paint themes for people to choose from. allowing for custom paint jobs would put too much stress on the server, but if there were only about a dozen or so different themes to choose from for each ship, then i believe that would be much more managable. decals and alternate paint themes allow people to have more choices and lets them stand out more in a crowd. the ""paint shop"" as someone else called it, would be in certain stations and anyone has access to it. as a reward the decals should be easier to receive, allowing it to be payed for in isk. but the full ship paint jobs would be more of a luxury and should only be purchased through use of nex. the current clothing idea might work better when/if the station lounge allows players to see each other but otherwise it is too limited. people see each other in their ships far more than in character so i believe a paintjob would have a lot of appeal to players. if the extra rendering hurts lag time too much in large fleet battles, then there should be an option under graphics to turn off all custom paint/decals. business: by allowing choices for ship rendition people have more variety and i believe it would satisfy a lot of people, possibly even bringing back several of the people that left with the addition of nex. it will further drive the sale of plex cards to convert to nex, increasing sales for ccp, and stabilizing the plex market for players through steadier purchases. so long as the resolution of the new paint schemes is the same and is added in both client and server side, then there should only be 1 extra call to the cpu for the render model. that should minimize the need for extra hardware server side to handle the extra renditions. thank your for your time and consideration, i have spoken with many people in game and the idea takes like wildfire which leads me to believe it would be a profitable investment."
7/29/2011,"i believe this is already in the works as far as the corp and alliance logos are concerned. paint jobs are a nice touch too, and i'm sure it will be another thing you will see soon in the nex store."
7/29/2011,no to 173. yes to 174.
7/29/2011,"why on why has this not been added, the wait has been long enough..surely?"
7/29/2011,"supported, but it's why i unsubbed my three accounts. maybe i'll look into eve again when they fix this, but waiting two years for them to get off their backsides to tackle this is really enough.i'm going to go spend my time on something.. y'know... fun."
7/29/2011,"support on some gallente hull changes, but no on the hybrids buff. (unless you want to buff caldari as well)"
7/29/2011,"because that is already on the list of ccp tallest, hence not needed in the crowdsource. i'm too lazy to look up the link, but its been linked already in a dozen of hybrid complain threads.edit: i think someone did actually link that in the crowsource thread even./not supported as its pointless"
7/29/2011,i want the old warp sound too!
7/29/2011,"elina tan, you don't seem to get it. paying real money should not give you any advantage in-game.i can agree with plex being the one and only exception, because it's based only on in-game currency. that means the person who gave up the in-game currency gave up something that was definitely of value to them. even if the only way for you to pay for more research slots was for someone else in game to sell them to you, it still wouldn't be fair because the person selling them might not even want them. but everyone can use more isk."
7/29/2011,actually if you have high standing with a npc corp you should get free research manufacturing spotsthat is my view
7/29/2011,"i actually will support this. it seems silly at first glance, because eve is supposed to be a harsh world. but missions pay so little that if you lose your mission ship very often, you end up losing more than you're making, thus rendering your time spent missioning effectively wasted.obviously you should need to spend time planning your fit, but players should not be required to go outside eve (like eve-survival.org for instance) just to make ends meet when missioning. a good agent should be able to tell their employees a little about what they're up against, especially if they're expected to face something requiring a hundred million isk ship and are only going to be paid 5 million for it."
7/29/2011,"solution to this problem: get in a corp that can teach you the proper eve mechanics. pve or pvp corp, doesn't matter cause they will teach you how to play correctly.in your case, its a code 18. the problem is at 18inch of the monitor lol"
7/29/2011,"i like your basic idea, but i think you've got the implementation all wrong. it's as simple as this: pay double subscription and be allowed to train 2 toons at once on your account. this has the advantage of you being able to cancel the second subscription and still use the character, and the disadvantage of only being able to log into one character at a time. seems fair to me.i know which option i'd choose, and it's not the one i already have."
7/29/2011,"i disagree. the new icons are an abomination. i have to wait for the icons to load just to scroll past the turrets in my station cargo every time i log back in to the game. add to that the fact that i can no longer tell what i'm looking at, let alone not having much difference between types of turrets. and to top it off, there is more difference, say, between heavy pulse lasers and focused medium pulse lasers than there is between heavy pulse lasers and 125mm railguns, just to throw out one of the many possible examples."
7/29/2011,icons are supposed to be an easy to recognise representation of what that button does. it should also be significantly and recognizably different from the icons around it.the old ones were just fine.the new ones are total crap.
7/29/2011,"hicrowsourcing is a really good tool for the csm but it suffers from inherent flaws. with this thread i just wish to bring this to the attention of the csm.while voteing for issues is very democratic and seems all do good, the reality is it does not reflect the seriousness of issues. now what do i mean by that you may ask!well issues that are race specific will automaticly be at a disadvantage since only players of that race are likely to vote in the affirmative. moreover, now that you can vote in the negative its to the advantage of other races to vote against fixing issues with opposing races however fair or real problems thay may have. this issue can in some cases be further compounded by the face that the 4 races are not equally popular and the least populated race is thus at a further disadvantage.i ask csm to consider this because the only (real) gallente issue on the crowdsourcing list is to buff gallente e-war. while true this area also sux for gallente its not the most pressing problem. can anyone guess what im thinking of? do i really have to say it?......hybrids....there i said it!"
7/29/2011,"not supported, there are two races that use hybrid turrets as there main turret of choice. caldari, the most popular race, and gallente, which you say is the least popular race.both races have 2 forms of major dps, caldari have missiles and the gallente have drones. only the gallente can apply both hybrids and drones at the same time with no penalty.hybrids are at a disadvantage right now but that is not the major issue with gallente. the major issue is that they are to slow to apply there best dps. fix the gallente ships, hybrids are fine the way they are."
7/29/2011,"whatever, twist the issue any way you like, its still an issue. i dont care if they fix hybrids by fixing the speed or whatever, just get it done. anyway, i just pointed out the issues with the way csm is prioritising, you did notice that right?edit: btw, i cant remember seeing caldari turrent ship in low or 0.0, they might be there, but then its very very rare"
7/29/2011,"i see the same thing concerning gallente hybrid platforms. most gallente ships i see are drone boats. domi kicks *** btwanyway addressing the gallente issue isn't my highest priority and i'm sure that the majority of the pilots out there don't care about race or anything of that nature, they won't vote against fixing hybrids, but they won't vote for it either."
7/29/2011,"i agree the vast majority of players will not vote for hybrids balance, and thats my point exactly. the issue is extremely central to to all gallente (and a very small number of caldary crazy enough to waste sp on a broken weapon). since so few players will vote for it, it will not get the attention it desrves based on the impact the iussue has on affected players. minor issues will get promoted over this to the detriment of players who did not know not to train gallente."
7/29/2011,"some time ago i read the last released summit meeting minute and one of the topics discussed was the difficulty logistics pilots have with the watchlist being limited to only 10 people.the minute also contained a statement from ccp that, while acknoledging that some pilots have valid reasons to need a larger watchlist, they could not simply raise the limit, as this functionality would start taking more cpu power than it should.this subject is also one of the items of the current csm crowdsourcing and one of the replies in one of the original threads suggests that perhaps raising the limit of some players in the fleet would already acomplish alot.this proposal is to go exactly on that direction, letting the players decide who in their fleet need more ppl in their watchlist and who could do well with a shorter list to compensate.it goes like this:- fc chooses b (base value) between zero and ten- fc selects l (a group of pilots, such as logistics) to receive the benefit- for all pilots not in l, the watchlist becomes limited by b- for all pilots in l, the watchlist limit is increased by ((10 - b) * (size of the fleet - size of l))/(size of l). the value is truncated and the reminder is distributed in round robin.- if there are no pilots in l, then all pilots have the standard limit of ten.a few notes:- the scope of this op is only the maximum size of the watchlist. it's not meant to discuss if it has all the necessary info logistics pilots need to do their job, nor if it woult scale well with a much larger number of people in it.- letting b be variable may be overengeneering. fixing it at some reasonable value may be enough.- i won't discuss how the ui will acomplish this op, but it needs to be easy for the fc to select/deselect the pilots that need a larger watchlist and it must be visible for all pilots their current watchlist limit.- on a side note, if this is really taking that much server cpu then perhaps the algorithm implemented is sub-optimal, because by fixing the size of the list it should have a linear behavior. or perhaps this is already the case, but the code is still doing unecessary operations like creating the same message multiple times instead of using a memcopy (if one pilot is being watched by many others, the message could be created at most once per tick). maybe there is one or two ""low hanging fruits"" here for team gridlock explore."
7/29/2011,"courier contracts. currently i have an alt with a freighter and a cloaky hauler. when i move to a different staging system, i have to contract my ships and the cloaky hauler to my main, then recontract them to my hauling alt just so i can put them in my freighter as a courier contract. this is just plain annoying, i propose that courier contracts can either be made to ones own self, or allow ships to be placed in a freighter when they are rigged. second proposalallow changing of skill training to be done by simply pressing the apply button on the alt toon on an account. a warning message pops up that states that training will stop on the other toon. i think it is annoying to log on and off 2 characters on the same account to accomplish a simple task like this."
7/29/2011,"+1 for second proposal, if your silly enough to train two characters..."
7/29/2011,its more of having the second toon on the account and wanting to train a small skill.
7/29/2011,"i think that perhaps using the courier contract system to fit ships into cargo should be counted as an exploit. then again, that's about as silly as getting worried that a million cubic meters of maintenance bay are being converted into a hundred thousand cargo space via fitted industrials.why don't we just let ships be placed in cargo holds, and why don't we just allow carriers to carry cargo-filled ships? if the problem is that people will stop using jump freighters when they can use carriers instead, then just make industrials bigger. want to move that cheap piece of scrap without a full cargohold? get over your rigs already and repackage the darn thing."
7/29/2011,"the game mechanic is already in place. i am not saying change how things are transported, i am simply stating that you should be able to setup a courier contract with yourself."
7/29/2011,please vote for the crowdsourcing initiative here. thread locked.
7/29/2011,"no, nothing to do with price at all. it makes them more resilient to penalties to mods due to damage (crew loss)."
7/29/2011,just because an e-tard gets elected to csm doesnt mean the game is going to be changed to benefit themselves on a whim. zulu throwing the *tard line over the whole wh abc ores thing gave me hope that ccp is not just going to bend over and make poor game design decisions in the future just because the csm are more interested in altering game mechanics to forward their own nullsec agendas rather than help influence game design for the sake of good game design. i hope ccp realizes this.the time and effort nullsec alliances spend to screw eachother over to rmt could probably have been better spent in the real world.
7/29/2011,"which is exactly why anyone who is crying about abcs in wormholes is a moron. the csm is a sounding board, not a scrum team. they use their knowledge of the game to offer advice to the ccp. ccp is still responsible for their decisions. if you honestly think its a cart blanche to bend the game to nullsec will then wow, you are ******ed."
7/29/2011,"to be honest these hulks in blue nap fest space are safer than highsec hulks. move abc ore to high sec (using failttani's logic of risk vs reward here) as anyone can gank you with some cheap dessies in such a densely populated area of space versus the only thing around you in nullsec is friendlies.clearly, abc ore prices are determined soley by the output of the occasional miner that finds a grav site in a wh once a week, mines for an hour or two and theres no more abc ore left and not the legions of bots churning out abc ore 23/7 with respawning roids and abundant availability of sites."
7/29/2011,"obviously, rather than fixing my car, i should just take a bat around the neighborhood and beat the **** out of all the others cars to make mine look appealing."
7/29/2011,"not trying to troll here, but tbh this is a pvp game at its heart. its got to be balanced around pvp. complaining about it just makes you look stupid."
7/29/2011,you should stick to theory then because most 0.0 nubs have the faintest clue about reality.sadly enough most high sec nubs know just as much.the fact is that most problems that exsist in eve currently are player driven.
7/29/2011,"exactly my point. player driven and inevitable. nullsec exists in a realist paradigm, where alliance continuance relies on doing what it takes to win rather than what is 'fun.'next time i promise to yield to the mighty intellect of killer gandry."
7/29/2011,did you study to get this dimwitted or did it all come natural?seems if i talk to you like your mitty does it might get through your thick skull.people in nullsec dug their own problems and now they want high sec and ccp to undig them.that is the reality of null sec.
7/29/2011,"just dont vote for nullsec players for csm unless theyve previously served on the csm and proven to be level headed people after good game design, not e-tards who think csm is just a joke and a means to further along their alliances nullsec agenda and make money off rmt. chances are a highsec player will be more level headed than this csm."
7/29/2011,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i can't even insult you because you fail so miserably at logic. what are you even trying to say?
7/29/2011,"as long as ""votes"" are based on forums/reading login news - there will never be a representative part of eve's player base.the day you get a popup ""do you want this? yay/no?"", its democratic, but don't ever think eve was ever anything but major powerblocks running the game.csm is voted in by 90% of the people who have an agenda. its like real world politics.it's not representative, and it's aparently what ccp wants.only whine is, you pay $15 to the powerblocks."
7/29/2011,"i don't think the artwork of dust can be used for eve, at least not in any significant way.the other thing i can think of is making the nex store items. which would be the case only if ccp has the most ******ed financial advisers ever, trying to profit from micro transactions instead of do a half decent job at marketing and increasing the subscriber base."
7/29/2011,eve has it's own art team. it's split 50/50 between incarna and fis stuff.

7/30/2011,"a thought that would greatly amuse me in regards to dreds and sc's, add a class role to dreds to increase damage done against larger targets ((say super carriers and titans )) by 10-15% per level. this does not make them more effective against smaller targets but it does make them dangerous to supercaps and gives them a reason to exist again. it also makes supercaps lives far more interesting in the presence of dreadnaughts . black ops, really, doubling the current jump range and giving them another bonus or two would almost make them useful. a damned cov ops cloak would also do a world of good.far as other things go, up the damage on rails a smidge so they are at least on par with lasers/missiles/cannons."
7/30/2011,"as ship balance is a complex task with many interrelated moving parts, finding a overall balance between the ships of the races while still allowing for different racial tactics and philosophies, all while not breaking anything else, is a herculean task. complimentary to all of the existing proposed changes in this thread, i emplore readers to consider as well the adding of a new mechanic, in order to tune out any current perceived problems. this 'new dial' will allow devs to dial in balance without affecting anything else, avoiding the problem most encountered when tuning game mechanics, that is if course, unforeseen side effects that disturb the balance in another aspect of the game. this new proposed dial/tuning knob, is the implementation of crews in ships. we have always known that they were there, and with the latest eon ccp even published the crew complement rough figures for ship classes. this new mechanic, while not the holy grail, will allow game designers another degree of freedom in tuning the balance between ships, without potentially messing up the existing balance. i put these thoughts into a thread, which is very much still a discussion topic, which i wanted to link here as i felt that any discussion of ship balance should also consider this as a supplement to rebalancing.crew"
7/30/2011,"much like what u've been doing when the only flimsy ""argument"" u have was shot down so early and easily? that's probably why u feel it's so personal when your ignorance is being pointed out.u know what else isn't true?

7/30/2011,"great solution to afker's remove local and so it is just like w space, problem solved. i also think that the same should be for low sec as well let high sec have their local since it is controlled by empire."
7/30/2011,"1) the issue isn't ""afk cloakers"", it's your awareness of them. if local were made into ""recent speakers"" all around, so the only faces you see are people who spoke in the last 15min, you'd have to be paranoid all the time instead of just when you see a strange face.2) in the spirit of #1, try living in whs instead of 0.0 where you never know if there's someone lurking. i notice the op talking about solo ops in 0.0 and yet counters the wh argument by saying ""then have some friends guard the whs and pull watch"". so wh denizens are supposed to travel in groups for safety, but 0.0 dwellers should be allowed to solo through life?3) the issue isn't ""afk cloakers"", as those are two completely distinct and separate words. ""cloaks"" are the counter to probes, and should be left alone in all regards. asking for probes that scan for cloaked ships is like complaining about ships with too much ehp and asking for armor piercing ammo that ignores resists. the paranoia comes from not knowing whether another player is ""afk"". this could be remedied in a number of ways.- have a little mark the depicts when someone is afk. then you won't try talking to corpies who haven't been around for hours.- log players out after lengthy periods of inactivity. there is nothing in the game that requires your presence, but not your involvement. if someone is cloaked, and providing active intel, they are chatting with their fleet/corp/alliance/whatever. that conversation means they are not (a)way (f)rom the (k)eyboard. however, if they are hidden in any regard, whether that's cloaked or just mwd'ing into deep space... and the player is nowhere near their desk... that person is truly afk.of course there are ways macros could prevent someone from ""timing out"". however, macros are illegal, and would be dealt with on their own.in summary, cloaks aren't the problem. as ""everything needs a counter"", cloaks are the only true way to counter probes. leave them alone.go after the real problem. the presence of someone in your system that you don't know.either remove the knowledge of their presence (fix local), make it easier to tell if they're actually a threat (afk flag), or...watch your borders better, and kill people when they invade!"
7/30/2011,"it's that creeping thought that keeps gnawing at you in the middle of the night, isn't it? the idea that someone, somewhere, might be afk cloaked in a hulk."

7/30/2011,"what i mean is that the attribute bonus on the pirate implants will be removed, while still giving their secondary bonus (extra armor, better shield boosting and similar). this way players will not miss out on skilltraining while jump cloning, even if they will be cripled overall in performance. but from my experience people tend to be willing to be a bit gimped for a day, as long as it doesn't make their skills train slower. i don't want to use the old clich<U+FFFD> of ""you didn't read the post"", but it seems like you missed part of my argument on why this change would make people more willing to explore the world.once again this suggestion is not some kind of ""force players to do this"", but rather remove some of the roadblocks stopping alot of players from experiencing different aspects of the game."
7/30/2011,"i did read it, but it was a long time ago, so maybe i forgot some parts.okay then, working with this proposal, i would ask why you think that people perceive the negative aspect of having their skills train slower? i mean, isn't it a choice any player makes to either use +5 implants in both clones or not? if they put the same implants in both clones there is no 'slower training'. just increased risk of losing a set in null. but that is the price you pay for training the same speed you do in empire. i mean, if you remove all the +'s from the implants, then everyone trains slower everywhere anyhow, but your response is to add + boosters. okay, so my counter proposal then is why not add those + boosters, but leave existing implants alone? why gimp somebody in highsec who has no intention of ever going to nullsec nor care to (hey lot's of play modes fit into this... fw, trading, r&d, carebear ratting) why are you gimping them?i think that adding +'s to (new) boosters is a good idea (if not there already) so that people can use their non implanted jumpclones on boosters in null, to 'match' the sp training that they have in their +5 jumpclone in highsec.doesn't this make everyone happy, solve your 'issue', and most importantly, doesn't force anyone to do anything that they don't want? (or muck with existing mechanics)?"
7/30/2011,"yes i could see that working, looking at the boosters as a 1-day pass so to say for the player that use them for the intention of having a day out of their standard clone. as i stated earlier i'm not a game balancer but rather a player that want a change, so i suggested a big change. but truth be told i would be happy with the boosters being an alternative. that is you can use either an implant or the booster, while the effects are non stacking.and as someone else proposed earlier in the thread, if the cost of using boosters constantly for about 3 months or something would be about the same as buying an actual implant i would be happy."
7/30/2011,1
7/30/2011,i guess then it's good that i am a game balancer. :)if you change this proposal to 'add attribute boosters' then i will gladly give my support. edit: though i would also insist that the price of these new boosters be free floating market prices and dependent on what they are manufactured from. or perhaps an lp store purchase at discount.
7/30/2011,"/undecidedwhen i first read the post, i thought it was a bad idea. then after reading a few more posts, it started to make a bit more sense. for newer players, they buy implants of any quality, they often cant afford to keep replacing them too often. older players can circumvent this with jump clones, but younger players often dont have the required 8.0 standing to get one, therefore newer players are less inclined to pvpon the other hand however, if implants were not seeded, but were player made, prices for these implants should drop and also have the same desired effect"
7/30/2011,"not supporting this idea, implants are working just fine as they are, they give reason to pod someone and they are one of the ways you can really hurt someones wallet."
7/30/2011,"proposal appears to be trying to limit the financial loss associated with death, by replacing a destructible item with an item whose effect is persistent through death and/or a cost over time un-associated with death. not supported. one of the appeals of eve is that combat is risky and death is at least a little bit meaningful unlike in other mmos."
7/30/2011,"perhaps it was originally such a proposal. (and i will be against if it that were the still the case)i think it has become more of a proposal to add some boosters which give some implant like qualities but only for limited time, like a week. i was under the impression that dying will still lose you the bonus, but the booster would be cheaper than the equivalent implant that would give the same bonus, thus making it more affordable for new players."
7/30/2011,"this is true that the idea has changed a bit over time. when i originaly made this thread i honestly came up with it as i wrote. with that said i will try to write up a new, more balanced and explainative thread that will hopefully be up during next week. i will also offer some of the people that gave me critics more than ""i hate this idea"" the opportuinity to read my draft to look for holes that can be improved."
7/30/2011,"i agree that there should be some sort of mine fields.just like in real war there are tactical environment modifications like mine field and trenches, so should there be in space.for the record, however, mines were removed because they caused so much lag. and it will be difficult to incorporate such a system without a lot of it."
7/30/2011,i think my reworking of the idea earlier in the thread (mines as 1-shot drones) bypasses most of the original objections.
7/30/2011,i support this *if* they can't fix the bug that prevents you from warping your pod out.in any case it would encourage more newer players to pvp. but on the whole i think people should be able to lose what they fly with. so if they can fix the recent warp out bug then i am against the proposal.

7/30/2011,"gallente was my first race. i learned all weapon and t1 ships (subcapital). after starting pvp i crosstrained to minmatar and amarr.amarr have fantastic range versatility with scorch => they do not need to range dictate, they hit hard at any distance.minmatar have many advantages: switchable damage types, ship speed, weapon do not use cap, due to speed and agility it is possible to use even long range turret in pvp (arty)so what we have for pvp from gallente? there are only drone ships. all other ships have better min or amarr counterparts."

7/30/2011,"wow! that's an awfully long way of saying, ""ctrl should only act as a modifier key"" :)which is what lady spank is saying.and is what ctrl has been used for ever since the silly key was invented in the first place.sometimes, ccp, it pays to do things exactly the same as everyone else, in order to help your users (and especially people new to the game) fly their ships reliably and experience the least possible frustration with this game. this is called principle of least surprise."
7/30/2011,"it locks whatever has focus at this time. that may or may not be what you clicked on in the overview just now. as an example, say you just warped into a mission space, clicked on your fleetmate in space and selected ""approach"". now you want to target the bad guys. if you do the obvious thing and start ctrl+clicking things, you'll end up targeting your fleetmate first, then everything you click after the first thing you ctrl+clicked.that's a separate issue.what we are talking about is the misuse of the ctrl modifier key to become a post-action-command key, where you have to click then press ctrl.ctrl is a modifier key, and changing its behaviour from what people are used to throughout every other ui on the planet makes eve that much harder to play and like (and thus, keep playing). ccp will most likely not get the answer ""your ui is screwed up"" on exit surveys, they'll just hear, ""i don't like it."""

7/30/2011,"what?and target ships by selecting them, then clicking the ""target selected item"" button in the ""selected item"" box?or is there some other way of targeting things? that's a genuine question."
7/30/2011,1
7/30/2011,supported. i'm tired of targeting acceleration gates.
7/30/2011,supported
7/30/2011,"supported. i, too, am sick of having to carefully select a distant planet before thinking about targeting anything with my scram hot, to avoid accidentally concording myself."
7/30/2011,"how this got deployed is beyond any reasonable explanation. i noticed it within minutes of log-in after that patch and it has been driving me nuts ever since. it's been a helluva long time, i've forgotten what its like to target something without having to do some voodoo on the ctrl key while frantically clicking in the overview. fix this crap before i break my keyboard out of sheer frustration."
7/30/2011,"ok, so people want the control key to only do what it does by holding the key and clicking targets. the ability to click your targets and press a key to target afterwards is something people don't want.i can kinda see that. but i feel you go back to the idea where a person can just remove the control key as the shortcut to target.i mean if you remove the control key as being an entirely separate shortcut button you can use it as a modifier for any other shortcuts you have without the problem of ""targeting"" whatever you have selected when trying to use another shortcut."
7/30/2011,"yet again, all this does is shift the problem over to a different key and does not return the previously useful functionality."
7/30/2011,"from just testing out the key, it appears to only target stuff selected in the overview when the overview is ""in focus""when i selected things out in space and then hit the control key nothing was targeted.when i hold control and click something in space it targets what i click in space.i can hold control and click to target in the overview or i can click something in the overview and press control and it will target.might i ask if people have a shortcut set for ""toggle lock target""? i'm not exactly sure what that shortcut does and haven't tested it.from what i can tell is the problem is the fact that the overview is kept ""in focus"" when people press the control key and thus they target whatever the overview has selected."
7/30/2011,i support this as ccp hasn't accomplished much so far and at least this would be better use of their time.

7/30/2011,"isn't that called a wardec?this is meant to be a full feature, not a pvp status. your first point completely eliminates the 'faction' in faction warfare, the second point removes it as a career (anyone can do it at will at any time), and the third doesn't make any sense - you can't be in fw and be loyal to an outside corp and shouldn't be.please actually observe how fw works, and think about how it should work - not how you can tear it further down, reducing it to little more than a spaceship version of a wow battleground."
7/30/2011,to be honest i think the battlecruiser tier was ccp's original attempt at t3 cruisers that went wrong which i feel is why most of them are quite broken. why is why a dilema ensues when trying to balance the t1 cruisers in terms of price and ability. how could you really make the t1 cruiser class better without making the battlecruiser class obselte?
7/30/2011,"this is already the case, but no - the majority of frigates would still be faster and a lot more agile, but the gap would shrink somewhat.insurance has been nerfed before, and if you're willing to risk a bigger ship then you should be able to take the loss. i am indeed talking mwd speed, and yes they should be a great deal faster. have you noticed how stupidly small the speed gap is?umm, no, battlecruisers are not modified cruisers, they are larger ships that use cruiser sized weaponry in larger quantities.try not being utterly clueless about the ships you bring up in discussions, otherwise your credibility goes out the window. i'll address this idiocy point by point:- a caracal is 3.5mil, plus fittings. in case you haven't noticed, a proper t2 fit will outweigh the hull cost several times over. the cruiser however gets a much lower insurance payout than the battlecruiser, despite a minimal gap in module cost.- caracals do not get up to 20k ehp without making huge sacrifices, usually on the gank side of things. come back here when you have a caracal with 20k ehp and good dps.- 30k ehp? on a drake? are you even putting modules on it? mine has 80k with just a three slot tank, and good dps on top of that. dear god you're clueless.not really, no. why would i want to fly a caracal when i can just get a drake that does the same thing better with a minimal price difference? the only thing caracals really stand out at doing is swatting frigates, and let's face it - what can't swat frigates these days?stabbers are hilariously underpowered. have you taken a look at their stats, umm, ever? with the fit you just suggested, its in-practice dps and ehp are utterly pathetic, and it has no anti-frigate defences whatsoever. by the way, your ham/425mm/tank setup is also impossible. it's over on grid by about 200 and still puts out pathetic damage and has a paper tank. so yeah, i get the feeling you're either looking at a different ship entirely and ""stabber"" was a typo, or that you just never even tried efting it.right, the trouble with this is, factoring that insurance they don't cost more. insurance only covers the hull.let me put it this way, on a t2 fit cruiser, the hull cost is around a quarter of the final total, meaning insurance covers barely anything.on a battlecruiser on the other hand, the fitting is only slightly more expensive than the cruiser, but the insurance payout is much, much higher. the result of this is that the price difference between the two gets skewed.i thought i'd made this pretty clear - i'm talking buffing cruisers to give them a different role to battlecruisers. the only thing cruisers currently offer (besides stuff like the blackbird) is being slightly more mobile than a bc, and that mobility gap is way too small right now.not only this, but the miniscule price gap means there's very little reason to pick a cruiser if you have the choice"
7/30/2011,supported - all you see is canes and drakes...
7/30/2011,"although... i wouldn't switch the drake's kinetic bonus for a velocity bonus, as that takes it into caracal/cerb territory, and we're trying to differentiate these classes, and i would nerf the tier 2s down to tier 1 levels, in slot counts, fittings and base hp."
7/30/2011,"removing a mid from the drake would be an excellent first step, if the bonus isn't changing. (in my opinon, anyway.)this would mean like the ferox it has to pick between a full 3 slot tank and proper tackle gear. wouldn't be a huge loss to the hml drake admittedly, but the ham version would have a serious choice to make as a web is pretty important there."
7/30/2011,"no, that's a rather heavy handed nerf to an already well balanced class/tier. in low sec the problem seems to be canes not drakes. canes do excellent damage and are really jacks of all trades. drakes have a lot of things going against them. they tank opposite of most other bc's, slow to lock, slow to apply dps, do less dps than most other bc's, less agile, and have a sig radius a mile wide. the only thing they really have going for them is the engagement profile and the shield brick."
7/30/2011,"the proposal isn't really aimed at balancing tier 2 bcs against each other, but balancing cruisers against bcs. have you encountered any cruisers, except for fw/rvb/throwaway suicide roams lately? if you did, i bet 90 % of them were ruptures.i was just referring to canes and drakes because the cane does tremendous dps (thanks to op acs) with awesome agility and speed, while the drake sports a bs tank and can be fitted to to good short range dps as well - hence those two are the most commonly used ones.there's practically no reason to fly a t1 cruiser when you can fly a bc and it only costs a couple mill more after insurance - hell - some hacs are matched by bcs in some roles, whereas losing a hac costs 10x as much."
7/30/2011,"yesmake them big and scary! they should look intimidating and proportionate to the ship size.frigs look more intimidating up close than cruisers and bs because of the size of the guns.same like in real life, bigger gun vs small tiny gun."
7/30/2011,i have spoken to a csm rep about this idea and he is in support of it. what he wants to see is what ideas we can come up with to keep this change from being exploited. that's where i need your help. anyone have any ideas?about the only thing i've thought of is put a max on what you can gain in a 24 hour period.
7/30/2011,"at the current time the only exploit that i see in this is pirates getting out of pirating by trading kills with eachother. fixing their sec status by sitting outside station and podding eachother. that ends up translating to people paying money to fix their sec by paying for pods. i see no issue with this, you have my support good sir."
7/30/2011,"if you want to cut down on the time spent in null/empire ratting sec then the gain from pirate hunting needs to be so high as to be easily exploitable = not a good idea. note: there are a lot of pirates in some areas, but they generally avoid fights where they may die and use all the tricks in the book to ensure they don't.do what the veto guy (mashie?) suggested, and move sec-gain to low-sec with an appropriate boost to gain per rat .. gives you more ls pew as well as hunting ground for anti-pirates.gain for pirate killing could/should be part of a bounty overhaul though."
7/30/2011,there is a way to get round the exploit.security status can only be gained by destroying a ship and the gain is directly linked to the isk value of the ship making sec status farming a very expensive business
7/30/2011,"problem there is does that mean the hull price, or price for the fitted ship. and how is it determined, checking jita at the time of the kill?as far as the op goes, i dont see your cons in reality. pretty much the first thing you learn when dropping below -5 is dealing with the fact that everyone takes potshots at you in vulnerable situations, they'll deal with it just fine as it doesnt change anything."
7/30/2011,supported.
7/30/2011,this is the best idea to combat pirate alts and friends farming each-other after a act of piracy. less likely to be exploited with putting risk on the table. also add to that have the gain also tied to skill-points of the char if podded.
7/30/2011,"heh, thanks kaelie :-) further to your point - i'm brought back to the age old request to be able to ignore people in the forums. however the ignored should know they've been ignored (a running count under their portrait to the left of their posts?), else it's no incentive to change or depart. and if an ignore is permanent they've no incentive to win back the favour of the person ignoring them, so perhaps ignores should be limited to a week in length. this would also help keep visual ignore counts from being appropriated by trolls.edit: actually now i think about it i far prefer a way to vote on players, rather than ignore them, in order to help ease them off to something more suitable. that way we'd still see what the 'sp for mt' crowd have to say, but their post would be so faded (i'm thinking how massively does it) that everyone would get the message they're being a bonehead."
7/30/2011,"don't forget to add star wars galaxies to the list of games people should consider...--whoops, guess the game is no more. i wonder what happened to it."
7/30/2011,"wardec is a very good system when not exploited. certain players feel the necessity to dec noob/bear/mining corps for easy kills and are hurting the retention of new eve players.waredec fee's are way too low. it is allowing bad pvper's the ability to get killmails from inexperienced pilots in highsec. pvp should be everywhere but, as example, a 3 man corp should not be allowed to wardec a mining corp for some free kills. the idea of wardec is very sound and is an aspect i really enjoy about this game. warranted issue between corps/alliances should be resolved with war.increase the price of a wardec to; 100mil a week for single corporations, 250 mill a week for alliances. this is still not alot of isk. it will lower the amount of crap pvp griefers, or aholes looking to get their monthly sub paid for by easy exploits.what this will accomplish. 1. increased pvp in low and null sec. the baddie pvper's will have to face facts and do some real pvp.2. more inviting atmosphere for new players. having all your **** blown up by some ******* that you have utterly no chance against is not pvp and gives this game a really bad rep. 3. wardec's will mean something besides; ""mark the 3 **** heads on your watchlist and watch local.""4. killmail boards will be more fair. as messed up as they are i feel that the worst exploit of killmail boards is the fact that you get points for easy killsi don't see any cons to this"
7/30/2011,1. no it really wont2. no it still wont and you sound mad too3. still no im afraid 4. nope and i dunno how you worked this out to begin with
7/30/2011,"no i'm not mad my corp has dealt with griefers like this before they either cancel the dec or don't log on, but thank you for your well thought out responses. can you tell me why you have come to these conclusions?"
7/30/2011,"as a high-sec player i have to agree with you here. sure people might think of high-sec as care bears, but that's because they keep going against the week targets, the unorganized groups, the small corps. i'm sure there are more than enough high-sec corps and alliances out there that are more than willing to give you a fight provided that they have the ability. going after a bunch of miners and manufacturers is wasting people's time, the victims because of lost income while staying docked for a week and the aggressor because they are wasting resources hunting down a target that is much better at evasion than they are at hunting. and yes, 100mil for a corp and 250mil for an alliance isn't much, its maybe a day or two worth of serious mind-numbing work. which is actually another game mechanic people don't really focus on when it comes to this issue. with the war dec fee so low and the high possible losses, it is unfairly biased towards the aggressors, they only need to put so much into the war and they get so much out of it. for example the other day i was talking to somebody who managed to clear out 2bil worth of items from a high-sec corp in a few short days. although to be fair, i'm not saying that this is a common occurrence, its just an example. so, to be quite frank, i'd even be for a system that increases the fee as member count increases."
7/30/2011,i have to agree with the op as well. i've pvp'd in alot of games i have always loved pvp and enjoy the challenge of it. a three man corps that preys on a high sec corps that have no chance against them imo is the worst kind of pvp'r. they are not challenging themselves and in eve's case are getting un-deserved kill-mails. i do not and have never understood this type of pvp. it is not challenging for the aggressor so personally i wouldn't waste my time with it. it would be nice to find a group like this in low/nul on my small gang roams to show them one aspect of real pvp in eve.
7/30/2011,"the current number 100m seems like a arbitrary number, that could be too high or too low. i have another idea to determine the cost.1 million per member on the war decking and war decked corp per week.and when war decking a alliance (as a alliance or corp) you add together what would be the cost of war decking each individual corp.that way the cost of making a war is proportional to how much concord needs to look away for people being attacked or attacking. that way it would be 200 mill for two hundred man corps to do a war (not mutual), and if two 10 man corps 20 mil. the cost would scale based on how many people get 'tickets' to pvp. so a larger corp could pay for pvp at their level, and a smaller corp could pay for pvp at their level. also, have it 2 week limit for war decks to remain active, then 1 week off. so no constant wardecks with rotating corps. (ytali convention not letting people hinder business forever/grief/bribe concord off all the time)."
7/30/2011,start charging too much for wardecs and people will just resort to suicide ganking and awoxing you.nerf to solo pvp and a nerf to pvp in general. there are ways of avoiding wars if you are too cowardly or incompetent to deal with them and if you are that incompetent then you don't deserve to make a name for yourself as a corporation.wardec fees are a nominal isk sink and should not be increased just because you are risk averse crybabies.
7/30/2011,"you're missing the biggest con of all...that everyone that has memorized, written down, put into spreadsheets, 3rd party apps databases, fitting tools, webpages, all would have to change it too. you are right that the names are a little confusing (okay lotta confusing) at first, but once you have them memorized, its not really practical to rename them."
7/30/2011,"a smaller con is that names give things personality, character, and fictional substance. it differentiates, establishes branding, and gives writers background material to work with in works of fiction.who make the 'malkuth' line of launchers? who knows but i bet its a caldari megacorp...with the competing corp making the 'arbalest' line. the companies won't be calling their products 'missile launcher +2' in 'real life'.perhaps a counter proposal should be to make the meta level visible in their name when you mouse over the icon*. that should solve most of your complaints i think. *why not in the name itself? because of the same reason in my previous post. the database names should be inviolate."
7/30/2011,i like the personality of meta level items :-) in fact i wish t1 and t2 items had the same unique names. let icon badges denote tier.
7/30/2011,eve is too hard
7/30/2011,"better solution would be to give the icons meta marking just like officer and t2 have. maybe number of tiny dots representing meta lvl. meta 1 one dot, meta 4 four dots...that is if the names can't be changed. some few modules need namechange anyway."
7/30/2011,"keep meta names, that's fine. if you use certain items enough, you can figure them outjust change the fracking hardwiring implant names! i remember looking at them once, i saw a ""beancounter"" implant give a bonus to industry, and another ""beancounter"" for something completely different. then there's the codes for their names. i once bought a 5% implant, thinking it was a kza when it was really kxa. at the time, i was relativly broke and that didnt help any[/rant]"
7/30/2011,"and in both of your examples above, i notice that the common denominator is you. why should ccp screw up our enjoyment of the game because you're an idiot?"
7/30/2011,"the implant names are pretty silly. sci-fi names or alphanumeric codes that don't correlate to their actual function, sure, i can live with that. but when every gorram implant has the same name even though they have different functions, something needs to change. even if i memorize what the name is, when i sort a list of them by name and still have to page through them to find the one i'm looking for, the naming scheme is broken!if nothing else put the alphanumeric code first in the implant name - i.e. ""sx-2 gunslinger hardwiring - eifyr & co"""
7/30/2011,"there will be some work, that's mentioned in the cons, but is that an excuse? it's like not cleaning up a room because everyone got used to it being smelly.as for the personality and lore, i suggested putting these in the description rather than the title. they'll still be there but without messing up everything.problem with that is, when you're browsing the market you cannot see the icons without without going to details tab, and then you'll have to scroll through tens of items back and forth, so that won't fix it."
7/30/2011,heaven forbid someone make an effort to educate themselves about a videogame they choose to play.
7/30/2011,i guess pi guys don't read the assembly hall much. probably because they're still busy clicking :d
7/30/2011,not supported.
7/30/2011,"hi sec is meant to be safer, if you want unrestricted wars go to 0.0 or w-space."
7/30/2011,i don't know whats more pathetic.... the lack of imagination or the fact these guys have carebear alts themselves as well.
7/30/2011,well i would recommend that you change the title to griefing carebears and you might get more support as there is already a noticeable tax for players in npc corps. as for your proposal not sure why you are going to bother posting this crap when ccp will never be enacted it as it will hurt there revenue stream.
7/30/2011,"i agree, the game should be centered around your personal desire to grief people who have no reason or desire to fight you, instead of simply targeting the abundance of people who both have reason and have the desire."
7/30/2011,i actually don't think the idea is bad by itself. i just think it was placed here by mental incompetents who should pass such ideas along to their betters so they can present them right.
7/30/2011,as csm i promise not to bring this up at the summits.
7/30/2011,"this thread should be called ""can i aggro?"" and can be summed up thusly:and, why not? why can you pay concord to kill the **** out of 50 players but you can't pay concord to kill the **** out of just one? and, why not make noob-corps war dec'able to solve this? it's eve! it's a sandbox! weeeeeeee!"
7/30/2011,"sadly, i have to agree.wardec is nothing more than paying off the cops to look the other way."

7/30/2011,i support this. although this is for the low-sec remake. currently i am offering sacrifices to pagan gods hoping they will do a real 0.0 revamp not just small scared changes.

7/30/2011,supported.bookmarks should be kept in the folders we put them in. god knows i had to reinstall the client over 30 times.
7/30/2011,"supporting. removing the feature in the first place was idiotic at best, malicious at worst (regarding ""rumors"" of it returning, at a price in aur)."
7/30/2011,"agreed.why ccp made it the current way eludes me. corp fittings go to servers, personal fittings should be saved locally. bandwidth and storage space costs ccp money so why not save a couple cents per user per month/year?"

7/30/2011,"you've a point, but typically i expect these kind of issues to be sorted by the devs localising the ui, not trying to make one size fits all users. at the very least it makes sense to me to go with the preference of the majority of users.still, which side the isk balance is on matters less to me than reclaiming another wasted blank line at the top of the wallet. ccp - please put the isk and aur balances side by side, if nothing else."
7/30/2011,"it is actually quite nice for those who use the feature, it helps getting rid of leftover aur that doesnt buy anything unless you break another plex.also nice for those of us who pay our sub with isk.even though nothing of the above applies to me, i still consider it a better idea than another useless gift ship."

7/30/2011,"mittens is making it more clear with every post that he is quickly becoming the sucking chest-wound in the csm. still love ya mittens, for all of your asshattery and douchebaggery (and your great tth column), but the csm, ccp and the players deserve a far better csm chairman."
7/30/2011,"what knowledge?mittens admitted that till very recently he didn't even know about abc's in all wh's.just makes me wonder howmuch else (common information) he isn't aware of and just pretends to know a lot about because he doesn't want to look like a complete idiot, but in the meantime has a group of other rejects that ""spoon""feed him information."
7/30/2011,"no one knows everything about eve. mittens and co. have a strong sense of nullsec mechanics, precisely why the nullsec block voted them in. i don't give too much of a **** about wormholes beyond that i think they are cool, but until the dscan is overhauled, they too much of a pain in the ass."
7/30/2011,"whs are not some obscure part of the game that nobody ever hears about or gets into. even more so, whs are considered null sec and technically that means they fall under null sec mechanics, which makes the fact that he doesn't know about them an even more glaring error."
7/30/2011,"you're arguing about sematics now. when i say nullsec, i mean conquerable space. i would really hope you'd have assumed that-- you must be new.unless you have an interest in whs, you tend not to spend much time in them. pretty simple really."
7/30/2011,so if i understand correctly this guy fee seas is the alt of our beloved csm leader maximo this is freaking burlesquei guess we get what we deserve... me for instance when i vote for the csm reps i look for a canadian and i vote for him regardless of what he or she writes in his electoral platform. maybe we should carefull to whom we give our vote toby the way i took the time to read what he wrote and seriously i cryed laughing so hard. at least he has the talent to keep his audience well entertained.
7/30/2011,"ok, while nearly every single person who lives in high sec and has had even a cursory encounter with whs knows how silly, illogical and nepotistic this issue is, its not going to make a difference because cms is run by null-sec. that being said, i think we need to get some organization and create a proper party with proper high sec candidates for csm so that we can stop this from happening and get some representation in csm for high sec. as such i know there are some people out there who are trying to organize something or are calling for the organization of some party. if you are one of those people, shoot me an in game mail and we can start figuring this whole thing out. regardless of what the null sec griefers and trolls say, high sec can get easily organized if people put even a little effort into it."
7/30/2011,"you are so clueless its cute. just so you know, whether or not ccp decides to nerf abcs will have nothing to do with the csm. ccp brought it up to them, and the csm isn't really pursuing it beyond, 'yeah, that seems ****ed,' when presented with ccp's data. until they release the data, you should really refrain from knotting up your panties to many times."
7/30/2011,"or alternatively, you are taking a wider view of what eve has to offer and not confining yourself to one aspect of the game. surely eve is big enough for everyone to play as they wish? after all who makes all the ships,rigs, ammunition used up in pvp?"
7/30/2011,"alts.i do a lot of industry. i mean a lot. a lot of 'pvp' players do. i've done mostly everything from mining to invention to jump freightering. the only thing i've avoided is t3 production and cap production. there isn't some arbitrary rule stating that if you use spreadhseets you can't pvp.without the carebears, the game continues.without the pvp, there is nothing."
7/30/2011,so i take it you're new then?
7/30/2011,"everyone can votenowehere in the rulebook are non-nullsec players restricted from voting. the csm has long been ignored by nullsec, to the point that the one one prior to this one was so unabashedly unrepresentative of nullsec that we as players organized to play a bigger role on this csm.use this as an opportunity to rally yourselves and perhaps collectively wet your little carebear panties on the next csm. or don't, i don't care."
7/30/2011,for someone who doesn't care you attempt to be very vocal.
7/30/2011,just tired of the level of stupid.
7/30/2011,"there. i said it! (i know; i'm a *****. i need to htfu. you can has my stuff? etc.)let me elaborate. i lost a myrmidon in dodixie trying to be a hero. i wanted to show some griefers that two could play that game, so i manned up and laid a well fit myrmidon on the line against a curse. i lost . . . not to a curse, mind you. to a machariel and some ""neutral"" rr and a curse. the machariel bumped me off station repeatedly and the ""neutral"" rr did what ""neutral"" rr does. it was what i expected, and, so, obviously, that's not why i'm quitting eve again.i am quitting eve again because eve doesn't give me the ability to be a hero.let me elaborate . . . in my real life, i am just some *******. i'm fairly athletic and fairly smart, but, really, i'm 1 of nearly 7 billion people. i'm nothing special. but, in eve online, the promise was that i could be immortal. i could lead an empire! i could amass wealth and fame and be glorious! but, let's face it. the endgame of eve is not being a hero of any kind. it's being a villain, and not even a super villain who dominates the galaxy with an iron fist. just a plain 'ole burglar or purse snatcher or child molester; serial killers and mafia dons are as high as it goes, and even those are rare. i was killed by thugs. they beat me up and took my wallet. that's it, and that's about as much as i feel like i could hope for in this game. i guess i could just cower in high sec and hoard loads of ""valuables"", also. either way, very disappointing. i had hoped to be a captain picard or a han solo (seriously). hell, i would have settled for an ace rimmer. none of those are an option, though. and here's why:bully modules:i would include the warp disruptor, warp scrambler (any kind of interdiction, really), stasis webifier, ecm jammer, energy neutralizer, and microwarpdrive in this classification. these modules interfere with other players' ability to pilot their own ship, and the older the player, the more these modules can exert such control. they allow other players to disable my ships' engines (i.e., they disable my ship; 1 modules does, 5 gigajoules per cycle, that's it!), hold me down, shut off my weapons, shut off most of my defensive capacity, and run circles around me in vessels of greater size and resources . . . and usually it's players who could have beaten you in a straight up fight, anyway.ccp knows these modules are unfair, which is why most npc's only use one of them, if any.suggestions:- make all modules in multiple, class variants; frigate, cruiser, battleship, capital; why should a frigate be able to interdict, web, or jam something 10 times it's size, let alone 1000 times it's size?- make interdiction chance based like ecm, or give a ship 500 points of warp strength and interdiction modules and warp core stabilizers 100, or 200, or 300, or 1000 (faction?) points of warp scramble strength; or allow us to just follow other players into warp and chase them around until they dock; or just remove interdiction entirely, since players will fight to the end either way, so long as they have something worthwhile to fight over- make it impossible to use a web and interdiction at the same time, just like it is impossible to use 2 afterburners or an afterburner and a microwarpdrive at the same time; or make it possible to use 2 afterburners (or 6 afterburners) or microwarpdrives or some combination of that; anyone who's seen world's scariest police chases knows that it's hard to stop a car; how about a thousands-of-tons interstellar spacecraft from the far future?; it should be very difficult, not very easy- the energy neutralizer should never neutralize more energy than it takes to run the energy neutralizer (or, explain how this relates to the laws of thermodynamics); or, how about making the nosferatu more effective, so if someone ""kills"" your energy with their energy, you can take some of their energy; think about it. you can ""kill"" x gigajoules, but only siphon x/n gigajoules (where"

7/30/2011,"x and n are real, whole number integers)?; also, where's the reverse shield transporter? that would be a good counter to someone shutting down your shield booster with neutralizers- the microwarpdrive needs more drawback; it's premise is that you use the ships warp engines to go faster (hence, a scrambler shuts it down), so a disruptor should shut it down, too; if it were well balanced, ccp would let you use it in deadspace. period.mining imbalance:veldspar is 0.1m3. mercoxit is 40m3's?there is a reason low sec isn't heavily populated, and this is primarily it. mining veldspar is safer and more profitable, because for the time and equipment needed to mine 1 unit of mercoxit with utterly no protection, i can mine 400 units of veldspar, in high sec. also, the increasingly powerful npc's that patrol the belts make mining higher valuable ore an impractical, intermitten activity at best for new and/or unaffiliated playerssuggestion: make all ores equal in volume and remove belt npc'sgame slant:games are ultimately games because all the players have a chance at winning. more veteran players, with more experience obviously have an advantage, but giving older players access to more advanced equipment, sometimes having functionality that more novice equipment doesn't even have takes that whole dynamic and multiplies it. it should be enough that an older player gets to use an armor repairer at a capacitor discount because of his skill, but that he gets to use a ship that also has an armor repairer capacitor discount and an armor repairer that has a capacitor discount and use a more advanced implant that gives him a armor repairer capacitor discount . . . etc., etc., etc. . . . well, it just gets assinine. older players can afford better equipment and fit more of it onto the same ship. at some point, the line has to be drawn as to how much better an older player is going to be. where is that line? who knows?suggestions: - remove skill restrictions from everything, or at least relax them- remove the double bonuses ships have; if a brutix has a hybrid and armor repairer bonus, give the eos and astarte better hybrid and armor repairer bonuses, or two different bonuses, but don't give 5 bonuses to a ship who's stats are already much better than it's t1 counterpart; it's overpoweringaggression mechanics:i had a rude awakening about the whimsical nature of aggression mechanics, once. i was in null sec in a hurricane. i jumped through a gate and there was an interdictor, so i reapproched the gate as he dropped a bubble. his buddies came and began to attack. i returned fire and went to jump out of the system. gong! nice try . . . see, in null sec, where you can attack other players at will, beyond the reach of the empires, where the gates are unguarded, out there in the wild west . . . the gates still lock you in the system . . . for shooting back. as an american (u.s. citizen), i was raised with the understanding that if someone attacks us, we are allowed, and even encouraged, to defend ourselves. we are not punished. i understand how difficult it would be to implement a ""reasonable force"" aggression mechanic, so we could protect ourselves without being punished, but locking someone out of a station or hanging them out to dry at a stargate for self-defense is, quite frankly, ass backwards.suggestions:- in null security space, i say ""aggression, smagression"". unless they aggress against the gate or station, let 'em play.- in low and high security space, lockout anyone with a global criminal countdown, for 15 minutes (why would an npc corporation aid and abet a criminal?); anyone else who is engaging in combat must be engaging in ""mutual combat"", therefore, let either of them dock or jump at will;- make dealing damage the only concordable offense; make everything else aggression towards the player (and, maybe, his corp)- make bumping an aggressive act!; if someone is fighting another person on the street and i shove t"
7/30/2011,"hem to the ground, that's aggression; it's simple; if x amount or x percentage of inertia is transfered from player a to player b, start the 15 minute countdown for player a; or, how about just making a hard enough collision inflict damage to both ships. bam! aggression.; or, just make players able to pass through eachother- why is any can a player-corp member drops automatically the belonging of the entire corp?; and, if stealing from a can is an act of aggression, why can't we unaggress by relinquishing what we stole and maybe paying some restitution; i can't kill someone for stealing my garden gnome, most especially not if the thief gives it back, right?; and if i do shoot at or otherwise engage the thief, that certainly doesn't give him the right to kill me; as far as i know, killing someone while attempting to rob them is ""special circumstance"", eligible for the death penalty, so you shouldn't be able to kill someone when they tried to stop you from robbing themthat's what i have for now. i probably should have posted this the last time i disengaged from eve, but i didn't want to seem angry or negative. i think the game is great and i will probably play it again at some point in the future. i just hope next time it's for more than a couple of months.fly safe."

7/30/2011,someone has to throw tomatoes at the poor clowns in the stocks.
7/30/2011,"got this idea off of vindicia.com""virtual-goods business models usually leverage virtual currencies as a form of aggregationtypically to entice customers to buy a larger amount of credit and purchase goods and products they want. since transaction costs are a larger percentage for lower price points, it makes sense to offer incentives for large credit purchases. for example, if $1 amounts to 100 credits, offer a bonus promotion of 600 credits for $5.""since the prices of items in the nex are likely to remain fairly high i thought that something similar could be applied for eve. something like 1000 more aurum for 2 plex, 4500 more aurum for 6 plex, etc. it's just an idea i wanted to bring up since i was doing some research on mt's. *putting on flame ******ant suit* flame on if you must."
7/30/2011,"not a bad idea.i don't really care about mt one way or another, but i'd be surprised if ccp didn't implement this at one point or another."
7/30/2011,ccp is discovering the harsh reality that prices are inelastic when it come to vanity items
7/30/2011,i like rule number 2. the other day i made a post and answered my post with one of my alt just to keep the thread going. this kind of thinking will bring you prosperity and success

7/31/2011,"i must agree with the 6 month thing, but not necessarily purchasing remaps. my issue is with the fact that after 6 months of a particular remap you have generally exceeded your need for said remap at that particular time. new ships require training, but after that training new ships need support training for mods and whatnot. and with all the different professions available, if somebody decides to turn a new direction, they are stuck until a remap is open. very restrictive if that period of time is a year. were not getting any younger and i see no problem accelerating every players training time by 5% yearly due to more productive skill training.i support the need for change, but not the means by which this thread is suggesting."
7/31/2011,well said.
7/31/2011,"as you read in my proposal, i'd rather just see ccp simply give us a neural remap every 6 months. the sad reality of it, however, is that ccp isn't likely going to introduce things like this, unless they can get extra money for it: that's just the result of going with greed these days. :( my proposal isn't so much to propose buying sp, but ere to give ccp an incentive to do the 'right thing,' whereas they're currently unwilling to do so, unless they see a bag of money first."
7/31/2011,"why not just cut to the chase and do away with remaps? and indeed statistics altogether.no seriously though, that's the logical end point of where this is all going. just have a set learning rate of whatever skillpoints per hour, with no dependency on statistics or implants and leave it there. then all this petty whining for ""just one more"" little extra advantage can cease.since the whole point of time based skilling is to eliminate skill-grinding and free us up to actually do stuff we want to, then let's do it properly.2500 sp/hr for every account all the time."
7/31/2011,"/signed for no insurance payouts for ship losses to concord. i also think ships destroyed in criminal action should have their wrecks impounded by concord which then can be purchased back by the victim for a percentage of the market value of the dropped modules.suicide ganking should be part of the game, in my opinion it should not be profitable for the gankers or so punitive on the gankees.yes i'm a 'carebear' or whatever you want to call me and yes i'm obviously speaking from the position of someone who has been on the wrong side of a suicide gank. i know that eve is a harsh game, but i think it would still be plenty harsh were it no longer possible for a few people in t1 battleships to destroy my mission running ship worth hundreds of hours intensive isk grinding in a completely unavoidable attack and actually make a profit from it...???if i'm honest i couldn't care two flips for the game experience of people who choose to play eve like this, if i had my way suicide ganking would only be for matters of honour or revenge and you wouldn't make a single isk from it. there seems to be a group of people who like to use eve to indulge in playground bullying simply because they can. they like to pick on carebears and laugh at them when they get upset, then hide behind internet anonymity and the excuse that it's 'just a game'. if someone spent hundreds of hours making a functioning replica naval warship then took it to the park to sail, would you snatch it out of their hands and stamp on it because it's 'just a toy'? it's scummy behaviour and the people who engage in it are at best extremely thoughtless, and at worst, bullies."
7/31/2011,"well at least you're honest that you want a completely unbalanced game purely in order to advance your own narrow interests in it. that alone earns you more respect than most of the weasel-wording whiners.there seems to be a group of people who think that they should always be allowed to win, and never have to lose. if someone spent hundreds of hours putting together a local baseball league which you then, would you throw a tantrum when you got caught out and your team lost, and threaten to sue the opposing team? such people are at beat extremely thoughtless, and at worst, childish, entitled losers.eve is one of the few games which doesn't tell everyone they're a winner just for trying, it's one of the very few mmos that it's possible to lose. that's what makes it special and if you dont like that aspect of it, then i can hardly understand why you're playing it."
7/31/2011,"all i saw from u was nothing but qq about how ganking a few miners somehow leads to the end of the universe.oh i know--u're slow since it took u so long to finally get it and u don't like being made fun of for it. if it's too much for u, u can tell me to stop and i'll...consider it."
7/31/2011,"-1dont agreesuicide ganking needs buff, not nerf"
7/31/2011,"lol :-dbut seriously, either grow a backbone and deal with the lone afk cloakie in your system, or press for no more local in 0.0, or local that only shows people who chat. growing a backbone is obviously beyond most of these whinging carebear botters, so expect more whinging remove local threads soon...though without local they'd actually have to defend their borders... uh oh, effort required! that won't work then."
7/31/2011,"i didn't see the proposal anywhere but i think i'll agree. all cosmos storyline modules definitely need to be boosted on attributes to make them better than meta level 4 and t2 modules. this would make them a sought after item.the prices for the materials, bpc's and modules is player driven, can't help that. all the materials to build the modules can be found in the various cosmos complexes the agents send you into. also some of the storyline modules are actually better than meta level 4 and t2."
7/31/2011,friendly bump.
7/31/2011,"just read this now. interesting proposal, but must be balance vis a vis the loss of income for pve missioners. essentially makes implant income for industrialists only. which leaves only factional and navy ships as income for mission runners? or am i missing something else?"
7/31/2011,"that is why i was trying to use current ingame mechanics, but i say that as little more than a novice in the programming field."
7/31/2011,"and that's why i think with the addition of crew damage, you can at least say that a gallentean fleet can withstand the most damage and keep hitting. minni's have high alpha, but wear them down and their ships start falling apart, slowing down, loose turret tracking. according to ccp lore, the required crews rank with gallente needing the fewest (at the low end of the range), then amarr, caldairi, finally matari.it sort of opens a different dimension in fleet tactics i think, you can hit hard and fast with matari, but if you are expecting a drawn out battle, on a long expedition into enemy 0.0 territory or wh and will be far from crew resupply, gallentean ships will win the endurance race, so better bring some along for fleet durability."
7/31/2011,"/supportedand personally i think that not only hybrids should be buffed, but also drones and gallente ships in general. i'm not saying that we should be op'ed but we do need a few boosts here and there."

7/31/2011,"maybe i just have too many characters with moderate to high sp (although i don't have near as much as some players), but i just don't see sp as any sort of achievement.it definitely isn't something to be proud of or valued.but i know that many of the people who leave eve leave because they feel they can never catch up. there is no 'level 80' that is the max level, which would cause them to catch up to those of us who have been playing a long time.now yes, many players who have played for a while understand that there is an effective level on different ships. i can't get any more sp that improve my ability to fly a zealot for example. but new(ish) players come from other mmos where this is not the case, so they haven't internalized this.isk is actually the more correct 'level' in eve, and we have had gtcs/plexs/etc for a long time (and no one suggests they go away).and yes, as already mentioned people can buy a character with isk. but people still often identify with their characters, and this is not a solution at all for new characters."
7/31/2011,"can you justify this stance? sp learning path is a long process. you can waste time training the wrong thing, you can be impatient and train the pilot skills or you can play it slow and stead and train core skills. it's a strategy, much like choosing your major in uni. i believe it is the *only* level mechanic in eve.i think most people who enjoy eve would agree that these players should just stick to playing wow or sw galaxies (oops that one died, i don't remember why).i disagree here. isk can be bought, stolen, loaned, etc. isk is less of a level differentiator than sp (more precisely, learned skills, not just raw sp), or standings."
7/31/2011,"your opinion is bad even though i don`t support buying sp. i`m sick and tired of words ""earned"" and ""easy"" and such. all it means you paid money to ccp and waited, nothing more. no accomplishment, nada."
7/31/2011,no.more people would leave over this than stay.i promise you. i'm absolutely certain.let those who want to be instant gods go play other games. we don't need their kind in eve.

7/31/2011,"when camping a gate or station i usually have a few bookmarks around it (as do most ppl i think), however when a possible target is flying around the distance the bookmark is made i still have to guess if he/she is close to it and how far i should warp.so i suggest showing your own bookmarks in space so you can see clearly if the target is close to it and how far of you have to warp to be able to snatch it."

7/31/2011,"in may 2003 eve came online too america 1 week sooner then in europe and there was only isk as currency only 5000 players could get online or server gets a break down.4 years later the plex came for those people who could not afford money too buy playtime. plexes where created with soul purpose for those who could make around 300 mil isk too buy playtime for a month.another 4 years there was the aurum. and how game technics work here i find strange.some people do not need plexes too play eve. but now they make the aurum. and too get too the aurum you need plexes. why?second why is not possible too get aurum directly through isk. because plexes are then high then low in price too obtain. while isk is a solid currency.i think the ones are are familiar with the concept plexes, the step too aurum is easy. but for people who buy playtime through other currency like the euro or dollar. the step too aurum get difficult. as they make the step too plexes the real currency that flows through ccp gets thinner. is ccp planning too get no currency at all anymore and make plexes there base currency in eve?"
7/31/2011,"i like anything that doesn't involve forcing my ram to load a million character polygons right after (and possibly right before) loading a million ship fleet polygons, in a game that already has the worst memory management i've ever encountered.i hope you're right, though the fact that they didn't give this option at release only makes me fear the worst."
7/31/2011,"reppyk, i wouldn't listen to page too much. she obviously isn't listening to you.i'm not sure what you're trying to say about faction ships (and i'm too noobish to be expected to), but i'll agree with you it's pretty clear hybrids are a main weapon at least among tech 1 gallente and caldari ships. caldari seem to be about evenly balanced between hybrids and missiles, with all (read, 100.0000000%) damage ships focused on either missiles or hybrids, never on both together. this doesn't mean a missile focused ship doesn't have a utility high it can't fill with a hybrid, and vice versa, but nobody can reasonably expect the other types of weapons to get much love on the thing. the closest thing to a compromise between missiles and hybrids is a merlin, and as far as i can tell it only has half and half to reduce its dps because it tanks so well. the funny thing is that it does a lot better with missiles even though it has a hybrid weapon bonus. when i was a noob i was killing stuff with my rockets in one, used the other highs for non-weapons cause i never scored any hits with hybrids.and hybrids are very clearly the main weapon gallente have. their ships generally have larger drone bays than other race ships, but only a handful actually have drone bonuses. yet the increased drone bay doesn't even come close to making hybrids work on those ships.supported because you seem to know what you're talking about."
7/31/2011,"i'm just talking from a general standpoint (with focus on balance and lore) so please don't jump all over me :)question: what pirate faction would that be? i always thought skill combos for the pirate where lore based, not arbitrary decisions just to make the game mechanics symmetrical. guristas operate in g/c spaceangels are influenced by m/g due to their tight alliance with each otherbloods span a/m territoryand sansha is a caldarian, but was banished to amarr fringes.how would they be able to fill the missing combos, and indeed, why should they?, (besides making some people with some sp invested in certain races sc skill happy.)well, khanids are a weird oddity. they aren't really a separate faction entirely, more like the thukker tribe but playable. so their ships are really amarrian, and as such need to be play balanced in the larger amarrian scale. i don't think it would be fair to give amarr another navy ship without giving every other race one too."
7/31/2011,amarr/ gallente pirate faction is equilibrium of mankind.they all use amarr hulls with railguns mounted.
7/31/2011,"here's an example fit like i was talking about. i can't fit mine exactly like this due to not having advanced weapon upgrades, but it's more than possible:highs:4x 425mm ac2x hammids:yt8 mwdys8 abweblows:tracking enhancerarmor explosive hardenerdamage controlrigs:anti-thermic pumpanti-kinetic pumpancillary current router (powergrid)now obviously this can't take hits like a tough cruiser, but that's irrelevant considering how swift it is. with about 11k ehp, it is a lot tougher than a destroyer. it's less agile, with a 5.4s align time (vs 4.4s in an unmodified thrasher), but its top speed is higher despite the armor rigs.also, it's no dps king. it doesn't have to be, either. if you want dps, use a rupture (which, though high for a cruiser, is still pathetic). the stabber can keep up with destroyers easily, as well as any frigate it gets a web on. add to this that its dps is quite a bit higher than a destroyer (176k w/ max skills vs. 140k thrasher w/ top weapons and max skills). (154 dps w/ assault launchers) so this thing is quite good at taking out the little ships. it's tracking obviously isn't nearly as good as a frigate, but i've found it still has little trouble hitting them. medium autocannons track about half as fast as small pulse lasers and have considerably higher range, despite losing very little range from ammo (unlike pulse lasers).signature radius comparison:35m - rifter75m - thrasher105m - stabber130m - rupture240m - hurricanefrigate average: about 41mdestroyer average: about 83mcruiser average: about 130mbattlecruiser average: about 285mso as you can clearly see, the stabber blurs the line between destroyer and cruiser when it comes to signature radius, as well as several other aspects. this gives it plenty of utility, and if it looks as good in practice as it does in theory, it should be a pretty useful hull.but you can't really know if it works till you try it. i have, and it does work."
7/31/2011,"duchess, do try to keep baseless inflammatory remarks to a min, and your credibility will also benefit. we aren't trying to shoot you down here, just asking due diligence questions. if you want general consensus, then the onus is on you to explain to the public (that's us!) the justifications for your arguments in plain terms, and we have the right to ask for clarifications, without any berating.anyways,okay, this is true. now that its apparent that you are speaking from a purely maxxed out t2 standpoint.so am i correct to assume that assume that your numbers are also comparing a fully t2 maxxed out drake? by my guesstimates, comparing fully maxxed kits on the caracal and the drake, we have about 30m vs a 60m kit. of which, only insurance covers only 2m and 30m respectively. this i presume is the source of your gripe.1 general point, have you considered the effects of your changes on non-maxxed out t2 fits? it does sound like a maxxed out t2 modded caracal is not a smart idea, but then what if the simple answer to this should be that you shouldn't fit one like this? maybe the 'progression' should be (as you sp up) caracal with t1 fits, then when you can fit some t2 mods go drake, then when the mods for drake overcome the price, move to cerberus (higher insurance).so i'm going to put forth a postulate (which you may feel free to refute) postulate:the market based solution would be not to use t1 cruisers for pvp on a 1 on 1 basis.as you put it (now that we understand each other) t2 modded t1 cruiser hull is not cost effective. instead of resorting to game mechanic changes, what if this just means that if you want to use t1 cruisers (or any ship), fit them cheap (relative to their insurance prems) and just use more of them.ie t1 fit caracal may not match a drake (nor should it) but >1 of them may give the drake a problem. a t2 fit caracal is not cost efficient, so instead you should use drakes instead if you can. not everyone in the game can fit t2 maxxed mods. so changing mechanics only based on this situation is dodgy, and you can easily inadvertently make a t1 fitted caracal be able to destroy a t1 drake. which then doesn't seem right considering their price differences.really what the perfect fix would be is if insurance worked on the mods fitted, but that would be too complicated as ins would need to be invalidated each time you refit.in summary, i'm not against any changes you proposed perse, just the economical justification. the role of a t1 cruiser is multi-faceted. just because it isn't a good choice for pvp, doesn't mean it needs a buff to be. maybe its fine that its a pve missioning boat only. or a noob ship. if you buffed them, it would take a bit away from the role of hacs wouldn't it?"
7/31/2011,"overpoweredness of tier2s was evident since the day 1. it's kind of sad to see people barely realising it now, but it's still better than nothing.each tier2 bc is to lose 1 high and 1 med(low) slot - and this is the prerequisite of making them actually balanced both with cruisers and command ships.stupid penny pinchers and abusers may now go *** themselves."
7/31/2011,"true. if hull cost and slotlayout ratio was static, 3mil hull could have 8 slots and 30mil hull would have 80 slots . 3mil hull costs about 3 modules worth and 30mil hull costs 30 modules.if you buff cruisers you need to increase hull cost to maybe 9 mil. even then the slots-hullcost ratio isn't comparable between cruiser and bc but it would help."
7/31/2011,"that fit you suggested needs awu v, and a 2% grid implant, and still has half the ehp and dps of another cruiser, also it costs significantly more than a t2 frigate, which would outperform it in every way. sorry but you're making a really terrible case for this ship. all the fits i have are mediocre at best and the ones you're suggesting are just a mess. stabber needs a buff.pretty much yeah, t2 is the standard and pretty much mandatory for a lot of ships and setups.(lasers underperform without scorch, and have you seen the prices on meta hmls? just as a couple of examples.)this is exactly the problem we have now, actually. battlecruisers are regarded as a higher tier of ship, when what they should be is an alternative with pros and cons of their own. hac vs bc is a choice that needs to be weighed up, and is not a straightforward ""upgrade"" either way. bc vs cruiser should be the same.the suggested changes are not because of their performance on a 1v1 basis. in fact i'm pretty sure i specifically stated the situation of bc > cruiser in a 1v1 fight is absolutely fine right now.the problem is that their role has been taken over almost entirely by the battlecruiser.and >1 t1 fit drakes would give >t1 fit caracals a problem.seriously, any suggestion you make on use of cruisers at their current performance i can just as easily apply to bc hulls, resulting in the cruisers getting obsoleted yet again. i happen to have a budget fit for the drake myself which offers close to t2 performance at a fraction of the price.this is why cruisers need a buff, anything they can do bcs can do better. (with the obvious exception of the blackbird.)there is no way the changes suggested here are going to make it a smart idea to engage a drake in a caracal. the buffs and nerfs on each side just aren't big enough to make this a viable fight, but they are big enough to give cruisers a role seperate from bcs.this is a terrible situation. more viable ships = more variety = better game.nope, hacs would remain more or less where they are - a significant price increase for better performance and roles that bcs/cruisers can't fill.example: the current harbinger/zealot decision would then become harbinger/zealot/omen.also how would you justify some ships being broken for pvp, pve and as noob ships? because you don't have to look hard to find hulls that fit that description."
7/31/2011,"lvl3 mission boat for players with <100mil isk. okay, it may not be much, but this is a valid role for t1 cruisers. people who are more combat oriented in the game, perhaps can think of more. alright, let's look at the situation in the reverse. instead of saying, 'hey there are these cruisers which seem to be not useful for pvp"". can you instead try to describe the fleet 'hole' that you are trying to fill with cruisers? is there a hole? what i mean is tacklers are frigs, you have bombers, covert, the dps tank is the bc. what other role do you see that can be useful in pvp here?what i'm trying to tease out (or perhaps bring to your attention) is buffing something is fine, when you have a objective that you want the buff to achieve. just making a cruiser a faster but lighter tanked dpser in a gang... one must ask, is there room or even need for a lighter tanked dpser in a gang? why not just use the bc? cost?if you wanted to go and rebalance all these lesser used hulls, then i would have imagined you starting with the dessie. i mean, at least cruisers get used a lot in pve missions for people on tight budgets. dessies have no use at all anymore, except that of a 'budget noctis'.funny situation may be, after a cruiser buff, people start complaining about the uselessness of dessies, so they buff dessies to be as fast as frigates, then people start complaining about how t1 frigates are completely useless and unused... as everyone uses dessies when they want a fast hitter.i personally am open to a careful, controlled buff on cruisers, maybe making them a tad faster is alright, but i defer to ccp to run the numbers on the balance here. i am still of the opinion that they already have a great role to play in pvp... ie a budget battlecruiser for those not using t2 mods. i like that i can throw away my cruiser without much financial hit."
7/31/2011,"that's not a role, that's grasping at straws. a ships usefulness for pve is purely incidental and should never have any bearing on pvp balancing. i hope you don't seriously think that 15 or so ships existing purely as newbie trash is good games design.... did you even read any of the op? the whole purpose of the mobility buffs and nerfs is to split the two ship sizes by speed, making the battlecruisers as slow as their size should be and the cruisers considerably more agile, and much better fitting in a gang that requires it.this principle is already applied in practical pvp - when was the last time you saw someone bring along a drake to a nano gang? the problem right now is that the gap is too small relative to the tank/gank difference, and the economic issues only compound this.seriously, the proposal outlines very clearly what the distinction and role between the two sizes should be, and all you can say is that cruisers are fine because they have stupidly nich<U+FFFD> pve roles?of course, precise role will differ from ship to ship. as a few examples of post buff-- caracals and omens will make very nice ranged damage dealers- stabbers will be very workable cheap nanoships- mallers will actually be worth flyingetc. etc. etc.there's so much potential in the current cruiser lineup that a bit of well placed rebalancing would neatly sort out.by the way:... right, defer it to the people who made the dramiel go 6km/s and the omen not even have the grid to fit basic weapons and an 800mm plate, among numerous other blindingly stupid design decisions."
7/31/2011,@ opthe balance of t1 cruisers is fine. one point you brought up was speed. they should be slow so you want to get to t2 or specific ships. i remember it took me 3 days to get into a tech 1 cruiser. it should perform as such./notsupported because it would
7/31/2011,"how exactly is the balance ""fine"" when half of them are utterly mediocre and the other half are largely obsoleted by bcs?this is one of the stupidest arguments i've ever heard. it takes a couple of extra days, if that, to get into a drake from a caracal. does that mean it should perform barely any better?conversely, it takes much longer to get into a hac - does that mean it should be an unstoppable pwnmobile what wipes out any bc that gets in my way?even a 2 week old player has usually figured out the game doesn't work that way. come back when you have something remotely intelligent to contribute."
7/31/2011,wow trolling your own thread huh. yea hac's should wipe bc's. cause it takes more skills/resources to get there. maybe u want to play wow
7/31/2011,"... right, except they don't. they have this thing called different roles. it seems you're only capable of thinking of ship balance in the very simplest terms, namely ""bigger/pricier is better"". once again, the game doesn't work this way, and i suggest you try to understand that."
7/31/2011,do you see the should there? nerdrage much? cya

7/31/2011,"i want more variety in the game, rather than an entire size class being relegated to newbie trash for no good reason.you want the one with the biggest shiniest thing to win all the time. sounds much more like the wow player attitude to me but hey, it seems you've either not read or not understood the op because you've made no points at all to refute or counter a single thing i've said. all you do is rage and spew insults, no coherent argument whatsoever.edit: that last quote is a prime example actually. worthless strawman arguments not based on any evidence or fact."
7/31/2011,"the ideal end result:- cruisers are lighter, faster, and more economically viable compared to battlecruisers and also have a greater number of viable classes.- battlecruisers are slightly toned down but maintain their role as anti-cruiser, and generally higher dps/tank platforms for gangs where speed is less of an issue.thoughts?are basically your points1st: there are t2/navy/t3/etc.. cruisers that serve this purpose. 2nd: would change the mechanics of many aspects of the game to serve this little niche you are crying about= fail sorry -1edit:: look at the big picture ex think of how badass a drake speed tank would be!!! thats right it would be too badass"
7/31/2011,"and would continue to do it, better than the t1s. your point?umm, no, it really wouldn't. it would make cruisers a viable alternative while refining the bcs nich<U+FFFD> down a bit from ""all-purpose pwnmobile"".having a large number of ships in-game that have no real purpose is not good design. simple as. why is a greater number of viable choices a bad thing? the rocket buff a while ago made several previously broken ships workable, thus adding more choice. same principle here.there are no core mechanics changes in this proposal, just buffing a number of broken ships and more clearly defining cruiser role."
7/31/2011,think about this for just a min before you reply. i would be able to dps fit my drake to solo lvl 4's. that is not a correct game mechanicas for your t1 comment. well thats the benefit of flying ships better then t1's. i assume you are a poor pirate and are looking to exploit because your op makes no sense when you really think about it
7/31/2011,"the main problem lies within t1 cruisers and bcs filling the same role, but for a marginal price difference and a few days of training, bcs are practically better at everything.my proposal would be to give bcs a fitting bonus on bs class weapons (not just an increase in grid and cpu, 'cause that would be abused), so they can fit the small tier bs turrets which don't get used by bs anyway.get rid of some highslots, so the overall dps would stay the same.effects: they would still be a highly mobile, decently tanked dps platform for low cost compared to a bs (reminder: solely losing the rigs on a bs costs more than the entire bc loss), but cruisers could get under their guns thanks to bs class weapons crappy tracking & sigresolution.that way, both had their niche."
7/31/2011,"please point out where exactly i suggested enabling drakes to speed tank? because if i did that was one hell of a typo.oh look, more strawman arguments.i had the idea a while ago of putting a tracking penalty on bcs. similar effect overall."

7/31/2011,"i like your idea, but i think it needs tweaking. if implemented as you describe, pilots will probably find it an easy (and dishonest) way to raise their security status, simply by shooting an alt with low security status.supported, with reservations, because i think it is a great idea if it can be made to work."
7/31/2011,i have hard time seeing this would make any difference because no one is shooting blinkys anyway even tho they can pretty freely aggro them anywhere
7/31/2011,"supported.it seems like one way of getting around the aforementioned exploit (pirates killing alts to improve sec status) is to scale the re-gained sec status to the amount of damage/property destroyed. that is, if the pilot takes out a pirate in a shuttle, he gets next to no standings increase. if he takes out a fully loaded bs carrying t2 bpos and bunch of high-end ores, then he gets a substantial standings boost. basically, if a pirate wants to game the system, they have to lose/risk a lot to do it."
7/31/2011,"this gives them the incentive to do so. when you pay for/reward a behaviour, you get more of that behaviour from people."
7/31/2011,"i think that would work. however, ccp would have to improve the system that determines the base value of the stuff on a ship, especially in the case of blueprints."
7/31/2011,how do killmails do it? an avg of jita mid prices ? that could work. don't forget to factor in insurance costs as well. pirates alts are really only losing the insurance premium and the base price vs jita repurchase price difference. not the cost of the ship.
7/31/2011,yeah there's no way that this could possibly be exploited wts: sec boosts. provide me with a supply of t1 frigates (any kind) and pay 50m/hr and you can shoot me until your sec is 5.0!

7/31/2011,"umm, not sure if this has been suggested, but what about scaling the sec status gain by ship size/type? tech 2s, faction and bigger ships yielding a bigger gain than frigates etc. and rookie ships and shuttles giving no gain whatsoever.in any case, great idea.edit: oh and i'm also in favour of this system only working for people with, say, -1 - 0 or higher? that would need tweaking. additionally: tech 1 should give a lower gain across the board, to account for the likelihood that they're insured.edit2: ... now that is interesting"
7/31/2011,"there is only one issue i can see with this and it's my own -10 status. your idea will move me off -10 if i shoot another pirate.i'm not against it, just wonder if we can limit this so only those with sec status of -5 and above will gain?"

7/31/2011,"hi all1st time poster after 12 months in eve.petitions:it seems an odd statement when individually asking for assistance, as the term ""petition"" (for me at least, and many i have asked ) relates to a collective of people all petitioning for the same outcome, hense ""petitions"" should be re-vamped to something more in line with (""help"", ""request for help/assistance"", ""attention required"", ""comment"").gates:when warping to gates, we should come to a complete stop rather than bouncing off the gate and heading back into space.bpo's:there should be a seperate market category under blue prints, 1 for bpo's, the other for bpc's.something i would like to see implemented:* customisable ship colors - corp names, and or ship names on sides of vessels.* bridge view option - ( as opposed to chase view all the time ).* buying a crew - purchased on the open market, the better the crew, the better the enhancement of your ships performance operationally.* fuel - varying grades of fuel, the higher the grade, the better the warp speed.well, that's it for the time being, go hard & full throttle on your thoughts and criticisms.cheershuntsmanthe house of 5trippers"
7/31/2011,"they're called petitions, because you put an idea out there. whether that idea is to fix something, or have something corrected. then ccp folks get together, and ""sign"" your petition if they support you getting your stuff back. or they don't because ""the logs show nothing"".there's always some variance in where you come out of warp. sometimes you stop 2km away, sometimes you overshoot.market can only list items that have the exact same stats. hence why only brand new bpos are listed. anything that's been modified, such as research on bpos or bpcs, has to be listed as a distinctly separate item, which is handled via contracts.1) custom paintjobs, corp logos, and such have been asked about for a long time. they may or may not be coming through the new noble exchange.2) there is no ""bridge view"", because there is no bridge. your character is floating in a goo pod like the matrix, and is experiencing everything through virtual reality. what you're seeing, is what your character sees.3) crew is also often asked for, but really unnecessary. for the most part, everything is controlled mentally by the pilot. the crew is only there to make sure the tp in the bathroom is stocked, and the hallways are swept. if they were added to the game, it would just be another slot to min/max like rigs.4) fuel is already an issue for cap ships, when it comes to jumping. if every ship had to keep an eye on their fuel gauges or risk floating in enemy space, it would be a huge pita. besides, that's what the capacitor is for. if you want to warp faster, get a better ship, or fit hyperspatial velocity optimizer rigs."
7/31/2011,"bpc's can't be sold on the conventional market though, only on contracts. this nullifies your suggestion.unless your suggestion is to have bpc's sold on the market as well, but that has it's own issues.ship colours - they're working on that, doubt we'll see the rest though.bridge view - like a nose cam? it's possible i suppose. edit: though now that i think about it, it would be useless as you wouldn't be able to see anything around you, only in front.buying a crew - been suggested a bagillion times, no one knows if it's coming or not.fuel - our ships have no need for fuel, it seems."
7/31/2011,"what i believe to be wrong with dscan currently:uniform short scan duration regarless of range.identification of names of ships as well as the ship model (the actual ship and not ship type eg bestower and not industrial).dscans role in eve online & points to take into consideration.a lot of people use dcan religiously.its an integral tool for gang and fleet strategy.any changes or fixes to it would need to be fair and reflect the current dscans abilities and shortcomings, at a tactical level. proposed changes:scan duration should tie in with its current scan range. scan results should not include shipnames or discreet ship model names, but ship class names.scan results should show distance to target but without a numerical indication of scan range deviation of 25% (based on user defined scan range)>>> explainations <<<the longer the range the longer the scan duration and therefore the less server requests for max range dscans in busy contested systems. its totally logical.dscan should not be able to identify shipnames or shiptypes like rhea or capsule or vagabond, but be able to identify hull size or approximate ship type from sig radius and categorise them as say freighter, capsule or cruiser. there should be no way such a short scan on items within a 14au range should return such detailed information so quickly. because of this its immersion breaking, even if youd hate that both a vagabond and a celestis would come back as a cruiser, it makes much more sense than the current system.this form of returned result would have tactical advantages if tied into ships signature radius, as active mwds could skew results into a larger shiptype (eg a battlecruiser with an active mwd could be erroneously categorised as a battleship). this would depend on tests to check whether this has any increased server overheads otherwise it could just return the ship class.its an outlet for racist, sexist, inflamatory and profanic messages, though hardened to this from years of fleet chat links, in retrospect itll probably help with game promotion if kiddies starting out in eve in hisec arent asking their mothers what a blue waffle is when they see it as a ship name on dscan.what this sort of ship identification nerf should be rebalanced with is the dscans ability to pinpoint distances. but with a varying degree of accuracy. accuracy thats not based on levels in astrometrics but fixed across all shiptypes and all skill levels.using the dscan should be a skill that pilots learn by practice and not grinding sp.much like probes, distance approximations should carry a level of deviation. so for example the max dscan distance of approx 14au should have a sufficient deviation derrived from its range, in percent. i put this figure at 25%hence a 14au scan with a result of 1 contact at 12au would mean that that contact can reside in a space anywhere within 9au and 15au due to the deviation of 12aus at 25% = 3aus. the shorter the range thats scanned the smaller the deviation, even though the percentage stays fixed.an explanation of this deviation for game immersion can be that scanning to a longer ranger requires a boost to signal strength, and that this boost negatively affects scan resolution.how i arrived at this percentage was to approximate a contact that would lay close to the maximum scan range and push the deviation out to a point that it would likely encompass not just a single planet and its moons but likely a few planets. this form would still require pilots to range-find contacts.this is an approximation of the way many pro pilots use the current dscan to calculate contacts distance by constant re-scanning and range finding using approximate km equivalents of aus, then ranging smaller values until the contact can only reside in a few specific areas.tbc.."
7/31/2011,continued... the only downfall is that to scan at a tighter deviation you need to be closer to the contact. to me thats logical as scanning at larger distances should distort sensor resolution. \o/ maccloud

7/31/2011,well i wasnt going to put any actual numbers down on the max 14au distance scan duration bt was thinking aound 10 seconds... so unless you know sum1 who can scan u down from start to finish in 10 seconds flat id be amazed.but the typical 4au scan duration would be along the lines of 1 second.tbh im envisioning the scan duration vs range graph to be exponential or relatively exponential in shape. so small and medium range scan duration are actually shorter than current scan speeds with the recal warning.
7/31/2011,"dscan should be passive instead of the clickfest it is now.have it use capacitor depending on the settings. setting could be:-angle-range-result type: ship, probe, wreck...-frequency: how often you get resulthigher values would cost more cap.there could be limit to frquency to prevent lag. if you had max range, 360 degree scan with all result types you could be limited to one scan every 20secscanner would have to be reactivated manually every 5 minutes to prevent people forgetting it on and lagging server.examples:belt ratter could use 2au range, 360 degree, ship and probe result types and he'd get a result every 2 seconds and it would cost 0.1% of max cap with every result.scout could use 7au range, 10 degree, ship result type and get result every second and would cost 0.05% of max cap.noob would use 14au range, 180 degree, ship, drone and wreck results but would be limited to a scan every 12sec and it would drain 25% of max cap with every result"
7/31/2011,"trolling aside i can see where you are going with this miss spank. i really do feel that someone that suicide ganks you has that right to do so because they are doing it on a fair playing field, that being risks are the same for both parties because the mechanics of high sec. that being the concorde beat stick and the risk of being in space in general. i think you are steering away from the issue. the issue here is players exploiting the wardec game mechanics. they obviously do not have a legitimate grievance with said corp they wardec'd and have no business attacking them. i'm not saying take that option away. what i am proposing is changing the rules a small amount as to stop obvious exploitation. sephiroth i like your idea better then the flat rate i put out. i think that is a really good idea if not taken advantage of but i can see, myself included, people making tons of alts and putting them in corp to avoid a wardec. maybe put a limit on how much it would cost or something.kin netics and lakitel thank you for your perspectives on this."
7/31/2011,"though, i'm not agreeing to either statement to raise or leave the current wardec fees, i do think this above statement is unfounded. i don't see how making fees more will make pvper want to waste more money by suicide ganking. suicide ganking has little relation to wardec fees, and its only governed by the amount of isk a gankee is carrying. put another way, wardec or not, if a pvp gang sees a gank target worth taking, they will suicide gank it... not wait for a wardec on a corp."
7/31/2011,"recently, i became aware of a real case of a corp being destroyed in a matter of a few weeks by frivolous war-decs. this upstart corp had succeeded in gathering a treshold number of players, like 40. most of them were newbies, just a few weeks old, but also a couple of real veterans, 3, 6, 7, years old, with previous experience of living in lowsec and 0,0.for these, this corp was to be a new start, a new voyage through eve. everybody was excited about this new joint venture and what could be built of this corp.but even before it really took off, the war-decs started to drop in. my guess is the recruitment visibility drew attention. anyway, the young players whith limited rl funds, who relied on plex to be able to play, were pretty much forced to leave. the dropouts affected things badly in the corp ofc, but so did the consequtive war-decs. some old player tracked and hunted alone, but ultimately didn't dare to do something. you see, he would risk hurting his corp even more, prolonging the war by giving the pvp'ers what they wanted, a fight.it didn't really matter, i guess, because the corp died anyway. the more people dropped off, the faster others followed them.ultimately, the real loss here is not the corp or the rare occasion of an assembly of people with chemistry, goals and time zones that could have worked well, but the dozen or so new eve players who quit playing for good.this is not something that is good for eve, and thus not even good for those pvp players who only think about their vain killboards and make these wardecs to have easy targets in highsec.so yea, i think something should maybe be done about this."
7/31/2011,"excellent point and example of the retention this is causing. unfortunately i am sure the griefers do not care about retention, know what it means, nor understands how it effects them."
7/31/2011,"i think another point that we should bring up here is when new people are starting out now they are having a much much harder time then when the veterans started. it's really night and day. the ratio of average skill points to new players is much higher which is in turn making it much easier to be a veteran. i think i can simplistically state it like this: ""no-one will play with you in your sandbox if you keep throwing sand in their face."""
7/31/2011,quoted for infinite truth. why should ccp have to step in here when it's well within player abilities to mitigate this problem?
7/31/2011,again you are steering away from the topic. this thread has to do this the obvious exploitation of wardec mechanics. not avoiding them... please re-read and reply on-topic. i would like to see the other perspective and not a short troll reply
7/31/2011,"that was on topic. lady spank put it perfectly - wardec mechanics don't need changing, it's just a simple fact of eve that if you start a corp you need to be both able and willing to deal with problems that will arise.it's perfectly possible to do so, and as such changes are not needed.oh but of course, if it was a troll reply or had no merit, you'd be able to refute it. why don't you give that a go? come on, surely it's an easy point to answer.edit: and here's another question - do you really think wardecs would be so widespread if people didn't practically paint a target on their ships? most of the noob corps i've seen wardecced were practically begging for it - lax recruitment, advertising themselves as carebears, and not having a clue how to deal with the consequences."
7/31/2011,i am replying to everyone while i can to be respectful. you are still off-topic. avoiding wardec is not the issue at all and was never stated by me ever. lady spank was off-topic as are you. please re-read and reply or not if you don't get it.
7/31/2011,"ok, i'll put this nice and simply for you, because you seem to be a pretty simple person.(pirates blow up your general comprehension along with your ship?)you made a whine thread, saying wardec fees should be increased.this suggestion had the aim of reducing wardecs.this suggestion is unnecessary, because the means to deal with wardecs are already available to players who aren't too inept to use them.understand yet or do i need to use shorter words?"
7/31/2011,"ok well i guess you don't get it, or you are trolling. either way you comprehension needs work."
7/31/2011,"is this your point? because besides that you were showing me your leet comprehension skills. if so again let me restate; this thread is not about avoiding wardecs. it is about aggressors spamming wardecs on new players to exploit kill-boards and result is hurting retention of new players, thus hurting eve as a whole. please if you have something to add on-topic please do so with a little more maturity."
7/31/2011,"your solution to which is increasing costs, which is pointless, for the reasons outlined above. seriously, do i need to use shorter words or something here? maybe draw you a diagram?"
7/31/2011,ok i give up if u refuse to address the issue i can't answer you
7/31/2011,"i just did, you tool. you suggested an increase to wardec costs, i explained using nice easy words why this is a stupid idea. you then threw a hissy fit about it being ""off topic"" when in fact it's answering the key point of the op - the mechanics change."
7/31/2011,"ok, maybe you will understand it this way. i'll just tell you what what's correct. you are supposed to be responding to the topic which is; your opinion on aggressors wardecing easy targets to get kill-mails and the effect it has on retention of new players. if you have an idea for a solution, great. please reply with your thoughts. do not just focus on a minor suggestion to fix the problem but the original post, the whole post. i have outlined the main points above. i do not know what else to do to make you understand this. whats your highest level of schooling?edit:: also do not focus on what others replies that were off-topic. it is not part of this thread"
7/31/2011,"a significant change to game mechanics was part of your post, i answered it. if you don't want people to respond to it, remove that point."
7/31/2011,i can agree with the op but i don't think a flat fee is the way to go. i have heard of and experienced people that do this. i gotta be honest if i didn't find a good corp as i did i would of left a long time ago. this will make it less profitable and less inviting for people to pull this crap. so i can see how raising the price would effect how much it gets done.
7/31/2011,so agreed! it's almost as if you read my recent post on the matter. :)+1
7/31/2011,"wardec fees were once much lower than they were now. they were increased because ccp caved into pressure from whiney carebears who want a ~risk-free~ game experience.if you want a risk-free game, i know of a different game you should be playing."
7/31/2011,"so what is it? the only thing you said is ""the mechanics for dealing with this are there"". so what exactly are they? and to curb your next reply: no i am not too inept to see it, i'm not a nub, i'm not stupid, i'm not a carebear, i'm not an idiot in any way shape or form. so now that we have your insults to me out of the way, how about you post exactly what these steps are? and ""they are mechaincs in place to deal with it"" is just a re-iteration of what you said without adding anything new, and saying ""you are stupid"" is not even an argument, so i won't accept that either. in fact, here is a short format of how it should be represented, just to make sure:- problem: new players leave because they get grief dec'ed solution: x (whatever that solution may be) (also, let me say that leaving a corp is not viable solution, that's a problem with the game mechanics, not a solution)- - - - - i don't know that charging just 1mil per corp members is enough, i think there should be some kind of formula, maybe something like (number of aggressor corp) x (number of victim corp) / 3. so say a 10 man corp attacking another 10 man corp would cost 33mil. and again, even that amount isn't even that large, if a corp is ready to start a war deceleration, then they should have more than enough to cover that. i would even be in favor of dividing the number by 2 instead of three, but i'm trying to be fair :p.edit: let me add that nobody is saying that high-sec should be risk free, what we are arguing here is that the risk is too high because the loss on the victim is disproportionate to the loss of the aggressor. compare spending 2mil a week to having a whole corp collapsing and having new members quiting the game (and there are several, several cases). so i would suggest you hatebears keep your null-sec opinions to yourselves."
7/31/2011,"i think you got this figured backwards: you want the 'isk free' wardec experience. you can currently circumvent highsec concord intervention, and keep a corp decced for an entire year, for the measely cost of running 1 single mission! (sic!) that's absurd. yes, i know you want griefing-on-easy-street; but if people had just a few honest bones in them left, they'd admit how ludicrously low the cost of wardeccing is."
7/31/2011,"funny, but you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. between being grief dec'ed until you loose all your members and your corp collapses, suicide gankers (who have no risk since they get reimbursed the ship cost in insurance), the constant deflation and cost of minerals going steadily down and now ccp trying to screw with us from incursions, such as open wh and sending in the sansha in non-incursion systems and of course the csm being controlled by you null-sec'ers, i would say that high-sec is much more risky than your blue-blob, safe, nap-sec space.if you want to dominate people and impose your control on them, then i suggest you try soviet russia, **** germany or the middle-east because you were obviously born in the wrong time and/or place."
7/31/2011,the problem here is people griefing new players by creating corps which are unable to organise and defend themselves.therefore my counter-proposal is that creating a corp should require corp management 5 and cost 100m isk
7/31/2011,"well, either way i definitely support this. i can see this helping a pant-load of people. sure a few greifers and easy-streeters might get annoyed by it, but if they wanted no challenge what so ever, they can go play wow."
7/31/2011,"ty for the support. i have yet to see a actual counter argument besides the usual toll bs. i welcome a well thought out counter-perspective besides ""go play wow"". idiocy seems to be prevalent in these counter arguments. actually no-one has addressed the issue. i assume yall know its bs i am supporting my own topic because of the lack of a counter-argument"
7/31/2011,"how exactly does 'wardeccing noobs' exploit killboards?why is it such a huge issue that it needs to affect a widespread practice?1. how do you imagine this will increase pvp in low and null sec? people that want to be in those area's already are, furthermore 0.0 alliances still get wardecced to pick off high-sec stragglers. the only people truly immune to player initiated wardecs are pirate corporations who can be shot by anyone regardless of concord sanctions, or those in npc corps, including fw corps. ramping up the price of war does nothing but sink more isk for the agressors, it will not make them move to low/null since their targets are in high-sec. if you respond ""no well they should"", you are missing the point that they want to kill those that think they have a right to immunity. whether you think this is 'fair' or not is irrelevant. anyone that doesn't want to be on the receiving end of a wardec can drop corp and be as safe as they were before war was declared. you forefeit the right to be in a corporation and develop a name. can't fight for it? don't deserve it.2. are noobs incapable of avoiding wardecs?3. eve does not need to be 'more inviting' to new players. as it is at present, noobs can remain in npc corps until they are ready to enter a corporation. if they keep their mouths shut and don't stick out it's unlikely they will get wardecced anyway. if you do get wardecced and go out and have 'all your **** blown up by some ******* that you have utterly no chance against' then it's your own fault for flying 'all your ****' while knowingly being in a state of war. again, if you can't handle a war, you can drop to an npc corp, therefore your entire reason for this proposal is nullified.4. who gives a crap about killboards. they are external to the game. how exactly is their 'exploitation' damaging to the game? people like lukka who get to number 1 in battleclinic through cheap game mechanics are known for what they are and it has zero bearing on the actual game.i have addressed your 'points' in full since you can't understand that players have all the tools they need to circumvent any issues you have raised.feel free to refute any of these, and please try to do a better job than claim i am trolling. anyone with an ounce of intelligence can see that i am not."
7/31/2011,"i find it eminently amusing that wannabe pirates, like you, dare talk about 'risk aversion' when your own set of balls is so small that you cry foul when your successful act of 'bravery' (= deccing noob high-sec corps) is being threatened by a nerf. if you're such a big badass, then hightail your sorry ass to lowsec, pronto, and fight people who can actually fight back, you pansy!"
7/31/2011,"i already do pew pew in low sec. i can barely enter high-sec. thanks for showing your incompetence to everyone.furthermore, i am not crying foul, i am pointing out how naive and poorly set out this proposal is. the whole thing needs to be rethought if the intention is purely to help nurture noobs into the game because at present is it a huge change to wardecs across the board when the entire issue can be easily avoided by player action."
7/31/2011,"ty for an actual response. you are twisting my words but w/e i'll take what i can get. i will answer this in the same format you provided me with answers 1. i assumed this was obvious. the players that sit in high sec blowing up noobs/miners/etc... will not have such an attractive easy way to gain kills and isk by griefing easy targets. this is not about a player trying to be high and mighty in high sec. this is about making players like lukka have a harder time justifying keeping wardec on certain newb corps up for months and months until they destroy corp make people quit thus hurting retention and eve in a whole. it will allow wardecs to happen still but it makes it less attractive. this is an obvious exploit to say it isn't is complete bull. 2. not the point of the thread3. in any business model retention of your customers is of the highest importance. unless you are interested in killing this game, and by other posts i can see you aren't too happy with this game, then go ahead grief new players. examples have been given in previous posts in this thread and links have been provided in eve forums detailing wardec happenings and the effect it has on new players.4. if you don't care about killboards then fine but some do. no matter what happens when you kill a player it is logged on your account .maybe you are out of touch with what a new players experience is like but i can assure you you had a much easier time then the new players today. again thank you for an actual response!"
7/31/2011,really?
7/31/2011,ffs this has nothing to do with nurturing nubs re-read if you have to. it is a fix for an obvious exploit.you still haven't addressed the issue you just are tip-toeing around it and changing it for your benefit. i know this game ive played it before.and btw i go out on roams almost daily. i am not a bear i pvp if you keep up the insults i'm gonna have to ask you where your bridge is
7/31/2011,"the current fleet command structure allows for a maximum bonus'd (if thats a word) fleet of 256 pilots with larger operations taking place regularly consisting of a number of fleets on each side.i think ccp should add 2 further levels to the fleet command structure a battle group commander able to command a group of 5 fleets at level 5 and a marshal able to command 5 groups taking the maximum numbers to 1281 and 6405 respectively with marshal to be coded but disabled pending lag reductions and fleet size increases to make it possible for 6k aside battles (we can dream) for these new levels fleet bonus range could be increased with group commander able to bonus within 5 jumps at l5 maybe with a long range command linkas well as simplifying fleet organization and potentially overview settings it could be used as a tool for ccp to automatically reinforce nodes particularly if coupled with a formal scout setting, maybe with dedicated bonus to encourage use. as if someone is forming a 1000+ battlegroup somethings going to go down"
7/31/2011,"yes, because enabling blobs more is a good thing."
7/31/2011,"fact is, a fleet cammander is just that, the cammander of the fleet, if you need more then one fleet, any sensible player would already have a devoted chat channel for the fc's and whoever is in charge of the overall attack, if you absolutely have to have things implemented in-game just so you can organize more then one fleet at once, you need to not cammand fleets anymore.also, like the guy above said, last thing we need is more blobbing, all your proposal would accomplish is meaning that people who have the numbers to blob, would not only outnumber their enemy, but would have insane buffs because of the links you suggested, making blobbing an even more op and ""easy button"" strategy.also really, if your gonna give a bonus to a fleet, you gotta be in the battle so you can be primaried and eliminated, no ""bonusing from 5 jumps out"" because that would give one side a distinct advantage with incredibly reduced risk of losing their support, and before you say its just one guy, one ship buffing 5 fleets or whatever number your proposing would make a huge difference in the outcome of any battle.*multiple edits for ridiculous typing errors*"
7/31/2011,"its quite annoying that this does not contain really pressing issues,for example the imbalance between armor and shield supercapitals.also i think its rather stupid that i as a player can not downvote some of those entries."
7/31/2011,do you have any comment that is even remotely contributing?
7/31/2011,"i think you're on the right track, but i dislike your idea because a control facility would require a lot of powergrid just by itself. on low-maintenance planets, a typical setup will likely include a lot of extraction (set to low extraction speed) and just a few processing facilities (since they run at a set speed). so the drawback to your method is that it hurts low-speed pi.i've got a couple ideas though:1. allow selection of multiple facilities. hold down the ctrl key and click multiple facilities of the same type to select them, and any action you make will be done to all of the selected facilities.2. have a [generate routes automatically] button in plants that, when clicked, will cause the plant's material requirements to be automatically routed from the nearest connected storage facility, launch pad, or command center.for tier 2 and 3 materials: if that storage unit is already connected to any processors which are generating the needed materials, they will be routed from the processor to that storage unit. after routing those, the processors will also have their necessary materials routed to them from the nearest storage unit. finally, it will attempt to link tier 1 materials like so:for tier 1 materials: if the storage unit is connected to any extractors which are extracting the needed resource, it will be routed from that extractor to the storage unit.-edit-so, assuming your whole planet is making materials that all contribute to the same output, you just select all tier 3 facilities, set their production type, select all tier 2 facilities, set their production type, select all tier 1 facilities, set their production type, make sure the extractors are running, then click generate routes. assuming your planetary setup is logical and efficient, the routes should be generated just the way you want them to be."
7/31/2011,"obviously there will be some re-balancing to made so that it doesn't hurt any kind of pi, the point of it is to reduce click fest without hurting any kind of pi. i presented a proposal here, the exact details are ccps job, they have the final say of it anyway if they even consider it."
7/31/2011,"eve misses currently the functionality to visualise damage on items.there are (afaik) two kinds of damage for items: 1) hp damage caused from overheating 2) and damage of tech ii or faction crystals caused by using themyou can visualise 1) by docking in station and using the repair feature. 2) is quite tricky since you will have to undock, ungroup your weapons and switch crystals until you know how much every crystal is damaged (this also requires somehow to manually sort the crystals in cargo).1) is kind of ok but 2) is quite a pain usability wise. so please add a damage indicator (like a small % value in the corner of the icon, health bar - whatever fits best) to the icon. i don't think there is a need to differentiate between both damage types so both could use the same ui elements.(i also don't think this would have a measurable impact on the server since: firstly stacked items are not damaged and could be simply left out for the db request and secondly the amount of damage doesn't change while being in the cargo/hangar...)"
7/31/2011,"answer to your question:when moving all probes in closer towards or away from the signature, instead of moving each probe itself, press and hold the alt key, left click and hold mouse button on the arrow point of one probe. when you move that probe in closer towards or away from the signature, all the other probes will also move."
7/31/2011,"the log has very limited options available to it, and i propose adding several features and options. a log can be an incredibly valuable tool, especially in pvp situations.for instance, what if you wanted a log that only displayed when your fleet party members were being neuted, and you wanted to use your support ship to help transfer capacitor in response?1. add the ability to have multiple logs open, each with their own settings2. (expanding on 1) saveable setting presets.3. ability to log other fleet members combat information.4. when receiving or dispensing damage, show damage type. (emp, thermal, explosive, or kinetic)5. expand display choices for each category currently provided, and allow each of these details to be individually toggle-able. such as (please note that i can not guarantee that the proposed examples pertain to their current master message category, this is an educated guess and would obviously be easily reorganized accordingly by the game developers)--show info messages[]server messages-show warning messages []'cannot perform action' warning []other warnings-show error messages []ui error []module error []client error-show combat messages (this is where it gets really important) []received damage - player (from target) []received damage - player (from npc) []received damage - player (from police) []received damage - player (from drones) []received damage - player (from sentry) []received damage - player (from friendly fire) []received damage - target (from player) []received damage - target (from player drones) []received damage - target (from fleet member) []received damage - target (from fleet members drone) []received damage - target (from sentry) []received damage - target (from police) []received damage - target (from npc) []received damage - fleet member (from target) []received damage - fleet member (from targets drone) []received damage - fleet member (from sentry) []received damage - fleet member (from police) []received damage - fleet member (from npc) []received damage - fleet member (from friendly fire) []received damage - fleet members drone (from friendly fire) []status effect(web, scram, ect..) - player (from ""who"") []status effect - target (from ""who"" (particularly fleet members)) []status effect - fleet member (from ""who"") []miss - player to target []miss - target to player... anyways you get the idea-show notify messages (similar to info messages?)

7/31/2011,"i think it's high time players are allowed to wardec npc corps. of course you'll have to deal with those pesky npc corp members, hostile stations, whatever. so the guy in the npc corp can sit safely near his npc corpmates, but he can't do a lot of carebearing without leaving them behind.i support your objective, but not your methods.this is what your post looks like to me:qq more, carebear."
7/31/2011,"that would be the single most disruptive change in the game. even if you buffed station and gate guns to the point of being useful, you would still have to allow for players to join any npc corp, not just the starting 3 per race. noob stations would still be blood baths."
7/31/2011,"knightsman,139,29,71,"
7/31/2011,"incidentally, ebay has a similar 'bot' (order bumper) already. you enter your bid, and you enter the maximum price at which you would be willing to buy. if your bid gets beaten, it will bump it to the top until it reaches your cap. i believe this makes for efficient markets and trading less of a clickfest and more of a thinking persons game.interesting point point put forward was thisi am curious to know why you think this will happen. i suppose if you didn't cap your 'bot' so that it just blindly kept on bumping until you crossed the spread. but then, that would be the operators decision. maybe you just want to get out if the market moves? it's a legitimate strategy.besides, (on a parallel thread) smaller spreads -> more volume which is actually signs of an efficient market, which benefits everyone, especially market takers."
7/31/2011,how about a bot but programmed by ccp like the ebay bots where you pick a max price but the bot only increments as far as it has to and only 1 isk more/ay there's a buy at 30 and you say you would bid up to 35 but the program recognizes that 30.01 would win the next buy. this might have to be combined with an enforced buy order cancellation time like you can run the price up but you can't cancel your buy until tomorrow? needs some work on the margin order scam though. i think this would eliminate fine granularity and allow make for more rapid spread changes and make the game more exciting.
7/31/2011,"that's exactly the proposal, yes. you can also choose to have your order manually watched if you like. the order bot is not mandatory. pros:-opens up the trading profession for differentiation. smart traders can then make money too, not just the 'good at updating every 5 min' traders. adds depth the trading profession. reward good trading strategy, not just click fest mechanics. -allow for more long term horizon trading. otherwise known as strategic trading. due to eve mechanics all eve traders now are forced to be day traders ( intraday edits to orders ) even if they don't want to be. i may only have monthly views on the movement of tritanium. i should not have to micromanage my large orders. if you couple with this the ability to delegate your corp orders to a corp mate to manage, then you can setup a bonafide trading corp. head trader makes the decisions and strategy, junior traders manage them and for the really low pri orders the auto-match bot can. cons. -would allow traders to move their orders when not in the local region. this may cause a flood of unwanted server traffic and activity also imbalance the current decentralize regional markets, and lesson the value of the contract markets. ( though setting up bad bot order that you cannot modify can lose you money just as fast )mitigation:bot only works or can only be modified when you are in 'day trading' range of the station. -would allow for some 1 unit orders to be used to auto manipulate the market. mitigation:only allow orders over a certain size to be auto-watchable. small orders must be manually watched. or charge a fee for use of the auto-watch bot per order. this is not unlike real life brokerage commission charges."
7/31/2011,"i'm not sure, but it sounds like you're asking for the attackers to get aggression to ninja looters. all the rest appears to be excess garble that serves only to throw the reader off of your real point.i have to say i strongly disagree. you don't get aggression to the ninja looters because they're looting something that isn't yours. but that didn't stop you from attacking what the wreck was a moment ago now did it? so maybe you can just attack the ninja looters even though you don't have aggression. just food for thought.also, i'd like to congratulate you on almost reaching two pages of replies, and still not having a single support thumb."

7/31/2011,"of course i'm arguing semantics now, that's why i said ""technically"", you know why? because the arguments you made make absolutely no sense what so ever. if you know anything about running on a platform, or politics in general, then you'd be well aware that any representative should fully comprehend an issue before making a comment on it. saying something like ""taking a hulk to a c1 wh to day trip"" obviously shows the lack of awareness of the whole wh issue. which is the point i'm making. and new to what? the english language? i think i know a lot more about it than you do. i also, obviously, know more about politics and this game than you do too. you know, this is the problem with you null sec'ers, all you do is whine, complain and insult people in the face of a valid argument instead of actually coming up with an original opinion (i know how hard that must be for you)."
7/31/2011,"you know, maybe, just maybe, if you had come up with a valid argument that didn't include lots of sarcasm and lack of understanding of the issue, then i might have considered giving some effort to coming up with a counter-argument, but as it stands now, you really aren't worth the effort. thanks for trying, come again!"
7/31/2011,why am i not surprised.
7/31/2011,"judging by the last lot of minutes i expect them to be released about sept/oct time. don't forget they have to be written, sanitised, checked, rechecked and approved before any information is doled out to the proletariat. so don't hold your breath."
7/31/2011,"don't forget, after all that they need to be re-approved, re-drafted, re-censored . . i mean re-sanitized, re-checked and then re-pre-approved before they are approved for the re-pro-approval and pro-pre-approval . . . . and that's without delays :p."
7/31/2011,last i heard they were in ccp's hands awaiting some censoring... and that was over a week or two ago.
7/31/2011,"i understand it's a long ass post, split up up over 2 characters and 3 installments, so you may not have read it in its entirety, but this is not a post about losing a ship. it is a post about why one player in what would seem to be eve's core target demographic, someone who:- is a mid-late twenties male- is highly computer savvy- has lots of time to play- is a hardcore science fiction fan- thoroughly enjoys pvp, even at a big disadvantage. . . has been left with such a bad taste in his mouth from the game that he hasn't panned out as a revenue source for ccp. notice that it's in the council of stellar management section and i brought up some rather concrete issues. the worst ship loss i ever had was . . . too many to distinguish. maybe one of my destroyers or tier 3 battleships in pve."
7/31/2011,"and who's posted list of suggestions are basically asking for him to be given an enormous advantage over multiple foes, superior ship foes, basically everyone. not to mention thoroughly entrenching older characters as superior to newbies.might i suggest the real problem is he wants to be ""a hero"" in an mmo, and that the main reason people aren't heroes normally is because everyone else refuses to follow the script?"
7/31/2011,"older players will still have more cap, more hp, higher resistance to damages, more isk; they'll hit harder, more often, more accurately, at longer range, using more advanced, better honed techniques and strategies, etc. where did i ask for an advantage and what advantage did i ask for?i wanted to be a hero, so i played a video game that advertised that i could if i played it. is that illogical? and, ""everyone"" does not refuse to follow the script. people who don't want others to be greater than themselves, who would rather there be no heroes, refuse to follow the script. are you one of those people?"
7/31/2011,"you know who are the heroes? that one newbie in the fleet who can barely fly a frigate, but gets a point on an enemy capital ship so the rest of the fleet can kill it."
7/31/2011,what do you expect? ccp is an icelandic company and you must have seen what their banks managed to do to the economy of iceland.
7/31/2011,"yeah, probably. i'll stick it over there as well."
7/31/2011,since ccp games sees fit to join the legion that are spammers i would like to propose an addition to the ingame mail options to opt in on unwanted npc spam mails.
