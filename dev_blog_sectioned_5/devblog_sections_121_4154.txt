121	english	 	 Looking forward:	Along with the changes above, we had also hoped to ‘fix’ 500mn Heavy Interdictors in this patch. We decided to hold off until we can also ship a new module to replace the mass control for wormholers. Look for that set of changes in the near future. We also aim to keep up the pace on small changes like the ones above to make sure the meta is interesting and dynamic. Please let us know what you think of these changes in the comments thread for this blog and tell us what ships and modules you would like to receive balance passes in the future.	If you'd like to discuss the contents of this dev blog, you can do so in the comments thread over on the EVE Online Forums!
