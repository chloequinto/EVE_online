For those of you that are in the dark regarding these so called ‘Expeditions’, (also referred to as Escalations), here’s a brief rundown to bring you up to speed.	“Once in a while, battles in Deadspace tend to escalate due to you being able to track down the origins/destinations of enemy messages or finding compromising plans or data in ship wrecks. These are called Expeditions and normally escalate further and further, until you either reach a dead end or the final location (mostly found in Low Security Space).”	The general bulk of the work has simply been to smooth out Expeditions by fixing all of the existing defects associated with them, (Bosses that didn’t spawn, triggers that didn’t work etcetera) but we’ve also touched upon a few other aspects.
