The President also remarked that the EVE community is a shining example of multi-national crowdsourced fundraising for charity, and that more games companies and online communities should follow the example set by the PLEX for GOOD program in order to assist their fundraising efforts.	Once again, here at CCP we are finding it very difficult to choose words that express our gratitude to the EVE Community for the incredible generosity you have all shown over the course of this fundraiser. The Community Team does however have an amazing display on the windows of our office as a constant reminder of the fact that we serve what is, without a doubt, the finest gaming community on Earth.
