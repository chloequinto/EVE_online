When this happens, we will follow the same procedure each time:	All market orders for the affected modules will be removed, the modules and escrow will be returned to the character who created the order.	We will convert every module of one type into modules of another type, everywhere in the database. This includes modules currently fit to ships and modules in containers or contracts.	Any instance where the old obsolete module types are dropping from NPCs will be replaced with the new type.	None of the modules we are consolidating have blueprints, so manufacturing will not be an issue in this case.	You’ll see the exact plans for what modules are being consolidated in Oceanus below.
