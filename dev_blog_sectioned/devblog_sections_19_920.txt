19	english	 	 WHY WE ARE CHANGING TRIALS	The goal of these changes is to open up the game to new players so they can explore a greater variety of the content available in EVE. We believe getting new players invested in the game early on will keep them playing longer than if we throw all the good stuff behind a subscriber wall. In addition to opening up the game for trial users, we will be adding extensive logging in every area that we are removing restrictions. This way we can closely follow changes to ensure they are not enabling negative behavior such as botting or trial cycling exploits.
