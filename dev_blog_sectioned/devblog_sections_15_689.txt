15	english	 	 Conclusions we have reached through this exercise:	The ease of nullsec logistics permitted by jump freighters, and to a lesser extent jump bridge networks, is not aligned with where we would like nullsec industry to be.	It is however, pretty well aligned with where nullsec industry is right now. As we improve the status quo for industry in nullsec, we will want to reevaluate this balance along with the impact potential changes would have on logistical work for other areas of the game.	We're pretty happy with the impact of the proposed changes on the movement of non-covert combat ships, as it relates to both jump drives and jump bridges for all ranges.	We're not overly concerned about the battle rorqual; if it starts being used in a widespread fashion we will nerf it, but we're not expecting this to happen.	We're also not overly concerned yet about High Grade Ascendency equipped capital fleets, since such capital movement would be very vulnerable to disruption and because it relies on very rare items. If this becomes a widespread usage pattern we will likely take action, and we'll be keeping a close eye on everything surrounding capital movement after Phoebe.	Black ops are working in a generally OK manner on TQ right now, and we want to minimize harm to their use with these changes.	We don't like repeating decimals.
