This filter relies on simulating each of the modules to get accurate values, and is therefore only available while in simulation mode. The first time it runs, it may take a few seconds to complete, but after that it should be near instant until hull, rigs or skills change.	This filter has 2 modes: Total resources and remaining resources, and you can switch between the modes through a right click option.
