12	english	 	 BUT WHY	Before I dig into details I want to take a second to explain why we’re doing notifications now.  Our team is dedicated to working on the new player experience (NPE) and one of our goals is to eventually remove the existing tutorial and replace it with a much more open-ended experience - for that to work we need a way to let new players know when they’ve done something awesome (or failed horribly) and there isn’t such a system in the game at the moment that fits very well.	On top of not finding a pre-existing system for messaging the NPE, when we started looking at what systems we might have been able to use we realized how many different feedback avenues there are in the game, scattered all over the place like Elise Randolph’s tears after the Alliance Tournament semifinals. Sometimes you get mail notifications, sometimes it’s confined to the specific feature window (industry jobs for example), sometimes it’s a popup (could be anywhere on the screen), and sometimes it’s a big dialog box smack in the middle. Rather than building a new, stand-alone NPE feature that would add yet another method of giving feedback, we thought this would be a great opportunity to clean up the feedback experience for everyone by consolidating as many of these methods as possible into one simple notification system.  Ta-da!
