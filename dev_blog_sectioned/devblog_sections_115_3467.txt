115	english	 	 REPROCESSING RIGS AND THEIR BLUEPRINTS	With the release of Refinery Structures that are bonused to reprocessing, we are planning some changes to the existing reprocessing rigs that were released with Citadels in the Citadel Expansion. As Refineries are only available in the Medium and Large size, unlike Citadels and Engineering Complexes which also have an Extra Large version, we have had to make some changes to the value of the XL rigs. The following changes will then be made on the day of release:	All reprocessing rigs are receiving upgrades to the breadth of ores that receive their bonuses. Existing M reprocessing rigs will be consolidated into one variant that applies to all standard ores and one variant that applies to all ice. A new variant that applies to moongoo ore will also be added, reducing the total number of M reprocessing rigs from 4 to 3. Existing L reprocessing rigs will be consolidated into a single rig type that applies to all forms of ore and ice	Since L reprocessing rigs will now provide exactly the same benefits as XL reprocessing rigs we are reducing the cost of XL reprocessing rigs to the same level as L rigs	The strength of the reprocessing bonuses provided by all reprocessing rigs will be reduced slightly (a 1% absolute reduction in the base highsec yield for both T1 and T2 rigs)	All reprocessing rigs (M, L and XL) will be unfitted from their current locations and placed in the Corp Deliveries hangar of the structure in which they are located. The owners of the structure will then be able to decide if they wish to keep them in their current location or move them to a new Refinery once it has been built	All XL reprocessing rig items (and their corresponding blueprints) will be duplicated to compensate for the change in build requirements and value. All duplicate blueprints will hold the same levels of research as the ones currently owned. Extra rigs and blueprints owned by characters will be placed in the owner's personal Item Hangar in their home station. Extra rigs and blueprints owned by a corporation will be placed in the Corp Deliveries hangar in the corp HQ station
