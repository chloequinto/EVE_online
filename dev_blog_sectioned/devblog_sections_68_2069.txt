68	english	 	 SISTERS OF EVE	Project Discovery is a classified research program founded and run by the Sisters of EVE. Their project lead, Professor Lundberg, will recruit you and provide you with a basic tutorial to be able to recognize specific patterns in biological samples already classified by experts. As soon as you graduate from the training program, you and other graduated contributors will be tasked with analyzing unique images fresh from the lab. To start you off you are tasked with increasingly difficult tasks which already have a solution, when you have finished with those you will get tasks that don‘t have a solution. Once enough contributors have reached a statistically accurate consensus on a task which has no solution, you will receive a boost to your Project Discovery accuracy rating. For every task you solve, the SoE will reward you with ISK and LP, as well as Analysis Points which contribute to your Project Discovery rank.
