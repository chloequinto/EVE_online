90	english	 	 Squizz Caphinator	The EVE Swagger Interface combines the usability of the XML API with the features of CREST while introducing documentation as an official feature. CREST's crawlable type system enabled people to do some great things with dynamic languages, ESI closes that gap for those of us using statically typed languages; providing much stronger interface definitions and improving on the usability aspects of CREST. I believe that this project is the perfect follow-up to improve on CREST, modernize the XML API, and make EVE development easier for newcomers.
