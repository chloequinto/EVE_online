70	english	 	 5 blocks / hour	We initially announced a new fuel block type that would be produced from all racial isotopes, but after much internal debate we’ve come up to the conclusion this creates a certain number of issues, one of which being too much hassle to import all the materials around.	As such we are going to allow the four existing fuel blocks to work with the Citadels for greater flexibility. Since Citadels don’t use Strontium Clathrates for their reinforcement mode, we will add this particular material into the composition of the four existing fuel blocks to maintain its demand. The current number we have in mind is 400 units of Strontium Clathrates for a batch of 40 fuel blocks.	As a side note, we are not going to require the use of the infamous Starbase Charters in high-security space as we feel it is an overkill requirement.
