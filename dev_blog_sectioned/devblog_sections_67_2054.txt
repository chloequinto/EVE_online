67	english	 	 THE PROCESS	If you are familiar with how we usually run CSM elections you will have noticed that both the candidacy and voting periods were extended. This has been done after considering the amount of applications that were submitted too late in previous years. On top of that, we decided to make people’s lives easier by leaving more time between to make sure that all required security checks are done thoroughly and also to leave some time for all of those amazing player-organized interviews like CSM Watch, Crossing Zebras and Vote Match.	Another big change is the timeline itself, we begin the process earlier and for a good reason. As it often happens, a lot of potential CSM delegates attend Fanfest, however, you should bear in mind that the first CSM summit will be hosted a lot earlier than normally – at the start of CSM11 term, which means, that if you are planning to run for CSM11 you should make sure that you are able to travel to Iceland almost right after Fanfest. There are no solid dates as of now, but we are aiming for May, 2016. Please note, that while the summits are usually 3 to 4 days, selected delegates spend up to 7 days in Iceland around the summit.
