95	english	 	 NEVER ASSUME	EVE Online is almost 14 years old now and has seen many battles during its lifetime, and one can say the code base is thoroughly battle tested. However, that doesn't mean sneaky bugs might not be hiding there, but finding a bug in such a fundamental function was surprising, to say the least. I guess we can never assume that any part of our code base is absolutely 100% correct. CCP karkur and others have spent a considerable amount of time tracking this issue down so we had high confidence in the higher level code. This allowed me to go into this investigation on the assumption that Sleep was broken, being stubborn until I found this rare edge case.	We have reason to believe that a few other bugs are symptoms of the same underlying issue - the overview not updating, for example, or the shield, armor and structure bars not updating. These bugs have always been nearly impossible to reproduce but nevertheless are reported occasionally, especially after mass tests or heavy fights on Tranquility.
