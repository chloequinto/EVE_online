76	english	 	 NEW TO EVE?	Consensus amongst players discussing the war is that right now is the best time in recent memory to start playing EVE. Not only do both sides have corps actively recruiting and set up to help new players, but the entire community is energized and helpful to those who are taking their first steps in the universe. Free trials are always available at www.eveonline.com.	We just recently (and thankfully) released an Updated Rookie Resources Dev Blog with tons of information on how to dive right into EVE.
