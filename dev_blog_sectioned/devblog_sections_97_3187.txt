97	english	 	 FEATURE TIMELINE	Speaking of the release date, there was a lot of interest in hearing when we expect to go live. While we still can’t give a specific day, we know it’s important for you to have a ballpark so you can get your ducks in a row. Our current target is for shortly after Fanfest, in late Spring or early Summer. Delays are always possible but for those of you worried it would be Q4 or later, rest assured.	Thanks very much for all the input, we hope these updates find you well.
