10	english	 	 **IN CLOSING**	These proposals are not the only improvements we hope to make for wormhole space in the future, and we are actively discussing with the CSM other improvements that could be made. We encourage you to keep communicating your requests both directly to us here at CCP and to your hardworking CSM members.	We hope you have enjoyed this dev blog and that you are looking forward to the Hyperion release as much as we are here in Team Five O. We are very interested in your feedback on all of these concepts and we encourage you to post your feedback, along with reasons for your arguments, in each of the individual feedback threads linked with each section of this blog. We will be hard at work over the next few weeks coding, refining designs, responding to feedback and testing changes for wormholes and we can’t wait to see how all you incredibly clever players find a way to pleasantly surprise us once again once Hyperion arrives on August 26th.	As for the rest of the changes you should expect in the Hyperion release, CCP Seagull will be posting a "Coming in Hyperion" blog soon with an overview and we will be continuing to release more dev blogs with all the juicy details in the coming days.
