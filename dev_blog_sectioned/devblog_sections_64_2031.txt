Numerous sources corroborate that sometime within the next 24 hours, Mordu’s Legion Command will publicly release coordinates and details of Serpentis Corporation storage sites located across New Eden.	With permission from the Upwell Consortium and Outer Ring Excavations, as well as with authorization from CONCORD, Mordu’s Legion will declare these sites open season for capsuleer assault, with attacking pilots entitled to any loot that survives the onslaught.	These Serpentis sites will appear globally on the overviews of all capsuleers without the need to scan them down, and will be labeled as “Operation Frostline Target” for ease of identification.
