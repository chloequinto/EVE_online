24	english	 	 The seventy five **Standard Shattered Wormhole Systems** will be similar to normal W-space systems in many ways (including delayed-mode local chat), but will have a few important distinctions:	They will have no moons and every planet will be shattered. The reasons for this phenomena are heavily tied into the ongoing and upcoming events within New Eden.	They will have some special landmark sites that also connect to the storyline and provide clues to the reason they were previously inaccessible. I wouldn’t be surprised if they found their way to Mark726’s EVE Travel blog.	They will have a somewhat higher occurrence of some of their class-appropriate W-space signature and anomaly content compared to a normal W-space system.	They will contain a new celestial debris field asteroid belt anomaly that will be larger and richer than most belts.	They will contain minable ice fields. This will be the first ice available in wormhole space.	They will all have an additional known-space “static” wormhole connection alongside the normal “static” connections that they receive by virtue of their class. For those unfamiliar with wormhole navigation, a “static” connection in this case means that there’s always a wormhole exit to a particular security level “known-space” system (one in EVE’s star map).	They will be distributed into all the existing wormhole classes, and some will have one of the current wormhole system effects.	There are also some extra unique lore-connected surprises to be found in a small percentage of these new systems.	The twenty five **Small Ship Shattered Wormhole Systems** will have all the features of the normal Shattered Wormhole Systems, with the following additions:	All wormholes in or out of these systems will be small ship wormholes, meaning that only Frigates, Destroyers and Heavy Interdictors (Heavy Interdictors can use their bubble generators to reduce their mass) can enter.	These systems will all receive anomaly and signature sites appropriate for wormholes between class 1 and class 3, but will receive the system effects normally reserved for C6 Wolf Rayet systems (+100% armor hit points +200% small weapon damage, -50% shield resists, -50% signature size)	And then we come to the most significant of all the new shattered systems:	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Wreckage550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Wreckage.jpg)	**Thera** is a new and unique wormhole system that will be intimately tied to EVE’s developing storyline and will essentially represent a new 5th variant of space in New Eden.	Thera is a gigantic shattered wormhole system that contains four NPC stations and a large number of wormhole connections.
