Finally, for those capsuleers who are on a hiatus from flight, we have a couple of seasonal reactivation offers in the works too, so be sure to pay attention to the news for Operation Frostline reactivation offers over the course of the next few days!	As well as all these offers and events, there’ll be the usual host of Festival Launchers, fireworks, snowballs and festive trinkets appearing in the redeeming systems of all capsuleers over the course of the holidays. Be sure to watch out for news for more information on when these will be added.	If you do need assistance with how to redeem items to your characters, then you can check out this knowledgebase article from our friendly GM Team.	We hope you all have as much fun with both the December release and Operation Frostline as we’ve had putting it together, and from everyone here at CCP Games, we’d like to wish all our capsuleers Happy Holidays and best wishes for 2016!	Team Murder Services & Team Astro Sparkle
