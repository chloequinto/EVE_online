105	english	 	 THE HARDCORE SCIENCE	One of the most fruitful methods we have of finding exoplanets is transit photometry.	This method uses long term measurements of the luminosity – or brightness – of a star. With these measurements, we can note systematic changes in apparent luminosity of the star which allows us to track celestial bodies in its orbit.	This is where you guys start doing science!	Pilots will be presented with light curves that belong to any one of the 160,000 stars that the CoRoT telescope is monitoring, and will be tasked with identifying transitional planets – planets that are passing between the star and Earth – by highlight drops in the star’s luminosity.	To do this, pilots will be equipped with in game tools to filter out variations in the star’s luminosity that do not resemble transiting events, as well as a tool to confirm that these transits are regular and periodic.	When our pilots have reached a consensus, the data will be transmitted to scientists from the University of Geneva, who will then study the results and confirm your findings.
