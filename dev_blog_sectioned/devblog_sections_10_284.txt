We also have some concerns about the power of the armor resist bonus in this effect, especially when combined with capital ships. The solution is to swap the resist bonus into a flat HP bonus like the one found in Pulsars and push the small weapon bonus far enough to create a truly unique combat environment. This huge bonus to frigate weapons will create one of the most distinct combat environments in EVE, which should nonetheless remain quite accessible to all players since keeping a small ship doctrine for your corp requires relatively little in skillpoints, isk and SMA volume.

The change here cuts the cap recharge time penalty in half (so that ships receive higher cap per second rates in Cataclysmic Variable wormholes) and add a new penalty to remote capacitor transmitters. Due to the nature of capacitor transfer bonuses on logistics cruisers and capital ships, this penalty is much more significant for carriers than for smaller ships.

We’re also interested in what you think about these changes, and we will be closely monitoring feedback on effect changes in this thread.
