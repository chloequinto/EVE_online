10	english	 	 Feedback Thread	One of the many unique aspects of wormhole life is the variety of special wormhole effects that can be found in many W-space systems. These effects can significantly change the balance of power within any given wormhole system by providing system-wide buffs and debuffs and they provide a great variety of combat environments for players to encounter. We are extremely happy with how wormhole effects have worked out overall, and will be taking steps in the Hyperion release to make them even better.	We have had a good understanding for quite some time about which wormhole effects are in need of significant changes, both from the experience of CCPers in wormholes and from reviewing feedback from our very vocal wormhole community. However metrics can also often be useful for evaluating the state of existing features and in this case metrics can be especially instructive.	The following chart shows the relative activity level in systems that contain each of the six wormhole effects, normalized for the number of systems available with each effect.
