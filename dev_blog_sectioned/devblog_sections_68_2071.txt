68	english	 	 AIM OF THE PROJECT	Together with Swiss startup company Massively Multiplayer Online Science and Reykjavík University, CCP has been working on bringing real world scientific research into the EVE game experience. For the launch of Project Discovery we are collaborating with The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), a swedish research group that builds and provides a public database of human proteins that gets used by thousands of medical research groups. By participating in Project Discovery you will be helping HPA to analyze new protein images to expand their database and in turn contributing to the wellbeing of future patients being treated around the world.
