Let’s recap what we have already talked about regarding fittings in case you haven’t followed progress closely  since Fanfest 2015.	Unlike existing Starbases (also known as Player Owner Starbases or POSess), the new Citadels will not rely on deploying multiple structures to add more functionality to your little space castle. They will use a fitting system in a way almost identical to ships, with slots and modules to achieve customization gameplay.	These slots are sorted into different categories:	High slots: dedicated to active modules--primarily weapons but also remote assistance modules--like our new structure missile launchers	Mid slots: mainly aimed towards electronic warfare and electronic / remote assistance modules like ECM, Sensor Dampeners, or Target Painters	Low slots: primarily used by engineering and passive modules, like weapon upgrades or reactor control modules	Service modules: a new layer of modules designed to provide functionality currently offered by NPC stations or other in-game structures like Manufacturing, Research, Market, or even Cloning	Rigs: provide further specialization into a specific structure role. For example, you fit a Market service module into a Citadel to get the basic activity, but the rig will be the item giving you bonuses like NPC tax reduction. Of course rigs are destroyed when removed, which makes them quite an investment
