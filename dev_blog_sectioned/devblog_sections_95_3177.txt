95	english	 	 HOW IT ALL BEGAN	A little while ago CCP karkur asked me if I could help with an issue she had been looking into with the drone window, where it sometimes would stop updating when drones are being recalled. Her investigation did not uncover any bugs in the code related to drones or the UI. Over the course of a few hours, she managed to repro the drone bug 3 times, each time adding more logging where the problem seemed to lie. After the last repro, it became clear that it was failing at the least expected line of code - the drone window simply started updating, then went to sleep for a bit, but never woke up again -  it seemed that tasklets were on occasion simply not returning from their sleep.	The original bug was quite difficult to reproduce, but CCP karkur put together a script that generated 500,000 tasklets that simply sleep for some given time, with some tracking to identify tasklets that never finish. With this script, we've been able to reproduce this sleeping disorder somewhat reliably. This script identified the tasklet that didn't wake up, and upon inspection it was clear that the tasklet was neither scheduled nor blocked - it was in some sort of limbo.	My first attempts at reproducing the bug with CCP karkur's script were not successful - I was running in Jessica (our authoring/debugging tool) without the client and didn't seem to have any luck. Later I tried in the client with better luck, so it seemed there was more to it than simply having lots of tasklets. I started reading through the relevant C++ code to try to come up with theories.
