109	english	 	 BALANCE UPDATES FOR STRUCTURE WEAPONS	This August, we are deploying a set of iterations to structure weapons with a special focus on the Standup Guided Void Bombs. These bombs have been a major topic of discussion in the community and we agree with the majority of you that they need to be toned down. Void bombs being the most powerful part of structure defenses has the significant downside of reducing the fleet composition choices available to attackers.	Our goals for these weapon tweaks are:	Reduce the pressure to limit fleet composition choices when attacking Citadels (caused by the extremely powerful void bombs)	Make the counterplay for structure guided bombs more clear and accessible	Compensate for the nerfing of void bombs with small buffs to damage bombs and single-target anti-subcap damage so that structure defenses remain viable	The changes we are proposing here reduce the area of effect and energy neutralizer amount per second of Guided Void Bombs while also reducing their rate of fire and movement speed to make counterplay more accessible.
