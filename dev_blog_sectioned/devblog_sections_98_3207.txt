98	english	 	 With all this new activity around the moons of New Eden, the corporations claiming the moons will need new tools for tracking what’s going on in their territory. The mining ledger is the new open-ended tool for Refinery owners to keep track of who is mining in their belt.	Each Refinery structure with an active moon drill will keep track of all the mining done in its associated belt, logging the character, corporation, ore type and amount mined. This will allow Refinery managers to share profits or request fees as they see fit, allow mining operations to more easily organize themselves, and allow corps and alliances to see who has been ninja-mining their fields without permission.	The ledger will be available in the client, exportable to spreadsheets, and obtainable through an API for those who wish to build advanced tools. It will not update fast enough to provide a real-time warning system against ninja miners, but it will allow owners to look back at what happened in the past and plan their revenge or negotiations as they see fit.	All moon drilling refineries will log mining activity in the moon asteroid fields they generate, and we are also investigating opening up the option of tracking entire solar systems worth of mining for Refineries that are also owned by sov holders.	Reactions	Refineries will also bring changes to the system for reacting moon materials and gasses into more advanced materials. Reactions are a key part of the resource processing chain for Tech-2 items, Tech-3 ships, and boosters, and we believe that the current reaction system using starbases has a lot of room to improve in user experience and quality of life.
