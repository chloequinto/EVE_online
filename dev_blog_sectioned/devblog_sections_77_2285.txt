77	english	 	 CCP FoxFour: One of the really cool things about this project is not only does it sound like something I could see myself using, I have actively been using it over the last few weeks. It is an incredibly well polished entry that aims to solve a single problem and does so well.	CCP Bartender: I was impressed by how focused and complete this project was. Valtyr has clearly resisted the temptation for feature creep and the result is a tool which does one thing and does it extremely well with no fuss.	CCP SnowedIn: Absolutely love the integrations in this app. Very clean and intuitive, does one thing well... great job.	Prizes:	Classic Tranquility server blade
