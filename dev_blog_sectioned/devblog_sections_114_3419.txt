114	english	 	 PERSONAL MINING LEDGER	We know that a vast majority of you love graphs, and so we've made sure your personal mining activity is represented in ways you like best: lines and bars - with filters to boot! 	The Personal Mining Ledger tracks all of the mining activity done by a character, anywhere in New Eden. It allows pilots to see the types of ores, gas and ice they’ve collected, the areas of space they frequent, and of course their activity over time. As a pilot mines, the mining information is collected and batched into days in order to create a personal mining history.	We have been gathering the mining data of each individual pilot in New Eden since the June release to allow miners a glimpse into their activity history when the ledger is released.	The ledger can be accessed through the Business section of the Neocom and is available to all pilots in all areas of space. Just like other tools, the Ledger can be dragged from this section to your Neocom, so that it is always readily available. For more details about customizing your Neocom, check out this great Eve University page about all the functionalities available.	To try out the Personal Ledger before the Lifeblood Expansion on October 24th, login to the Singularity test server to try it for yourself.
