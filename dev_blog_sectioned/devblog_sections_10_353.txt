10	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	As you can see in the above chart, Class 2 wormholes fall below the curve in NPC kills, but are extremely healthy in other metrics. This is due to the unique position C2 wormholes occupy thanks to their dual static connections. This makes C2 wormholes especially well connected to both W-space and K-space and an excellent choice for corporations who are particularly interested in PVP.	In the Hyperion release we are planning to provide C4 wormholes with their own area of expertise, by adding a second W-space static connection to each of them. This will make C4 wormholes exceptionally well-connected to other W-space systems and a great choice for corporations who want to enjoy a variety of travels within wormhole space.	The new static connections from C4s will have the same mass and lifetime values as the existing C4 statics, and will all lead to a different class of wormhole space than the system’s existing static connection.	We expect that this change will add a lot of value to Class 4 wormholes and create a new class of hub systems that allow for exceptional access to wormhole space. We will be listening to your feedback on that proposal in this thread.
