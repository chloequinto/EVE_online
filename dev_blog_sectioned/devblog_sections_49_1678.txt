These designer SKINs help give us a bit more freedom in that we don't have to try and tie each SKIN to an existing corporation or create a new corporation for each SKIN we want to make. With that in mind we are aiming to have four new designer SKINs out this summer. Two for Minmatar and two for Caldari as those two empires have the least number of SKINs available right now.	Here are some concepts that our art director has come up with. These will likely not be what we end up releasing but should hopefully give you an idea of what we are considering doing.
