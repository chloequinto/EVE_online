82	english	 	 Alliance Tournament Edition Blood Raider SKIN	As with Alliance Tournament XIII, we will be offering a ship SKIN that can be applied to any of the Blood Raider ships to give them a unique visual style. We will be awarding 10 copies of this SKIN for each series won by a team. This includes the single match series that make up the bulk of the tournament. This should provide an additional incentive to try and win every match you can. Again like last year, these skins will be handed out later than the rest of the prizes at a yet to be determined date.
