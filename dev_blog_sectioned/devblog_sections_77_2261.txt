77	english	 	 Better define the judging criteria	One of the things that came up during the judging was how we all defined the criteria differently in our heads. This lead to a lot of instances of us having to discuss things that should probably just have been defined better. Things like should technical difficulty be how difficult of a task the application is trying to solve or should it be how much of CREST the application is using since the contest was about CREST. While we were able to resolve this in the end we should have had all of this defined better up front. The other part of this was how slow we were to get into the judging as we all sort of had different ideas of how to do it. For the next challenge we hope to answer all of these questions internally before we announce the contest.
