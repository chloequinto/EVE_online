90	english	 	 There's a new API coming to EVE, called the ESI. It's based on the OpenAPI Specification, is fully documented and will make your life easier if you choose to develop an application for EVE Online. It's been ramping up for a few months, and is currently serving up to 4.5 million requests a day.	If you're not a third party developer, over the next year or two you can expect to see the apps you use start moving away from api keys and towards EVE SSO logins. This brings security benefits, and reduces the complexity of authorizing an application.	It's already being used in the new EVE mobile app, as well as by some third party developers. You can check it out for yourself right now, it's live at //esi.tech.ccp.is/	Questions, comments, concerns? We'll be monitoring the threads both on the EVE Online forums and Reddit, or hit up anyone from Team Tech Co on tweetfleet slack (@ccp_snowedin, @ccp_bartender, @ccp_aquarhead, @ccp_chimichanga), we're almost always around in the #devfleet channel. Also, we've opened up a new channel specifically for ESI discussion and help, also on the tweetfleet slack, channel name #ESI.	To the glorious future!
