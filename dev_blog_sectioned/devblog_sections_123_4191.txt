123	english	 	 RETIRING OLDER CONTENT	Currently we have a situation where SKINs & Apparel remain in the store for years, become dated and eventually clutter things up, to the point where we have almost 800 cosmetic items in store today.	In order to keep the store fresh & easier to navigate, we will be retiring a large portion of our current SKIN & Apparel items in the coming weeks. We will be doing this through a series of weekly retirement sales, starting in March and running through until June, where retiring items will be sold at discounted prices before being removed from the store. So be sure to check the store each week during this time to grab a bargain on your favorite item before they retire.	2018.03.01.15.58.44
