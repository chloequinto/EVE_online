83	english	 	 CSM X Summit	For the second year in a row we scheduled a session to meet with the CSM during their summit here in Reykjavik.  One of the major concerns they raised was transparency with regards to what is and what is not an exploit. Because of this feedback, the Known and Declared Exploits article was produced. It's one of the most 'liked' articles and we aim to keep it updated as much as possible. We're looking forward to meeting with CSM XI in September.
