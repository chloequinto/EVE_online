11	english	 	 TWEAK TO BASE SUCCESS CHANCES	We would like to tweak base success chance on various item types so they are a bit more consistent with ship sizes. Base invention chances currently are:	Modules and Ammo have a base probability of 40%	Frigates, Destroyers, Freighters and Skiff have a base probability of 30%	Cruisers, Industrials and Mackinaw have a base probability of 25%	Battlecruisers, Battleships and Hulk have a base probability of 20%	We would like to tweak those numbers to:	All modules, rigs and ammo have 40%	All Frigates and Destroyers have 35%	Cruisers, Battlecruisers, Mining Barges, Industrials, ORE industrial have 30%	All Battleships, Industrial Command Ship have 25%	Capitals and Capital Industrial Ships have 20%	So basically it results into a 5% base chance increase for all ships, except Freighters that drop down from 30% to 20% and Exhumers, which get a 0 to 10% boost depending on the exact hull.
