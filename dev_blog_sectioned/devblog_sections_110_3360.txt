110	english	 	 BETA MAP CHANGES 	We ended up with our head in the Beta map code for some of the work we have planned for later in the year. I would like to emphasize we are not working on removing the old map at this time, the changes are focused on increasing the performance and usability of the Beta map.	We have been tweaking the usability of the Beta map, mainly focusing on camera interaction and system/constellation/region navigation.	Here are some of the changes we are making for August:	Improved Beta map performance when zooming and rotating the map, especially when down at the constellation or solar system level.	The map camera is now pitch constrained so it cannot go below the map plane.	The introduction of a breadcrumb style label that shows the selected region/constellation/system and the corresponding faction (if any). Clicking a location will zoom and pan to it.	Ctrl+clicking a solar system will now set it as destination and Ctrl+shift+click will add it as a waypoint.	Hovering over a solar system will now show how many jumps away it is.
