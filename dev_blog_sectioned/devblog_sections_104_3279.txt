104	english	 	 ITERATIVE PRODUCTION	When we finally got the go ahead to enter production for the redesign, we had a pretty solid basis to go on. I did some very messy blockouts early on that identified lots of issues with the designs that are hard to identify in 2d. There were so many shapes that we couldn’t easily transition from one to another, and once in 3d after merging conflicting angles together, we felt like the design was looking a bit too much like a busy Caldari design. CCP BunnyVirus began doing his own blockout that was a bit cleaner and blockier, and from there we began to better work things out.	Our biggest initial problem was that, despite being happy with what was generally going on, a lot of our decisions meant that we’d lost some subtle angles of the original Rupture and made the sides too flat. Our art director had the idea that the gun bay should be visible, with players able to see the tucked away turrets inside of an armor plating. The complexity of making this work had massively inflated the size of the hull around the gun ports, which resulted in this very flat side as you can see above. From the side the ship looked great, but when viewed directly from the front and top it felt too monolithic.	I looked a lot at the original Rupture’s silhouette, and we tried to add in very subtle changes that wouldn’t interrupt the ship’s firing angles or require us to clumsily add in tertiary turret locators. We also slightly angled the gun port covers to add a downward slant, which helped break up the 90-degree angle when viewed from the front, exaggerating the ship’s inverted pyramid shape.
