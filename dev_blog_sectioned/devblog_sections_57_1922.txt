57	english	 	 ADDED REDUNDANCY	TQ’s storage is mirrored and redundant. The storage array has always been redundant but now we’ve added more failsafes.	There will be a full SAN mirror so that we can both maintain TQ and failover live, replicating a copy of the TQ Database across the ocean to Iceland, land of fire and ice.	From the storage side this is how TQ will look once we're done:	What you see here are 2x IBM SAN volume controllers which govern and control 2x IBM V5000 controllers which store all the data with 3x expansion shelves that house 9x800 GB SSD's with a grand total of 83x 1.2TB 10K SAS disks. 	Remember this is all mirrored so double these disk numbers for the full picture!	All this lightning fast and redundant storage has to talk to servers...
