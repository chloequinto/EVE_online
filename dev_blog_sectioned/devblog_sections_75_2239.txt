75	english	 	 CHAT RESOURCES	First off, you will have three open chat channels when you initially create your character. Whenever one of the channels is highlighted, it means you have unread messages there.	The local tab is your local channel. It contains all other players that are in your current system, so don't be afraid to talk there when taking your first steps and requesting assistance as required. You will start out in a system with a lot of other new players, so feel free to get to know eachother, strike up friendships, and help eachother out!	The corp tab is your Rookie Corporation Chat. Rest assured that this channel is filled with new players just like yourself, so chat away! You may also find some experienced players in there who'll be answering questions and assisting new players.	The last tab is the Rookie Help channel. That is absolutely the place to seek assistance and ask questions! There are a lot of seasoned players in this channel who will assist and guide you, along with members of our wonderful ISD STAR Volunteer Team who are here to help. They will be highlighted in chat with a different color of text to regular players, and the prefix "ISD" before their character name.	If you ever lose one of these channels, don't worry. You can click the little chat bubble and find them listed there. Most notably, this is where the help channels are listed under the Help category. This button will be at the top of your Neocom menu, on the left side of your screen, unless you decide to move it.	Above: The default location of the channels list in your Neocom.
