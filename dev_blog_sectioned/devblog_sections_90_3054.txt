90	english	 	 ENGINEERING RIG SIZE SCALING	Like existing Upwell structure rigs, Engineering Rigs provide the same strength of bonuses at each size category. The primary benefit of upgrading to larger rigs (on larger structures) is that larger rigs are more generalized in their bonuses and smaller rigs are more specialized. This allows larger structures to gain bonuses to more types of industrial activity than their smaller brethren.	For example, a corporation can potentially rig their Medium Raitaru Engineering Complex to receive the maximum possible Material Efficiency (ME) bonuses for constructing small and medium T1 ships, and significant cost reduction to invention jobs by filling its three available rig slots with:	Standup M-Set Basic Small Ship Manufacturing Material Efficiency II	Standup M-Set Basic Medium Ship Manufacturing Material Efficiency II	Standup M-Set Invention Cost Optimization I	If that corporation upgraded to a X-Large Sotiyo Engineering Complex they would be able to get the exact same ME bonuses to production of small and medium T1 ships, while also receiving rig bonuses to a larger variety of industry jobs by installing:	Standup XL-Set Ship Manufacturing Efficiency II
