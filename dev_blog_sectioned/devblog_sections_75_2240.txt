The purpose of this Dev Blog is to arm you with the basic knowledge and links to the information that you'll need to thrive in EVE Online, so take a look at what's to follow and see if the answers to your questions are here!	We'd like to give you all a helping hand and try to ensure that you hit the ground running in what is considered by some to be one of the most rich, deep and complex virtual worlds in existence. It's good to know where valuable information is readily available to you, so below are some very good sources of information. Quite a few of them are provided by communities of other players who specialize in helping new pilots.	These sources range from those that are player created, to those created by Developers and Game Masters here at CCP.	Above: Clockwise from top left: Amarr - Impairor, Caldari - Ibis, Gallente - Velator, Minmatar - Reaper	As a rookie pilot, you'll be provided with one of the four basic ships shown above depending on the race of your character. If you lose this ship, don't worry! Simply dock your capsule at a station and the friendly insurance company will provide  you with a new one!	While you'll want to upgrade pretty soon (usually within the first few hours of gameplay), you can find more information on your rookie ship and how many new players use them on the amazing player run EVE University wiki here:	Impairor	Ibis	Velator	Reaper
