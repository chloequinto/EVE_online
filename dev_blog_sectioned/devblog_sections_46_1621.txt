46	english	 	 Electronic Warfare	Structures will be able to fit their specific variations of Electronic Warfare modules we all know and love. They include, but are not limited to: ECM, remote sensor dampening, stasis webifiers, tracking disruptors, target painters and warp disruption. We are considering the introduction of area of effect variations of those modules later on.	Single target modules will be available for all sizes and locations, while AoE effects will most likely be restricted by size and security status.
