very good idea
would have to speak to chribba about that 
if not remove at least several reduce in quantityits my understanding that ice fields dont currently deplete im saying change that
lets see goons are targeting blue ice high sec miningwithin 24 hours the price has gone from 400 per isotope to nearly 3000 per isotopeso if this isnt a reason on why not to remove it then i dont know what is
this just encourages people to set up shop in one area and never leave stagnating intercorpalliance conflictit also ironically enough does the exact opposite of your goal and kills small scale pvp under your system in order to go out for a ngiggles pvp roam you needs to set up supply lines get dedicated playersalts to fly the tankers andor make sure everyone is in the same ship with the same fit so no one runs out of fuel before everyone else no small corp has the manpower or the will to do thata large corpalliance on the other hand has many many peons that they can delegate tasks to fleet a combat fleet will run point fleet b tankers stay behind one system until refuel is requestednow as far as the blob being spread out because some will run out of fuel before others well that kind of thinking flies in the face on conventional wisdom and tactics if a few people in your group run out of fuel you do not leave them behind for that reduces your overall effectiveness instead everyone will sit and wait for all of their ships to be refueled before moving on as one unit once more again this encourages players to team up with more players rather than fly on their own and just makes thing unnecessarily tediousoverall your proposal makes it seem like you have a big beef with big ships and that you want to limit their use almost to the point where you obsolete them in any activity beyond defense fleets and sov warfare which is still iffy because it seems carriers would perform better than battleships in just getting around
how to complicate a game to the 10th degree of insanitytldr  not supporting stop the evemail spam
having to stop to refuel my ship every 23 systems is absurd and i mostly fly t2 cruisers
not really it encourages people to fight with their neighbors in effect creating multiple points of conflict with smaller number of participantsthe ease of transportation is never the reason for fights it just facilitates blobs therefore making transportation hard does not change the reasons people fight it just makes hard to cobble up a blob from five different regions and go across half of eveno you dont need to either you limit the range of your roam or its so long that you can make aquick detour to a friendly station or empire to refuelnote that 100bs doing 80 jumps is not called a ngiggle roam its called blob forece projection not true the need of tankers scales with the number of ships in the fleet if a large group willneed and be able to dedicate a comparatively larger group of ship as tankers that means they have alarge number of combat ships in the first placecompared to the current situation my proposal introduces a compromise between power and thedistance on which one is able to project this power  large distances mean less power  eitherbecause of the need to scale down hulls or because of the need to scale down the number of combatshipscould you please point in the proposal where i suggest that a blob will spread out because someships will run out of fuelplease refrain from making guesses as to what my motivations might be but instead concentrateon the implications on the gameplay that my proposal would have try to compare the positiveand the negative effects of such changes to the game and consider which one outweighs whichpain is weakness leaving the body
you havent read the proposal carefully have youits explicitly written thata its battleships that are limited to 45 systemsb t2 cruiser hulls have between 150 and 250 bigger range than battleshipswhich even under the current tentative numbers would mean that t2 cruisers would be able to cover fast 1015 systems range and slower  unlimited rangehow did you get that 23 systemspain is weakness leaving the body
because the addendum to your idea about reducing the size of insystem warps isnt really feasible if you were a coder would you want spend a godawful amount of time reducing the size of 5000 star systems just for the sake of a single mechanic that encourages people to turtle up in a single area of spaceeditso basically if there are no targets in my area i am effectively forced to go back to hq and dock or spend time setting up a supply line for a fight that might not happen as is so often the casehow does this encourage pvp againi dont know about you but if i have to have to spend time and isk buying fuel then that im certainly not going to roam around aimlessly unless i have a damn good reason for doing so eg theres actually a fight to be had note this is why i so seldom use my carrier i hate dealing with fuel issues if it wasnt so useful i would had sold it by nowas for 100 battleships no try more in the range of 10 to 15 or so assorted battleships andor battlecruisers andor hacs andor cruisers andor frigates is such a group considered blob force projectionso basically if i am part of a small gang and do not have the manpower to dedicate people to the task of refueling then everyone is forced to use smaller ships against godknowswhat in whatever system we all end up in and said inhabitants will not be limited to using small ships as we are because they dont have to travel and waste fuelagain how does this encourage pvp especially small skirmish gangsalright heres what i seebasically your idea forces me to chose my ship based on ease and economy rather than tactics and counters it forces me to choose between staying in a certain area or spending my gametime tediously setting up a plan to go out on a random direction i have never been to before because i want to find more targets there are many reasons why i hate 00 living and logistics crap like this is one of them
oh i am a coder and i can assure you the required coding effort is negligibleyou dont think a dev goes one by one over each solar system changing by hand coordinates of jump gates do youpain is weakness leaving the body
they have had to do this in the past they dont like it very much and usually break something in the process
im glad to hear they have experience with this thank you for your inputpain is weakness leaving the body
terrible idea
thank youdo you think that the stated goals are terribleor do you think that the proposed changes would have consequences different from the ones stated in the proposaland whypain is weakness leaving the body
what would happen if you run out of fuel in a battleship in 00 and there are no people nearby who can refuel you would you just wait until someone scanned you out came along and popped you
no you would proceed to warp at a reduced warp speed given that i have to repeat that ships can warp without fuel in almost every reply of mine in this thread its obvious i have to make this information stand out morepain is weakness leaving the body
making fuel pointless anyway
no fuel wont be pointless because it would provide increased mobility and increased mobility will be very very important and not easypain is weakness leaving the body
this entire proposal is made of fail are you trying to kill eve gtfoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
and because it wont be easy people wont be doing it for a little  and giggles roam you cant just go take some hacs or bcs out on short notice with this proposal like a lot of people do now if youre lucky you can take some rifters out and die to the first smartbombing bs you see thats it no cynabal gangs no nanohac gangs no muninn fleets welpfleets bomber fleets no dics or hics no logistics just rifters no fun allowed
of course you exaggerating but yes thats the idea you can have all that but it will be slower andor shorter range force projection would have drawbacks and involve compromisesthe concept of deep blue space 40 jumps around would a need to be revised eh  pain is weakness leaving the body
soyou actually do want to stop roams thennot to mention restricting deep nullsec logistics to people who own jump freighters and pretty much noone else making multiple titan bridges absolutely mandatory for the few fleets that might still be possible why do you hate funthe concept of living in 00 would need to be revised eh
what is stopping youthe issue of deep space logistics is specifically addressed by making the effective fast warp range of freighters industrial and transport ships very large  i put it at 1000au but no problem to be 2000au the concrete value is a matter of game balance and can be tweaked indefinitelyexactly the current concept of living in 00 needs to be revisedof course if you like current 00 very much just say we like 00 as is no need for these changes period pain is weakness leaving the body
the fact that i dont want to deal with dumb logistics crap for a simple pvp roam that might take me anywhere revised in such a way that it encourages people to stay in one general area and create more logistical headaches if anyone wants to actually do somethingi agree that 00 needs an overhaul but not this this just kills it the same way it will kill small roaming gangs
nothing requires you to do dumb logistics crap for a simple pvp roam well you will be a little limited in range or speed but hey its eve there are always compromises and drawbacks yes encourages multiple smaller entities distributed all across eve every one of them fighting with their neighbors as opposed to a few megablobs that easily wage war at the other end of the galaxyand of course encourages but does not confine themno create more logistical headaches for anyone who want to blob and for anyone who has blued everyone and his sister 50 jumps in any directionand thats good tm i like that you see the same implications from my proposal as i do pain is weakness leaving the body
unless you you know want to fly something bigger than a rifter or maybe a stabber or if you want to go outside of the region you live in and its immediate surroundingsi hate the new forum sometimes
alternativley encourages massive blobs surrounded by buffer pets no enemy roam would make it through the buffer pets without running out of fuel so your billion isk tengu would be safe to run sanctums all day long quoteyes create more logistical headaches for anyone who doesnt live right next to empire where theyll be able to get fuel from easier or for anyone who likes to roam to hotdrop to play around in bombers hacs recons anything bigger than a rifter i like to see that you have literally no idea what youre talking aboutalso why exactly is having friends a bad thing
because you cant shoot them ps apropos thank you for voicing your concernspain is weakness leaving the body
i see youve never been on a shoot blues op
obvious troll is obvious this would crush the market for everyone in high sec and wormholes that depends on the ice to survive side effects would spill over into insane prices on t3 ships many poss failing and wormhole corps being unable to maintain themselves the sheer stupidity of this idea indicates the op must be a troll
removing the ability for cheap robotic labor to take our jobs and push the prices down so far that its not really worth it for people to do when actually sitting at their computer while playing the game  a good thing
people like you are why csm is such a jokeyou know whats also not worth it ice mine in lolzsec without major changes to make barges survivableuseable no highsec ice  no ice period
your jobs please like youve mined a block of ice in recent memory all this would be is a massive economy crushing blow to highsec and wormhole spacei dunno maybe itd be worth it selling tengus for a couple billion who knows im sure all the tengu pilots that dont make their own wouldnt mind paying that
market speculation is obviously something decisions should be based on not the eventual stabilization point right
no it shouldnt happen it would be completely ice should deplete and ice systems should be random or ice should require exploration to find ice fields ice should never be removed from highsec
yes i think it would profit eve very much if ice was removed from highsec quote ccp fozzie  the days of balance and forget are over
i agree that it is not a sideshow my point on the matter of pi becoming an actual profession is that like mining you really need to love doing it any yutz with a pos can make is own fuel i would rather like to see pi professionals doing that and making the money there in real life how many people who own cars make their own gas not a great example but there it is loki
i doubt your proposal would contribute anything relevant to your aforementioned goals1 it discourages going solo especially over long distances  if you use one account you cant bring a fuel tanker with you by definition unless your heart tells you to solo in a battle fuel tanker therefore you will be limited in either fuel range or ship type if you choose to get into expensive ship types anyway you may be trapped between hostile gates in said expensive ship if you use more than two you still wont want to swap a combat ship with a fuel tanker2 it discourages going in groups smaller than a certain critical mass suppose an average deep space tanker can support 25 t1 bcs for the duration of a roam 75 jumps a total of 5000 aus because of warp inout maneuvers in this case the critical mass of fleet size would be 25 t1 bc equivalents per tanker if your fleet consumes less than 25 t1 bc equivalents the remaining fuel capacity gets wasted similar to unused fitting slots the waste in fuel capacity would become more pronounced in small gangs less than half tanker equivalents so small gangs would have to make a choice of selfpenalization bring a tanker instead of a combat ship dont bring a tanker but downgrade ship classes t1 cruisers instead of t1 bc  t2 cruiser  command ships dont bring a tanker maintain ship classes risk losing mobility and getting trapped between hostile gatesin the meantime larger fleetsblobs more than two tanker worths would simply delegate fuel hauling duties to the least experiencedskilled membersanalogous to unskilled manual labor thus losing relatively less combat effectiveness compared to small gangs3 malcanis law anything that tries to reduce the penalties on small gangs would benefit larger gangs much more thus defeating the purpose of introducing warp fuel in the first placetherefore not supported
it does not discourage going solo more than it discourages going in blobs in fact it indirectly encourages going solo  you dont have to wait for gang members to come slowly from across the region and your targets are slow to get reinforcementsi dont understand how you can be trapped in a way that you cant be trapped now perhaps it would have such effect perhaps not its not really interesting and i wont discuss it because i have never proposed a deep space tanker to be able to support 25 t1 bcs for 5000aui proposed a deep space tanker to be able to support 34 bs for 50 increase in range thats 200au worth of bs fuel lets say bcs have half the bs consumption therefore 400au of bc fuel almost but not quite doubling the range of a single bcperhaps these numbers can be increased but nowhere near supporting 25 bc for 75 jumpsif you ask malcanis you may find that he has very similar attitude regarding slowing down ship movement across evepain is weakness leaving the body
a well trained blob can simply bring a fuel tanker along as if it is bringing another fleet command ship solo pilots cant do that by definitiona hostile and well fueled blob warping at 336 aus interceptors at 916 aus and in case of 00 interdictors at 6 aus outmaneuvering the empty solo pilotgang crawling at 0205 aus the only way not to go down in this case would be to keep running rolling safes until the next dt comesnumbers are just numbers in this stage i simply used it to make the analysis more quantitativeyour numbers are severely limiting as others have stated before but thats not important eitherstill small gangs of less than 10 have to pay an arm to bring a tanker because each member counts while larger groups can keep their combat effectiveness by delegating fuel hauling duties to noncombatants  less experienced pilots can you explain how this trend encourages small gang activitiesthen you can simply cite his opinion the burden of persuasion lies onto you
crappy idea wormholers regularly travel what would seem like insane distances to many simply to get stuff to market and bring needed items back this just adds added and unnecessary cost to us
a well trained blob must first be assembled from individual pilots it does not just appear out of the thin aironce a blob is assembled of course a solo pilot will have the same chance as todayyes and the well fueled solo pilotgang outmaneuvering a hostile and empty blob it works both wayspain is weakness leaving the body
no the proportion of required fuel support is the same regardless of gang sizethe small gang is encouraged respectively that blob is discouraged at the stage before and atforming not that my proposal somehow allows you to solo pwn a blob once the said blob isformedforget the current situation when pilots idle in a single capital system this is due to the easeof movement  people can quickly assemble from their usualrattingminingwhatever grounds to thecapital and can also quickly disperse to their usual places for making money from the capitalinstead consider  you have 20 pilots in 20 systems ratting 10 miners in this system 10 more inthat system 5 people exploring in random places 5 doing a plex here 7 doing a plex there 2following an escallation somewhere 10 hauling stuff from empire 20 fueling poses and bridges 10camping a gate over there if youre gonna wait for all of them to assemble  well good luckon the other hand the same applies to your red neighbours they arent likely to form a defenceblob very quickly so why dont go with whatever you can assemble instead of waiting a hour for theblob to formand theres a second aspect its not only numbers but also power in my proposal forming aheavier blob is discouraged by limiting its range compared to a lighter blobpain is weakness leaving the body
would you care to elaborate because in this form its a crappy opinionwhat is insane distance and what ships do you use to travelpain is weakness leaving the body
well lets put it this way when i enter kspace and find a hole 20 from jita thats a good day depending on how many lows are between me and high ive gone 30 or more simply because the opportunity to do so was there a hole 6 from jita thats a party waiting to happen
i will have to repeat what is insane distance and what ships do you use to travelperhaps you shouldnt go to jita with my proposal its likely more market hubs to develop  the harder to travel the more likely people to buy and sell locally also i have specifically addressed the issue of logistics  the transport ships retain their current mobility for the most part it should be rather obvious for anyone that cares to read the proposal and the discussion thread that the proposed changes are directed mostly to combat shipseven considering that you escort your cargo ships through lowsec still the movement of the fleet will be limited by the movement speed of the cargo ships which would be the same as nowpain is weakness leaving the body
its added expenses for no benefits whatsoever fortunately theyll also not go and change every ship in the game to implement this so let it die the inglorious death it deserves
thank you for your opinionpain is weakness leaving the body
if you have ten guys putting one in a tanker is going to have a much much bigger effect than if you have a blob in a blob youre going to have enough people who have enough alts to fly the tankers without taking a combat pilot in a small gang this is less likelyquoteexcept that people wont spread out like that theyll be within a jb or two of the capital system or theyll keep an alt there or just jump clone youll still have people like me who dont rat mine plex explore etc tooand as for the same applying to the reds well why is that a good thing what benefit would this have to the guys who fly out into red space looking for good fights the guys who enjoy spanking home defence fleets or who want something more challenging than a guy who logs out docks or hides in a pos when reds get within five jumps why spend serious isk on fuel when you an just go and play a game that doesnt actively punish you for attempting to do something until the reds get bored andor run out of fuel
go rant elsewhere if you aint got anything constructive to saywe already know that you dont like the proposalpain is weakness leaving the body
and we already know that you outright refuse to listen to anyone pointing out its obvious deficiencies so lets both shitpost together 
not empty quoting
this proposal is bad and you should feel bad for making it
then please explain how you would properly fuel yourself when you are in hostile territory while using only one accounthint if you use more than one account its no longer solo
obviously you wont be able or it wont be easy to refuel yourself when youre in hostile territory just like you wont be able or it wont be easy to restock ammo paste get repairs unload loot why do you presume that youre entitled to thatof course same applies to hostiles on your territorylike i said it works both wayspain is weakness leaving the body
in summary do not consider fueled warp the default statethe default state is painfully slow warp and bigger evethe fuel is merely there as a little remedypain is weakness leaving the body
gonna stop writing now because trolling has become excessive pain is weakness leaving the body
thanks for the supportpersonally i prefer option 2 but id be happy with option 1
here is a post that explains the problem without realizing itthis pilot just believes that the other fw pilots are afraid to pvp when in fact amarr pilots cant fit their ships for pvp if they want tto run plexes effectively so thy cant really fight other players you can find these sorts of posts over and over again people claim fw pilots dont want pvp but the fact is fw plexers cant even fit their ships fo pvp if they want to do plexesits way past time for ccp to make fw a pvp activitymake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
shameless bump lets keep this at page one permanently guys
yesthis thread deserves way more attention than it is getting yeshint hint ccp
considering the impact something like this would have on the market it wouldnt be prudent to cut it cold turkeyccp is doing well with this by making high sec ice deplete and with just enough to meet demand of high sec from there they can determine the effects and the next action to take perhaps it will be to just remove ice from high the goal is to stop alliances in 00 form shipping all their fuel from high sec instead of mining it in 00 cutting out all ice may be overdoing it to each said goalive actually made a proposal to help with that the benefit targeting smaller corps its a minor change with little to no real fallout but i think it goes a long way simply from having that optionlol one of things i mentioned in my post was the need for more people to kill mining barges in high sec although it was only in jest
good one i laughed so much it hurt this has nothing to do with botting or making ice mining a profitable profession and everything about creating a viable non tech based monopoly with which to fund gsfs ship replacement program
just to point something outthere seems to be this strange idea that ice mining  botting this is wrong cycle is so long that one person can control dozens of barges and watch tv at the same time the ice miners are people just mostly afk macros are used in ratting ore mining chaining prescaned sanctums since theyre far more profitable while unlike missioning or incursions can still be handled by macros its a waste to use them on ice just to save clicks for the automated program
i stopped reading when he said no one mines ice in 00granted they may ship in some ice from 00 but the ice in 00 is far more rich than the crap you get in high secobviously this is a glorified troll stop the evemail spam
i dont understand why goons would randomly shoot high sec ice miners they say they are getting rid of bot miners but they have no way of knowing who is a bot and who is not a bot i got popped by one of these goons loosers while getting up to peee and get a drink spouting off in local about mittani telling them to go kill all high sec miners in gallente space and the only ones that are safe are the ones that donate isk to goons some of you might say game mechanics but we all know that is a bunch of crap i can support random sucide ganks of miners because that is game mechanicsi also think the ice should be limited and run out just like normal but with out being able to keep bots in check all the ice would be gone 2 hours after down time
i would like to see all highsec mining ice and roids moved to exploration mining low quantities per site with a high respawn rate and a maximum duration to cycle the spots almost empty the micromanagement of the spawns size and rate would allow to help limit the explosion of material cost even if it would mostly make alloys more expensive and farmedthat s a great way to limit botting and make mining a valuable profession while making low sec null sec and wh mining more importantfor ice mining the composition of ices or the availability in nulllow should be tweaked to allow a full autonomy from highsec old sourcestrue it does not solve null sec botting but this is only a first stepnext step would be to increase exploration importance for null sec to allow mining non standard materials that lack in null and limit the types of roids available in normal beltsfor lowsec a middle ground solution can be found as their roids contain most materials but who mines in low for wh lowend roids should be more available to allow some autonomy depending of the class and typeit is true that it would be a lot of bot subscriptions cancelled as mining would not be that easy but any change cause such claims anyway
when something that you use every time you undock is given the option of being better with a bit of isk especially when better  you can outmaneuver anyone who doesnt usehave it it stops becoming optionaland again smaller groups will have less options than bigger groups in amassing the resources necessary to stockpileget isk for it
i like your first suggestion perhaps make the agent a scanable site instead to enable more accessibility to them and draw more people from high sec instead of having her permacamped and unusedexpanding on that have scanable pirate faction lvl 1 agents in 0506 systems lvl 2s and rare lvl 3s in low and lvl 4s in nullfocus the missions more on gaining small valuable loot and against less but more powerful ships that will warp away for your third one i must disagreepirate null is already being worked on to give players benefits for being on the good side of the ruling faction i dont see why pirates in empire space would get a bonus they dont have any authority there where would this come from and what is the purpose of itif you want system bonuses and 100 reduction in sentry gun dmg go to npc 00 after decemberwhat low sec really needs is more then just people camping gates one thing could be ice mining with ice belts depleting in high low sec ice may become more popular and in order to assure that people need a viable way to work there even in a small fleet thats why i made this proposal
low sec icem ining will not beckome more populer to much pirates to deal with beter minrs wil move to 00 then to low sec
incursion has brought people into doing the sites people just do them in cheaper ships in ls whs also grants small terrific due to people moving their nice ships if they cant get a hs entrance through low sec these are just harder to catch to due to scouts etc hs missions is what really killed low sec due to it being the norm now taking away hs missions would cause a lot of rage that route is not the best option anymore adding some more features to low sec of alternate ways to make more or close to the same amount of isk compared to hs missions is always a benefit to somewhere the pirate missions also suit pirate players due to they dont care about their sec statushs standings because they cant all ready go theresure fw mission blitzing is still good isk
topic unlocked it appears it was closed in error
do want
also remove acceleration curve implement warp from standstill
yesUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD i totally agree with this i was wondering the other day looking at warping animation if someone had already brought this subject to the forums  i also dont like how if you are at max speed and initiate warp how your ship stops then the warp animation beging and slowly start to warp just makes no sense and i think it breaks the experience of warping it breaks the sensationi totally agree with this so punch itUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD
my favourite jump to warp animation is the one from farscape

what your are saying is if i want to change name of my character i would have to transfer said character to another account i own well i could live with thatbut why not cut on complexity and simply make name changing a separate service
alerting the other militia everytime a plex is being ran doesnt fix some of the core issues that makes plexing unappealing stabbed alts will still warp off and run a plex elsewhere and you can still chase them its not hard to find where certain people are plexing its not rocket science this mechanic will not induce more small scale pvp infact it will diminish it we have to take into account population discrepencies that may occur over the course of time on daily basis and even the longterm for instance fw usually has times during the day where one side has a stronger presence than the other and it shifts from one side to the other as people log onoff when the faction thats outnumbered is plexing the other side should have to do some legwork to find them because well they have the advantage and the side thats outnumbered has the chance to capture the plex before the full fury of the blob descends upon them or at least they get to kill a few first responders before being forced out when one side is outnumbered in some instances severely they need to attack where the enemy isnt prepared if the enemy is too lazy to hunt you down that their problem it forces people to spread out because you have to be out there scouting looking for the enemy listing where the enemy is and what theyre in with zero effort on behalf of a player is just a broken mechanic i can envision it now assuming occupancy was the focus of fw blobs sitting in station waiting for a notification of who what and where the enemy is and ships specifically to counter the enemy fleetshiptype oh theyre in cynabals lets break out the td arbys comes to mind this change would make plexing even more gay than it is now doing the legwork ie having pilots out there scouting systems to see who is plexing and where actually helps a lot with creating small gang scenarios for pvp the whole npc situation is tricky completely removing npcs will give rise to just everyone and their mother making several trial or non trial accounts with recycleable untrained stabbed plexing alts in cheap little frigs npcs serve some purpose in this fashion i believe that ewar should be completely removed from all npcs in fw plexes or at the very least have the number of ewar npcs severely reduced in a plex another issue at least with major plexes is npcs take too long to die if youre soloin a small gang i think the ehp of the npc battleshipselite ewar boats should be reduced making them easier to dispatch with a bc a full spawn at least in terms of missiles is devastating and the dps should be lowered but increase explosion velocity to help with smaller targets ie kill afk speed tankers maybe even nerf npc dps across the board some the overall function of the npcs should be to force players to at least bring an appropiately sized ship and to eliminate the untrained alts so people just cant afk cap plexes with them theres a lot of tweaking to be done with the npcs but i think this is a step in the right directionhere is last couple issues with fw plexingthe first and most obvious one is there is no incentive to beyond initial standings increases occupancy isnt meaningful it should be im not going to divulge into this right now im just going to point it outlastly theres the nothing to do syndrome after downtime most plexes are captured and there is very little left to do in some areas which leads players having nothing to do for the rest of the day there is shifting a practice that involves plexing in other systems within the same region to get seemingly random respawns within the region its a lot of work and really boring but its the only way to hold your systems if you dont have the european timezone dominant presence its not even possible to hold occupancy in systems where the opposing faction holds sovreignty unless you have eu timezone dominance as afaik you cannot get respawns with shifting in these systems when there are no plexes to take people obviously arent going to participate in this activity because they just cant the casual nature of fw should allow people to log in and find something to do within a reasonably short amount of time not wait one to two or more hours for a random respawn that resulted from shifting that may or may not occur note shifting becomes less and less valid of a tactic the smaller the region isthe obvious solution is to have periodic spawning of plexes at regular intervals set a cap on the maximum amount of plexes in any given system though so players actually have the opportunity to participate in this activity if they arent on after downtime an alternate method is to have there always be a plex spawned within a systema certain number of plexes within a constellation shifting on a smaller scale if its constellation but this would obviously need to increase the number of plexes needed to be captured before a bunker becomes vulnerable
i hate to be the guy to burst the proverbial bubble but there is a reason its called the dead horse thread and thats cause ccp let the horse die years ago and via their inaction to fix poss told us they dont give a hoot about our hints if you want poss to be fixed i suggest you crash jita thats about the only thing large enough to get their attention and make them respond id wager there have been more ideas fielded about how to fix poss than any other topic and you see where we are at still personally im going to curse ccp and then continue playing knowing one day ill move on from this game just like i eventually moved on from runescape and wow when companies stop thinking they know what a player wants better than the player knows what he wants is the day pigs fly in short you arent getting pos fixes sry man i really am
but it is still a nice ideastormhammer 666 ceo arse another really stupid enterprise
i hate to be that guy who feels the need to point out the very obvious flaw that everyone know aboutfact is pos are old and needed changingccp needs to put some time into changing themthe flogging the old horse thread was a great place where people discussed why it was so important that they change and is still very important todayit doesnt matter if ccp is slow they are getting slowly back on the ball after a bunch of terribly implemented ideassince we have new forums this needed to be one of the first threads before all the stupid people whine about afk cloakers and nerf xyz its too powereful and more importantly it needs to stay relevant
this is an outrage i wanted to buy a dress so i could feel sexy for once but i have been denied my rights i call for unisex dresses to be sold immediately as i feel im being discriminated against i refuse to spend my aurum until i can get a nice looking skirtand maybe some more makeup im mad as hell and i dont need to take this anymore
i second this since i am the man behind
i like the direction this idea is headed like posted above if you incentivize antipiracy you should also improve piracy itself i still think the corruption concept presented at eve vegas was great with sort of safe havens for pirates combined with the op proposal and maybe a reworked bounty system this could be awesome
on the eve main page at the very bottom there used to be a tiny little selection you could find that listed the plans for the futureit listed a variety of things the devs wished for coming in the future its been removed now because most of them have actually come to fruition such as planetary interaction walking faction warfare and a few othersone of them listed was called low sec viceroys  i dont agree with the system you are proposing if youve tried fw youll understand why the fw system really isnt a good systemhowever the viceroyship of low sec would still be a fun way of having sovereigntylite i dont know what you could specifically do with it and thats probably the major reason there is no big push for sovlite in low sec however id say theres a lot of reasons that it could be a viable tool for low sec
well they said they wanted to do something of people working as concord in a fanfest but that they were triying to find ways of people not being to exploit this maybe someone can have concord status and pass intel to their frineds of were is soemone going and traps etcbut is a good raw idea
to the goonsmaybe you should practice what you preach its funny how all the goonie hulks automatically log in and then out evey hour when a hostile issitting in your mining systemsfix the csm voting system so these muppets cant wreck the game
it would be altogether terrible if you removed ice from hisec without adding it to wormholes wormhole logistics is complicated enough without making it worse
ok so i wake up and this is the eve mail i find when i log on greetingsyou have been identified as one of the unfortunate miners who has suffered the loss of his ship within the last 24 hours of goonswarms ongoing effort to stop the environmental destruction of new eden and ensure that the faulty belief that ice mining is a profitable enteriprise ends we are sad to see that you were caught up in our effort but we do hope that you understand this was nothing to do with you in particular but more to do with your chosen profession we goons are environmentaliststhat said this is a one time offer if you will pay 500000000 isk you will be protected from further destruction this one time payment will protect you in only one system so make sure you point out which system you ice mine in when you reply payment is immediately noted in our goonswarm public boards and all goons currently participating in the effort to eliminate miners will be notified immediately as well via evemail and notification on our internal jabber systemin your payments comment line please ensure you note the system you are mining in once paid mine to your hearts content and enjoy the upwardly mobile price of oxytopesthanksvenus vermilliongoonswarm recruiter and public representativedoes anyone else find this mildly disturbingthis is the alliance that is suppose to be looking out for all of us in the csm its this kind of crap that makes me want to cancel all my accounts
you came here expecting us to respond with sympathy stop the evemail spam
not one to side with drake but sympathy can be located in the dictionary somewhere between  and syphillisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
nope i never look for sympathy in my opnion it is what it is i just want to bring it to light i think people should know the corruptness of the csm
if you actually did a little research there is a distinctive reason theyre doing it it is to limit the ability to use gallente supercaps ie the nyxclass supercarrier is a current favorite crippling the market on fuel for these behemoths is a valid means of warfare its called cutting supply lines if goonswarm federation controls the ice theyll be able to wait until the fuel supply of their enemies dwindles andor put it on the market at such a markup that itll force their enemies to find alternativesif i were you id find a way to profit from this like find the cheapest oxygen isotopes on the market buy in bulk immediately mark up and reselli am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
what corruption dude its just an ordinary scam pain is weakness leaving the body
tin foil hat really clashes with your fashion sensehonestly theyre doing it because they canand disrupting super caps by cutting off fuelreaching at bestgoonswarm has been ganking mackinaws for as long as i can remember and its always something they get a kick out of and manage to pull in a profit when they get someone to fall for a scam stop the evemail spam
if you can rub two brain cells together youll notice the bs in their excuse to be goonsany entity that can afford moms wont be bothered by jump fuel prices going up a few times exploiting game mechanics for lulz is a valid means of being goons
have any of you considered that the turret size is really small i can barely see the turrets in my abbadon i wanna feel that i am carriying a bazooka when i am in a battleship not a water pistol
i am hereby calling on darius the third to relinquish his counsel of stellar management csm alternate seat as he has disgraced the office and no longer possesses the moral authority to continue on in this capacity darius the third or darius iii recently leaked information from the csm skype channel to en24 editor riverini violating the trust fellow members had placed in him and trampling over the spirit if not the letter of the non disclosure agreementhis actions have proven that he can no longer objectively represent the eve online community and as a result he should be relived of those duties through either voluntary resignation or forced abdication by ccp
i second this
so say we all
i second this
i support this proposal
kick darious iii
i too support this
so then youre establishing that this is the punishment for leaking information removal from the csmi feel this is simply political maneuvering to remove the voice of the citizens that darius represents i find your tactics abhorrent and i feel that it places a shadow of corruption on this council that will remain forever if this proposal is allowed to passdarius is not the first of the csm who has committed such a trivial transgression if indeed he has committed any and some of those councilors have posted in this very thread you have provided no evidence nor supplied the council with any compelling arguments that would lead any reasonable person to conclude that darius should be removed from the councila vote in support of this motion is a vote for corruption lawlessness hypocrisy and exemplifies an utter disdain for this council and everything it stands for
apologist white washing at its finest the csm represents all the voices within eve not just the ones who voted for them his actions not only violate the trust placed in him by his fellow delegates but by ccp and the entire community as wella vote against this motion is a vote for corruption lawlessness hypocrisy and exemplifies an utter disdain for this council and everything it stands for
so youre saying that this is acceptable and that we shouldnt consider repercussions for this or future transgressions
so youre saying that this is acceptable and that we shouldnt consider repercussions for this or future transgressions
i support corruption lawlessness hypocrisy in this game
not following a legal document that ensures that ccp can be frank with the csm which is absolutely vital to keep the csm relevant isnt trivialdo you really think removing a member who is leaking confidential material to his friends and is breaking legal contracts makes you corrupt lawless and most importantly hypocritical
i also feel violated by darius the third
look at dat dreddits  pain is weakness leaving the body
i assert that before any decision is made the accusers must bring forth evidence of wrongdoingand in the event that evidence is supplied and to be found incontrovertible and beyond reasonable doubt then the council must make a decision on how to proceedi would caution the followingthis evidence must be verifiable and nonfalsifiablethis evidence must demonstrate that darius committed acts that are specifically outlined and documented in the agreement he madethe evidence must exceed a threshold of reasonable doubt this is not a kangaroo court and i would pray that the citizens we have elected to guide us would not stand for burning someone at stake until this point we have nothing but trite accusations and heresay nonsense that is evidence of nothing other than political banteringnow in the event that such evidence is supplied and verified and accepted as being beyond a reasonable doubt i would then caution all of the members of the council that the path forward sets a president one that will be followed by councils that follow you and by burning darius at the stake you very well may likely be lighting a match to your own feet as well
the cases of breach of an nda are not at all a subject of debate between players csm and ccpthus any proposals in assembly hall with such a topic are pointless and mentally challengedpain is weakness leaving the body
hd vid or it didnt happen
as said alraedy nda stuff is handled by ccp and their legal department its none of our bloody businessshort of your usual emorantrage agianst csm stop the evemail spam
greetings to the csm and all interested pilotsi have been playing eve since 2008 and would really like some improvements done to the current tools provided for supply  demand market analysis dont have anything against eve central market website but it is quite obsolete if you want to really want to dedicate your development to trading inside the game1 market informationi guess this is the first thing i would like to raise as a concernwe are so posed to be living a futuristic ingame life experience based on the technology designed by ccp but market information transparency regarding what is being sold or demanded elsewhere your current region is very difficult to get and follow as well as in eve central market one should be able to easily sort market info from anywhere in the gamea pricesb quantities supplied and demandedc select timeframe for queryd customized dashboard of indicators for watch liste ability to download to excel files numbers mac worksheets any information request2 marketing toolsprovide a place to put advertisements space cans and cargos with long texts are not fulfilling the needim not asking to populate eve space of crowded communications but we could eventually have a couple of systems were you can put your own station or advertisement to make people enter and buy only your stuff moreover being able to better communicate your offers and not just morse code messages in trading channels3 financial servicesits quite a complex market but we are not able to have banks this is really needed when you are focused in tradingi know that most players are mainly interested in pvp but there is at least a small community of professionals that really enjoy and have fun with the cycle of mining manufacturing and selling my casein these cases npcs financial services would be an interesting concept to develop and i do believe is quite simplecorps could also be able to set their own banks and communicate it to the eve community not saying this should be easy to get probably more difficult than to open a corp4 corporation stock marketif a corp is doing very well but would like to take their economic growth beyond why not enabling the possibility to corps and investors to interact in a digital stock market placethis will also bring improved market performance and funding5 freelance sales representatives contractsif we do have contracts for people that are able to provide distribution services why couldnt we offer products for resale and paying a commission without needing to sell the full items and then make the salesman bare all the risk some enthusiastic sales people could power up items availability and market competition benefiting everyoneok guys have other suggestions regarding the subject but not as important as these onescould u provide feedback if this can be escalated to ccp or notthanks and good luckroldanusblack anvil industries corporation

i hate my name i therefore would love the option to change iti also agree on one time change and something stating it was changed in the players bio or whatevernot trying to hide anything im a nobody however it bothers me only having one namei want a last name or want to be able to change this crappy name for one of my other chars on this account10  20  30 i dont care i will pay iti tried bringing myself to starting a new toon but that lasted all of 1 day realizing how long it would be useless for
thanks for your commentsalerting the players will dramatically increase the amount of small scale pvp the question you raise here is will people who want to run fw plexes in alts that never pvp benefit from an alert telling the enemy where there alts are i think its pretty clear a notification system would severely decrease the effeciency of the alt method of plexingpeople who enter plexes but never fight to hold them will constantly have their time wasted and rarely if ever be able to finish a plex thus they wont be able to actually accompish much other than open plexes for the enemyonce the enemy comes and chases the stabbed alt off the enemy can then run the plex on his own if the stabbed pilot opens a plex in the next door system then the combat pilot can simply wait out the timer and as soon as it runs chase the stabbed alt out of the next plex he opened the alt will just be acting like an alt for the enemy finding and opening plexes for them yet not being able to finish any themselvesthe idea that you run plexes with alts will no longer work nearly as well as it does now now the alts have a certain advantage that you have to keep chasing after them in order to track them people get tired of chasing alts with a notification system you willno longer have to chase after them plexing alts will no longer be able to play hide and seek they can run but they cant hide alts will mostly be wasting their own time and rarely able to finish a plex make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
who do you think will become disillusionedtire first the responding pvper or the plexing altwhat you say may well be how it is for a few weeks after such a change but people will very quickly stop responding to reports of frigs since they always run  frig plexing moves from being the norm to being why use anything else  ever essentially decoupling plexing from pvp entirely thus exacerbating the problem you are trying to solvechanges to fw need to be extensive and allinclusive for it to have any impact on the behaviour we can observe today plex reporting might be part of it but will not be what moves fw in the pvp direction ex rewardscarrots for staying the course would have a significantly better effectlove your optimism but we play to be entertained and hunting fit frigs simply does not satisfy that need  it is barely satisfied by hunting the mission bombers but at least the payout from those can be quite high best one yet was a 500m hound  bling ftw
the alt will be disillusioned and tired first because he wont be able to capture plexes like he can now the pvper will be happy because he can capture plexes and the attached rewards plus he will get lots of fights with other pvp pilots you are thinking of how things work now without the notification system and not fully appreciating how notifications will change alt hide and seek plexing there will be no more hiding like i said in my last post if the alt runs to the next system and opens a plex you can just finish the plex he already started when your timer is done chase him out of the new plex he opened and run that plex as well the pvper and the alt both spent about 25 minutes in the game the pvper captured 2 plexes the alt captured 0 there is no more need to chase anyone the smart militias will have plexing pilots spread out in different zones player defined zones throughout the fw regions so lets say i am notified of a plex being run by an enemy in hadzeko i chase someone out and run their plex while i am runing that plex i get a message that the person i ran out jumped into ardar and is running a plex i can just finish my timer and then chase them out of their new plex and run that as wellso i have 2 plexes captured and he has none so letUFFFDs say i get a message that he went all the way to tzvi and is running a plex there do i chase him not if the militia is being strategic about it i would be on vent and let the militia that is running in that zone know this guy is a rabbit and so you can chase him out at the last minute and he wont fightdo you see this is a completely different type of warfare than anything eve has to offer it involves people coordinating and spreading out and covering different zones instead of just blobbing up and chasing people imo this is what eve needs most a system of warfare that involves some other strategy besides getting in the largest blob you can and chasing things assigning pilots to different zones and then having those pilots within those zones coordinating would be key because of the sheer amount of combat pilots would need to actually start thinking in terms of what shipsfittings make sense iskwise it would be a major change for eve in that what is now an abandoned mechanism would become the funnest part of eve it would be a huge draw for those who like small gang pvpside note ccp would have to figure out the timer mechanics iUFFFDm not exactly sure how they should do it i would suggest that when you first open a plex 1 minute is added to the timer so if i first open a minor plex i would have to orbit for 11 minutes if some enemy came in a plex that i opened the timer would stop while we were both in range of the button if i left then the timer would restart for him and he would have 10 minutes if i came back after he ran 5 minutes of the plex and chased him out the timer would then restart at 10 minutes itUFFFDs only that original opening of a plex that adds that 1 minute that way an alt running around and unwilling to pvp would definitely not be able to get anything done make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
while you are sitting on that timer he is on his  you may run the timer you just won but by the time you arrive at his new site he is ready to move  i have been playing the seconds left on timer too damn long to buy into that illusionand now you also want to reset timers every time it is taken over by the other side as wellyour lack of understanding of the mental strain involved in serious plexing is shining through you will never be able to sell that idea to any of the organized plexing crews one of the major parts of being able to hold the line against superior numbers read blobbers is that every minute spent on a timer has to be matched by opponent  cannot begin to count the number of times where extra secondsminutes acquired by running a timer you know the enemy will take over soonUFFFD has been enough to gather the extra 23 hulls to beat them backalso just what do you expect to give to the pvp pilot to encourage him to sit on his ass for 1020 minutes at a time whenever some major plexing push is being planned we spend hours upon hours convincing the combat centric population that it is in their interest to assist pretty sure this goes for plexers in all militias orbiting a button has never been fun so unless you introduce some golden carrot which will be abused to hell and back there is just no way to make people twiddle their thumbs for the amount of time that we are talking when they could be bonking heads at their usual gatesstationson timer mechanics one of my former corp mates suggested that defensive plexes run themselves once started and only offensive plexes require someone on timer puts the pressure on the attacking party who quite literally has to be there and thus expose themselves to response effectively solves your problems in a much smoother fashion provided spawn mechs are not postdt biased without the use of plexspam channels and what notin short the idea will massively favour whomever has the most peoplealts available and will not improve on either fight frequency or quality numbers  all paradigm has been tried and it has failed so miserably that even null is starting to ask for changeps this is the last bump you get
no he will not be on the timer as long as i will he will have to travel to a new one and scan it out i will know exactly where he is plus he will have that extra minute added for starting a new timer you probably didnt read that at the end of my post therefore i will be able to chase him out before he accomplishes anythingpvper 2 alt 0 i am not trying to sell this idea to the 80 or so people who do serious faction war plexing now any more than i am trying to sell this to the people with the other 300000 accounts not to mention the millions of people who dont play eve because there are no mechanics to bring about small scale pvp the current plexxing mechanics make it so people can capture lots of plexes without any pvp see anks post from 2008 if you doubt this and there were likely several more people doing plexing then than now so yes i no longer engage in the current plex mechanics because they are bad as far as resetting the timer and how the timer works i am making some suggestions that i think ccp should consider they are not part of the original proposal and i am not wed to them if you think what i say is a bad idea then say why you might be right but just claiming that those who do plexing now wont like it is not really helpfull or relevant ccp should consider the plex timing mechanics when they redo plexxing that is not to say they wont ultimately decide to stay with the same times they currently have but they should at least consider alternatives i proposed the extra minute when a plex first starts to help prevent alts from running plexes in other words you save a minute of time if you chase someone out of a plex instead of just opening one when no one is around what do you think should happen if you chase an enemy out when he has say one minute left on the timer make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
unlike now when the other militia doesnt even know you are running a plex so you end up sitting on your ass for 1020 minutes the new system will notify the enemy so you will have to fight other players to capture the plex the main reason people like ank were able to capture hundreds of plexes with no pvp was becasue the other militia didnt even know she was there in fact it was in that thread where she posted she made the highest rank in amarr in under a week without a single pvp kill that someone proposed the idea that the militias should be notified its not my idea at all but it is an obvious solution to the problemagain you are failing to realize that plexing now UFFFD which often does involve orbiting a button because no one even knows your threre UFFFD will no longer be the norm once you attack that complex and your presence is announced to the entire enemy militia you will have more to do than orbit a button moreover i am not saying these are the only things that should be done for fw yes people should get some sort of gain for capturing plexes that is important as well that is more or less a seperate issue i think all ideas should be considered but wonUFFFDt this particular proposal just lead to alts starting a bunch of defensive timers and leaving i donUFFFDt see how it will yield any more pvp having more numbers will always be an advantage all else being equal we have to accept that but this proposal does not help those with more numbers than the current system does plus there are other things ccp can do to help sides that are severely outnumbered
ok i agree that the npc part is tricky i think ccp can do away with them completely but i agree your concerns are valid i like the idea that the missiles would have increased explosion velocity along the same lines consider these ideas1 have an alarm beacon spawn say at 3minutes and 6 minutes for a minor and say 3 times for a medium 4 times for a major f th alarm is not destroyed in 2 minutes the rats as described below will spawn the minor alarm will tank 50 dps the medium wil lank 150 dps the major bc and down will tank 350 and the major open will tank 500 these are rough numbers they are pretty low because not all fw pilots have top skills moreover some pvp fits do not do allot of dps for example a merlin might have 2 neuts insead of rockets launchers2 make it so the all the rats have lots of target painters and missiles no other ewar the target painters and missiles would mean that they can not be speed tanked by fast frigatesthis would make it so pvpers could still kill the rats without having to fit a lame pve tank yet noob ships and t1 frigates would not be able to tank the npcs and run the major sitesmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
hirana knows whats upcearen you need to read the last part of my post earlier the nothing to do syndrome and the fact theres no incentive to hold occupancy you seem to think that not knowing where the enemy is is the core issue behind the lack of small scale pvp in regards to fw its a really really bad idea to have alerting mechanics in place and will just lead to blobbing i already went into why its a bad idea you dont seem to grasp the concept that the people who run alts arent really after pvp theyre role players they want systems and nothing more they plex 16 hours a day without so much as a fight somedays regarding your discussion between hirana and yourself about alts heres an example why running with alts still will work under a notification system alt begins running a major plex you get the notification and begin heading that way to respond meanwhile the alt has been running the timer for 10 minutes before the time you arrive you force alt out and have to spend 30 minutes to close the plex meanwhile alt opens another major elsewhere and has to spend only 20 minutes closing it compared to the 30 you have to spend to close the one from before you have the option to chase said alt hardcore plexers will run with multiple alts as well as a main who will have stabs fitted and warp away so someone looking for pvp doesnt get any under the current system or the one youre proposing your other option is that you sit there and capture the plex they were running at first theyll still get the other one but at least youve removed a potential plex from threat of being captured but then youve sat there bored for thirty minutes with no pew pew its a loselose for anyone looking after pew when it comes to altsthis is why there should be an incentive for having occupancy a meaningful reward at the end of a long term push to capture a system it doesnt neccesarily have to be monetary but there needs to be an incentive beyond a little line at the top left corner of the screen players should say i want to capture that system right now its what the  would i do that for again ill reiterate often times when a system becomes a focus there isnt anything to fight for for hours at a time the nothing to do syndrome kicks in people want to attackdefend the system but they spend countless hours waiting bored waiting for a plex to spawn these issues need addressing more than oh i dont want to use one of the 20 locator agents within 5 jumps of me there should be an automatic system telling me where to blob someone
uh oh im getting support from tears well im sure you guys will make it entertaining you always do
1did they remove the vote for check box cause i dont see it and the sticky still says to check it
indeed take the work away from the cheap hisec robotic labour and give it to the cheap null sec exuberantly mining for 18 hours a day labour
i decided to wait a few days as it would help drive my point homeoxygen iso prices at time of this post jita sell order 89899iskits been only 6 days and 3000 per iso is no longer although ive only seen it as high as 1200 but what do i know i only exclusively trade ice productso lets talk less about moer tears omg quit my accounts goons scammed me and more about what the causes and effects are of our high iso pricesyes ive read the reports on why goons did this goons gunna goonso why have they been hovering around the 900 mark for the past few daysaccording to this
thats an easy one stockpiles are being released back into the market in efforts to take advantage of the inflated prices theyre being released a little too quickly to maintain an excessively inflated value as the stockpiles dwondle prices will again begin to elevatebesides you cant rule out option 2 the goons are allowing miners to buy the rights to mine during this event depending on how many do this and take advantage of the reduced competition youll also start seeing an increase in supply although not at the initial levelso yeah the whole remove ice from high concept is still moronic
you didnt actually look at the killboard the goons have even killed blues which has caused some unrest in the cfcthey are not allowing any mining why dont you prove me wrong though go out pay a goon 500m and see if you can mineas for the market being reinjected with stores of isos check the before daily traded volumes check the daily volumes now
so youre saying that 00 spawning ice such as pristine white glaze at 17517101 is far more rich then white glaze 14708601 350 isos vs 300 lets talk about risk vs reward shall we
scuse me have you ever lived in 00oh waityou havnt have youbecuase if you hadyoud understand theres risk involved in transport of cargo via jump freightersspecially if the bridge goes downyoud also know that ice locally mined for poss that can consume that fuel are cheaper to do so locally with an outpost capable of refiningwe all know your just a glorified troll so please move along stop the evemail spam
actually i visit 00 often stop the evemail spam
visit is not livemany of my customers are 00 dwellers i deliver there very obtain ive never lost a jf just lots of cynosmoving a jf with good skills doesnt cost very much in fuel yes there is a risk in moving jfs around but as long as you have an alt for eyes thats not an issueas for wormhole dwellers i sell to them but never deliver obviouslythey should not have ice nor should they have as much ore as they have eitherthey have sleepers which is the whole reason for whs anyway i realize that some highend mats are needed for t3 production but currently their supplys are a lot more then their demand currently ice is the only monthly import for whs that and a very few whoms planets can not sustain pos fuelsfurthermore lets take a little look at ccp recurve dev blogi would like to thank him for his hard work as i know it must have taken a good deal of time recurve there are people who enjoy your work please keep them coming maybe even get our q reports back linked relationship between pi and ice prices graphthis blog was posted after this thread was created and was one of the points i was trying to makeif ice goes up pi goes down while this is bad for pi initially it will normalize after the market corrections
while i dont live in 00neither do you according to the information your givingregardless your prespective is based on a small smattering of prespectives and statistics your practicually pulling out of thin airremoval of ice from high sec is a foolish notiondepletion i can deal with but as its clearly been said alrady but the majority hereregardless of some trolls this is foolish and riddeled with tin foil stop the evemail spam
as a human playing in australia i heartily support the concept of depleting the static ice belts that means far more isk for me since ill be able to mine the belts immediately after downtime while everyone else has nothingon the other hand moving ice belts to grav sites means that there is something worth mining in hisec grav sites and all the ice wont be disappearing within an hour after downtimedepleting static belts is a silly idea suitable perhaps as a stopgap if ccp already have the move all static belts to grav sites process well under way but a foolish  shortsighted move otherwise
1 i never claimed to you accused me of not knowing about the risks involved in transportation which i in fact do2 and by thin air you mean actual information from ccp3 prove it ive given supporting case as to why it would be good or is logic too hard for you eve does have a steep learning curve so if you cant then just keep quite pleasekeeping ice in highsec at all in my opinion is badno ice in empire else there would still be a supplycurrently there is nothing in empire that you have to import from 00 ice would solve that as well as solve many other issues with market bubbles tech t2 etc
we are calling darius a disgrace but not including vile rat and the mittani in this
yes
 snipe down the drain
i say we just kick out the whole csm and then mail every eve player a golden fortune cookie those that open and find a coupon for a free pet badger get to be on the next csmbut honestly why bother removing anybody half the csm maneuvers to ahev the game shifted in them and theuir buddies favor anyways and thats certaintly not in the spirit of their position and you seriosuly think no member besides darius might have released nda realted material to someone even a trickle cause my friends who go to jury cant shut up about it and they are told to quiet by a legal court honestly i say we just start kicking people out on the sheer reason that they got themselves electedim against this for these completely ridiculous reasons but 90 im against this because i find the current csm in its form is rather funny to watch
lol xd u so randum
i support this inb4 lock
i have confidence in the csm and progression is good
i support thiseveryone that doesnt support this is just mad
idgi mittani leaked a ton of info to the people closest to him not sure why youre making such a big deal out of this guy doing itif he goes vile rat and mittani should go tooi mean if youre going all balls out about it you have an ex goon working for ccp whos now pushing through whatever ideas and game changes that goons wantelections are soon enough anyway
darius iii is alleged to have leaked three lines of useless text from skype while the mittani is developing an entire null sec empires future strategy based on information he is privy towhich is the greater sintrick questionthe answer is the only crime is getting caught
there can be only one
the true story is that mittani and vile were embarrassed by darius because of the whole delve freeport troll so they came up with this csm leak bs to try get back at him
of course it clearly has nothing to do with breaches leaking for personal gain or anything of that sortoh wait
oh yeah well mara rinn is making hundreds of billions on an untraceable alt because shes getting out of game communications from a friend who is a dev at ccpi dont need proof to play this game right
i would ask that ccp close and delete this thread if the matter is indeed for them to discuss and investigateif ccp wishes for this nonsense to continue with the baseless accusations and character dispersions of mr johnson we can see on which side their bread truly is buttered bottom line it doesnt belong here and should be deleteddarius deserves to be compensated for the damage this has caused
hmm or as opposed to jaggas interpretation  which is sound are you implying that in conjunction with the establishment of a name changing system character transfers would be entitled to a free name change if not it would just be a circuitous means to name changing  but without all the safety features  as jagga wroteyeah i guess it does kinda work for me either way too
i feel that youve encapsulated the views of a great many people with your post the frustration the dismal alternatives  the fiscal desperationalso why stop at last name i think someone posted that you can now have middle names toothat is right here
yes a million upvotesid love to be able to change names
i agree that they need to adjust how many plexes are in play there should be many more plexes in play throughout the dayas for the incentive to hold occupancy i agree that there should be some increase in the rewards but they shouldnt just spew isk at people and turn plexing into a new form of fw missions frankly with the current mechanic where people plex in backwater systems and fight rats  adding isk to it will just take fw pvp a step backward did you read that analogy to the lottery that i gave what do you think about itsince you havent explained how you think they should make system occupancy mean something i cant really comment moreas for your first paragraph it wont take 10 minutes to get to the alt it will take about 1 minute moreover i dont think the timers should work like you describethe alts in cheap frigates will fare worse if we are informed where they are do you not at least agree to thatas for your claim that this will lead to blobbing it wont ccp will need to make sure there are enough systems in play so if the blob is up in one area a plexer can go plex somewhere else the blob will need to split up if they want to be most efficient at plexing blobbing will not be an effective way to run plexes if they are constantly popping up in all 8 regions of fwmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
no doubt i agree with what you say my second post in this thread was intended to address this that is the new spawns of plexes shouldnt just happen after downtime or through shiftingbut again there are other ways to solve this problem they could make the system of how occupancy is taken more dynamic than it is now systems could go in and out of being contested throughout the day so there are several things ccp could doin short i totally agree that this will need to be addressed dont think that the op in this thread was intended as the only changes to fw plexxing they are just improvements that would make plexing more pvp instead of pvemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
want the modular space station thingers instead of the horrible bubble staffs we have now please ccp implement this stuff
exhibit i is pretty bad ass and the pos should look like that in the beginningalthough i think a force field should be added to the picture jsut because its what weve been used todeath of this horse is a lie
and while you are at it make them dockable and allow us to get out and walk around in them one day dont make them as good starbases in terms of storage and whatnot of course
eve was going to have something like this except they were cosmos agents you needed very high security to use them and they would hand out pirate kill missionsbounty missions so you could kill them in highlow sec with no threat to gate guns this including podding to collect a higher reward  bountyexpand this to corp missions to huntkill other corps
however your opinion is ill thought out and fails to fully consider the ripple effects such a poorly thought out move would have as im sure youre aware ice fuels the poss in their current configuration youll have all ice fuels spiking in prices as the supply drops dramatically and therell be a negligible increase in the amount of ice supplied from null sec simply put itll become too expensive to maintain poss anywhere except null not only will a ton of research and industry screech to a halt in high sec but wormholes will drastically suffer as such many corps in wormholes will fail simply being inable to keep their pos fueled and thus greatly reducing t3 research and production and those that do manage to hang on will have no choice but to jack up t3 prices even more simply to break even basically t3 prices will go through the roof researched items and blueprints will go throughthe roof the ripples would pretty well cripple the economy to a devatating degree and the kickerpeople still wont go to null to mine ice theres a reason theyre not there as it is you cant take the sand from one persons sandbox and expect them to go play in the one you tell them to theyll simply look at their empty box and go home
can only agree to this if ice is put into worm holes i do not currently live in one though i did at one timenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
ingvar angsti like you sir that was well thought out and you stated a very good casei think that we just see different outcomes but see the same tricklesi feel that low sec should maintain ice how it currently is it is vastly more accessible to empire corps then 00 also npc 00 should also maintain icemy expected outcome is that corporations will seek to overcome the current drawbacks of low and npc null in order to strike it rich so to speaki remember a time where rookies wanted to mine in lowsec because they thought they would be making more isk in an environment that is harsher then empire id like to ask someone in an active corp that has new members whom mine do they bug you for a lowsec mining opmoving ice out of highsec may help to eject lowsec with a larger population clearly the miners would need pvp support and if ice prices were highenough it would warrant the iskhour lost having pvpers escort instead of simply more minersor the even larger offset would be that the corp could afford to have a highsec pos where previously they could not then they could make a passive income from researcht2 invention or whatever theyd like to use that pos forpirates would be happy as all of a sudden there are more people in lowsec and they would have to decide if it was worth it to try to attack a well defended fleet or they may need to grab more friends to helpthis could inspire nice battles over resources and a greater sense of respect of corpmates who specialize in certain fields miners pvpers as each relies on the other rather then two distinct groupsyou are absolutely right  research and invention would increase in price blueprint copies would increase as well however they would not increase as much as we expect them to believe it or not there are a lot of highsec research lines yes there is a wait but the supply exists also npc null has lines free all over even copy slots greater risk for quicker time using themthe corps who took the time for a corp lowsec  npc mining op would have already invested risk in the mining op itself as to mitigate the risk in doing research elsewhere or having to wait a long timet3 would be a very interesting relation you and i agree spending more isk on pos ice fuels would raise t3 prices well perhaps we can both agree that those costs will be passed on to those who buy t3meaning you spend more isk but make more as wellside noteif you live in alaska usa you know what i mean you may get paid 10  hour to work at tacobell far over federal minimum wadge but it costs 800 for a meal there in the washington you make 725 per hour but it only costs 580 for the same meal both cost 80 of your hourly wadge the same floating effect can be used to show decade prices where our father paid 100 to fix his broken car back in 1971 where now we paid 300 for the same type of repair however it equated to 2 weeks of our fathers paycheck and it still equates to 2 weeks ouf our paycheck at a comparable jobanother probable potability as t3 goes up more corps will do day trips into whs increasing supply helping to elevate the gap between demandwhere i think the truly helpful effects come into play would be moon mining towers and jump bridge networks both of these mainly take place in null secif the fuel prices increase then so does the poss moon goo output as it will be passed on to the customer the buyer currently there are many complex reactions mainly the base 4 crystalline carbonide fernite carbide titanium carbide tungsten carbide that are already lowpriced with pos fuel declining no one will want to take the initial loss before the market adjusts they will spend more on pos fuel then receive on creaction output the supply of these creactions will decrease causing the bottlenecks such as tech and r64s to drop because they will not have the lowend creactions to react with eventually these will all equalize out to a closer average between the two current pricesif the highends and the low ends are equalized then t2 mat prices will be quite similar to their current prices00 alliance logisticscurrently moon goo is how most alliances foot the billlower returns on this passive income will inspire a need for them to cut their own ice to supply their jump bridge network as well as fuel their poss and super fleetssame concept as the smaller corp scenario defined before but on a larger scale more pvp more hot hot sweaty carebear love both parties feel needed filling a role more people getting immersed in a game due to bondingwin  win nwinth
true were definitely seeing different outcomes for example will more people go into low to mine ice i suspect itll be far less than youd expect why do you think hulkageddon brought about so many tears theres a lot of people that play the game at a low level they prefer a more peaceful environment its their nature and theyre not wrong for wanting that its simply who they are as a result it would only take one or two packs of roaming narwhals popping their precious hulks for them to give up completely on the idea of mining outside of high sec theyd either go back to mining rocks or simply move on to a game that is more encompassing of their preferred style of play yes eve isnt supposed to be perfectly safe but theres a reason many people seek as much safety as they can its their nature so this nature alone will result in a drastic drop in supply and a correlating increases on anything and everything that requires pos fuelswith t3 production i like the comparison to taco bell in alaska and washington however the major difference i see is this youd be making people that live in washington have to buy tacos at alaska prices your example has the industry occuring in both places tacos made and sold in ak vs those made and sold in wa t3s are only supplied from wormholes period everything that goes into a t3 is obtained through wormholes  hence the need for abc in all holes its intended to be primarily selfsufficient except for one thing that painful need to import ice fuels well two things but dont get me started on not being able to assemble and refit t3s in a hole as a result if t3 prices go up due to the increase in cost to make in holes that price affects everyone from alaska to washington to tibet and it will do so painfully now you may think thats fine everyone has a chance to buy them at the increased prices but its actually quite imbalanced null would have the greatest advantage at being able to afford t3s next to only the remaining wormhole corps themselves that have been able to survive the spike in prices and dwindling supply of fuel null would control the isk even more dangerous you see what the goons are doing with their push to control all of the major supplies of t2 industry in null imagine null run by one power bloc that decides they think wormhole corps have it too good so they simply turn off the fuel spigots going into empire what happens wormholes are strangled to death with no defense at all being available to them they could crush wormhole space without having to undock too much power too much ability to control areas of the game that should be outside their sphere of influence wormholes are more null than null keep in mind as all holes are 10 space as such they have as much if not more rights to be able to control their own destiniesas far as this benefitting null more you may see that as a benefit but as someone that doesnt live in empire null i see that as more of a problem again its not going to increase the population of null much at all people with no interest now to live there wont magically develop an interest and move there if they cant keep playing in a way they prefer theyll leave so who benefits the preexisting megaalliances almost exclusively any small alliancescorps in null that currently are in or near ice systems will get steamrolled at a power grab takes place to control the supply of ice fuels this is inevitable hell look at the current distribution of moons and who controls what and youll see that the small even in null will suffer the huge will become larger and too much power will shift to those that dont need it
remove rats from nullsec this will force people there to rat in highsec
you cannot escort mining barges they are soft targets and there is no practical means to intercept attackers before they blow up the bargeexhumerif it were possible to deploy warp bubbles in lowsec belts it might be possible to escort barges in the meantime they are a soft target that can be destroyed in a couple of salvos even concord cant stop an apocalypse suicide ganking in hisec
simulated pvp from console in captainUFFFDs quarters now we have this living space outside of the ship add a game consol so we can play simulated eve pvp in our quarters suggestion is to add simulated pvp within the game that is have a game playable within your quarters where you can participate in simulated battles with ships you can fly against other players or nominated npcs thus you can learn if the skillfits you have are adequate to battle other players way i see this being added is1 you have a display just like now but you can buy any item you can fly or equip for no cost you make no isk also  just need some id system to indicate you are in a simulated eve station all normal rules for eve apply but no cost for simulated parts  ships2 you have a number of systems you can form up in with normal concord rules for sec 10 system this system jumps to a null sec for pvp recommend one for noncapitals one all ships possibly limit capital ships available to one or two a day per player3 to get to this pvp station is by a simulated jump clone that has no cool down doing this protects real eve reve implants and death function is not affected add auto medical death clone skill protect to again get around reve death functions this clone will have no implants but as they will have no cost in this pvp game in eve you can try different setups 4 the null sec system people can practice their setups for gate camping etcUFFFD find out if your bs with 8sb can take down those bubbles before sucking on vacuum 5 players can practice tactics with others in same corp setting redblue teams or even interalliance pvp with no loss you will be able to find out who has the best skillsetup with risking that 45b isk t3 setup with all officer mods if you get party crashers during your training its all the better6 as we now have a new currency system in the game give it some function beside looks smiles add the ability for a small cost to modify your skills so you can flyequip normally unavailable stuff in this simulation of eve pvp while resting in your quarters drinking a cold drinkto all you low sec plays just think of it this way the care bears in empire can practice some pvp first so you may get more customers for the now braver empire players i know pvp is not even i just like to be in the 20 ship fleet finding the 5 ship fleet
people will shout this down dont forget they dont actually want highsec carebears 95 of playerbase to know how to pvp
groaned a bit right when i read this lets get this over with pvp without risk of any sort is a nogo for a good many people as youll soon find out its a principle thing more than that if people could pvp in station against other players at no cost and no risk what reason would they have to actually undock and find real pvpor you could you know actually practice with your corp against your corp oh wait you want to use officer mods why not use them anyways oh you dont want to risk losing them thems the breaks there is a reason they are rare and expensiveso basically pay rl cash to give yourself skills in a simulator that many people are going to be running because they dont want to risk themselves in actual combati dont know where to begin with this one no the actual problem with so many carebears is that they find the idea of risking their ship abhorrentwhat your idea does is give carebears a subworld where they can say that they have pvped without having actually risked anythinghonestly if you want to try some stuff out get your corp to sign up to the test server not only can you test stuff but youll also be helping devs find bugs which i hear they need people to do
theres this thing called sisi you should look into it
no because i consider one of the fundamental principles in the game is that a loss has a meaning ie it hurtsalthough ccp seems to forget that given how easy to make money and obtain resources has become in the last few yearspain is weakness leaving the body
stupid idea is stupidnow that ive gotten that out of my systemgetting paid to run a fake pvp scenario will let the bears get to avoid shedding tears and then they claim they pvped so nogood ideaallow for an ingame recording setup that allows you to watch the playback on your nice inquarters displays this will give fcs the opportunity to rewatch a fleet engagement and established where things went rightwrong and thus formulate after action reports to tweak their fleet standard operation procedures tactics and techniques i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
just what eve needs more micromanagement and logistical nightmaresmost definitely not supported
yes lets go with mob rule and throw darius because were convinced he did a bad thing dont wait for proof dont wait to verify these actions violated nda just give him the boot and nevermind ccps job enforcing csm rules lets just cast a summary vote to determine guiltlets elect op to replace him hes clearly a great candidate
and just remember the buttered side is always the one that hits the floor so lets just get rid of this crap before it creates more stupid i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
nope
id ask for evidence but meh its nothing new in the world of the csm

yo dawg i heard you like eve so we put eve in your eve so you can pvp while you shipspin
this idea is so pointless that it actually hurts
how about you access sisi from your cqyo dog we heard you liked eve so we put eve in your eve so you could
im against the ideal of virtual pvp sisi is an adequate testbed for practicing pvphowever i wouldnt object to a simulator that would let you pit saved fittings against other saved fittings using the players skills the idea would be to test the tank on one ship against the alphadps of another and have minimal controls for each ship in the virtual environmentlets say the ships spawn a set distance apart possibly determined by the player and stationary you can click modules for each and set each one to orbit or approach how you want to maybe put in one or two celestials they can be aligned to but i wouldnt give them the ability to fly free you click go and they autotarget each other while executing any movement or module activation commands edit to be clear youd be able to continue giving commands after starting the simulationin this way a player wouldnt be able to get anything resembling real pvp without the risk but they would be able to test various fits and see their speeds abilities damage and tank in a limited and controlled environment its eft warrioring with more shinypersonally i dont care to see ccp waste effort on such a feature but if they did anything like it this is how id want to see it work singleplayer limited and clinical it should never be a substitute for undocking
this a replay system that would allow you to record a battle and then replay it and even adjust camera angles would be awesome and create some amazing youtube videos there have been great results from valve doing this with their source engine
not supported its hard enough to get logi pilots for an op can you imagine trying to find tanker pilots
quoting grath tears of goons controlling his gameim opposed to this proposalhaving darius in office just perpetuates this drama i will be backing manny and vlade randal for the next ballet dual pane idea click
first off the evidence we have is shakysecondly ccp deals with nda violations pretty severely  and quicklythird it is not our position to remove darius iii as a csm member  it is ccpsand finally if a violation is found it absolutely tarnishes the legitimacy of the whole csm to keep darius iii on boardthe bs about mittani and vile rat leaking info is heresay rumor and completely without evidence this leak by darius iii has shaky evidence but its evidence nonetheless
then why has it not been presented in this thread
low sec love so far has gotten crudoo level 5 missions that are bugged there are still missions to date that cant be completed the target that needs to be destroyed takes 0 damage fw currently is just a place for people with not the load of free time to deal with 00 or just lack experienceits current status is just really a red vs blue system control is almost meaningless o if you get all the systems you get a medal that anyone can get by just joining before the medal procs so what we currently have in low sec is currently buggy or it not full content adding some content and fixing current content in the game would be great
to fix lowsec improve fw the bigger fw the more lowsec will be usedalso lvl 5s were better in highsec now its to dangerous for most people to do them sure they should be easier in lowsec and give more but why make stuff no one can do without such huge risk
greetingsplease add stack all to the assets windowlonger storysome time ago my alliance lost a system or two as i was rather busy that time i did not had time to move my assets i played only seldomly for a few months  until now when i had time to liquify those assets i traveled to the region with intention of setting up some sell orders remotelyso i repackaged everything and found out that instead of having 3000 liquid ozone i had ten stacks of 300 units same applied to modules boosters even spiced wine bottles were all in separate stacks i tried entering the number manually while setting up the order ie changing volume from 300 to 3000 but to no availi would need several hundred of sell ordersat the end the enemy was kind enough to accept a public courier contract from the 00 to 44 while buying the big thingies like ships but i would like to see the improvement small yet useful neverthelessthank you
it would be a pretty nice wis feature if you could access sisi directly from within it and have an arena style function that way
also consider the following being able to get saved recording from another pilot that was involved in the same battle and put it up on the other screen giving you the ability to look at a battle from three angles at once and thus give you a slight bit of clarity into what could have gone rightwrong with an engagement from the standpoint of more than one pilot this would make for some pretty crazy youtube videos but it could also be utilized in a clinical fashion to critique an incident more effectively and allow for future pvp training or actual pvp engagements to be tailored to include contingencies based on prior eventsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
horrible idea 1 this would just generate massive upperhand to defending party owning stations nearby2 i guess everybody would just use slow warp until you really need to use fuel atleast near to objective area3 hauling stuf even in empire would be a real pain docking every now and then takes time4 capital ships5 people would hunt for the fuel hauler only leaving rest of the fleet middle of nowhere for lulz6 rvb is for fun easygoing small ship stuff join 7 manymanymany more reasonsbcbs arent that expensive anyway  fight isnt over in 15 secs
i like the idea of fuel but not as a restrictive measure ships use fuel so i would be more of a fuel bay and a industrial item that could be harvested fuel would be cheap and abundant small isk sink
i second this
i want to know what did he leak
level 5s are still done they are done in carriers and some people get a small command gangs and take them out they are not done very often because missions just cant be done as they are physically impossible to completein terms of making fw bigger would just be bigger blobs that is something ccp is trying to get away from but have been unable to create
made this thread back in april as my take on what would make lowsec worth inhabiting for people from all walks of life problem is that the pirates who currently reside there are generally not interested in competition on even terms and carebears who we want to move there will always lean towards safer space like highsec or the deep blue seas of null makes it a rather hard nut to crack
low sec gets better when there is more to fight over null sec still needs to be a much more profitable place but as a low sec lubber i support any improvements to it so this gets a like from me i used to be optimistic that wiss could be utilized by having some unique npc stations scattered about low sec to encourage people to live there and fight over dominance on a small scale especially pirate locals however that still semms like any chance of that happening is a long long ways away
boosters would need to be changed they are not great for small ship combat some bses can make use of them but the setups for that are solo pvp as for your idea on claiming a system low sec is still empire space just a battle zone between factions so conflicts with eve lore ccp does not really like to change their lore too much it is not a problem with adding to it the fact remains the empire factions still own these systems they are just less secureprotection contracts would really not be worth while due to abuse hey i may go out and sing one of those and kill off the entire fleet that i was guarding thus the contact would be around fleet isk value and if ships were lost its on you thus wont be worth it a valid claim transfers authorizations of all developments pos in said system has to be approved by claimant by way of contracts replaces charters  since pirates are honourable folk a breach of contract voids the claim long cool down or pos is treated as if it ran out of fuelchartersshould pos already be active in a system the owners get one month to come to terms with claimant or above offlining appliesyou can do that right now called taking control of a corp with an anchored posover all i think the idea of improving low sec is a good one just how you went about it would not be the best way i do think some of my ideas are a little off it is just more of getting ccp to buff up low sec
aye getting through to the pebble sized squishy bit inside their thick skulls does seem to be a primary hurdle for all the lobbies  if we are lucky then they take a liking to the concept of iteration and put some permanent staff on it
oki know this has been brought up before it needs to be brought up againthis especially applies to wh space but is relevant to anybody who scans in eve once a site is created its signature id should not change after downtime it is rather irritating to have to scan down the same sites after downtime again and again it is really that simple i am not sure why this hasnt been done already i cant imagine it is that hard for the server to remember the name of a signature id of a site or object in spacethis is just one of those little things thousand papercuts that should be changed
this is on my personal list of annoying things the thousand asspains and ive reminded some people about it
if it is part of the thousand papercuts list then that will make me happy
i support this as well the only thing i could see affecting a signature is if the site was cleared out completely including looted and salvaged and thus would create reason for a new site to spawn elsewherei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
shameless bump for much needed change
1agreed current pos stations are ugly and very difficult to manageas a wh pilot that also lives in a wh i need to point out as well thatthe logistics needed to keep a pos alive are horribleunless you are lucky to live in some c4 which has all the reso

i think its a good idea so long as you dont gain anything from it and dont lose anything either you could basically use it as practice or a testing ground for new fits most people do this already by logging onto sisi i see no difference in putting it into tranquility as a simulation in cqanother thing to consider is giving the cearbears a means to get a taste of pvp without the fear of losing anything might give them an incentive to actually go out and pvp sometime or move to 00 once they are more confident in their skills
hint if the isk goes to another player its not an isk sink
if youre looking for a tiny isk sink ive seen that our wallet has a catagory for gate fees we could just start charging people to jump from system to system or docking fees for npc stationsbut trying to micromanage fuel would only make the entire game lameimagine a spy behind enemy lines cloaked up watching fleet movements and then his tank runs empty and hes left strandedor imagine that fleet engaging another only to realize that not everyone topped off before leaving and suddenly ships have to fall back and gas upheck you could run dry in the middle of a mission and get picked off by the rats you were sent to kill or have your bargeexhumer floating adrift like the asteroids you were mining only moments agopoint being fuel tanks would only further complicate an already overly complicated gameit wouldnt make any aspect of the game more fun and isnt that what games are really about
what would be the best way to fix it would not be the best waypeople have grown to love hs high incomes i would have all 4 lvl agents in low sec00 and remove the good incursions from hs could probably leave them as is they would be over crowded to stop blitzingleaving hs with level 3s and incursions isk scales would be proper again hs being the lowest income hs being second highest and 00 being the best missions would slow down as people would need to fly safer ships and so on and so forththis is no longer an option due to the fact so many people love their hs missions and would make a lot of people rage quit ccp does not want that to happen they are currently feeding to the masses as hs and 00 is the highest populated sections thus get the most attention like whs are still 00 minus the major politics issue there is cannon with eve low sec is still empire space empire space is controlled by the major factions that is why i was saying put the pirate agents in space as they would not be allowed within the stations so really if a major empire lost its station they would want it back and if an empire wanted it back it would be taken back fast with the largest freaking cap fleet ever known to eve thus no player control
what it really comes down to is missions in high sec killed low sec and for years plagued 00 as you could make more isk per hour in high sec and safer than 00 just recently they made 00 near the best profit in the game still in terms of risk vs isk per hour high sec missions are the best way to do it right now what really needs to happen is ccp just needs to remove missions from hs or at least level 4 agents from hs
i want this
supported
as long as its not quick enough to make it impossible for me to see where my target has warped to
the warp effect is quite broken as it is right now so it would be nice to have a new effectseeing as how 90 of the time i dont even see the effect and the camera only shakes when i exit warp for a little bit
alt scouts dont really thin blobs out very much if ccp has enough plexes spawning throughout the 8 regions of fw trhoughout the day it will be easy to spread the other side out i gave an explanation of how this woudl work in resposne to bad messanger make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
well its wormhole lost space and its impossible to go through a wormhole and guess what system youre in just because the suns are in a similar position
edited now that ive thought this and some comments below through some morewith the great news about the infamous logoffski maneuver becoming a thing of the past id like to propose a sister change to how things behave when a ship selfdestructs while it has aggression using the same aggression checks that can be used to determine whether a ship should be able to disappear on logoff it should be possible to prevent someone from denying their enemies a kill they earned when a ship is set to selfdestruct the capacitor is drained its modules are all offlined and its resistances are set to 0 this creates a tangible downside to setting selfdestruct while being attacked if the ship successfully selfdestructs its drop rate is reduced by 50 meaning modules and cargo would have a 25 chance of surviving so theres still an advantage to doing it if you can pull it off a killmail will always be generated with the selfdestructing ship inflicting damage to itself as needed to finish it off option insurance payments could be reduced or removed entirely for selfdestructing this might be limited to doing so while there is an aggression timer on the ship
arent killmails already granted if a ship takes a certain level of damage before its selfdestructedabandoned
ive seen ships selfdestruct well into structure and not generate a killmail
in my mind self destructing a ship should destroy all mods drones and cargo a ship has essentially denying the spoils of war to the victors while still generating a killmail in reality its just a metagaming tactic that people use to spite their enemies because of this mechanic ive missed out on a quite a few capital killmails including a rorqual and archon this weekend so i feel your pain however id prefer ccp focus on other game tweaks
do you really expect new and rookie players will go to low sec to be blown up just for the lulz at the gate  tell me honestly would you help newcomers to learn the ropes  i am sure you wouldnt as you only want kills without any riskyou have scared almost everybody away and now wondering why nobody is going therei dont suffer from insanity i enjoy it 
do you even think rookie pilots dont do lvov 4 and it takes them a few months to fly a bs right they would be left with lvl 123 and that is plenty of income at that amount of experience in the game vs the risklike said before too many current players would rage and ccp is after growing the games pop so the mission thing would be last on their list even though it would be the best solution to the 00 income issue and low sec as he there is little to no risk and u can make 60m a hour atm counting loot and salvage ontop of bountyso really your response is a troll or idiots idea because lvl 4 would no longer be rookie and by the time they can do a lvl 4 in the current game they would be paying anyway so they would have to learn the ropes before doing low sec missionseditthis would also force people to use rookies as scouts to help out with lvl 4s so you dont loose your bs that infraction would teach them a lot about the game giving them pvo experience as missions would be done in groups for safety and intelligence of friendly mission corps would go up unless you elaborate i dont see a down fall besides some pissed vets that cant do their lvl in such a safe environment
to be honest just having a consistently working warp effect would be enough for me
i couldnt stand by and let this thread die so this is the continuation of the thousand papercuts project created by akita t on the old forums akita t did an excellent job of organizing the eve community in creating this list of minor annoyances involved in everyday eve gameplay original message below
when my ship goes into warp it should be an impressive sight especially when we are moving many times the speed of light that would be one heck of a light show i can warp through solid objects in a very unimpressive unrealistic manner that includes accelerating through a station doesnt that equal explosion this is one of the first things a nonsubscribing friend will mention when i show them the game missile bays need the same attention given to turrets currently all missiles fly out of the center of a ship and ram into the center of another ship resulting in an unrealistic explosion bouncing off of things in space is not harmless never been there for real but just a guess and would result in damage one way or another missed shots from guns and missiles still visually hit their target poor shots still hit dead center maybe some visual misses and grazes would be sweet effects grouped missile launchers fire in one giant blob cluster pattern or missiles flying from multiple tubes would look much better turrets and missiles only hit one focused point on the ship and theres no big gratifying explosion when it happens ships should visually take damage whether its an attack to shields or armor it should look like the ship is being damaged parts flying off etc
ive got another one some ships especially cap ships require skills that are also required by their prereqs it would be nice if redundant skill requirements could be removed examplesacapital industrial ships requires advanced spaceship command 5 and capital ships 2 which requires asc 5 alsocarriers and dreads require capital ships 1 and racial carrierdread which requires cap ships 13its not a huge thing but its a little pet peve of mine that id like to see fixed
1 especially annoying for wh pilots and explorers in general because the ids also change whenever the server derps which can be frustratingly common after an expansionpatch
i guess what i dont understand is if eve can remember a ship name and its last location when it logged out then why cant it do the same for a site unless ccp is deliberately making the sites change ids so that we have to rescan them down every day even though they dont change locations or anything if this is the case then it is just annoyingit does not contribute anything to the gameplay except maybe some scanning practice for new pilots other than that its just an irritating nuisance please changefix it ccp
as someone who has played this game for a long time i have finally run out of clones i have infomorph psychology 5 all clones used with crystals snakes slaves 5s 4s 3s and i need morei live in 00 mostly but have some toys and good clones spread out in lowsec if i want to get away from the sov war and go kill some stuff for a few days with some fiends however now that i only have one cheap clone i cannot really go to other 00s as all my clones apart form my 3s are worth 500 millwhat i would like to propose is an advanced infomorph psychology skill allowing another clone per skill leveli cannot think of anything game breaking this would cause just give us people with lots of good clones the opportunity to go pew pew else where without having to my cheap clone 3040 s to do it
this is the whole reason that this idea is made of fail because to a carebear the idea of pvp or losing a ship is completely reprehensible hence the reason they are carebears they dont want to get a taste of pvp they dont want to look at pvp they dont want to hear about pvp and the sad part is they think that this game solely revolves around themi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
that alone hardly makes it a fail idea i see plenty of pros to this ideabiggest of all being able to test fits in a safe simulated environment other than sisi before using it in pvp
thats actually the problem because its safe it will eventually come to replace casual pvp why is this well why would you go out and try to find pvp and risk your actual ship when you can do the same thing in a simulation
why go out and risk your ship when you can just log onto sisi and do the same thing there with no risk instead see same damned thing and just about everybody with a brain already does this
only if it carries the risk of being easier to kill during the destruction timer perhaps with a better drop rate if it doesnt complete the self destruct im mostly bringing this up now as the logoffski nerf is going to increase the use of selfdestruct i think for the sole purpose of spiting enemies and thats something that needs to be removed if nothing else it is completely unrealistic were being attacked quick blow up the ship before they doalso i forgot to include the idea of denying insurance payouts for selfdestructed ships again its sort of a mixandmatch affair not every idea is needed to make this better
u mad bronot supported and km should be removed
simple solutionremove kill mailsno killmailsno zomg he denied me killmail ban him or fix ithe died you can loot his ship that is what matters not the such and such killed such and such in a blob

erm noi guessing prople do this to you all the time if u want to get the km from a ship that is self destructing then bring more firepowerdont wine about it needing a fix on the forumsfyi killmails are for epeen only and if you constantly need to prove that you have one that you probably wanna try a different mmothe loot is where its at bronot supopted
id go for the removal of killmails as well i think we can agree thats very unlikely given the broad use of killboardsas the game is right now killmails are part of how ingame success is determined so long as they are available as something people can track they should be accurate
ccp there are too many corporations lead by newbs taking other newbs into the typical missionmining grind of death i can tell you when i was a newb i joined a newb corp because they were newb like me set a limit to must be 3 months or older chars for corp ceation and remove the pointless corpalliance skills you for some strange reason still have raise the average enjoyment levels for new pilots  customer satisfaction  profit  winnig
im not sure that taking freedom away from players is the answer a better solution may be to provide more opportunities for established corporations to recruit right now the 3 main tools are the recruitment channel station ads and the eve corp recruitment forum how many new players look at these sources of info in their first few daysweeks does the npe point them in this direction or simply encourage them to find a corp is there a way to educate new players on how to find decent corporations or is this a sinkorswim process that new players are expected to go through to learn on their own
some times ned to take freedoma away abit to make tings beter i tink even a year wuld be good start to creat a corp some where was writen that 7 month for eve player is critical age then he disides realy if he wil play or not that minimum need to be after that age to not ruin fun for ader ppl if ceo disides quit eve
i dont see how this would be taking a freedom away from players they can still join a corp right away all this does is change the current reqs in game for corp creation that will have a positive impact on the overall player experince
honestly i dont think that this is a good idea at all because for a player to learn how to be a good ceo theyre going to have to fall flat on their  at least once so if they have the epic fail corp to end all epic fail corps in the beginning and they learn from their mistakes it will in the longrun show them how to be better at what it is they doexperience is the best teacher let the noobs have their corpsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
want more people to join easy 0 tax and free ship replacement mods benefits etc funded by you thats the people youre competing with you get what you give
name one that does this
your argument good but your missing the point of the customer satisfaction of the game do you think he will be satisfied by running his face into the floor then a greifer curb stomp him i doubt it and i doubt it would have any positive impact on the sub rate remember these new guys got that cliff of a learning curve to climb whats wrong with giving them a little safty line
you just invalidated your own point griefers are going to come up and curb stomp noobs anyway why its part of what they do thats why theyre griefersnow as far as customer satisfaction goes i think a customer would be less satisfied with not being able to do something not because they dont have the skills but because they havent been around long enough so basically your line of thinking take freedom from the customer and they will be more satisfiedthis is new eden mate there are no guarantees of safety anywhere you go just increased levels of safety but no absolute safety unless you just dont undock and the quicker players learn that the less qqing there will be about stupid  that happened because someone put themself in a situation to be a victim or because some griefing hole got bored and wanted to ruin someones dayi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
all these points are invalid the only way to make my idea into a theory is by having the numbers which i cannot supplybasicly will limiting corp creation to 3 months increase the average  of pilots in a corp and will that  have a direct effect on customer satisfaction s will defeat all bias on this subjectthough if you are so upset about being free from ccp tyrants herding noobs vial limits instead of features such as ingame recruitment adds i would like to hear your ideas
im rather glad my friends and i were able to form a noob corp and do things our own way we learned a lot often the hard wayif anything up the skill requirements on corp management so that its a more significant investment if it took a month to train up to be qualified to be a ceo most people would rather train for something more useful in the short term
can you think of a better way to teach someone how eve works
the ones where your members are going to
when a pilot learns to fly a bs properly to do highsec level 4s they still know nothing of pvp
super chair i agree that newbies would probably end up loosing their ship ialso see where ragneir is coming from its perry much would make someone learn about pvp in order to do lvl 4s would also force coordination between players to not loose ships or a new way to go about doing missions solo i use to do fe missions after the nerf you could fly safely 13 jumps with a covert scout in no time most missions are just 12 jumps
im one of those people that should be moving into low sec ive easily out grown high sec and need something different however low sec in its current form is just completely unappealing im going to make a broad statement which will probably be flamed but its how many if not most high sec players think but flying in low sec is suicide you cant run missions because your bound to be shot up you cant mine because your bound to be shot up you cant haul because your bound to be shot up the problem low sec has is that the people that currently play there shoot anything that flys there and nobody else feels any desire to be involved in that if you want more people in low sec there has to be some sort of protection offered to people wer not all willing to lose ships to gate camps because its awesome fun my idea was always that as low sec is empire space the empires should be policing it isnt that just common sense but they should only be policing it for people with a good standing with that faction ie if your in minmatar low sec and have a negative standing to the minmatar republic the republic fleet wont come save you i dont know it was just my idea anything to get away from the freeforall thats its perceived is going on at the moment
all i really can say to you is learn to fly low sec is not as dangerous as you described and i have done fe with loosing some small things in missions due to people beating me to the beacon but any can warp to your mission in fe doing lvl 4s and 5s on the other hand i have never lost a ship in lowsec due to missions
that may be so but what ive told you is the perception most people have and being told by people that live in low space thats its actually not that bad is the equivilant of the shark saying come on in the waters fineeveryone knows low sec needs love it should be the natural progression from high sec not skipped and straight into null but its not because rightly or wrongly the perception is that its too dangerous and so far ive only had that proven to be correct let me put it like this right now if i wanted to mine i have to choices i can stay in high sec mine less valuable ore from now until the server shuts down tomorrow morning or i can go to low sec mine more valuable ore but chances are that sometime today probably within the first hour ill be attacked and ill have to stop mining probably having lost a mining barge or if i was really dumb a hulk at that point ive been forced into pvp which for whatever reason i dont feel like doing so i log off and play something else or explore the outside world or mine in high sec net result is that im still not in low sec there are all sorts of things that could be done to entice more people into low sec but none of them will work if people still think that they cant do what they want to do there with relative ease surely the place for freeforall combat is npc null sec outside the reaches of empire totally lawless keeps with the theory of the further from highsec the more dangerous space is just makes sense to me
as for mining its not worth it at all ore gayle difference is so small its not worth the time you would loose due to hostile pilots also an intercepter can warp to you and point you in a belt before you can enter warp if he is lucky npc null i only would do theirs if i was in one of the pvp alliances for use of their intelligence channelsalso i dont live in low sec im in null i real high sec is broken in terms of the risk and to scale of income is also broken it use to be high sec being the lowest than low finally null being the bestin that term low is broken its something i no longer bother with due to how dumb it has become due to it dieing off when high sec missions came about low sec quickly lost its meaning high sec still can beat most null due to missions and incursions beat about all null but for null incursionsedityou can use a slavager alt to scout the gates problem solved you loose a t1 fitted destoryer gate camps are easy to avoid just scout the dumb thing and just take a diffrent route that means you make need to make an extra jump or to to get around
i support either option
isnt that the one where they send noobs through lowsec to be smartbombed after tyrannis mission load unbalancingccp tried to nerf border highsec agents by making them more likely to send carebears to lowsec noob agent ended up doing what they wanted too so instead of fixing what they broke by reversing tyrannis mission nerf they removed the mission ingenious
no i think the mission youre referring to was in one of the career agents 10 part mission series which was later changed the old tutorial agents 2 part mission series didnt involve much travel part 1 was an encounter in the same system as the agent part 2 was a courier to the system next doorall of those agents were located in either 10 or 09 high security systems most were deadend systems none of them ever had any low security systems enroute as i stated in the original post ccp has replaced those agents with the new tutorial aura npe which doesnt give any faction standing increase dmc

i love this ideai think that the warp effects during warp need a little improvement too i know this because i very much hate the current warp effects and the first thing that a friend tells me when i want to show them eve is man you just flew right through that station and that planet the effects kinda suck in this game dont theyi found this video to illustrate what fasterthanlight travel would look from the inside

thanks dont forget to spread the word get your corp involved check in and post regularlythere are many little things that anyone can do to help support our cause  the key is remaining active
asteroid belts are very low detail a bunch of rocks floating in space my vision of an asteroid belt is something scary and full of debris warping through objects as stated above is sacrificing realism my windows change positions sometimes when undocking fleet broadcasts dont make a sound when made i often miss broadcasts
one of my biggest daily annoyanceswhen swapping laser crystals the used option uses new crystals resulting in a pile of barelyused crystals if you keep a spare set in your ship this used to work properly and changed with incursion i think and has never been fixedexamplei have 12 scorch crystals and 6 in multis in my cargo i load scorch shoot something load multis shoot something then choose to load scorch m used it loads the unused scorch crystals leaving me with two partiallyused sets of crystals in the long term this can result in the system mixing and matching crystals so that you shatter some of the stack and your guns wont fire even though the group shows to have ammo loaded
they should also do more to visually alert those of us who play with the game audio muted or on low volume right now you have to be actively looking for a broadcast which conflicts with my definition of the term broadcast
yes but if bumping does damage it would have to give aggression and trigger concord responses imagine the number of concord actions on the jita undock or in an ice field when an orca lands in the right spot while the chaos would be a great show this isnt a practical idea
the whole bumping thing would have to be changed for it to work i personally think that if you warp into a gate at full speed its going to hurt bad i think bumping shouldnt happen at all although a ship that destroys its targets by mauling it to death would be cool why are guns and missiles the only weapon ramming speed but anyway yeah i think if you warp to something you shouldnt bounce off of it unharmed it just doesnt make sensei also thought of the following when the rorqual transforms during industrial mode it is awesome i want the same for siege mode and triage mode the sun should be bigger also warping to it would be bad entering the suns corona would be deadly right
having a way to save overview settings and share them with the corp like the corp fittings would be greatsending voice in mail would be coolhaving a better system for trading bookmarks and doing it remotely maybe add something to the people and places window or at the very least make it easier for a corp to trade them inside their rented office and poscorp owned pi with grantable roles for collections and management of themmy little things are probably a bit of work for ccp sorry boys but you got to admit that it they would be pimp and not unbalance the system
you can already do that if you export the overview and you know where you saved them to you can send them the xml file or upload it somewhere and provide a link an ingame method wouldnt be bad either thougheven more than that i would like to be able to imexport my windows positionssizescolors i hate having to backup the games files and manually overwrite them to keep everything from being reset when i reformat my machine or install on a new machine and if you need to delete the local data those are completely gone anyways just give us a nice json file with window information or something its not that hard
im talking about getting an ingame method to save time and energy it would be nice if you got a new computer to be able bring up the settings without dealing with backing everything up and playing the upload game
i tend to like listening to music while playing eve and ive created a custom playlist for just that purpose accordingly i really wish that eve didnt automatically switch to a preselected track from the default soundtrack whenever you go through an acceleration gate or at least that thats a feature you could manually disable since the transition is particularly jarringi wish that probe launchers would autorepeat since you need four probes to be able to do anything worthwhile anyway and having to wait to reactivate the thing on each cycle is somewhat annoyingi really wish that mining lasers would automatically deactivate when the asteroid in question is depleted i really really wish that theyd do so automatically as soon as they reach the point in their cycle on which the asteroid would automatically deplete if you deactivated them anyway in fact its just that kind of annoyance that led me to sell my hulk and be done with the businessi wish that the process of retasking 19 advanced industry facilities to use a different schematic could be streamlined a bit theres an obscene and rsiinducing number of clicks required to do thati especially wish that the most useless of these clicks be removed the launchpads storage section should not autominimize after each routing having it vanish each time youre finished using it forcing you to wait a second for it to go away completely and then reclick it to bring it up again forcing another second of wait fiftyseven times is the most rageinducing part of an already lengthy process and one which happens for no reason
1  probe launcher not actually cycling2  better epic warp effect needed3  missiles not launching in clusters when more than 1 missile is shot just keep them as one body for the game to handle but change the graphic4  asteroid belts only vary between a few set formats and never look as large as one should be going off into the distance5  better wrecks and debris arent produced when things of all sizes blow up just a generic wreck shows up6  user interface needs much work see
1 i wanna blow up asteroids it would be so much more fun if i could swoop in and shoot the rock my buddy is mining when i know he is afk2 i want some amazingly cool warp effects im goin the freakin speed of light3 why do turrets get to have all the cool effects and their shots arent grouped into one cluster do the same for missiles
this is my current beef with evestatic annom and sig ids stop changing them on downtime
i used to take screenshot of id after dt when i was able to be online at this time but a little server crash and you did that for nothingthe probes change made basic scanning checking type not going to 100 even more long so at least give us this little thing
1they stay in the same places the wormholes connect to the same systems and retain their mass limits yet the ids get shuffledthis definitely needs to be fixed soon good to see a csm backing it
this is a perfect point to why the current system does not make sense i dont suppose we have any chance of input from a dev as to why it is this way difficult code or intentionalwould be nice to know and see ccps stance on the matter
considering were in the csm assembly hall i really doubt a ccp dev will comment on this thread that said i havent had experience with the phenomena listed above but it seems like a slight quality of life change for wh explorers supported1UFFFDUFFFDno man ever understands quite his own artful dodges to escape from the grim shadow of selfknowledgeUFFFD  joseph conrad
so if you scan down a site before dt and stay in system you suddenly have no idea youre still in the same system after dt and its impossible to identify a system when suns planets and moons all match up to what they used to be
whathave you ever even been in a wormhole really lets let the common sense monster out of its cage on this one since you seem to be scared of it when you scan something down in a wormhole you bookmark it then you open up people and places and while holding shift click and drag to your cargo hold then take that item and put it in the corporate hangar where anyone can get it best part name your exit wh exit or c3  c2 then rinse repeat as necessary1
the j tag which identifies the wormhole stays the same so this has no bearing whatsoever
wowyou fell off the boat there bud this isnt just regarding whs themselvesthis goes for annoms and sigs in general read this thread againthink about it a bit and try again you arent even on the same page here
and you missed my point genius bookmark your sigs and you wont have to rescan them heres a floatie the boat left before you showed up
your point is irrelevant since you have completely missed the point to this thread to begin with everybody as well as myself are aware that you can bookmark sites and whs the point is having to rescan them to update your list of sites and whs when they do change new ones pop upwhs collapse and respawn this gets ever more complicated when you have a chain of whs you might use for one purpose or another and you go through downtime seems to me that the common sense monster ate your brain before you released it
this would also be a great chance to not only balance poss but fix the issue with thier size they need to be way bigger than they are now the size currently just looks silly you can store a capital ship in that wtf of course this also goes for actual stations as well i know a while back ccp made them biggerbut not big enough bigger  bigger
hello allfirst off im very very happy with the new font change might need some resizing im told differentiation between numbers and letters but i think the needs a lot of work tooa should be1  functional2  convenient 3  intuitive4  aesthetically pleasing5  customizablethe interface we currently have supplies 1 and 5 and 5 only by dint of the limited modular design i think ccp should go for 1  5 to make our interface not just functional but easy to use convenient for handling the myriad of tasks an eve player does on a daily basis intuitive so a new player can easily get a grasp on it pleasing to the eye to allow us to really show off our game and customizable to the extent of making it our interfacea friend of mine recently started and he of course commented that it was microsoft excel in space lets push for not just a font change but a ui redesignps while theyre at it reorganizing useful information to be available at a moments notice in a good format would be nice for such things as basic weapon info there are so many things which could use a redesign to make them easierconvenient i dont feel like listing them  feel free to do so yourselfUFFFDUFFFDno man ever understands quite his own artful dodges to escape from the grim shadow of selfknowledgeUFFFD  joseph conrad
the should also react properly too i dont know how many times i have clicked on a ship in space and it did nothing at all click on a ship i have targeted to change targets andnothing the ui does need a rework and i recall there was a change coming at one point but it was pushed back and buriedwhat happened to it where is the neocom change that was about to release a year ago
anything that gives you the chance to play the game how you want without effecting other people should be supported imho especially when its this simple to implement
you need more than 5 clones thats a loti dont see a particular need why this should not be although its getting pretty excessive i also wouldnt mind a skill to reduce the jc timer somewhere between 515  level
yeh i mean why not
sure
informorph psychology and  clones were not meant to store implants that is just a side affect of having clones and implants in the game  clones were meant so people were able to move to different locations that were significantly distant like the far end of 00 to some place like high sec or low sec or the other side of 00 more rapidly encase they were need for something or wanted to participate in something like a large important fleet engagement not to store implants that is why they are called UFFFD clonesUFFFD not UFFFDimplant storage clonesUFFFD
hey ccp you want to get us to start using aurum we want a way to use it that allows us to show off the stuff we buy with it that also doesnt give an ingame advantage this can kill two birds with one stoneallow us to use aurum for ship alterations not anything that affects performance just appearance allow some alternate skins for certain ship types allow us to change the colors on ships or to add a corp logoother approved logos to the side of our shipseveryone wins ccp gets people using aurum people get to customize in a way that will actually be visible to others no effect on the game performancewise or on the economy plus it brings the focus back to flying in space
i like the idea because it would help players personalize their ship it would also help create a feeling of pride in your corpalliance since you could have their symbol plastered all over your ship and it would allow those people who have the isk in eve to put even more into ships which can be lost perhaps if an alliance pays a set cost or a set cost per month it could give everyone in the alliance the option to have that ship skin  allowing for a really unique sense when you hang with your buds from other corps in the alliancea few things to consider however the ship skin should be destroyed with the ship and it should probably function the same as rigs and be destroyed if the ship is repackaged1UFFFDUFFFDno man ever understands quite his own artful dodges to escape from the grim shadow of selfknowledgeUFFFD  joseph conrad
with the current arum pricesselling painted cnr 55bil
then no one would buy them and it would be another useless featuredestructible vanity items would mean that fewer people would use them
they need to allow me to buy better ammo with aurumjust me
because in sisi there is no functioning economy you cant really make isk you dont really buy anything you cant really lose anything it is subject to resets and tinkering by gmsdevs the gameplay and effects caused over there are divorced from what happens in tqsisi is at its heart a test server for gmsdevs to play around with eve code the fact that you can also play with ships fittings and tactics over there is a perk nothing more
thanks for making my point because what would a simulator be ive already said i would only support it if there was no gain or loss either way but i suppose you just glazed over that part right
i see where the op is going with thishey ccp where are those minigames you promised with incarna dont think i forgot that fanfest from that time where you demoed that board game i want that i want to play a game in your game perferably about playing yet another game like chess checkers spades hearts 21 blackjack poker texas hold em go othello risk  pokemon fire red
the thing you have to ask yourself is do you really want to tie up ccp programing resources for something that already exists i dont know about the rest of you but if i want to simulate anything i log on to sisi with a buddy test my fitting or whatever then bounce back to eve i would rather see see them do some real improvements to the game and not some stupid  so carebears can hide instationyou are flying a spaceship on the internet if going to do pvp then do pvp if you pvp you are going to lose its going to happen you are an idiot if you think you wont thats part of the fun though being able to lose thats why you work to reduce your loss expensive ships have an edge but there is more risk involved so cheap fit a ship grab some friends and go bust up a gate camp or you can program a simulator for us and leave a link here because you are not taking ccps time to do thisdude i heard you liked eve so we simulated eve on your eveedit yeah if you are going to put something in station make it a card game that you can wager isk for id be down to hang at the in station bar dropping some isk with some mates
and just who exactly are you to be deciding what ccp does with thier time
just one guy thats saying whats on my mind if ccp thinks that making a combat testing program and inserting it into cq is a great idea and they should drop everything and do that then so be it i would however like to point out again that sisi is a great way to test out ship fits and simulated pvp and that is basically what this op wants they have enough other content to fix andor improve without having to put resources into something that already exists
even in real life warfare self destruction is a viable option to remove the possibility of war material falling into enemy hands so i think blowing up ones own ship in the face of inevitable ship loss should remain a possible outcome as well if the enemies are too slow to bring down a ship in the alotted time they arent entitled to the spoilsso i thinkself destruct should reduce the probability of modules surviving even further maybe even taking a klingonesque approach to the situation if we need to blow up ourselves do it with a bang that is painful to everyone nearby as well those who know good ol vgaplanets might recognize what im thinking about i dont care about killmails never read them never post any though what i do care is that when i lose my ship others shouldnt get anything from itand yes before you ask when im doing missions in highsec im not above blowing up my own wrecks as soon as a ninja salvager shows himself if i cant loot them nobody else should be able to
km whoring ruins this game logi are crippled by itthe need to km whore to prove you were in a fight save people and it leads people into  concepts like the idea that a self destructed ship somehow isnt a loss for your enemy by being a km whore you are losing fights that you would have won if you had stood back and said yeah they are dead because they are getting your tears over them losing a expensive shipwhile the isk war is important its led people into forgetting that the winner of a fight is he who achieve his objectives even if he lost 3 times the isk worth of ships you get tiny alliances claiming they won because the alliance could only field a fleet with less than a single of the aggressors ships but managed to get 1 lucky killno no killmails for self destructing please no more killmails at allbring sanity back to how the victor of a fight is decided and quit penalizing the force multipliers who dont actually shoot anyone while they make the difference between victory and lossps can we have a new reporting category for fundamentally  ops so as to have the posts removed instead of having to write up a wall of text refuting them
translating ops postpeople play game differntly then me they should not be able to do this so dont let newer players make corps cause i think thats how it should be with no proof it would help the game
thats not a translation you are just describing in your own words what i said  sigh i guess i see why ccp doesnt like to listen to its players sometimes the lack of critical thinking is shocking
noobs should all be channeled into my high tax corp and be my slaves game mechanics should be changed for this purpose this will definitely happen
your critical thinking skills certainly tell us muchsuch as assuming you posting here is going to make ccp answersuch as assuming your speaking for everyone bullseems like your making a lot of assumptions over a whine over nothing stop the evemail spam
no its your words plain and simple you think new players should not be aloud to make a corp why because you think that it leads to something that you do not like some people like miningsome people like missioningjust because you dont doesnt mean rules should change to accommodate your thinking
point i like the way things are right now just thought of an idea that could improve the game exerperience for newer playerssome people do like to mine others like to mission yes i wasnt taking these options away from anyone or limiting what activities they can and cant do you dont even need to be in a corp to do any of these in fact all ccp would need to do is alter the training time for corp managment skills to something stupidly long and say they are not taking anything away from youlol accomodate my thinking
shhh dont tell anyone my master plan 
someone else brought up dscan in another thread posting here that dscan needs some love my suggestion is to make it a cone or wedge in the solar system map so that we can see exactly where its pointed and where its range stops give it left and right arrow controls to manually adjust it look this direction and scan doesnt really seem to have the precision i would expect out of a space shipbut dont take away the current method of dscanning just add in the ss map support
yesthis was a topic of conversation as to if local were to be removed from nullsec than dscan would need some major love and improvement remove the clickfest that is dscan make it autoscan and improve the scanning process of dscan
i saidshameless bump stupid new forumsalways hungry and eating my posts
its an annoyance that the ids change after downtimeand really there is no reason for it as the site itself retains everything about itexample today you scan a grav and mine the ark tomorrow when you warp to it the ark is still gone and the bistot remains100 agree  the sigid should not change
you forgot something mr geniussignatures of sites change regardless of whether you bookmarked them or notand you have to filter out the ones that are already bookmarked from the ones that arent when scanning for new ones amogst the old onesso this is still a bit of a annoyancein other wordsyour both rightand your both wrongin shorta simple solution is to keep sites that have not changed to stick with the original signature until they expiresimple stop the evemail spam
pretty sure sigs and annoms appear in high sec i see plenty of people scanning in high sec all the time for all sorts of stuff so this issue effects them too
and my point is valid in any security systemdont believe me look it up your self and try itim sure any whs guru will also vouch for this as welltrolling quote removed zymurgist stop the evemail spam

good eveningas you probably know about two times per month ccp qa team is hosting a so called mass test on the singularity test server in order to try out new stuff optimize old stuff etc as the thinclient ccp uses to conduct testing internally can not catch everything please see mass testing on wiki for more informationas a reward for participating in the test players are awarded 2 milion skillpoints on singularity to allocate however they wantbut i do believe that these fellow capsuleers who sacrifice their own time to help our benefactors in the everlasting quest of improving eve deserve a little bit moretherefore i proposeaward mass test participants unallocated skillpoints on tranquilityas 2 milion sp would be unbalancing and crashing sisi i suggest 10 to 20 thousand  approximately five to ten hours worth of trainingit is small enough a boost to envy while at the same time showing some solid gratitude to the volunteerssomething similar could be applied to those finding a bug and submiting a good bugreport  please see this sticky thread awarding the first dozen or so people that report that particular bug as to prevent abusive spammingimportantly this would probably bring even more players to the tests allowing the qa team to gather more dataif i recall correctly on the 1102011 mass test ccp asked for 500 players while only 350 came  testing results on wikii am looking foward to your comments opinions and bumps

would be game breaking gtfo of here with your idea stupid idea is stupidi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
for once he has the right idea good job draconis you use those two brain cellsbut back to the main issue this would give a very unbalanced advantaged to people that pay attention to their calenderhave other things to dodont care while they should get some shiny toy from ccp for slaving over a game this shiny toy should be worthless like a shiny mug for their cq or something d
disagree with the opinions posted thus far a small amount hours worth of sp given out on no more then a monthly basis to people who actually help out ccp on important issues would not at all be out of place i support the op
wtb a real comeback with substanceas far as the thread goesi like the idea as long as it isnt more often than they usually do the tests and that perhaps only the first x pilots get it ie they ask for 500 and 700 show up only the first 500 get the bonus  xor the bonus is a set amount of sp split among the participants

you sir sound like a  if clones were not meant to store implants then please tell me why they have for as long as i have played this games 4 years  if i wish to go pew pew 40 s away pls tell me why i should auto pilot when i dont have freecheap clones anymorreps troll moar
i dont need to explain it to you the answer is in my post if you have reading comprehension problems then there is nothing i can do for youby the way my previous post was not a troll this what a troll post looks like
rule of eve design intent comes secondary to player usage if people are using clones to store implant sets either to allow them a menu of implant bonuses to choose from or simply to keep their expensive stuff safe for pvp then thats actually part of what theyre foraccordingly it wouldnt at all be unreasonable to have extra skills out there to improve on the use of jcsof course since having five jcs floating around with full sets of faction implants is an expensive hobby expect an expensive skill with long training time
i actually like this idea1
as far as the destructible paint job is concerned maybe its something that is tied to the account of the individual who purchased the skin they can skin as many ships as they want but you can sell the ship to someone else with the skin still on it that way if someone wants one they wouldnt necessarily have to pay for it in aur but would have to deal that if they lost that ship that they wouldnt be able to repaint their next ship it would had another element to the economy but that could also be a terrible idea where it just turns into who paid for the skin packs off the nexthey are rich now i definitely agree that they need to have ship mods in the nex but implementation is going to be the harder thing and choosing which direction to take italso 1

the aggressed logging changes makes me hesitate the simplicy of it is good but the implications are bad the 15 min timer was introduced because ccp acknowledged that computer problems happen and you are sometimes unintentionally disconnected in battle the 15 min timer was there to ensure youd die if you were going to die supercaps have such large ehp that they broke this rule now there is the expectation that supers who would not normally have died will die as a result ie a super is aggressed attacking a tower in an empty system he dcs and warps off aggressed a lone helios comes in scans him down and keeps him aggressed for 4hrs until his friends get home from work to come kill it this breaks the intention of the original rule in the opposite directionthe proposed halfway point on this much more closely mimics the original spirit of the rulestandard 15 min aggression logoff timers for all ships can make it 30 for supers if you want and then only give the infinitely repeating aggression that holds the ship in game if the ship is superpointed or bubbled if a super isnt pointed or held down within 1530 minutes after logging there is no reasonable assumption that the ship would have normally died otherwise
your missing the pointthe point of the change is to prevent people from escapaing by pulling the plug on the interent connectionmainly this is a massive debate thats been going on for yearsyou cannot and will not be able to prove if that person was disconnected or just pulling the plug to save his precious shipsc or notnot supporting stop the evemail spam
i never differentiated between legit and illegit disconnects it doesnt matter if you cannot catch pointbubble or kill a super in a full 30 minutes after its signed off then you dont deserve the kill regardless im not missing the point the point is that only ships that were going to die if they hadnt dcd should die this is about fairness all the major engagements where an entire side mass logged to avoid death will all still die under this proposed change all lowsec hotdrops that go south and the super logs to avoid dying will die as a result
reasonable point is reasonable inclined to agree any force capable of killing an sc should be able to point it heck any force capable of killing ships in general should be able to point itd be entirely reasonable to consider logoffwarp in the same sense as any other warp and require point to counter it
who doesnt get point on a ship theyre trying to kill
supportedwhile i agree that a name change history would be nice  the fact of the matter is that people change over time and names that might have sounded like a good idea no longer do after 23 yearswith a reasonable cost its a valuable service that will more than cover its own expenses
i agree with the missiles grouping thing i think itd be neat to have the missile volley graphic look like as many missiles as are in it since theyre only blips of light that shouldnt be hard to implement also missiles are just blips of light of course viewing them from the rear thats all youre going to see but from the side or fronton you should see a missile heading that bright blip its most noticeable when missiles are fired at you you should see a dark object silhouetted in front of the bright doti miss the old mining sounds when i was in my first week i was mining away when i discovered a mining barge the strip miners seemed to awesome it made me really want to have a mining barge of my own for months every time i got bored i would pull out my mining barge and let the soothing roar of the strip miners lull me to sleep in front of my computer or if i wanted something a bit more gentle the ice miners did nicely great way to make some isk while just passing time and if i ever didnt want to hear them of course i could just zoom the view out till the sound stopped so please bring the old strip miner sounds back
agreed on the new mining lasers not enough umph where the old ones were obviously ripping roids to bits im not sure how to fix bouncing maybe a little more precision to ship movement it can be annoying why cant i sort local by sec status standings and whatever else bombs bomb effects from stealth bombers are boring i expected an explosion and got crap missiles need the attention that turrets got i want to log with an alt without completely logging out of my account modular poss are a great idea dont screw them up and make them dockable some ship models need revisited make that a lot of ship models using 3rd party programs to skill plan works but shouldnt that be ingame warp effects are boring as stated above i believe i want my ship to have a crew i dont want to be so lonely in my space ship ships should have lots of people involved in making them go undocking from station can sometimes leave you inside or colliding with another ship thats just not right either manage undocking better or make it so there arent ships inside of ships when undocking
what if they put more then one undock point on a station like jita 44 could have 4 undock points and it cycles through them so ships arent coming out on top of each other that would also make it harder to be station camped by a couple of guys but it also makes the undock instawarp very difficult that is thinking that the undock points are pointed in different directions but you could probably have them point the same direction on one side you would just have to stack the undock points on each other and the undock instawarp and station camping wouldnt be disrupted
scanning is not brokenthere are plenty of other broken features to worry about fw for one to try to fix something that isnt broken which would only lead to it inevitably being broken dont like scanning just dont do iti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
10
nobody said scanning is broken its a pain in the ass mechanic that ids of sigs and anomalies change for no reason at all other than the game server reset i dont understand why people have to hold such a torch against making such a simple easy change that would better the lives of anybody that uses scanning would you ragequit from eve if this change was made or something
its not that easy is bad its that there is so much more things we need fixed and honestly scanning stuff should be a pain in the ass its a challenge that reaps good rewards one of the few ways this game promotes hard work so leave it be
supported 1down time is for daily backups and server maintenance and should not affect ingame content so signatures should not change until the anomwhwhatever is despawned or goneproc
you offer a valid arguement that is strangei still think that scanning shouldnt be fixed or improved cause its not broken nor does it need improving it functions fine the way it does
thread cleanedplease stay on topic thank you
a lot of people keep talking about scanning just to be clearits got nothing to do with scanningits the signature tags asigned to sites as they spawnthen cycle through every downtimethe proposal kinda jumps all over the place but the solution as i said before is to keep the signatures locked until they cease to exsist or get exhausted by a player running through said signaturein wormhole space you could be in a fresh class 3 or 4 and get anywhere from 25 to 50 signatures on a good dayand from there on you could have 5 to 10 new signatures minimum of 3 on average every 24 hoursand thats not including new spawns during the day that tirgger to say a wh collapseyoud have to take copious notesand bookmarks have to be filed and not just slapped together with a funny namethen coordinate that with an entire team if your living in said wormhole to make sure they dont lose trackyou end up rescanning sites again even if they are bookmarked to eliminate the signatures when they changethat is the frustrationthis is the case for known space not just high sec as some foolish indiidvuals poke fun atthe only difference isyour not going to get tons and tons of signatures every day in known space because tis known spacemore like 5 if your fortiante00 might be more depending on the ihub  upgrades installedfeel free to shed a little light on that 00 gurusscannings fineits the game mechanic tagging signatures on sitesthat should be adjsutedbut not drastically made easierjust less painful stop the evemail spam
thank you drake thats about as simply put as its gonna get if people cant understand that then they are a hopeless cause

i approve of op post
speaking of brain cells not being rubbedall we need is to incite a mob of sp hungry pilots who care nothing but for profit and sps to train skills faster and give ccp inaccurate reports on bugsissues on an already bug riddled gamelike i said hell no stop the evemail spam
skill points no a vanity item like perhaps a singularity jacket sure why not no in game advantage and yet your participation would be duly recognized
thats better reasoning then your first responseeven so a lot of the recent testing has been stuff like mass tests where what is desired is precisely just hundreds of people running around doing stuff with no need for specific reports being filed that kind of thing is precisely where ccp most needs lots of people hanging out and offering sp incentives for that makes perfect senseas for the other thing where ccp needs specific and detailed reports then they might instead offer sp bounties on good reports where good is defined as useful to the devs imbalanced you betcha but itd work and no one but the most dedicated bughunters would get more then a few days of training time out of it and lets face it they probably deserve it
everytime you come up with stupid ideas such as this a kitten dies this is just stealth qq for skillpoints
guys its like 4 hours worth of training its not a huge boost especially of there is only 1 test a month or so its not game breaking at allquality of reports are you  if 350 go they might get 50 reports 10 will mean anythingif 500 go 80 might be sent in and 15 might mean something not to mention more people means the devs themselves can monitor the situationsit couldnt hurt i say make it 2 hours worth of training though basically its like training 2 times as fast while at the mass test
not supportedit was a mistake for ccp to give out skill points out for anything except the removal of the learning skills
never liked kittens anyway
this is why your a terrible person with terrible ideasstill dont supporttoo many exploits could be had from thisgive out mug or something else i can break over a hobos head when they knock on my door
for once i actually agreebetter to award vanity items or some actual real stuff like eve strategic maps or eve online paperback books or some tshirtsgetting an ingame advantage for testing something like crazy is going to pollute the results of those teststhis game is screwed up enough already as it iswe dont need sp hungry pilots making it more jaded than it isi mean id rather see like faction ships or something awarded at least it has valueand that value can be destroyed like everything else in this gamesps are a little more difficult to remove vanity items are harmless for the most part but for the love of all things good lets not make it worse than it already is stop the evemail spam
and as much as i hate to agree with 07 im going to have to  even give the testers some aurum so they can buy something in the nex store i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
vanity items  how then would you encourage people to attend a test or submit a bugreport more than once also i am not sure if people change their appereance often enough and giving out also every pilot in eve is sp hungry  but only a tiny fraction would spend 2 hours just to get something they would get anywayit would still be significantly more timeeffective to run mission and buy better implantspvp with better implants than to attendassuming 2000 sphour i am training 2580hour at the moment by the way and a 30 day month 1 440 000 sp a monthshould a player earn 20 000 sp by testing andor submiting quality bugreports he would be cca 13 percent betteris that really so unbalancing
you have no business asking that question if you dont understand why we are so passionate enough to tell you hell noill give you a ltitle hintsome of us actaully put a little time time into our accounts and dont like it when peolpe are given shortcuts for something that will not have a lasting impact on game in a good waygivnig ccp botched bug reports or showing up for a test evevnt for sps wont be for the bug reprotsit will be for the spsthis is a question of motivationnot goals they wont give a crap about filing reports that is the point let alone showing up to test something that is likely going to be utterly boring or reptitivesingualrity kills dont count after all as an example stop the evemail spam
it will have good impact  as the qa team will have more data leading to better gameas not to spam the reports  thats why i suggested awarding only first dozen or so of quality reports
more data  quality data thats does not equals for those who dont know programming speak stop the evemail spam
i disagree with any proposal that grants sp to any player for any reason outside of current game mechanics the way the time based training and skill queue work is one of the fundamental parts of eve that makes it both different and better than any other game out there any proposal that wants to change this is in my opinion a bad ideawhat about paying players for participating in tests with aur aur seem to be worthless to me anyways and people who participate in the tests could be paid say 500 aurhour for their participation that wouldnt unbalance skill training and they could buy themselves monocles or something if they like
which would equal precisely 2 more than yousoim with draconis on the hell no if they wont give us sp on tranquility for participating in sisi testing why would they give us sp for finding bugs they are already fully aware ofeither way anything that is giving free sp for doing nothing is a bad idea
one of the shortcomings of eve is that corps and alliances are able to quickly mobilize forces to attack or defend through use of titan bridges bridges and clone ing advanced infomorph psycology would finish with 9 or 10 clones with that ability there would be nowhere in eve that a fleet cant rapidly form every npc region in eve could then have a fleet amass attack and if opposition is stiff slip back to safer spots sov warfare would be especially horrendous heres the strategy everyone leave a clone and 2 pvp ships in system xxxx when the time comes to take our space back well hit from front middle and back there would never be a need to destroy that clone you havent needed for a year because you have 8 more 3 of which are in friendly space
not seeing the downside to that one in fact it sounds quite especially awesome i approve with 9 clones total 10 for the fanatics and possibly a skill reducing the duration of clone cooldown tactics like that can actually be implemented which means more toolboxes on hand for fights having the option to use old clones you had lying around to do behind the lines sorts of smallgang pvp instead of just forming up with the blob seems like a major plus instead of a minus
considering that most icemining bots actually work in null sec and not high sec like some might like to make believe i fail to see the point
completely reckless would wreck havoc on all the pos owners who do not have connections in null my wh corp would be paying a tax to the nullsec alliances who would cartel the ice prices again so reckless i cant believe they even put it on the whiteboard its a disaster that even the most clouded mind can forsee
you are mistaking the csm with an ingame alliance dont its stupid
is this the concept ice  00  ice prices cheaper in 00  pos maintenance cheaper in 00  t2 production cheaper in 00  t2 modsships cheaper to 00 dwellers  t2  00 if so please make tag costs associated the purchase of fed navy gear reasonable so i can fit up my vexor navy issue with fed navy gear low sec  faction navy gear
i sayinstead of removing ice from any system we make it available in all systems every system should have at least one ice belt in it including wh space thereeverybody go suck an ice cube and watch the market on pos fuels crashif you can set up a pos in high sec then there should be ice belts in high sec sames goes for low and null wh space is a special case as ccp never intended corps and alliances to live there permanantly like we do now but now i wouldnt mind seeing ice in wh space
toy with a fit with eft test fit in sisi or with a buddy in tq theres your simulated pvpthis adding an eve in my eve would be unnecessary and i really dont want xhibit  his dumb spelling in my spaceship game hopefully this thread dies soon
how do we run ideas by  in case we dont like what the playervoted csm is doing or how they are representing us maybe can put a good word in for an idea with ccp
pity reply
ccp came to the csm for commentary on this change we provided our feedback its not a conspiracy sorry
lmao i never knew eve uni provided unelected csm here i was under the impression that the only csm were the ones we votedor failed to votefor gonna have to remember not to bother to vote since the other csm makes it meaningless
its past time to improve the general pve content in this game its past time to bring wormholeincursion ai to all npc rats1 no this does not mean that npc rats need to be as hard as sansha or sleepers2 npc rats do not need to be buffed in terms of there dps and hp but buffed a lot in terms of thier ai ie all npc frigs now scram and web npc crusiers use ai to remote rep focus fire etc3 ccp does not have to introduce new loot for these changes but can increase unit bounties by a  say 100 increase in bounties to justify the harder experiance that would require at least two pleople working together or dual boxing to complete missions4 this will make the game harder for noobs but not that much harder noobs will benefit more from running level 1 and 2 missions with a friend and thats why its important that the bounties should be at least doubled to reflect the number of people needed to run the improved missions belts exploration sites5 these changes will easily improve eve existing old basic and boring general mission and belt ratting pve content6 these changes are long overdue7 these changes are not hard to make8 noobs will whine a bit but this change provides a small stick to increase thier social interaction which is eves best part9 please make this change soon
this wouldnt affect people that solo pve so theres not much point in this since a fair majority of pve is solo incursions excluded
i agree it would make soling missions much harder you would need to dual box and soloing blet ratting a bit harder however can you honestly say that you enjoy playing with eves current dumb npc ai do you realy like running one mindless mission after another so many other games have much more fun pve content because the npcs you are up against use good ai cant we encourage ccp to provide us with more entertaining npcs
no time and time again no this kills the ability to carry newer players through missions so they getthe hang of it this will also mean drones die a lot more due to target switching
i agree that the change would need to be balanced so that the incrase in dificulty does not put off new players perhaps drone sigs and hp ccould be buffed a bit npc time shooting at player drones could be less than for sleepersansha ai etc perhaps ccp could scale the changes to be less in levels 1 and 2 and 3 but more in levels 4 and up its just that i find the level of quality of the general pve offered in eves belt mission and to a lesser extent in exploration sites to be very sub par when compared to other games out now it would be ok for a fp2 game but i dont think the quality is high enough for a monthly subscription game
i would conditionally support this as a part of a bigger rework of the npc ships fit and behaviora improved aib fits similar to player fits using existing modulesc dropped loot corresponds to npc ship fit if its pointing me with some superdupper 60km point i want this point to have a chance to dropd cap stability speed sensor strength tracking etc same as existing ships ie npc sansha bs spawn has same stats as ordinary nightmaree belt plex and mission spawns scaled down to manageable levels i dont want belt ratters to have to cope with the equivalent of three player flown machariels f npc bounties scaled up to compensate for epain is weakness leaving the body
part of what im also hoping for is for ccp to change empire pve and made it posible for small fleet of manual flying read real player empire pilots say at least 2 in fleet to be able to out earn a bot shipit be great if you could have fun and earn more isk playing harder more complex and more chalenging contentent in empire over a 2 hour stretch than can be earnt by a typical 00 bot that runns 10 hours at a time
all sounds good to me  im also for ending solar system local and only keeping constalation and regional chatbut thats another story
a couple of thoughts 1 the last thing ccp should do at this point in time is increase hisec bounties nullsec anomalies were nerfed because the raw isk flowing into the game was unhealthy what do you think doubling the bounties on all rats will do 2 an improved ai on missions would be nice but nerfing all missions so you can feel like your facing a harder opponent is most definitely not something the majority of eve players want i would think asking for an alternative set of missions with sleeper ai npcs is more appropriate how you will balance this in terms of risk vs reward system security lps and loot is a nontrivial problem but you can leave that to ccp perhaps these missions will be provided by concord agents with the reward balanced via lps i dont care 3 nullsec rats need to scram more
as a nullsec resident i too love this idea i mean who really needs isk in this game to replenish the stuff they lose its bots and empire residents obviously theyre the true consumers in eves economy on a serious note i shouldnt be able to earn quality isk anywhere near my nullsec base theres too much fighting and destruction going on there all serious iskmaking in this games is best left to illegal programs and empire residents
i agree i find much of eves current pve is too repetitive not fun boring and far too easily exploitable by boting boting in 00 side systems already allows some of the games major alliances to finance tens to hundreds of super capitals a year this is the most dangerous isk faucet in eve especialy when coupled to the existing moon goosov system many alliance and corp members will swear on their holy books that this is not the case but recent exposes in gaming news has proven that it is the case the anomaly nerf hit real active players more than it hit bot incomei hope ccp is be able to increase players funinspace while flyinginspace by making player isk generating activities more fun harder more complex more unpredictable and more challenging i would be perfectly happy if ccp removed all plex removed the ability to use  to buy isk and make the gameUFFFDs pve content too unpredictable and too hard to bot is it technically impossible to make eveUFFFDs pve content fun to play while also making it naturally unbotable
1theres absolutly no reason why all high sec missioning has to be soloable this would bring more diversity and challenge to mission grinding
another it wont effect everybody in eve so there is no point response you are proving to be a bit of a drag on these forums this seems to be another simple fix that should be easy for ccp to implement i agree with it any upgrade to the ai of rats would improve the overall game
no to making more isk in 2 hours of highsec than 10 hours of 00making all the rats in l1 and 90 of l2 missions web and scram wutever toadvanced ai for npcai will not make pve more fun it just makes you adjust the shooting orderit will not make it anymore dangerous outside of allowing more time for players to warp in to your location assuming scrams have not been dispatched quickly enough in other words put sleeper ai in place if you want because it doesnt help or hurt everyone should be clear that it wont do what op claims it does however with the exeption of detering noobs from missions until they can fly appropriately skilled ships
after this i dont think any more argument needs to be presentedany change that forces everyone to dual box or form fleets to do one of the most basic activities in eve shouldnt happen it would drive a lot of players away from the game
holy mother of god a proposal thread i actually and completely agree with never thought id see the daybadposter since fooooreeeeevaaaaar i come back after 2 years to this now 4 years apparently
i support name change op has good arguments
yes pls 1 and great idea 
personally i like aur idea i find the idea of spending rl for vanity items repugnant but thats me and whats available isnt worth the isk on the market that being said im one of the people on the fence about showing up for mass tests i keep meaning to but never get around to it sis laucher helped this might actualy tip the balance aur isnt game altering and really its probably the only way id ever end up having enough to buy anything decent
as someone that was part of one of the biggest blobs of the time the nc and now part of the thunderdome i can tell u that noone would clone to save a tower or ihubstation because of one simple fact the 24 hour delay forming a gang to then tell them they are stuck in whatever back end of space for 24 hours would end up with no gang those taking part in sov war are generally engaged in very close proximity to their own space and so do not need to clone  the idea is to allow people to simply have more clone so be able to get away from sov way and go have some fun the other side of eve and 5 clones is not enough any more for many of us that have played this game for a long time
they did add those 4 faction eccm sets i would like to use them but i have only a few clones left and im not sure what set to get make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
the solution to wanting to use more implants is to allow us to remove them with a cost andor some from of penalty like they have a chance to break or something then we would be able to use all the different implants we could want personally i would not mind having more clones but not because i want to store implants but i want to be able to use them for what they were intended for would be nice if there was an advance infomorph psychology skill that would lower the 24 hour timer by 4 or so hours per skill level that would be useful
well it would certainly profit the nullsec empires who are pushing for it but then i guess thats the point of the whole drama isnt itif ccp cant see past the self interested loud squawks for more worms from the nullsec inhabitants who already have the best of everything and realise what a terrible idea removing hs ice is then all hope is lost ps show me the high sec alliances that have corp wallets numbered in the trillions as do the null sec moongooplexingbotting types ie most of them probably excluding fa numbers most likely can be counted on the fingers of one handedit ccp  fix the problem kill the bots that is all
is there a way for ccp to change the existing pve ratting and mining isk model and to make it more immersive and less easily exploitable from bots i would like this to be one of the core focuses of changes to fis i wish is to see ccp focus on making fis funinspace again with more immersive content and the removal if possible of bot friendly grind content i think ccp would need to do more than just move ice from high sec to low sec00 i would like to see ccp work more on the mechanics of mining to try to make it more immersive and not profitable to bot if ccp cant improve mining then perhaps the existing mining system should be removed and all players be given access to a mining bot like ship ccp sent so much effort over the last year and a half on either adding grind to the game via planetvile or adding content that does nothing to increase fis game immersion i hope ccp will now refocus on the games core pve mechanics and pvpsovmoongoo mechanics 
resource gathering is always going to be tedious in some fashion thats been true for every single mmo that ive played over the past decadeand since existing bots can already run missions what makes you think that they wont be able to handle any curve ball thrown by ccp developers ccp needs to do a better job of identifying and banning bots  and make announcements when they do it
this is a very good ideait seems that ice products in eve online are somewhat the equivalent of oilsimilarly ore is the equivalent of steelin many respects eve ought to revolve around these two principle materialsmoving ice to low sec will make it the true rare and desirable material its supposed to bethe economics analysis was also very concise and eye opening however i do not think this will affect the rmtbot population problems which plague this gamebotting is just as easy in lower security space as it is in higher security space

i was reading another proposal for modifying the bounty hunter profession in new eden i think iUFFFDll give this one a try if you donUFFFDt like it no worries forums allow for your opinion toocurrently the bounty hunter profession is broken we know this ccp knows this and god knows this to fix this issue we have to provide means for bounty hunters to conduct their duties now for the best partUFFFD what ifUFFFDbounty hunters could be contracted by concord the way this could work is bounty hunters would have access to the UFFFDwantedUFFFD roster as they can now however could chose to accept contracts and gain kill rights to conduct their operations the cost for this option would be a percentage of the bounty provided to concord as collateral the collateral will only provide rights to the individual paying however they are not limited to soloing other members would have to pay a percentage as well with the percentage increasing as more bounty hunters take the contract ie bounty on UFFFDwanted criminalUFFFD  5000000 isk UFFFD contractkill rights collatoral  2500000 isk this is just an example ccp can figure out an appropriate percentage the reason for the increased increment for the collateral would be to prevent too many people from gaining kill rights cheaply if said bounty hunter had to pay 200 of the bounty to gain kill rights they would be less inclined to pursue that character it isnUFFFDt cost effective after the bounty is taken bounty hunters could be assigned a UFFFDcase workerUFFFD aka dedicated locator agent similar to those logistics characters in console games that feed UFFFDimportant infoUFFFD to the lead character through the game however the information would cost increasing increments as the bounty hunter continues to use the agent essentially the agent could provide continuous updates as long as the bounty hunter is willing to pay the price allowing for the bounty hunter to manage the cost effectiveness of his operationonce the UFFFDwanted criminalUFFFD is killed and a kill mail is generated the money is deposited to the bounty hunter via concord for contract completion if no bounty hunter was on the kill the money is split by the assailants to dissuade people from using alts to pod themselves with alts or make it more difficult one possible solution would be to create skills that must be trained in order to use the bounty hunter profession i donUFFFDt know eve already has a god awful learning curve but i think this would make the bounty hunter profession more fun and  in peopleUFFFDs cheerios so itUFFFDs whateverUFFFD cheers
shows promise and better then most of the bounty hunter ideas ive seen but doesnt really elaborate much on ways to prevent people from podding themselves for cash other then make it a skill which is fairly weak all told it feels more the framework of an idea then an idea itself but itd be hard for anything to be worse then the existing systemi give this proposal 35 stars
this is an awesome proposal that deserves the attention of ccp
for level fours and fives sure maybe some of the tougher lvl 3s but also if they do this the ai should not go after drones it would be a bad thing for gal ships that are rather underused for missions as it isnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
fair points i dont want to see anyone making more isk in 2 hours of highsec than during 10 hours of active non boting 00 pveing what im hoping for is real players being able to more easily outcompete bots this might be possible if ccp offers more isk from more fun and immersive pve content than from the existing pve content which is full of grind is very bot friendly and is mind numbingly boring is there a way for ccp to change the existing pve isk model and to make it more immersive and less easily exploitable from bots
yeah i agree with that its best to focus more on belt rats and the level 4 and 5 content i also love my drones and am looking forward to a blaster boost
i see nothing wrong with the aggression logout timerspeople will use any means to avoid dying and this is long overdue
just display character id in info sheet which is unique and unchangeable all the problems with name changing can be avoided you dont need to keep those name change historylike character info as followscapitan epic loserplex id 42347861235
bumping for effect also i was thinking about this today the server has to remember the location of each site in each system and what it is and what has been done to it so far such as mining gas harvesting rats killed and whatnot so with that considered it has all that already saved so when the server comes back up all of that information is the same the only thing different is the sig id nowwouldnt it create more work for the server to assign all new ids wouldnt it be easier to just save the current id
we are in terrible need of changes well we always are but right now im seeing thesecorporation management skillstrade skillssocial skillssubsystem skills see belowplanet management skillslearning implants see belowto address the problems as we did with the learning skills by readjusting everyones base attributes up i propose the followingemulate trade skills at lv5 contracts should be made limitless and buying and selling should be possible from across the universe instead of being regionrestricted being able to access station services across the galaxy for items you own would be great too say you wanna recycle all your garbage and sell it somewhere 50 jumps away instead of having to have to go back to that regionsame with social emulate all skills at 5 no sensible person likes grinding and skill training is slow enough without players having to train just to optimize standing gains with npcs and suchplanet management as above lv5 and on a sidenote  please make an autorepeat function with an option to send notifications about the production yields so players dont have to manually access each planet to check on them and renew the cycles doable by scripting a simple function that resets a cycle based on where the player sets it reset every 1 hour 2 hour 3 hour and so onsubsystems  im not a strategic cruiser pilot so this is going to earn me some rage but this is merely an alternative ive been thinking about take the subsystem skills and roll them into their parent t3 cruiser skills and then adjust the parent t3 cruiser skill multipliers to reflect the change currently theyre 5x so maybe 6x yay or naybiggest issue  please revert all of nullsec back to 00 instead of this new negative level system it did nothing but cripple pve for us carebears and render quite many systems frankly worthless to live in reduced minerals means reduced materials reduced materials means reduced pvp if you cripple the miners you cripple the fighters by default where do you think theyre gonna get everything fromtheres an other issue that ive been raging at cloaks theres no way to counter cloaks the same way you counter any other fleets in a tactical way cloaked ships covert or not are completely outside of eves tactical rockpaperscissors and this invites people to permacamp enemy systems with cloaked ships just to discourage undocking and you never know if theyre afk or just trolling because they will find you in a sanctum soon after there needs to be a way to break enemy cloaks but at a proportionate cost versus the training to use cloakssomething like an echelon but a big fat slow 1slot ship that equips an anticloaking module that breaks all cloaks within 100ish km friendlies included and disables cloaks for 10 seconds penalties equal to firing a doomsday device sitting duck so the anticloak wont be spammable and another ac cannot activate within 5 minutes of the first oneover to learning implants not combat implants this was already posted in another topic but there can never be enough spam for change theyre too expensive theyre a drain on your wallets to replace and they discourage newcomers do away with them attributes and remapping altogether skill training should default to as if players had 25 alreadyactually the above gave me another idea if players have an active account must not be trial or cancelled with time left have an actual subscription going and they dont train anything the time wasted should rack up points anyway and be available for spending that way people dont lose training time but at the same time it doesnt train them faster if you idled for an hour youd only gain 2100ish points assuming 24 in all attributes it only makes sense since i doubt ccp can handle the alternative method of allowing people to queue skills up endlessly that is do away with the 24hour start restriction and this way players will be able to come back to their stillsubscribed account and catch up to everyone else
lol wutitt someone who doesnt like having to train skills to get the benefit from them
read it again why train skills just to increase the number of players youre allowed to recruit into your corporation
you seriously have to ask that question stop the evemail spam
what the really i dont think eve is for you mate you know what im a ceo and even i am against taking away the corp management skills basically means if you want to elad a corp you have to be willing to invest your time and isk into that proffession and live with it tying up your skillpoints is part of leading a corp and should not be removed all it would do is inspire tons of halfassed ceos to start their own corps and then barely even work in themi think what im trying to say is quit trying to simplify eve to suit your laziness andor add eve is supposed to be ahrder not easier im still mad they took the bulldozer off the top of the cliff
think again why train skills just to increase the damage your guns do why train skills just to increase your ships speed why train skills just to be able to fly different ships everyone should have the exact same character with all skills maxed out when they start eve so they dont have to bother training anything sarcasmthe skill levels are there so that you can work to improve what you can do in the game and running a corp trading more effectively or running pi is no different than anything else people who decide the skills are worth it train the skills everyone else shouldnt get a free pass on training skills just because they dont feel like it if its not worth it to you dont train it if it is go ahead and train the skill just dont ask for the skill to be removed and everyone given max stats just because it isnt worth it for some people to train it
who said anything about not investing time and isk into it and since youre going to be such an if its easy it sucks scrub about it go troll in another topicif i wanted the complete removal of skill training i would have written it in my original post wouldnt i puts a torch to your strawmanim not saying remove skill training im saying remove unnecessary skills i dont see the logic in having to train a skill to expand a corps member count the same way i wouldnt see someone try to capitalize on some sort of talent at cramming crowds into a soccer stadium irl it wont impact veterans and it will make eve look more presentable to newcomers who have never touched an mmo before and it only makes sense to make accommodations that will attract more players who eventually become subscribers within reason we dont wanna mess with the core gameplay
frankly op has to be trolling how else could such a terrible proposal be made in a way that doesnt sound sarcastic nice try but this is ridiculous all skills have value you wanna be a ceo of a large corp train for it you want to fly t3 train for it you want to manage planets train for it plain and simple
wheres the end though my point is that the list of skills you want to remove is completely arbitrary i wasnt trying to say that you thought all skills should be removed i was trying to show that theres no limit to where you stop removing skills to remove the inconvenience of training themand yes there are people who do specialize and make their living irl based on their ability to design buildings to fit lots of people efficiently theyre called architects there are also people who make their living off of getting people into said buildings and keeping them happy and entertained while theyre there furthermore noobs shouldnt be looking to start a corp leave starting corps to the more experienced players who know what theyre doing noobs starting corps just leads to them coming on the forums complaining about being wardeced by older players and saying theres nothing they can do about it
dude the skills differentiate those who are willing to invest the time in them from those who would half ass it and nariya kentaya isnt trolling she is making a legitimate point you dont see the point in these skills but that doesnt mean there isnt a point in them im sure fish dont see a point in the existence of air that doesnt automatically make it unnecessary
this has been posted before somewhere im sure but i thought it would be right to bring this topic backyes its about gas cloud harvesting an area of mining that at the beggining its only point was to produce those risky boosters now its needed for t3 ships manufacturing which makes it more desirable the gases extracted for this use are very worthy we have our modules and skills but nothing else many people wants more love to it so ill collect the ideas herei vote for a dedicated ship for this task along with new modules such as gas strip extractors mining upgrades rigs etc and other uses for the gas i know it has been voted for even ccp ive heard about converting the procurer to this role but i think it hasnt to be forgotten personally as a minerexplorer id love to do it in an industrial way and still having to find itabout its locations i think theyre ok a rare ore type hidden for explorers to find if only it was a it more expensive in the markets i only think that the gas clouds themselves although theyre variated and beautiful are a bit small and repetitive could they be more randomized in shape and size since its gas asteroids have a randomized size and shape so why not gas clouds tooive been thinking about the following the ship as jack karrigan said a dedicated industrial ship for this should come from ore folowing they line of naming their ships after fish it could be called lamprey because it vacuums xd and have the following  6 high slots used for the max of 5 extractors and 1 probe launcher this means 5 turret slots that could be normal slots if there were strip gas extractors or such that wouldnt be turrets so this ship wouldnt be nerfed with weapons and battle ships could still fit the usual extractors the probe launcher could be removed but this ship totally relies on exploring for its role  3 medium slots or such for scanners and such  24 low slots for cargohold expanders and mining upgradesas many ore ships have a tech 1 and a tech 2 variants this ship could have both too being the tech 2 one made for unsafe places as exhumers areas an industrial ship it should have a good cargohold in the thousands of m3 line and a decent drone bay since this ship will probably be in dangerous places more than exhumersmoreover it would be made for lowsec and wormholes so it could get a 2 bonus to warp strengh like the skiffso this ship would need the ore industrial skill to be flown it could have skill bonuses to gas compressing or cpu use of gas harvesters or suchvisually this ship could be like any other ore ship industrial looking but could have one or two big cylindrical containers that could be slowly spinning or spherical ones take inspiration from reallife gas carrier seaships maybe a vertical looking the skills the gas harvesting skill allows to use one aditional harvester per level which is an original way of making this minings mechanic different from the other ones mining asteroids works by increasing the yield and ice mining by decresing the harvesters cycles gas harvesting could work by reducing the base volume of each gas unit this is because gas can be compressed while rock and ice cant this could be an original way of increasing the quantity of extracted ore untouching the yield or the cycle and could determine mining upgrades and rigs each level of gas compressing could reduce the base volume of each gas unit by 51020 the upgrades and rigs basing on the previous idea of compressing the gas for lesser volume there could be gas compressors or such that decrease the base volume by 15 or such or decrease the cpu needs for gas extractorsif you have more ideas to post or if you like this or not please post herevote so this wont be forgottenedit added some old topics about this containing interesting ideas
i agree with a dedicated gas mining ship and a dedicated exploration shipas seperate entitiesas gas is more of an industrialist thing said ship should be manufactured by ore or dcmand exploration should be manufactured by soe or soct other than that good suggestion 1i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
makes a certain ship from star trek come to mind it was atlas class or something eitehr way its front end was a giant shield and glass or whatever technobabble they used instead of glass bubble with the bridge in the center of the bubblebasically its role was to fly into nebulaes and other anomalies and siphon the amterial into the bubble where the bridge scanners could analyze it and determine tis compositionperhaps a similar design for an eve gasmining ship honestly i would think a bubblelike container visible on the outside of the ship would make sense because were talking about gases insetad of ores
1 gas mining sucks in a nondedicated ship and i would love some upgrades that make it even more worthwhile
double post my fault
this imo shortened timer  more clones
this is the problem in a nutshell generally in a software context if a human can use it the macro can do it better my understanding is that most eve macros dont even use the client except as a method to access the data stream once the basic mechanics of the game are known to the writer they simply tell the bot what to look for in that data stream and voila you have a bot that plays the game perfectly barring human inteference in summary ccp needs to ban the bots and not punish legitimate players for their years of failing to try seriously to stem the problemand when they catch a botter 1st time  2 week ban all botting assets confiscated 2nd time  start looking for a new game all accounts
remove any isk faucet from null sec and remove most any stuff that is not isk from high sec there everyone happynecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
this is a very bad idea i will say it againhigh sec should not have to rely on null sec for pos fuels
nullsec already has the best of everything iskwise  nerfing hisec or whs will do nothing to attract playersbuffing nullsec is not the solution to improve the playability of eve  a simple glance at the number of players choosing to live in hisec vs nullsec shows that  most players simply will never want to live under the boots of a huge nullsec alliance  they simply wont  its not what they play the game for and never will besure improve nullsec mechanics for those who love it there a small  of the playerbase  they deserve a good game toobut your average players just want more immersive content  we should have hundreds not 5 epic arcs new players should never be confused about what to do next after the tutorials nerfing hisec will only drive players away from the game  its not going to fix nullsec
the only concern id have with more epic arcs and the like is sliding the game more towards a theme park than a sandbox but i like the way youre thinking
my thoughts from the omg wtf no hisec ice thread in si from a is it profitable standpoint removing ice from hisec is a good thing too damn many bots as it istwistedyes i know null has bots and low probably does too  but mehnow if ccp goes through with it heres what well see happen1 the buyers will cry2 the botters will cry3 enterprising corporations and alliances will make bank as they move to lowsec to obtain the icenow from looking at dotlan i havent seen a single lowsec system that has ice without a station thats a bad thing in the safety department as its nearly impossible to kick someone out of a system with npc stationsif theyre really going to go through with this id like to see ccp move at least some of the permanent ice fields assuming there will still be permanent belts regardless of whether or not they can be depleted to deeper lowsec that doesnt have a station ie not right next door to hisec if its going to be in grav sites and a relative  to find  then it would be nice to get some of the nullsec variants as well
i hope this has been posted beforebecause if it has its because its a good idea soperpetuum is a pretty crappy game graphically it sucks and the combat is pretty lame not to mention it is pretty much an eve ripoff no reallyyou cant play perpetuum and not see the blatant similarities to eve there are however a few things that it improved on that i believe should be adopted one of my alliance buddies pointed out a couple to me and i agreed1 static noise by this i mean targeting restrictions based on the number of ships on grid the more ships in the blob the longer it takes to target an individual ship in perpetuum it is explained by the nearby ships creating noise from their targeting systems that counteract or slow the targeting of other ships2 aoe ship explosions something i brought up on the old forums that seemed rather popular with a few nitpickers ship explodes and the resulting explosion causes damage to all the other ships in the area bigger the shipbigger the explosion and damage of course the easy way to do this is to make the ship explosions work just like missile explosions for velocity damage and whatnot3 sp accumulation to a point pool instead of setting your skill to train and having to worry about changing that skill at a certain time and blah blah blahinstead just have all your sp go into a pool of points that you can specifically assign to whatever skill you want to when you want the mechanics for this are already in the game as evident when learning skills were removed and the points refunded there you go 3 things perpetuum does as  of a game as it is that ccp can learn from for eve
the sp pool thing would never work in eve however having ships explode deal aoe damage to each other would cut down on capital blobs like no tomorrow and by blobs i dont mean 1020 carriers i mean 3050 mother ships you lose 3 mother ships and suddenly your super dense blob is all at 50 hp also on idea 1 the static noise is one of the only reason in large sale battles idea 2 works by limiting locking time and having ships deal massive aoe damage to each other base on size of ship and size of ship taking damage you have an awesome combo that focuses combat down to smaller fightsyou would also super increase the usefulness of the titan laser by inadvertently making it into an aoe weapon target carrier press fire kill carrier carrier deals aoe damage to the 40 carrier blob they just shoved into the system to fight your smaller fleet
aoe explosions should be restricted to low sec and below otherwise this would open up yet another can of worms
i will concede that point why wouldnt an sp pool work in eve so long as you have a subscription you gain points and apply them when you want not very hard at alldoes away with the complaints of not being able to change skills outside eve
thiink really hard im sure youll figure it outbut really the problem that comes is thislets say you cant afford a skillbook well right now that emans you cant train the skill until you can afford it in your system they can just grind isk for a while adn the second they can afford it boom put points in lvl 5 basically meaning a player can in essence get the sp for every skill in the agme without ever actually having to afford it basically pretraining a skill before you even buy it which is bad
yeahi cant see that as actually being a problem as that really only applies to newbie pilots anyway anybody playing more than 3 months should be able to easily make the isk needed to fund any skillbook purchase in which you could do that even still it means they are not applying the skills to some other skill while they wait anyway yeahi dont see that as being a valid problem at all
i play perpetuum and know the games strengths and weaknesses pretty well the usual stupid its an eve clone arguments dont work well on me  the last time i checked you couldnt hide behind stations nor even planets in this game but los is big there  tracking means nothing there but is a huge consideration here  skillpoints earned realtime is similar but 1epmin and no way to enhanceimprove building up is a bit different than remaps with implants so on and so forthexploding ships  in perp this isnt a major issue though even there you had mitigation due to terrain being discussed that los issue above it does not exist here in eve it would be alpha kills in perp are extremely rare but common as dirt in fleet ops here you arent running a 1000 ship battle with such mechanics and exploiting it would be extremely easy simply run a ship into an enemy fleet and alpha it with your fleetit sounds neat but in reality it would cripple a lot of pvp in the gamethe sp pool has issues why log into the game at all if you want to just build up skills why even look at the game at all just to build up there is no expending the sp until you feel like starting to use that char or sell itstatic noise  how does this work with drones theres nothing like them in perpetuum yet they are a corekey weapons system in this game it might work to help out some situations of vast numbers but 500 or less ships shouldnt be crippled unless you want to shut down all major fleet operations in the gameps graphics dont suck in perpetuum on many machines my old machine it looked great on my new computer  they look a bit washed out one is an xp box the other an up to date win7 box with high end graphics card it appears the engine renders better with older systems the why of it i have no clue i just spot it very easily if i use my old computer
the goal of static noise is a laudable one  change the fleet sizepower curve so that after a certain point bringing more ships to a fight doesnt buy you much advantage imho a change that achieves this is the only longterm solution to blobs and lag because fleets expand to fill the lag availablethat said the proposal is overly simplistic because its based on  of ships on a grid that means it hurts everyone on grid equally so the effect is neutral and it does not achieve the desired goal for it to do that it must impair the side with the big fleet more or bigger ships more than the side with the smaller fleetthe naive solution to this is keeping track of things on an individual ship level and generating a noise map of the grid so that regions with lots of tightly packed ships are disadvantaged more however without some very clever programming and simplifying approximations this is not computationally feasibleback when i ran for csm5 i illustrated this issue with a proposal that ships only be able to target the closest n ships be they friend or foe so if you were in the middle of a big blob most or all of the ships you could lock would be friendly and the extra combat power you could provide would be limited this is of course only one of a large number of possible game mechanic tweaks that might address the issue which one is best is up to ccp to decidebut sooner or later theyre going to have to change combat mechanics to introduce some sort of fog of war at the grid levelps i do like the idea of chainreactions of exploding ships
artificial blob limiters will never work unless they are made so horrible to work within that people ragequit on the spot much better to cook up mechanics that encourages not blobbing  fielding ones entire extended family should remain an option for the neanderthals do we really want an aoe weapon usable by day 1 characters id much rather have a kamikaze option where i fill my hold with explosives and can do damage to anothers hull directly by ramming at full speedthe sp thing can be done by letting the points added to the pool be as if no implants are used or lower even and setting a restriction on the pool of 34 days worth point would be to expand on the queue concept while making sure that logging in remains the optimal solution
also i dont like the idea of a single artificial limit noise which make fights less fun with growing sizerather than one limit with big impact i would suggest multiple mechanics which discourage blobbing speak are specific against blobs independent of the fleetsize and make somewhat sense from the immersion standpointi posted this already somewhereexample based on formationsfleet bonuses only apply if you fly in certain but reasonable loose formations blob gives no bonus at all add the noise penalty here if you like  wings should stay together  frigate specific formations v x give speedsensoragility boosts  formations for slow ships like wall or line give defensiveoffensive boosts  deltasquarestar formation for logistics  blob gives you nothingadvantages  very large fleets will require more than one fc subfcs for optimal results  blob is discouraged  larger fleets require some kind of strategy attack from both sides etc  new feature for the marketing departmentsure this is not trivial to implement but this would be a nice midterm goal imoas good start results first ccp could restrict the noise penalty only for blobs to many ships in one place and ignore the formation feature completely having a grid wide penalty would be rather suboptimal since it would affect the smaller fleet too in a fleet vs blob battleedit but yeah the noise idea is quite cool 
the only mechanic id like to see moved over from perp is their systemoutpost control scheme that rewards a constant presence in the systemartificial blob limiters wont work imo its better to create incentives within the sov system that encourage multiple fleets
hey wait a minute they already have the ability to refund spwhat if instead a nice balance was to say give you half your lowest sp gain per minute as sp you can put into anywhereso you still want to train skills and it rewards you for keeping up with it but if you miss a day you only miss out on half of the sp you could of hadyou know that or get eve gate working to the point where we can just change skills online
i like the noise idea alot still signature radius should count for something this would encourage to fleets to bring hundreds of cheap frigs in alts as nothing more that static noise generators if there was a way to implement it without abuse factors being painfully obvious it would be cool though1
oh hey look another thread about fixing lowsec that is full of people who spend no time there and havent the first clue as to what theyre talking about yay
this wouldnt buff lowsec at all it just means i wuld spend more time in highsec farming lvl 3s to get the isk to pew pew in lowsec casuallyalmost everyone in eve has an end goal to pvp either in high low or nullsec to reach that goal most people want a huge cache of isk to throw away making all lvl 4 missions in lowsec would just mean it takes longer to get to that goal
1 bounties may only be placed on characters who have a  50 security status or worse in life bounties are placed upon the worst criminals not law abiding citizens people with a positive security status should not be allowed to have bounties on them  50 locks people out of high sec mostly as you are seen as a criminal in the eyes of all faction navies2 bounties degrade over time if you dont undock or log in every day your bounty degrades if you dont have a negative security status change every 2 or 3 days your bounty degrades any positive sec status change degrades your bounty getting 49 clears your bounty completely3 no one from the same corp or alliance may place or claim a bounty on another member no one in npc corp may have a bounty placed upon them nor may they claim a bountysince the launch of capt quarters eoh has been using the bounty system as a way of advertising their game they have over half the top bounties on the list which means theyre constantly coming up on the in game tv most of the other top bounty players have not undocked from a station or logged on in weeks ive been watching for them and i know this to be truethe bounty system is currently a worthless feature as is but it has real potential with a better mechanic this is something that could interest more people in pvp as there is a real profit if you succeed it also keeps the majority of bounties in lowsec 00 players usually have a high security status because of ratting and complex running
sure thing mateyes to sleepers ai for all npcs at least a derived version of it no way to sleepers specs for all npcs tho our dumbass npcs act like this1 looking for target2 found target 3 attack targetthe endits 100 predictable and therefore lame as 
give the wh ai to level 4 and 5 rats but leave the rest
considering how many times ive lost kills because someone accidentally lost their internet connection forget being nice to people who legitimately lose it and make them face the consequences
ive wanted name changing for so long take all of my isk put a big flag stating what my previous name was anything just let me get rid of the awful name my other character has
1ive dabbled in probing once or twice its extremely unhelpful when underskilled and the sigs are moving 40 aus a second while im desperately trying to scan them down
sigs dont actually move at all thats just your skills causing discrepancies in your scan results this thread is referring to the actual sig idsabc123changing every day even though the sig itself is the same and in the same place
i think hes referring to ships but still stop the evemail spam
lolyeaheither waystill a little off
i just want a pretty place to attend to
9001out the door with you and your cheap proposal
00 isnt for everybody yes many people enjoy going out there building empires and shooting thousand man fleets but this is one part of the game populace and not the be all end all of what eve is about many people myself included spend a large chunk of their time in empire doing empire stuff be it market warfare mining mission running or just goofing off flying space ships with some friends not everybody wants to play the cutthroat version of the game and maybe you just want to log on for a bit do a couple fun things and then log off this is a legitimate and fun way to play eve with that out of the way id like to open some dialogue on what youd like to see empire game play look like and how things can be improved from what they are now im not looking for ways to make you super rich mining veld in a 7 system im looking for ways to make the game fun when you dont want to invest your time and effort in the space conquest game the empire part of the equation has been neglected for some time and while the csm is full of people who mostly live in 00 this is but one part of the overall storymy vision i want to see a legitimate career path for those who want to live in empire and enjoy eveonline i want to see empire activities iterated upon properly and i want there to be a plentiful array of entertainment options available for those who want to make their empire in empire and not lowsecnullsecthe purpose of this thread is to gather data i want to hear what you feel an empire career should be like what have you experienced that you enjoy what pisses you offwith ccps recent change to focus on flying in space we have a unique opportunity to advocate for resources to improve the core game play and i intend to capitalize on this a bit to press for empire game play changes tell us what you would like to see itt in this threadi am not going into this with any specific agenda the sky is the limit im looking for ideas
i think the largest problem with highsec is mostly ui issues considering allot of people run micro manufacturing process i think ui and pos changes would be a big help the time i spent in highsec was mostly doing invention and market things but i just got burned out on the poor sni interfacejust small changes such as setting multiple invention jobs would go a long way to making highsec life more enjoyableon the other hand pvp wise nuet repping is a bigg issue
well exactly what i thoughhope that what ccp is doing currently on pos will be nice give us this devblog quicklywould like the agents never send you to lowsec also i tried some missions not long ago and was surprise with all the changes that happens to them these last months agents are still bothersome about sending us on low sec sometimeps  i wonder how many posts will be if you want to help high sec make yours corpies stop killing us 
jesus  christ hell must have froze over and satan is giving free sleigh rides did vile rat actually just post a useful and constructive thread i think i need to go home and prepare for the apocalypse i see nothing wrong with high sec as it currently stands aside from a bounty hunting system that flat out does not work and the fact that suicide ganking and piracy are far too easy as professions since they are basically always a win for the pirate and pure loss for the victime with absolutely no true reprecautions to the pirate or gankerwe have had hundreds of threads on how to fix those issues however
point of interest  lowsec 04  01 is still empireid like to see lowsec revamped more than hisec hisec is fine in its current state and lowsec is nothing but a wasteland 00 has the security of an alliance hisec has the security of concord coupled with the fact that since there are so many hisec areas that are relatively devoid of people or at least the pro pvp crowd that preys on industrial corp 2343451heres the rub though  you cannot make lowsec more easily profitable for a solo pilot  but there should be incentives to go there beyond lets gatecamp and gank who we can most of the trouble is in the fact that you get one or two newer players in a corporation of new players who have gone to lowsec for a missionto see whats upwhatever they tell everyone else omg stay out of lowsec youll get killed in 2 sec flat and everyone else listens without checking for themselves perhaps this can be fixed through use of the tutorials  have a mission where you have to webscram the npc so your npc fleetmates can kill it teach people a few of the things that they need to survive in the inevitable war or lowsec roam and maybe they wont be so quick to jump on the bandwagon that everyones out to grief them well we can hopein addition to this educating people that this is not your typical mmo is also key  corporations have downsides theyre not just social clubs like in that other mmo so if youre not familiar with the game so much making industrial corp 2343452 is a really bad idea there needs to be a way for these industrialminded corporations to draw in the pvp guys and keep it fun for the pvp guys or for the pvp guys to have a few minersindustrials around and let them have their fun
i would really like to see pos changes as in the flogging a dead horse forum not exactly high sec only but it would certainly make life easier and something resembling a real station would be impressive a genuine bounty hunting option  the current system is too open to abuse and pointless to follow as a professioninsurance payouts for gankers need to be looked at
i odn tlive in hisec obviously anymore but wardec mechanics are a bunch of ass and insurance should be nullified if concord id on your lossmail
1also i lulzd a bit at the suggested name lamprey x3
i like the premise but i think that a cycle time bonus would be fine without going into compression also why does it need protection from deadly gas clouds do kspace gas clouds explode fullerites dont or are you referring to mercoxit which if mined has a chance of releasing a cloud of toxic gas although i believe that mercoxit itself is not a gas
hmm its true that kspace gas doenst explode but wspace gas does as taken from evelopedia 
yes youre wrong fullerite clouds are nondamaging now theres the damaging cloud you can find at isolated core deposits and im not sure on the mercoxit ones but the regular wormhole gas clouds are just big bright shiny fluffy pillows of wormhole love
fixed thank you and sorry for the mistake 
hmm could this be the birth of the jumping jack flash class of ships
havnt encoutnered a gas cloud yet that didnt cause damgeexcept mercoxittechincally its not a gas cloudbut flying the incorrect ship with incorrect skills or tools will cause mercoxit ore to spit damage clouds at youthats for sureie fly a skiff and be propperly skilled to fix that problemthe only time theres ever been a hazzard in gas clouds is rats or sleepersthats about itcourse there may actually be a gas cloud out that hitsyet to fnid one tho not to mention weather hazzardswe should have a gas mining dedicted shipwould be nicei always end up dragging out a cyclone or similar ship to pull it off with decent rat defenses stop the evemail spam
eh rereading your post did you get the did and didnt mixed up
whoopsi thinkcourse its monday morning and im juggling work and keeping my brain awakegas clouds dont cause damagethe environment they are in however do at timesthats what i was trying to say stop the evemail spam
this plans draws from all ready suggested ideas almost none of them are mine exclusively this is the single thread which could bind low sec and walking in stations together the aim of ccp should be to keep all of eve a vibrant dynamic universepvp is the most exciting draw of eve1 boosters are desirable because they improve combat in pvp2 faction warfare should be the driving dynamic behind low sec3 pirates will have militias and will be able to compete as a third party for low sec systems within their normal empire stomping grounds4 all though you can still earn faction loyalty points any where lp awards will only be able to be redeemed in these contested systems this will increase the desire for players to claim these systems for whatever faction they want this reward from5 faction warfare will now have a big impact on systems after a system has been flippedall the bunkers claimed it enters a reinforced state where it cannot be contested until after down time after down time all though station models remain the same the companies residing in them will change hands ex gallente factions caldari factionsguristasserpentisdepending on region 6 when pirates claim a low sec system ladargas sites will begin spawning in that system considering that agents for pirates will appear in these locations that means they will have access to faction lp rewards needed to produce boosters7 boosters will now become racial in other words each pirate faction will not only poses the blue prints to only certain boosters but will also spawn the necessary gas clouds to create them when a low sec system is flipped to that racial pirate faction8 boosters will be bought in player owned establishments in a sort of UFFFDoff the gridUFFFD transactions at player owned establishment sockets9 under world agents will be present in station environments only by visiting with them you can gain standing with an opposing faction again ex gallente or guristas if your caldari with out causing damage to your sec status or standing to your own faction this evens out the playing field for people who only want to mission and donUFFFDt want to fight if a mission runner has a blockaderunner and has good standing with gallente caldari and guristas no matter who controls your faction lp reward center you can claim something there whether being controlled by caldari gallente or guristasregional eg from a lore standpoint it also emphasizes the fact that capsuleers really serve no ones interest but their own10 underworld missions will have risk associated with them the activity could risk them getting stopped by other players like being marked for smuggling contraband or it must be done under a certain time limit if a mission is accepted and then failed failure could result in a loss of your own faction standing or a direct hit to your security status this mission should have good pay out for lp and isk again more risk vs reward you gain access to these missions by talking to any agent from the faction your interested in who would normally just give the default response to people who donUFFFDt have enough standings to give missions too in addition to the default response the agent will direct them to a UFFFDgood friend of theirs who if the player is still interested in helping empirepirate faction should talk tounder world agent name at station x in system x you cannot access underworld agents via the agent finder11 for the underworld missions with smuggling if contraband is captured from these missions you should be able to turn it in to specific agents to gain standing with their factions ex you catch some one smuggling slaves in minmitar space you tag them and destroy when your friends show up you bring them to a minmitar agent who UFFFDfrees themUFFFD giving you lp for minmitar this gives people in empire reasons to police lanes because there will be real rewards12 militias should be able to complete bunker sites like an incursion site with a similar pay out system but with faction specific lp this will drive competition over systems a system canUFFFDt be claimed until its after down time and every bunker is flipped this means opposing militias could flip bunkers while other militias flipping others in the same system once a faction has claimed all the bunkers they claim the rewards and the system is set to flip after down timethe goal behind this is not just to make low sec dynamic and desirable but also to give people who live in empire a reason to go to low sec if the only location to redeem faction rewards is at certain locations in low sec they will go there to get them increasing low sec traffic once again giving pirates something to piratethis is an attempt to increase band density lets say empire low and null sec are giant bands in the universe currently empire and null sec are dense with people fighting missioning industrialUFFFDingUFFFDing and low sec for the most part is empty this should not be the case eve is a vibrant thriving digital world and each of the major bands should have their own flavor and community residing with in themthere also should be unique draws from each to each other empire will want to claim their just rewards in lowsec people who fight over low sec will learn to a degree what it takes to claim a system in null sec people in null sec will want boosters from lowsec and of course worm holerUFFFDs are just goofy people in empire will want to police space lanes leading to more pvp in empire from what ive state you can come up with lots of stuff too
clueless absolutely cluelesswhat will really happen is this ice fuel prices will spike as a result everything produced from poss in high sec and wormholes will spike smaller corps will find that its no longer affordable to maintain a pos in high sec and wormhole space and will fold many of those people having had the sand removed from their sandbox will leave eve some corps may take a shot at ice mining in low however after a few ganks theyll give up and go back to high and mine rocks prices will continue to escalate forget about being able to afford a tengu unless youre in one of the null sec megaalliances its simply a gamebreaking idea that will eventually drive people out of eve people arent in low or null for a reason they dont like it taking ice from high wont suddenly make them like it if they cant afford to survive in eve the way they want theyll go its an incredibly stupid idea and whomever at ccp first thought of it should be embarassed
within the first three months this would certainly happen but probably not as black as you paint itlongterm i have to disagree as soon as the price of iceproducts reaches a certain point it will be really lucrative to mine ice like mercoxite a few years ago players are adaptivethey will find ways if they can make a profit at the end lowsec players will find that protection racketeering pays more than ganking nullsec corps will suddenly consider ice mining players highsec players will form consortia to mine ice and have protection small corps will ninjamine iceif there is isk to make players will do it but ice is so darn cheap that it is senseless to invest even in the skillbook
oh it would be worse much worse youre completely leaving human nature out of the equation look you and i both know without any reasonable doubt whatsoever that theres a carebear portion of eve that prefers to move at a slower pace they make their isk slower like their risk lower these for the most part are the ice miners maybe just maybe some of them would try low sec ice if it were gone from high but not many not enough to meet current demand of those that do how many do you think would last more than one or two mack ganks not many theyll be back in high in no time and will simply go back to nibbling rockssupplies will plummet and youll have the survival of high sec and wormhole poss becoming solely dependant on null sec and to a lesser degree low sec ice this is a recipe for failure high sec poss wont be making enough to afford fuel or the added costs will be too great to justify the time and effort wormholes will suffer greatly as it is we have to periodically venture into empire to resupply this happens maybe every few weeks with a spike in fuel prices smaller corps will find that buying a couple weeks or a months worth of fuel has eaten all their profits and more theyll wind up failing the larger ones the ones with a full and healthy t3 production chain going theyll need to recover the fuel cost losses with the only things they have to do so with t3 ships and subsystemsits clear that removing ice from high would have massively detrimental effects that would ripple throughout all areas of eve high sec and wormholes suffer greatly research takes a blow industry takes a blow t3 products well if you want to buy a t3 in the future you better be quite prepared to cough out some serious isk probably so much you wont fly it anyhow your little pipedream about how the high and low sec bunnies will all come together as one and mine low sec ice under the rainbows and nebulae is just that a pipedream that fails to reflect on human nature and reality oh and one last side effect people that have had their high and wh livelihoods crushed by such a change well you cant take the sand out of their sandbox and expect them to go play in sandboxes they have no interest in theyll simply look at their empty box and go home
predictions as this is reading the tea leaves anyway could happen either way everyone has stated valid views so farhuman nature works both ways surely some will go back and nibble rocks for the others this change would bring a little eve back to eveso some players and producers quit then the t3 ships get more expensive of course so what they arent cheap anyway and were expensive before they will skyrocket but soon there will be someone who has access to ice or the money and will be able to reach the break even point with a whposi still believe that the majority of the players adapt well there are some unfortunates which have their cozy gamestyle broken but thats whats eve
some of us arent content with the thought that wormholes would be pushed from a mostly disparate groups of smaller corps and alliances into a place where only a few of the largest survive its too much like that lesser empire null by the way those people quitting that youre so so what to theyre cash is just as good as even the most hardcore null sec pilot probably better theyre less likely to be buying plex and more likely to be paying directly if ccp is in agreement that its ok to crap on so much of their subscriber base in order to benefit a few megaalliances or null bunnies well the whole reaping and sowing expression comes to mindlets hope hilmar is still listening
ill say it againremoving ice from high sec is a horrible and stupid idea the only reason anybody is asking for this is because they live in nullsec or lowsec and want to be able to make more money off of ice in all the time i lived in nullsec i never saw anybody mining ice they bought it from empire and hauled it in nullsec and lowsec already have the ability to mine icethere is plenty of it that goes unused every day no reason at all to remove it from highsec other than to fill the pockets of large nullsec blocks
reviving thread only so to pee in your tea it still makes absolutely no sense to shoot down an idea only because there is already a painfully long and convoluted process in place if i had an eft option with a testing ground in game it would be an improvement to eve and that is the whole point to these threads
high security systems arent secure at allmyslef and friends of mine were recently attacked and ganked in high security systems 06 and 08 systems i propse that there be more penalties for a player with low or negative standing 50 and lower when they enter high security spaceconcord police need to be more aggressive in their pursuit of these criminals also if there are any unprovoked aggression gank the criminals should lose more than their ships concord should be given the permissions to pod kill these criminalsthere is also an old corp trying to remake a name for themselves they destroyed ganked our hulks and then they sent us a email telling us if we dont pay for them not to kill us they will not stopemail is here  subject miner amnestyfrom skeith oumis goonwaffe aka goonswarmsentto helloas the financial director behind goonwaffetests current operations in gallente high sec i thought you might be interested in our amnesty program for miners were currently extending this to a small group of miners to test the waters and see how things goa full outline of the program can be found at

im sorry you had such a negative experience i realize it can be hard on some to replace ships lost in belts and dont have the means to buy plex i dont either real life finances are pretty tight to that end i think you should give some serious thought to taking mr oumis up on his kind offer you wouldnt want to lose another hulk would youif you have any questions feel free to contact spookydonut in game and he can assist you
this is a post to try and make this game a better experience for all high sec pilotsif i canUFFFDt afford to replace my ship how do you think i have the money 250 mil isk to throw away  i have no interest in paying your corp any money of any kind vultures is all you are i wish you nothing but failure in your pursuit of personal pleasure at others expense
i have to sayi think the hate goon atitude is seriously misguided and mob relatedim increasindly finding it hard to hate goons based on the reasons people giveoh sure what they do is not necessarily nicebut then ive seen worse and most of which are not goonsgo figure stop the evemail spam
hategoon attitudei have hate towards anyone that gets pleasure out of causing others grief i feel the same way towards others that do this type of game play others have ganked me and i feel the same way towards them this is not a goons bashing thread i am getting tired of the so called high sec space being called secure when ccp allows this type of negative game play to go on the only penalty they offer is the destruction of throw away ship wow how about making them pay by destroying their pod and all the implants in their headsits the whole human nature and breeding negativity i cannot stand i could care less what goons do
this has to be a troll thread no one can be this naive
naive think about what you are trying to say again all i am trying to do here is fix a broken system hgih sec space is only a fraction of the whole eve universe if you want pvp im sure there are alot of people that would love to entertain yougo have fun  leave the people that dont want anything to do with pvp alone 
yes naive the warning on the box since day one has always been the same hisec is safer but not safeso why do you think you are such a special snowflake not to play by the same rules and mechanics as everyone else
a couple of thoughts 1 there is no such thing as pve and pvp areas in eve any time you are undocked you are vulnerable to attack use the market contracts etc and you are vulnerable to the scams and manipulations of other players there is no shallow end of the pool here only deep and deeper 2 what do you propose as stricter punishments remember there needs to be a balance between the risks you engage in and the rewards you can earn  transferable killrights that you can sellgive to another player quicker response times in systems  harsher sec status penalties  prevention of the loss of your ship 3 why should a hulk pilot be able to mine an asteroid belt in 05 space without being molested are there other options available to you that utilize teamwork or less efficient beefier insurable ships that will greatly decrease your chances of a loss or even the magnitude of your losses shoudl they happen why should a badger autopiloting across empire be safe from molestation are there other options in game where they can utilize beefier less efficient ships that can survive an attack or are there other insurable methods to have your stuff moved so another is taking the risks why should a mission runner be safe from being ganked are there other options in the game where they could sacrifice some efficiency to make them much less of a target and perhaps even harder to kill just because you can fly a hulk and its the most efficient mining vessel doesnt mean you should be using it in a risky situation why should the risk to it in a 05 system be loweredremoved
this describes literally everything you can do in evehow many serpantis did you slaughter today you monster
i am not special why do you think that combat type players that have an advantage over others have the right to destroy  gank others with lesser skillswithout any stif penaltyall im saying is there should be higher penalties for this actionlike i have said before im an industry pilot with little combat type skills like i have also said i have no intention on doing any pvp type of game playhow an i supose to defend myself from a seasoned combat pilotoh well as i suspected i am trying to voice an opinion and view of a system i think should be changed and all you are interested in is bashing people for their views
lol players none npcs  several lolbut i didnt kill any that didnt attack me first make them stop attacking me first ill leave them alone
so let me get this straight grakoyoue been playing a little over a yearmaybe twoand your just now figureing out that high sec space isnt as safe as you thought it wasyou do realize these very same mechanics have always been this way with minor adjustmentsand i do mean minor and your just now getting around to bitching about itnaive is an understatementedit ok maybe a ltitle longer than 2 yearsbut that makes it far worse than expected stop the evemail spam
this is an alt toon i stopped playing for almost a year due to this issuei have not just started thinking about this it has always been an issue of mine as to gizznitts post my sugestions are posted in post 1 try reading it some timeim done here all im trying to do is make suggestions on how to make it more balanced and girzznitt cooperation with more players only means the gankers attack in greater numbers it doesnt fix the issuei am not saying stop it totally just make the penalties harsherplease see post 1
they arent supposed to bemy condolencesnoremake themselves this is pretty much the norm for goons you should have seen what they did the last time they invaded highsec it was more damaging caused more grief and had much weaker reasoning behind itheres the thing eve is marketed as a singleshard universe where everyone can affect everyone else for better or worse nonconsensual pvp regardless of its form is the enabler of this sellingpoint as it allows players of any stripe to actively go after those that negatively affect them whenever they feel they need to and better yet the rules of the game are flexible enough to allow you to be creative with the solutions to your problems with the exception of using tacticsthings that violate the eulasince your problem is that you are being attacked by people who seem to care less about the consequences of their actions which i might also add raising penalties on will not stop them from doing any of this the onus is on you to alter your tactics and gameplay to preserve your selfinterest some things i just came up to assist in this include but are not limited to scanning out gravametic sites there are plenty of ores to mine out there and most gankers cant be bothered to bring a probing ship to scan you out theyre after easy prey tank your ship out more yes you will mine less but i think mining less is a small price to pay in order make yourself a less appealing target compared to other people mine in t1 ships again you do mine less and you will not be able to defend yourself at all but t1 ships give better insurance while t2 ships do not not being afk and being vigilant if you see an orca acting strangely local spiking some strange messages appearing in the center of your screen andor couple destroyers on dscan its time to gtfo
your context and presentation say anything but thatyour obviously ticked off and want punnihsment to be harsher you know whatthe price tag they pay in the first place is plenty bad enoughespecially if they try to recycle the toonsand they may not care about penalties like losing access to high secdont like itdeal with itby quiting or playing smarter stop the evemail spam
there are reasons people hate goonsi just hate because i feel like giving a reason when i let off a couple volleys in their direction and running away when they spam battleships at me that and most of my buddies flew under the drf banner not me though and currently many of them fly under atlas but that is pretty much the extent of the reasons i have to hate goonsthat being said anyone who hates gons because they scam and play unfair is just in the wrong part of highsec andor needs to actually look at that contract before they accept the good dealat op also how the ehck do you get suicide ganked in high sec i eman really your just going to let somebody with a highprofile read as very wealthy nullsec corportaion ticker in a ship class commonly associated with ganking fly within 40km of youwanna survive in highsec quit babying around in the highpopulation areas and run some lowsec roams
again a post that doesnt pay attention to the topici am not saying stop it intirely just make it more even how far or equal is it when1 i lose a 250 mil ship 2 the attacker loses a 100mil or less ship and flys away in their podlets make high sec ganking more challenging to players that want to pick on lesser skilled players all of your replys is what i expected bashing me telling me im naive i dont understand the game mechanicsim older than most of the people that play evei understand the mechanics perfictly thats why im posting they should be changed to make it more balancedso fell happy about killing my ships other views the people that gank in high sec probablly cant survive in null or low sec so they need to fell bigger by picking on the smaller weaker players school yard bulliesenjoybash me all you want this is my final post
the mechanics are already balanced you are the one that let another unknown player get close to your ship first mistake which im guessing was utanked your 2nd mistake and did nothing before hand to try and escape either i woudl assumethe aggressor in a gank is already guaranteed to lose his ship you are not unless you are untanked and fall victim to alpha but that is a mistake you should have learned to correct after your first week of play forcing them to lose their pod is overkill because thats trying to guarantee they lose more then you you ebing the one who chose to fly an uninsureduntanked expensive ship out of the station docking bay
no its not its for you to whine about people playing the game within the rules
other than obvious cheap shotsi must sheepishly admit that most of my antigoonisms where based on the angry mob stop the evemail spam
this is a space pvp simulator you are safe no where the criminal loses their ship you receive your insurance money because you are smart and have it insured and you move on with your life and deal with the fall out just like real life welcome to eve space is a cold lonely place happy flying
on the noise  yea it would make gridfu damn near essential to working fleet ops decently some upsides to this but also downsides  a game mechanic focus vs gaming focus  need to shape the grid properly for this battle adjusting the idea might workthat exploding ship idea sounds very cool i remember thinking how it was awesome  then i saw how it worked and who it was used againstthink about it this way  every younger char becomes a liability to your side being as they are the easier target to kill sp prerequisites to joining organizations would soar to prevent the trash kills that hurt your gang an alternative would be the fire ship model based upon selfdestruct or the like a weapon vs an effect but thats all sidebar stuff
it would work the same way bombs do one bomb does about 30 damage to battleship and only 30 damage to frigates
this has one huge disadvantage and that is that it penalizes longrange fleet compositions as soon as you bring n1 ships you can not target anything from the enemy fleet because the closest n ships to you are allies meanwhile a close range fleet can just warp on top of an enemy and hope that at least some of them will end up being closer than most of the friendlieslongrange ships are already disadvantaged enough in eve they dont deserve another nerf
this would just result in sebo ahacs backed by newbie frigate spam ruling all 00 combat battleships and capitals wouldnt have much of a chancei will task mittens with implementing this immediately
the entire point of visibilitylocking restrictions is that it will force fleets to split up into smaller semiindependant units that have to maneuver around the battlefield and coordinate with each other to gain local advantage granted it would be a very different battle environment than the current one with a much higher load on fcs and much greater roles for wcscs but imho it would be a much more interesting onebut also keep in mind that i made the proposal as an example of something that could be done to illustrate the problem there is a whole class of possible solutions but sooner or later ccp has to pick oneand limiting visibility to the closest n ships  or making it a function of distance and ship size or whatever  is something that can be implemented and tested quickly and easily in the client on sisi its basically putting a perceptual filter on the overview plus a little extra code to check for direct clicks on ships only once you have something that is really promising do you start worrying about anticheat code on the server side
los is another issue all together frankly it would be nice to see ships that are occluded by larger ships objects or even stuff like gas clouds able to be unlockable imagine a frigate that flys behind a battlecruiser while you have it locked and suddenly you lose lock and have to lock it again or a battleship you lose lock on because it moved behind a carrier this would also make asteroids and stations have a tactical role greater than they do nowthis would also make people freak out and qq to no end but heyi think the more challenging the pvp is the better it is
i think the insurance system is a good thing but need some change for gankeri think if you get popped by concord you should not receive any insurance i cant drive my car with 200kmh in some other guys car i hate and then get a new car from my insurance the problem is easy ganking is to cheap there are lot of ships that cant fit enought tank to survive a single gank ship brutix or disco bs highsec should be secure space but if you fly a t1 hauler or a mining ship you are never safehighsec ganking is of corse a part of this game and should never be removed or changed that its impossible if someone is too stuped and transport 10b of flex in a t1 frig he deserve to die pbut it should not be possible to gank a 200m mining ship with a single t1 ship and make nealy no losses because insurance pays you ship if insurance stop paying gankers ganking will be more expensive and the ballance would be much better you still can make much isk if you gank a weak ship with billion of isk in itbut new players whould be able to transport cargo of 100m in a t1 hauler and dont get ganket because the ganker will make huge profit of this
quotenurdra if someone is too stuped and transport 10b of flex in a t1 frig he deserve to die pquotei am keen to loot someones flex when they drop it pleaseon a serious note while no where is secure space any lossmail that has concord on it should not pay out insurance at all not even the uninsured amount you get there is nothing wrong with ganking and hoping to get expensive loot but it should be at the risk of heavy losses
ive always said that any criminal act should result in voiding of insurancebut i stop thereno more no less stop the evemail spam
or easier solution that wont take up devs time1 stop flying uninsured ships yourself2 stop flying ships you cant easily repalce3 stop flying ships with no tank4 stop going afk outside of the station5 stop waiting for an enemy to attack you ebfore you warp out honestly the second someone in a cheap combat ship appears on grid and starst moving towards youand big one here6 stop flying mining ships by yourself you wanna mine get in a mining corp because solo mining is the elast profitable thing in this game at elast in a group with boosts you can somewhat increase the iskminute
why not there are faction cruisers and faction battleships and they would be awesome ships i think there is a need for one between the cruisers and the battleships and they could be based on current designsafter looking at the roles attributes fittings and the prices of the current classes of standard faction and advanced battleships and then comparing them against the current classes of standard and advanced battlecruisers i think we could use these new ships based on the midlevel pricing they would be offered at alone camo colored faction bcs all it takes is a stroke of the programmers pen you decide
why notwould be cool to see a fleet issue bcs stop the evemail spam
bump please support or offer ideas to help this become a concept worth ccps time
it wouldnt be any profit to pod yourself if person1 sets a bounty on person2 then they can set up a bounty contract that is available to all those people who have trainedgot sufficent standings to use the bounty hunter system then person3 can accept the bounty contract and receive kill rights for a set time like 3 days or we ccp wants after placing a nominal collateral fee if the person3 kills person2 then person3 receives a portion of the bounty like 80 or we if person3 doesnt kill person2 in the required time then bounty contract goes back to person1 for resubmittal also the amount of time could be set to a few days or a week or whatever your would like to purchase perhaps we could set the nominal bounty fee to be like 5mil for 3 days 10mil for a week or something to that extent there still may be some flaws here to work out but this is the reason its in the forums to get worked on ok i got a brain fart now so i need the next nerd to chime in lolpossibly if the person1 placing the bounty could put up the fee to place a bounty then deposit the isk that will serve as the bounty and make the bounty contract available to his aliance or corp only or possibly set a bounty contract to a specific person just like we can with regular contracts this would alleviate the ease of using an alt toaccept bounty contracts on your main account also as proc said perhaps there should be sec requirements for bounties ie only those people with lower than 10 sec status can have a bounty set on them and only those with sec status over 10 can accept bounty contracts that would keep people that dont want to be innocent victums from getting bounties placed on them if you dont pirate  you wont get a bounty placed
i like this one minus the skill parti seem to remember there being a topic that discussed this in the form of players issuing kill contracts that grant takers kill rights to their intended targets
have bounties set by players as they are at presenttie the payout to ship death rather than podkilling to make it viable in empire spacecap the amount paid out for any one kill at half the value of the ship destroyed after platinum insurance if evekill can estimate the isk value of losses with reasonable accuracy so can ccpif theres still money left in the bounty pot after the kill it rolls over to be paid out the next time the target is killedwith the value of the payout for any one kill capped at half the actual isk value of the ship destroyed it becomes impossible to game the system by killing yourself with an alt since doing so will always lose you more isk than the bounty is worth
huh i think that might actually be a bounty system worse then the existing one a token attempt to stop people from collecting bounties on themselves is laudable but its cancelled out by a number of bad moves1 theres no reason to restrict bounties to unrepentant pirates after all career pirates and suicide gankers carefully micromanage their sec status to continue their piratical acts and bounties could be a good way of going after them2 theres no reason why bounty funds should degrade over time otherwise why would anyone contribute to them heck i could see arguments for bounties increasing over time as the scc invests the bounty funds at a marginal interest rate to encourage the bounty hunters3 there shouldnt be any way to shed a bounty that doesnt involve someone collecting on it ever merely ratting for a few hours should not be sufficient to undo the consequences of any action serious enough that other players put their money on the line to punish you for itfor somehow managing to propose a bounty system worse then the existing one i rate this bounty proposal 15 stars
that would just lead to people putting big bounties on alts then podding them periodically to reap the additional funds put in by the sccin a game with alts and multiple accounts theres no way to ensure that a highpriced bounty wont be collected by a friend or alt of the person with the bounty since we also have near unlimited jump clones you cant even count on the pod kill resulting in implant lossdue to game mechanics bounties in eve will probably never be more then fluff or a badge of courage
noall rats need wh aiperiod
1 makes missions more challenging therefore more fun and will also encourage more team play in empire
i think maybe a  per 15 minutes that needs to be dealt for the timer to reset but ill be honest i like the idea for the new system
totally agree with both points to that end remove the ewar immunity from supercaps immediately
first off the helios issue i would think standard protocol after this change will be for fleets to insure their shinys are all safe before evac system if they cant go kick that helios off of you long enough for you to disappear then that alliance doesnt deserve your shipthe pendulum before this change has very much been in favor of the logoffer now its swing very much the other direction but what real abuse will this cause people are supposed to be careful about logging off with aggression does this spell doom and gloom for those that crash or log off while aggressed yes but is that really a horrible thing no is it fair given how the current logoff mechanics have been blatantly abused i think this change is appropriate

why not allow name change once per lifetime if you made a mistake at the begging and choose some stupid number to your name because you werent sure will you even keep playing why not give one time name change onlyas far as limitation goes i would suggest1 you standing sec status remain the same as they were before2 your new name is  y aka old name for like 3 months and then it is just y where y is new name3 your name is changed on every list watch list contacts and notification is sent to those people4 you cant change your name if you have kill rights5 you cant change your name with negative sec status6 you can change your name only once7 payment would be plex 3000 aurum 5 10 dont careand dont tell me about scamming what could you possibly scam do you remember names of scammersgankers and rest maybe you do for few of them but there could always come somebody new so that doesnt make difference since you probably dont know every single of them on serverin rl you can change your name but all your rep goes with it if you need to go to jail youll go to jail even after name change so rep stays the same maybe implement new tab with old name or write it down at employment history as name change from x to yand yeah one time name change would be used mainly by player who simply wish to change their name and keep sp if somebody really wants to scam you or something hell make alt and do it anyway i dont see the argument against that if you can change your corp you could change your name as welloh yeah and there should be rule against caps lock names d

yes and that is always the problem i doubt if there will ever be a 100 foolproof system as there is always some way around itthe best idea that i have heard to date is probably tradeable kill rights ie i can sell my kill rights to a mercenary for a sum and they can claim the bounty on completion pod kill naturallywhether that bounty should be open to all or just the persons purchasing the kill rights is debatable however would certainly reduce the chance of abuse particularly if reputable merc corps can claim the kill rights obviously that would also create problems however it might at least be a starting point in working out a solutionedit pod kills would have to be allowable on targets with kill rights to make this work once only for each kill right i honestly cant see a problem with that however its something else for consideration
these are in no particular order just as they occur to meui improvements long overdue and good for anyone playing eve in anyway make pi manufacture and research less of a clickfest as a beginning decent hisec wardec mechanics current system is not goodget the bounty hunting profession working bounty hunting profession suggestion not ideal but a good starting point for discussionremove ice belts and replace them with scannable sites such as depletable comets would make ice mining a proper jobdo something about mining to make it more interesting and harder to bot been plenty of suggestions but no feedback or actionreal smuggling mechanics something to encourage blackmarket trade between hisec and losecpos changes been needed across hi lo null and wh space for a long time
the following is suggested as one of the and as a possible  sports in the sense of ancient rome gladiator fights rather than todays baseball matches regular permanent alliancetournamentlike events with ladderrank list betting and bookmakers and yes this will most probably involve limited access areas deal with itpain is weakness leaving the body
want this so bad
for the most part i do industrial stuff manufacturing occasionally invention and market activities in generalsurprisingly the single most annoying thing for me is the mechanism for checking orders its a tiny tiny thing that really annoys me to hell and back i have to go through my orders list and do rightclick  view market details for every single one every line contains a infobutton at the end yet a doubleclick also shows the info window can we please have the double click remapped to view market details who uses that show info anywayalso the science slots on highsecstations should be taken a look at they were scaled for a totally different amount of players and this shows i dont know what kind of queuetimes are deemed ok but some types of slots copy  me research are just booked for months in advancenow for he question on how the game is accessible to the occasional gameri would really like to have some at least remotely challenging combat activity for players older than 23 months at that point l4s are starting to be quite easy to do logging in for 12 hours just to do l4s is just boring a mindless grind against enemies with the intelligence of a mothwe now have the sleeperincursion ai please use it there is so much that could be done with that currently the only combatencountercontent are missions and the only one paying well are l4s im not counting unknownexploration sites as they can be done in a badly fitted frigate and are fine content for newer players just like highsec beltrats also both basically dont pay anythingwhere are the missions where i have to fight just a hand full of npcs but where the ships are similar in strength to a player ship instead i get a mindless blob of npcs where i can tank 15 bs plus 15 bc with some frigs cruisers mixed in in a single player bs the best tactic is usually to just sit there wait until everything is dead maybe crawl towards a gate 50km away give us stuff that is closer to the way pvp works smaller exiting engagements with strong enemies acting with more intelligence than just fly towards player orbit and shootgive us missions where we dont know if the enemy will be long or shortrange fit and where that actually makes a difference where are missions designed for ships other than bshacbcthere could be a stranded sip that desperately needs an engine part given by agent and need to be dropped off by me ship acts as a container dropping the part completes the mission i can either go in with a cloaky frigate but have to maneuver around debris form the fightexplosionwhatever to not be decloaked or go with an interceptor and outmaneuver them or go in with an assaultfaction frig and take them out but 510 incursion ai based npcs t1 player frig equivalents are nothing trivial to fight nothing bigger than a frigate can enter this would be challenging and fun allow for a variety of solutions and so onhow about missions that have a bunch of remoterepairing frigates andor cruisers where you have to get them to break up the group to lower their tank or bring a risky gank fit one way would be to have a structure nearby shooting it would cause some to stop attacking you and start repairing the structure be far enough away and you can take out the remaining group or just have small fleets frigcruisers with true support logistics which also warp out when you come to close or aggress them and warp back in after a while giving you a window to bring down one other ship or you use the time to maneuver close to their warpinspot allowing you to tackle them and stop them from warping out or have a friend with an interceptor help tackle them smal group activity much smaller than incursion group requirementsyes there are the smallest incursion sites scout but those are clearly meant for newer players and pay next to nothing also i personally cant do incursions that often even though i like it since i generally have to fly 20 jumps or so and then im outside of my regular region and cant adjust market orders also getting an armor fleet together is just a pain  and i fly only armor taking 2 hours to form a fleet isnt a rare occurrence and might even be unsuccessful after that amount of time its clearly not an option for someone who just wants to play for an hour or two some comparable solo content maybe paying similar to l4s so significantly below groupincursionpayouts would be really nice and much appreciatedwhat is annoying me too much can be done with bots mining in particular just remove belts completely and move all mining content either to exploration or at least in a way similar to anomalies this could be done everywhere of course might be less important in lowsec though this can and should include icehighsec war mechanics need to be fixed but it will probably still end in station games anyway mostly with 5 neutrals repping and redocking whenever they want due to remote repping not causing an agression timer this is a problem but its all well documented and i dont think i need to go into details on it make bounties useful the link in one of the post before mine doesnt work but there has to be some suggestion on how to do this i personally would at least allow for the option to make nonpublic bounties like for corpalliance only which pay out on the destruction of the ship not pod or have bounties include a way to make engaging in highsec possible but be careful with something like that a way would be contractlike bounties allowing whoever accepts the contract to engage the target everywhere including pod but again hard to balance and be made exploitsafe
the one thing that bugs me the most is the contact list please fix that most of the time it does not tell you correct info when hunting war targets remote reps need to be looked at the orca and the being able to switch ships in the middle of a fight without the orca getting aggressed now that the undock timer has been removed i am think the only option is to flag the orca red if it is used in anyway by an aggressed target not sure if this has already been fixed i donUFFFDt fall for that trick anymore also thank you for asking this is the first thread i have seen in a mountain of crap about 00 and elite speaking homies cutting down anyone that thinks clearly or ramblings from a self indulgent stalin want to be please remember what this game needs the most is new players not to pamper the rich and famous or hand tissues to crying vets this winter expansion offers zero to the new player if sub numbers are the biggest concern and from all the crying in general it sounds like it is then we royally fed up and ccp has been on the right track all along with the development of incarna too bad as a player base we cannot support then when they try and be innovative if this keeps going i will see you in wow or one of the other million clones that is all we will have left and it will be our fault in not supporting one of the few companies willing to break the mold and try something innovative and new i for one will support eve and ccp and trust ccp they have made the best mmo on the market and the only game i have played longer than a few months and i have no reason to doubt they will offer quality goods in the future they have some new products coming and if we donUFFFDt support them we will not only lose eve but also some potential ground breaking games in the future so get your head out of your ass and get behind ccp instead of allowing this bs in the press player written press that is to drive one of the only good games out of existence i know thatUFFFDs what goons like to do but seriously enough is enoughwhat press you may askexpanding the realm of terrorin the long term i would like to see hisec itself become a realm of misery and fear in the past two weeks as i have been murdering miners i have found the average hisec dweller to be truly execrable imagine the worst iskmonger of the northern coalition selling supercaps to the very people trying to destroy him and then imagine that smug  protected from any and all risk by concord the most common insult i have seen in hisec is some trivial im richer than you wallet epeen contest as if any of them have riches from scrabbling at veldspar with their bloodied fingernailsperhaps ive taken the stalinist gimmick too close to heart but this enrages me it is my hope that through a combination of technetium targeted strikes on bottleneck assets and the service of dread pirates we can send these people into a paroxysm of misery nullsec is a small and insular group of players most of us have been killing each other for years and changed sides so many times we cant keep track of who were angry at podding happens so often that it isnt even discussed by contrast hisec is virtually untouched by deathlust and aggression  rather than being de rigeur  is shocking and disruptive to their gameplay there are barely any tears left in nullsec yet hisec is a veritable geyser this is from our beloved leader but you know thatthis makes the csm look like dicks do you really give a  about highsec some how i feel highsec players are talking to a brick wall above is why i dont want anything to do with 00guess it is my fault i voted for you guys and was happy at first becasue ot this artical
perhaps instead of compressing gas which may get complex this means you now have 5 different subtypes for each skill level each with a different volume perhaps the new ship can have a dedicated gas hold whose capacity can increase by say 20 per skill level this lets those cool rotating tanks come into play too
sounds cool too i though about compressing the gas for making this type of mining different from the others as ore and ice mining are different between them but a bigger cargohold is always useful
awesome suggestions ifwhen lowsec does get improved its stuff like this thatll make it worthwhile supported
why not 2 new skills then1 requiring additional clones 1 to shorten the time down tie both to informorph 5 as a prereqas for the ops idea  if folks want to spend fortunes putting clones at every single station with different implants  imo go for it thats a pretty decent tradeoff that really wouldnt hurt anyone better than having spare ships and implants sitting around  its used up already so cant be resold
is there an antilike button for this post
if theres an intent to remove ice remove all of it the entire mechanic of getting it through mining and instead use pi produce hw lo and isotopes one generic version now from various twoplanet combinationsscaling already exists for highlownullwh allows wh access to last pos fuel ganking still possible in all spaces stront only made by reacting the above in the same system used by boostersboost to low sorta and slight nerf to high towers  compensating for the new wardec rules rework the mackinaw as a gas minerthis type of ship is finally available boost to boosterlow and wh folks
this is good but theres one major problem i can think of people often select wormholes based on the pi available systems with full pos fuel pi being idea if this were enacted people may find their systems no longer capable of sustaining their pos now we have to import ice fuels anyhow but this would instead shift survival to an unpredictable supply instead of a reliable supply initially it would be chaotic and provide undo burdens on a huge number of wormhole dwellers and everyone else that runs a pos now if the base materials were available across most or all planets that problem goes away and it also makes planets that may have been less than desirable suddenly worth doing pi onthis could be made to work and work well
1 the csm is supposed to help ccp improving the game and they spend their time for it without any payment2 gsf is not a csm alliance thats meant to look over you honestly are you on drugs  we play this game like everybody else and we do what we want to because its fun3 one of the main features in eve is that if somebody just tries hard enough he or she can force you into pvp everywhere deal with it
sorry all rl call me away to do this thing called interstate workUFFFDto the very enlightening comments made below by some playersUFFFDpvp without risk of any sort is a nogo for a good many people as youll soon find out its a principle thingUFFFD and UFFFDno because i consider one of the fundamental principles in the game is that a loss has a meaning ie it hurtsUFFFDeve is a game for people of many skills some people would like to try other parts of the game with limited risk why not let a new player find out that his new bs setup sucks with no loss not all players have a spare 10 bill isk and 80k  skills to the pvp UFFFDitUFFFDs a principle thingUFFFD having players rage quit thus loss of income for ccp because they just lost their new ship they spent months saving up for is bad for all yes i know i know if you can not afford to lose it do not undock in the last six years i lost count of how many times i head that but to some new players they just like to see what that new ship looks like in space know if it can tank as well as the last with the lower skills for new class get a UFFFDmateUFFFD lol to test out its tank etc a lot better that a rage quit to find out it sucks just look at what ccp have managed to do with an increased income stream if some one wants to live in a simulated pvp world why not let them the only real affect it will have on real eve is more players that more ccp content UFFFDhonestly if you want to try some stuff out get your corp to sign up to the test serverUFFFD yep you can do this but it can be time consuming and can reset at any time plus itUFFFDs a test server notice the word testUFFFD its not the same eve world this function would give very fast access to new and old players to test out a setup with out having to dual installupdate and transfer a toon data plus it gives you fast access to any toon you have on a single login as stated else ware in this thread using the test server can be UFFFDa painfully long and convoluted processUFFFDUFFFDallow for an ingame recording setup that allows you to watch the playback on your nice inquarters displays this will give fcs the opportunity to rewatch a fleet engagement and established where things went rightwrong and thus formulate after action reports to tweak their fleet standard operation procedures tactics and techniquesUFFFD a great idea adding an ingame recording function into this simulated pvp environment thus not affecting real eve is a good plan good for working out tactics i know it can be done some of you may of heard of a mmo called rift it has an ingame recording function that you also upload to utube while still in the game so it can be done this would also allow for as stated else ware in this thread the ability to UFFFDcreate some amazing youtube videosUFFFD easier to create videos the more on utube thus more free adds for eveUFFFDbecause its safe it will eventually come to replace casual pvp why is this well why would you go out and try to find pvp and risk your actual ship when you can do the same thing in a simulationUFFFDcasual pvp now that a fun expression normally used by the player with 75k skills on a new player that is the problem there is no casual pvp in eve in 00 if not blue you kill in low sec all are targets even corp mates i have found out smiles empire wardecs  faction warfare  ganks before concord turn up i see no casual pvp here UFFFDthe thing you have to ask yourself is do you really want to tie up ccp programing resources for something that already existsUFFFD as i said above if you used in game functions like jump clones to this space with auto medical insurance on death we already have space in real eve players can not get to only gmdev so you just add some more for this for simulated pvp  setup testing  fc fleet training etc  itUFFFDs a limited change thus i think a smaller change in code that you thinki summary this function will give players a chance to try ship setups they may never risk in real eve plus if a new player only wants to play in this norisk pvp why say they are wrong itUFFFDs a norisk and nogain but itUFFFDs still a player paying ccp for time so it helps keep eve in the black if you want riskgain pvp you need to undock as always
i really dont think you get the point of this game
since you fail to specify why said unspecified person doesnt get the point of this game then i can only reply withnoyou dont get the point of this gamei have already made my case multiple times as to why this would benifit players of eve as have othersi can only assume you think eve is about pvp if this is the case you would be wrong eve is about a lot of things but primarily about everybody having fun thier way in the sandbox if that means testing fits in a safe simulated environment before running out to nullsec with no experience and losing a billion isk ship then thats what eve is about for them
lol casual is what you make of it i usually just make it out to be whats funwhat is fun for me taking out an expensive piece of hardware and throwing it out onto the field of battle a place where the trust of your wingmatescorpmates to fit their ships well and follow the plan you all agreed upon is paramount you trust that everyone is following the primaries doing their respective jobs well you are looking to see anything that might threaten you or your wingmatescorpmates and the whole time you know that if something goes horribly wrong eg someone fit their ship horribly wrong someone didnt do what they were supposed to no one was paying attention to local to see that number spike etc then you have not only just lost a few hours to a day worth in isk you have assisted in everyone else losing their hard earned isk and the time it will take the recoup itthe fun come from the rush of something at stake take away that reason for players to plan better fit better and generally be better pilots and you wont see people fight as hard so why is pretty much everything in the game geared towards player versus player interaction and allow for people to interfere with your activities when you might or might not want them to
youre right goons have had such a hard time getting a foothold in nullsec well probably have to disband for lack of space to do anythingbutbut its highsec insurance is just a waste of money
angry mobs best mobs
not true ganker to resives back insurance and loses noting sec status is not inaf punishment for ganking that shows in number off high sec ganks over all check kbs once a time and hulk is t2 ship or makinaw so you resive noting close to the ship cost even with highest insureance so lets make calcualtionganker cheep ship at max 100 milj with all fiting insurenace covers atleast 60 milj form lose at max 40 milj loseminer 250 milj with all fiting insurance cover 4 milj lose 244 miljconclusion ganker lost only 40 milj in atack miner lost lath more 244 miljin real life i culd get back form ppl all that money in eve i dont have mechanics get out from them money ho damaget my property even if i wuld not insure a ting property was damaget from mader ppl actions they wuld need pay me back or get arested and sit long long time in jal so even not close to the rl so curent mechenics wrong eve looking form rl prospective
hisec is not and has never been safe only safer i still find it hard to believe that anyone who has played long enough to get out of a noob ship hasnt been able to crowbar that simple fact into their skull the only way to stay perfectly safe in eve is to stay docked you should rejoice in the risk implicit in eve as that is what makes the game worth playing even in hisec though only just hisec is a stagnant overpopulated pool and lifts it above the mediocrity of most other mmosends sermon steps off soapbox 
i agree with your postthere are things and initiatives happpening atmit is useless to post it here as a good portion of csm follwers and supporters are actually the responsibles of much of all griefing can flipping and other abusive activities in eveplease contact me in eve tonight for further detailsrolds
this is a pvp game with some pve content dont like it dont play iti dont like vampires so i wont be playing wod no matter how well done it is
oh but you do engage in player vs player activity everytime you log inif you mine like i do in hisec space then you compete with other players for the best belts in the systemif you build stuff for the open market then you compete with other players for the best prices ie price warsif you day trade then you compete with other players in trade warshow you forget that eve is all pvp just not always combat relatedsome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
if you mine in hisec like i do you can easily make upwards of 100mil a day with two hulks and an orca so it would only take you a few days to recover from a suicide gank you dont need to buy a plex to make money you just want to take a short cut but as you are finding out the short cut isnt really so short now is itsome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
dont lose your time with this guys graycosoon we will have a way to express ourselves believe me
i play eve because i like it that doesnt mean that enjoy morons to take advantage of the game flaws to be a hasslego do some incursions and stop firing mackinaws cowards
you are obviously misinformed on the game mechanics of eve being able to attack others in hisec is apart of the game not a flaw the only flaw in eve is the belief that you are safe in hisec the best advice i was ever given as a new player was for every hour you play eve you should spend an hour reading on how to play evedont complain because there is a player base that understands the game mechanics better than you it just belittles you and your efforts ingamesome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
yeah but the qq factor would be justified in some situationsthere you are youve got your target and are shooting away in comes a shuttle across your line of fire and concord intervenes  you show a shuttle kill and a lost shipthen again chasing a ship around a planet trying to get a clear line on them to open fire exiting the far side of a pos from hostiles to fly off in safety it would add some dimensions to combat that dont currently existi understand why they dont allow hiding behind ships and the like but some celestials would make sense so i guess it would need some cautious looking at if they ever really considered it
at first i was hell no but after reading the different views here it seems like interetsing ideasmore micromanagement would be nice on fleet battlesreally liked trebor idea to force fleets to works on different units at different pointsthe way to do it however dunnoand it would be funny if succeeding to kill an ennemy titan make half the subcap close to him explode just after would means attacking it at close range is pretty dangerous however as you risk getting the whole attacking fleet destroyed with the target
the only must have from perp is the option to automatically rejoin a fleet after you disconnectinternal corporate markets would be worth a look but it could destroy the overall economy
you obviously werent around for the last insurance change
signing up for my republic fleet issue hurricane now
all you do with this is giving defender a hilarious advantage over roaming gangs because the roaming gang must be carefull with warping while the defender can do whatever they want with plenty of fuel nerbythis will actually discourage small gang warfare as you are always at the risk of running out of fuel with hit and run tacticsonce you are out of fuel a defending fleet will be able to intercept your frigateshacs with bs thanks to the lowered warpspeedand good luck managing meaningfull fuel depots in the enemies core systemhonestly if you want an anti blobb mechanism introduce a warpspeed modifier for fleets that is based on the combined mass of all fleet ships 250 frigates work fine 50 bs work fine 250 bs not so muchhell thats a better idea than yours and still bad
nopain is weakness leaving the body
there are some annoying things about war dec be good to look into themthere are some differences also between corpalliance war decs and i cant see why1 why can a corp only dec 3 entities at once i dont see why this is should be just like alliances unlimited2 if you are a corp and you have currently less that 3 war decs then as usual some corps leave the all alliance you are at war with this classes as another war dec on your list thus with the 3 dec restriction it stops you from doing anymore again they shouldnt act as a separate war i know its only for 24 hours but if you need to do a war dec urgently this adds an extra day obviously implementing item 1 will resolve this issue3 when a corp leaves an alliance during a war dec they are classed as surrendered then why are there no deals made on this surrender as per the mechanics they should either close a deal or made to be in the war up to the time the week would end  corpwardecendate  alliancewardecendate they shouldnt be able to simply leave and thats it we know the current alliance hopping issue needs to be sorted really4 why is it you can dec immediately if your in an alliance but have to have a corp vote if your in a corp thus waiting 24 hrs surely all corps in the alliance would need to vote on this it has a bigger impact i would assume allowing corps to immediately dec and alliances to have a corpceo vote would be better it dont make sense make it the same at least either way5 these silly stopping you deccing mechanics when corps are half inbewteen leaving when you do the dec is silly it takes 24hrs for the war to be active anyway by then the corp would of already left so i dont see the point of this6 if you dont have enough money in your corp wallet pop and ask if you want this money transfered from either another division or your personal wallet just makes it a bit easier im sure there are some more ill try post if i rememeber them

wait is this the wow forumnope it is eve it is getting i cannot tell the difference dont worry everyone your custom diapers will be avalible on the nex next week maybe mommmy will let you buy then and you can stay up late that night and filling then with your 
i have further described my feelings on darius the thirds recent actions in the following blog post
where can one find this evidence you speak of
i covered in my blog post but heres the original article
herp you fail this is just about buffing low sec you are just wasting web space and good at i support low sec love
losec to me is like the kids playground at school with a bundle of bullies trolling around picking on people and taking their dinner money then when you fight back and look like winning all their mates bundle in and kick the crap out of youwhile the answer may be to join a pvp corp and come in a group my schedule doesnt really allow for that and i tend to snatch a couple of hours of eve of a night when i have time i suspect that quite a number of carebears fall into that category and if you really want us to come venture into lo you need a solution that doesnt involve us rocking up and being cannon fodderperhaps given the point someone else made about losec stillbeing empire theres some scope to tweak faction warfare to incorporate skirmishes with the piwate factions which should allow for some local activity rather than stuff halfway across the galaxy while giving some benefit to those who want to be on the pirate side
i would really like a stock market and i gort some ideas how to do this but it seems like my post dont get posted for some reason 
for number 3 it has already been done in fact it was done so well that when when it came to its predictable end it got a mention as one of the top griefer moves in mmo history7 dck moves in mmo history  page 2edit damn filter you have retype the actual word into the link to go there
shahi understand your points but dont think its impossible to track financial services could be given and provided through account info if the user doesnt pay theb the credit card is being chargedan i agree with hrs previous comment if our suggestions dont match csm heads pwrsonal interests then the post is left aside or we are answered with very limites thoughts or depth in the comments
i agree it happens that is some smart solutions are being raised and are not in line with csm heads personal interests then u are left asideplease contact me in eve tonight id like to chat with u about this
well and what about the other ideas
hey all i know that a bunch of us have ideas for ship that we can use here in the eve space and we would like to get them out there and see what people think so i feel that here in the forum there should be a topic just for new ship ideas and the fit outs for them and really it would be nice i have a whole list of ideas that would make great ships and stuff like that but i can not find a good place to put them so can we open up a new spot for the ship ideas and thank you all an have a good day
two things1 this is not a bad idea in and of itself2 for it to work op needs to post a few good ship ideas of his own not just call for ideas this whole forum exists for the explicit purpose of calling for ideas and anyone who has a really good ship idea would be posting it somewhere already
the bounty capping is a great idea that fixes the issue with alt killing as you said however there still should be an interface with concord to provide legal killrights to facilitate the role players and ingame content requirements im sure if we keep bumping the thread and refining the concept well eventually have a perfect option for ccp to work withthanks for the support
i like this one a lot you would still however have to deal with people putting large bounties onsomeone and them never undocking from station you suggestion has a lot of merit and sounds very interesting
i am a selfproclaimed smallscale marketeer looking for the big  and i enjoy the spreadsheet version of eve just as much as the client however there is one problem that arises the lack of exportable data from marketsat the moment you can export a limited number of things gamelogs chatlogs and static market logs of the buy  sell orders on the market all i am asking is for the data that can be exported to be increased to include the following itemsprice historytransaction historywallet historyassetsthese things are already downloaded from the server so all it would really need is some txt formatting and a button that says download this would make the market analysis i do so much more fun id no longer have to handcopy the average price  volumes of trit on the jita market to excell
not because you are the csm means that you represent all gamersyou are only taking care f your alliances interests and leaving aside important minorities that are supportive to some ccp initiatives asidethings will start to change sooner or later u cannot fool ccp much longer
im thinking you might need to get some professional help soon your obsession with eveuni is getting slightly disturbing
as a new player running a couple of low level missions i noticed that projectiles can pass through space objects asteroids space stations etc i think it would be an improvement if objects played a factor in whether or not a projectile can hit you i dont know if its possible to have some visual representation of projectiles hitting asteroids or the shields of a station but at least some type of programming formula where space objects factored into whether projectiles could hit you would add a real strategic element to space combat if ships could hide in asteroid fields or flee around a planet
i think at one point it was in the game then taken out because of the lag monster maybe just for missiles though
not sure im relatively new to the game bout a year i thought there could be resource issues of graphicallly displaying projectiles hitting objects though know sure what it would take to figure it into a formula of some type
not sure im relatively new to the game bout a year i thought there could be resource issues of graphicallly displaying projectiles hitting objects though know sure what it would take to figure it into a formula of some type
yeah if it was there and then taken out it was long before i started playing as well if it can be done whilst keeping the lagmonster at bay then it would add some interesting things to fights
would be cool if it doesnt make a huge lag as velicitia said would be really interesting
the odds of employing such a tactic however is few and far between and likely going to cause problems the lols to be had in invoking concord by hiding behind stations would be funnyalbeit a little ridiculous stop the evemail spam
errrrr infernal double post glitch stop the evemail spam
in all honesty simply to make it so capsuleers dont look like special needs cases when highsec wardecing im sure it could be implemented that the ship will automatically cease fire when it reads its weapon trajectories intersecting something that is not hostile or marked to be as such so it would stop firing before it hit station or a whole group of frigs on the jita undock so as to not make highsec warfare impossible
good idea whatever way they do it i think coud result in some pretty interestng warfare tactics
this would have to apply to all effects for the sake of balance or else you just hide your ecmlogibooster ships behind supertanked battleships designed to soak up enemy fire server load would be horrendous during nullsec blob fights when youve got hundreds of ships shooting at each other thats a lot of vectors to calculate for every frame the upcoming time dilation system will come into effect much earlier with this sort of thingwhat i find more frustrating is getting stuck on an object that i am visibly nowhere near id much rather see the ships get smarter about flying around collideable objects before we got lineofsight effects
not cease fire they would have to remain active and just not cycle again until you had a clear shot otherwise it would just get stupidalso highsec combat would get a new element blocking alts big neutral nano ships intended to get in the way when things go bad
agreeing with the consensus here the math behind this sort of thing would put too much strain and therefore lag on the systems it would be easier to do with turret weapons but missiles move through space and in nullsec blobs that complicates things immensely and since it wouldnt be fair to implement a system that didnt affect one type of weapon it wont happen until processing capability or possibly data handling capability markedly improves
ok so the new nebulae coming out looks really cool and all but i just read an article that makes me think eve would be mindblowingly awesome with all of these in it as the title of the article implies
some new scenery would indeed by nice to look at if it doesnt take priority over other fixes i can support thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yeah i am not saying prioritize it over anything else but really awesome scenery in space could draw in new players what if we had specific solar systems that had storms occuring in them that actually did system wide damage to ships lightning bolt streaks accross the system at random and depending on how close to it you are depends on how much damage you take goonswarm and pl both lose in 2000 man fleet fight due to lightning destroying both fleetsawesome
thats a bit of a stretch but new visuals would be quite nicei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
one can dream
i never said it would be a good interest rate that said since there doesnt actually exist any other way of collecting interest on isk in eve as of yet thats not an appropriate mechanic and it would be exploited like you said if there was other sources of interest though itd make sense
i really dont agree with transferring characters at all so i really dont like the idea of changing names on a whim eitheri dont think its that big an issue with the vast majority of players and i would rather ccp spend their time fixing the broken aspects of spaceships and game mechanics that minor issues like namesand before the op goes all emo like she has on others that have commented in the negative this is my opinion take it or leave it
while i do argee that fixing broken things shuld be a priority however progress shuld also be a priority and altho the majority will not need  want a name change now some day im shure most will at one time want  have wanted a name change
as long as its trackable possible once once per year and awefully expensive why not but if done it should be really expensive like 5 plex for exampleif its too cheap it will be done too much and for too stupid reasons
shameless bump it really would be nice to have even just a little bit of input from a dev or even a gm on this matter
yup good idea supportedbump
current csm is comprised of the wrong people we should field a candidate to push this issue as a primary concernedit actually i hear two steps corp works in wormholes maybe he can pick this up
thing iswe know ccp is working on something for poss seems we dont know exactly what since they are keeping the nice fluffy warm details to themselves for now
priority 1 priority 2 the rest of the ui  gui
double post fail
yes thank you for cross posting and double posting and everything else inbetweenyour point relevance stop the evemail spam
not supportedi pay my monthly fee and so do you you should not get any more sp than meour toons are evenly matched because of itjust cause you live in mommy and daddys basement doesnt mean you should be getting a million more skill points than everyone elseits ccps job to run and test its product and code its our job to report any bugs and play the game
please dont confuse the mittanis newfound love of empire ganking as a csm statement of policy hes the leader of a 00 alliance with one hat and a csm with the other hat each csm has their own voice concerns and strategies for how to improve the game i do have an interest in bringing a focus to ideas that improve the overall gameplay for all players a not just some so please assist me in this by contributing to this thread and brainstorming ideas on how to make the highsec game more enjoyable for those who choose this style of gameplay i have every intention of aggregating the best ideas and advocating on their behalf to ccpi know you feel strongly about your concerns and frankly theres no way i can assuage them with words but please try not to derail this thread with that kind of stuff ok
back when i was running missions in hisec the thing i found most annoying about it was the structures some of them drop nifty little bits of minor loot which is kind of awesome especially when you get cool stuff like exotic dancers unfortunately most structures do not drop anything there is seldom if ever any hint as to what will be the case except that habitation modules of any variety seem to have drops more often then most things while generic walls and such never have drops and rogue drone structures frequently drop drone alloys yes i get that this is mostly trivial generally not worth the ammo and at best something for your drones to do while you loot the field but since youve got all that stuff out there waiting to be popped anyway why not populate it with lootit doesnt have to be good loot most of those easilypopped structures walls junctions elevators etc shouldnt yield anything more valuable then a dozen isk or so a handful of tritanium or some lowend ores or something equally forgettable but if i want to on the other hand go after a harder target like a drug lab or a hanger array or maybe one of those stationary whatever ships lying around the missions id like to actually get some kind of reward out of it it doesnt have to be a big reward but should be something random and unusual like i sometimes found by popping hab modulesbeing taunted with rare drops of unusual but forgettable items only some of the time at whim is just annoying generally id like to see structures drop things about as often as wrecks they dont have to be awesome things but some physical recognition of the fact that i went out there and blew something up even if it winds up being a random useless item would be vastly better then the existing system of mostly nothing and occasionally something kind of interesting but not actually valuable
many highsec folk would ike to get out to null its just impossible to go alone and they are treated like  in large alliancesalso never nerf highsec missions mining or anything really it wont helpsomething new for highsec would be nice an arena establishments would even be good but something new to dohighsec needs something that is its own even if its not super rewarding on isk but something that people cant do in lownullwh space
hisec is fine  what needs to happen is that lowsec gets boosted a bit to drive people out that way the new pi stuff should help maybe not right away  but in the longer term as people realise that if they stop being 5 man industrial corp 23413465 and merge together with the other four 5man industrial corps now being 25man industrial corp 123341 they can better pool their resources to get stuff done however said 25man industrial corp isnt yet ready to venture into lowsec they need to either take some combat classes i know a few corpsalliances do this just cant remember the name offhand or find a way to draw in 510 combat capable pilots aka missionrunners to help make a push into low
this is prolly a huge trap but oh wellhighsec is fine as it isexcept maybe for hsec mag sites they are soo worthless they are just wasted space on the server imo lowsec is the problem hereimo lowsec is crap the rats are crap the ore is crap and the pvp is annoying crap imo instead of going with the whiners who say nerf high sec start thinking about buffing lowsec to the point that people want to go down but not to the point that null sec alliances will just stripmine itmaybe either reduce or remove the security status hit for killing people thus encourage more pvp as none of us non 10s can really enjoy ratting our sec back up and maybe reduce the tracking on gate sentrys so that you can use frigs or fast nano fit cruisers for gate camping but if a single web goes on you it becomes a oh  moment up the value and amount of battleship rats in low sec so there will prolly be more people ratting and more people killing said ratters ps moving l4 missionsincursionsoreice to low sec wont force people to go there you try forcing someone to play your way and see how well that goes
this sticky link is a listing of all the ideas that have been proposed and is being tracked by a dev 
this damn forum has eaten my post twice nowremoving insurance for concordaggression losses is a nobrainer no insurance agent is going to pay out a policy on a vehicle lost due to criminal activity much less 8 times per day suicide ganking should be a more calculated risk for the attackers on the expected value of the drop insurance shouldnt matter to anyone doing it for a bounty on ice miners or because theyre bored and want to waste money attacking a nonwtsmall scale arenas with betting options yes yes it attracts folks to pvp who would otherwise not bother and can lead to hilariously obvious oddsriggingas far as highseccers and politics the problem is a compound one highseccers tend to be casual players who dont want to or cant toss in the time required to be relevant in a null alliance or form up into small gangs for lowsec roams casual play is perfectly legitimate and accounts for significant revenues for ccp but theyre not organized and only barley pay attention to csm politics if at all when their concerns are marginalized or ridiculed by powerblocs the usual response is you should have voted run for office formed an alliance etc whats more likely here is that the casual player will simply quit why spend money on a game where nobody cares about you they take their subscription fees with them as well as the fees of their casual friends who also leave since their friends are gone and the winners of the political argument wind up being the losers in the final result along with ccp now that the csm has moved from being a pr stuntmouthpiecet20 bandaid there should be a way to get casual players into the political process even if its just a stupid little can of i voted quafeon that note props to rat if this thread isnt just a giant troll p
i actually laughed irl at this bit seriously dude where have you beeneve is all pvp that guy mining in a hi sec belt supplying minerals for ships for pvp that industry dude doing pi for pos fuel supplying fuel for poss that are used in lownull for pvp purposes everything in eve revolves around ships getting blown upas to a simulator in eve to simulate eve thats just dumb seriously dumbthe whole point of eve and the reason most people play it is because there is risk take away risk and you will not add to the subscriptions ccp will lose thousands of accounts as all the people in lownull sec stop logging in and when they go so goes the carebear aspects of eve so no more mining or whateveri started in hi sec like everyone else did i have played for 4 years and i have gone through all the problems and mistakes that eve has to offer i learned and i improved basically you guys just dont want to take the time to learn and improve you want eve for dummiesi for one would hate to see something like this in eve as it renders all the time and effort all the people that were here before you went through you demean the efforts of all people that improve with ideas like this
if eve was about pvp then that would be the only thing to do in eve its not grow a brainhate to break it to you but there is a lot of other things in eve to do and they dont all gear towards pvp pvp is a singular aspect of the game i have friends that have played eve as long as me that have never even bothered to try pvp that have never went to nullsec unless they had to
what part of pvp in eve isnt already simulated what youre actually proposing is simulated simualated pvp or shuld it be virtual virtual pvp evevvpvpftw maybe
now the conversation is just getting stupid to the op keep going with it its a good idea despite they naysayers nitpicking at stupid little things and those that think eve is only about what they specifically do in the game it likely wont be something implemented anytime soon or ever for that matter but you never know
i really like the new ideas that ccp is coming out with for pi private cos is going to revolutionize pi and for the better just like i said now we will have pi professionals doing the pi work and our products are going to be worth a lot more 1 for ccp imolokiish
basically what i most need on the science and industry window is an indication of the resource capacity of my planets its that capacity that tells me when i need to visit my planets to restock supplies and haul away finished goods thatd be a fairly easy indicator to add in except that the capacity in question always winds up being the capacity of my launchpads since anyone who does pi seriously runs through the launchpad instead of the command center since you might wind up having multiple launchpads on a given planet depending on your setup that complicates things
concord podding gankers just means they use jump clones or use cheap implants it would have zero impact on gankingthe goons are presently engaged in an operation to affect the market and that requires destroying mining barges and exhumers in high sec this is an invasion a guerilla war being fought by the goonswarm in order to deny their enemies resources while strengthening their own the fact that the everyday miner is impacted by this is simply a matter of course as with all wars a lot of innocent people are caught in the middle your losses are collateral damage and a means to an endand no im not a goon
dude they are goonstest sorry to burst your bubble here but they live in null sec they couldnt care less about their pod or security status as most null sec pilots dont use implantsi once felt as you did when i first started but i learned to use dscan and pay close attention to local and ships nearbyany losses you incur due to your lack of awareness is ultimately your own faulteve is a harsh complicated and dark game we like it this way and would like to keep it this waydont support this service andor product
says whodont pretend to rule this game dudewe will make this game more fun to a broader audiencegreifers will go down
we here at wildly inappropriate are willing to overlook your previous transgressions if you give us all hugsalso op is obviously mad that his riskaverse play style was interrupted in a game where pvp is nonconsensual and unlimited in scope hoorayhko is that way 
sorry no hugsbut respect and propsyesbesides your not an original goon  stop the evemail spam
you can have as many hugs as you wanti would really like to support you as i do have a lot of friends in goon unfortunately your alliance behavior is widely known for their abuses of powerin some cases you picked the wrong corps as allies you are definitely building a bad reputation
i found the troll
nope unfortunately is not a troll what you ve foundget used to it
absolutely 100 with the op on this one piracy and ganking should be hard high security space should be secure not total anarchy like it is nowgank and get concordedno insurance at all drop below a certain sec status get actively popped by concord for entering high sec rats should give less of a sec increase to pirates the lower the sec status the harder it is and longer it takes to get it back up ganking someone should give the ganked longer kill rights on the ganker than this joke of 15 minutes lets try a week and go from there a sec status of 5 or lower should allow any player to actively kill you with no reprecaution from concord
my corporation is at war with three alliances and one corporation i move through known staging systems of these organizations on a regular basis if im able to move about in highsec with that kind of ease it is far from anarchy
here is some real sound advice learn to pvp if you need lessons get in a low cost tech i frigate fly to parses and look me up im a hisec miner with a background in pvp i will be glad to show you the ins and outs no charge no humiliation just what i know about it im not the best but im not the worst either and ill be more than glad to help you learnsome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
ive spent years in nullsec and currently live in wh space i hardly need pvp practice and that is hardly the issue good luck firing back from your hauler or mining barge you think pirates target the first tengu they see so they can get the kill and 20 mill in loot nothey target haulers with valuable cargo in which they can make more money than what they lose from thier concorded ship highsec stands for high security which its not it isnt secure if the killer is able to get in and kill someone high sec is supposed to be the place the new people go and carebears can do thier thing in relative safety as it stands right now there is no safety at all
you wanna know the best partwe dont give a  what you pubbies think
highsec stands for high security which it is it does not stand for total security which some people seem to think they are entitled to
thissome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
thanks dude appreciatednevrtheless this is not the point of the postjust think about the pilots trying to mine ice inhigh sec that do not want to do multiboxing and they have personal mining embargoes from griefing corps like goons making the gameplay very boring i would at least expect to receive a war dec ganking a mackinaw in high sec is just an abuse of isk capacity and gameplay flaws helping griefersif thy are bold enough to dec there are good enough miners that are able to sustainan honorable dogfightit depends on skills and balls i believe that today miners that pvp have more than many griefers recent statistics in ship losses proves my pointminers are not afrid of pvp we will never be
uhhhhh what every hardcore miner ive ever met has been afraid of ship to ship combat even in a wellskilled fullyfit combat shipalso consider that gankers dont declare war because as soon as a carebear corp gets the notification they all leave and wait for the declaration to end suicide ganking is on of the few ways to go after people who you know will corphop
well i guess some griefers are being victims of some carebear power latelykeep doing your bestnext time youd rather be bold enough todo some incursions instead
security is relative not absoluteall life is riskif this bothers you get a helmet
im with trebor and raiden on the proposal both features already exist in eve after discoing and relogging it asks whether you want to rejoin previous fleet timeframe is 1 min iirc internal corpmarkets are done with the contracting system
yesthank you
i like the exploding ships idea alot its realistic maybe base it on a ratio between the size of the ship explodingsize of your shipdistance to the explosionif it only took a  of your hitpoints even in empire it would be ok
problem with empire in the last discussion was the gcc from the resulting explosion it would have to be carefully addressed or create no gcc at all as it would create some havoc
i think it could be even less for instance even if your really close a frigate could only take like 1 damage from a battleship blowing up if you did it this way it would encourage fleets to bring many tiers of ships as they wouldnt deal much aoe damage to each other but if you had all battleships youll more screwed for blobing
an example goonswarm wardecs testtest bs at jita undockgoonswarm shoots test bstest bs explodepeople explodetears flood the forumsno sec status or standing lossrepeatim all in for destroying highsec once and for all but hell it has to be a challengefrom another point of view we could shoot test 
so i guess you just ignored the part where we said special considerations would have to be made for high sec and gccs would have to be addressed
why ship death aoe wont workmy crew gets a bunch of ships and shoots them all down to 5 hull we park them all on the jita undock get aggression on one and pop it the resulting chain reaction deals enough damage to the freighters undocking that they are destroyed congratulations you just enabled smartbombing inside the docking radius whats more its not concord enforceableif they ever do introduce it though neutral suicide bombers are going to be a lot of fun in highsec wars
so i guess you just ignored the part where we said special considerations would have to be made for high sec and gccs would have to be addressedseriouslyfor the love of god
what i propose would be for the borders between the empireUFFFDs and null sec to be in flux this can be accomplished by during an update to a 04 system that has shown a higher use by a plus rated corp or alliance be moved to a 05 status the same could be done if a minus 10 0  00 corp or alliance moves in or continues to hold the area this may happen to 1 to 10 systems per update or maybe entire constellations during a major update ie incursion this would be more realistic of showing political changes between empireUFFFDs for materials andor expansion some ideas that would help with this1 that high sec mining belts be sized down to account for the years of mining to push miners to the outer areas or into low or null sec to make iskUFFFDs2 using the new pi plans set the tax on concord custom stations in null space 00 to 04 and 09 stations to 40 08 to 30 07 to 20 06 to 10 05 to 5  in null space to 04 a concord custom station will stay in place till 24 hours after a player owned custom station comes online at that time is will be assumed that the concord workers have been hired by the pocs or evacuated by concord a pocs will stay online till destroyed or the empire has rated the system to a level of 07 or higher at 07 concord will either pay for the pocs prorated by standing of the corp or alliance to the dominating empire or by hostile takeover once a pocs is destroyed or falls into nonuses  the planet it orbits will be inaccessible for planetary interaction till rebuilt
actually i think that concord probably shouldnt put up any customs stations in lowsec at all let player corporations andor pirates do that themselves give them a taste of nullsec conflict mechanics and the necessity of defending some expensive thing based on a timer see what happens
 concord are not supplying npc customs offices to low sec and noif you decide to live in low security space you take the hit  changing security status of a sys over an expansion will have adverse effects that you have not ever nconsidered1 traping 10 players assets in highsec this is counter to what ccp wants they like the fact that people decide to live outside the confines of the law traping assets on a whim is not ccps style2 influx of caps in highsec border systems i myself live in a 4 system and if the security status was raised then i would lose the ability to field my capital contingent this may not seem like a majure problem to you but there are plenty of 00 alliance who use these border systems to store and move capital ships this change would cause imo upheaval on par with the nex 3 changing a 5 to a 4 could potentialy cut off entire areas of space to people who need to move around udema is just one example of this  all trade lanes pass through udema not supported
i agree
this is a new and entirely unique idea i support this
i agree ships destroyed with the help of concord should not receive any insurance benefit whatsoever they should also not get a free reaper when they dock 1 to this idea
draketrain fleet issue drakesupported
supported bcs are after all some of the mostused ships in the game so having shinier versions of them for richer folks would be a good move
supported oh and by the waygrey and brown camo is fugly
last i checked eve was a game and not a job i play for fun not to sit for ages working out logistics for going further than 5 jumpsyou ask anyone that flies capitals what they hate most about them and the majority will tell you fuel and cyno chains logisitics is not fun even if the op thinks differentlytry making the game fun not a second job
better yet implement the idea for a one month trial period and make op responsibe for plotting all cyno chains refueling routes and pos logistics costing him 1 plex for every month he fails to do his job and after he si 3 plex in debt he biomassesbut seriously ship fuel is the capacitor and theoretically if they used something liek a fusion engine kind of principle as a power source a pellet only weighing 10 grams could power a city for 4 hours so im sure it could keep a frigate energiced for months making fuel irrelevant and supers basically have to be their own gate so they require a larger source of fuel hence isotopestldr ops idea was implemented at start of agme fact si ships just dont last long enough to see their capacitor run out of juice try flying the same rifter for about 3 years and im sure youd eventually need to refuel but chances are youll die months before you ever need to
of course attempts to maintain the current style of mindless megablob game play in the hypothetical new environment gets all sorts of obstacles as pointed by the highly revered opposition here which kinda proves that the idea will work pain is weakness leaving the body
the opposition could also indicate that its a crap idea that needs to be allowed to die a slow painful death
your points are sound in the mean time everyone can join dec shield alliance in order to wipe wardecs off upon us
interesting that this is still in assembly hall  and the thread to remove another csm member was moved to jita park speakers corner
thats because the mittani did nothing wrong unlike darius the third who has abused his position in the csm
this is starting to look silly his nda is with ccp and theyre the ones tasked with enforcing it if they wont do that they certainly wont remove him from the position for a few squeaky wheelseither he didnt violate it they cant prove it they dont care or theyre dealing with it internally already no matter what its beyond our control now as it should be can we stop this nonsense
bitter post is best postand of course you will have incontrovertable proof of this no i didnt think so

my main interrest is the stockmarket but i think your post had some great potentialsmarketing tools  iUFFFDve been wanting the possibility to place ads on the billboards for the price of x isk that leads to a secondary option  corporate billbords  ads on capitainUFFFDs quarters screen  corporate stationscorp shops is an interesting idea but we should keep in mind that this could overcrowd systems like jita if not controlled properlyfiscal services  to make evebanks a reality the banks need to be able to claim collateral eg ships mats items etc so that that isk cant be transfered to another char without losses  loan contracts is also an opportunity but again collateral is neededfreelance salesmen  also a good idea adjusting prices is quite boring so if contracts could be set up to have someone else do it for x  that would be greatstock market my main interest  this could open up a whole new dimension of trading in eve   as is trading corp shares is based on trust because there is zero guarantee that a scammer wont run of with the isk you invested  corp security is a major factor iUFFFDve talked to alot of ceoUFFFDs searching for corps to invest in but everybody are afraid of corptakeovers with a multi member corp 5 is enough to vote out the ceo as far as i know only single personcorps are are safe because non corp members cant replace a corp member ceo  corp history is an essential part to make this work the publicpotentional investors need to be able to see corp info like  payoutdetails corporate strategy corpage  of corp members and shareholders etc to be able to evaluate the corp shares  of course there need to be a stock market equal to the regular market where you can buy or sell shares
welli have posted one and i have plans for another here real soon too
i click on eve and dl the new patchupdateafter playing for 40 seconds or so i notice ship spinning awesomeafter spinning for 3 seconds i instinctively try to find the walking in stations camera transfer or whatever fancy trick ccp put in to allow the game to feel seamless while switching from one game mode to the otherd oh noes10 second story im on the forums now wondering if i should bother looking in game for a hidden checkboxyawnjust making the point peacesalamcypher
i apologize in advance if this post is not up to code for the hall it is my first time posting herei would like to propose a change to the directional scanners of the ships of new eden it would make myself and im sure other pilots very happy to have a drop down menu in the scanner where we could load overview settings weve already saved if the scanner is using the settings weve already saved from the overview why cant we select one of those saved settings to be on the scanner while the overview is using a different setting
i am pretty sure most would rather just revamp dscan entirely anyway
like i said i just started visiting the forums recently im not sure what other revisions to the dscanner have been suggested i think a scale bar instead of text bar for the range would also be very helpful
we have incarna kill em in station 
i too would like to see more information available via the api whenever possible
elaborate and explain yourself please
it would be nice if stations that look like they have more then one undock would work that way say a station has 5 undock ports it would just randomly pick one and you would come out there i think this would make it seem a bit more real since a place like jita would not have just one undock there is just way too much volume
supported
i would like it if players could be doing concordcustomsnavy stuff it could even make smuggling a more interesting career
to be honest i cant really think of anything about high sec that pisses me off and that might be the reason why i choose to stay there instead of low or null sec i live in a wormhole and make frequent and daily trips to high sec i enjoy the small scale pvp that wormhole life offers the lack of supercaps steamrolling everything the ease of logistics availability of trade hubs the lack of supercaps steamrolling everything the feeling of owning a little piece of new eden to call home the isolation that wormholes provide the lack of supercaps steamrolling everything and the randomness of each day living in the wormholeoh and the lack of supercaps steamrolling everythinglife in high sec is a bit safer we can do just about everything that null sec residents can do except it takes us longer to do it and is less profitable high sec life is for the patient and i think a lot of players are used to the whole concept of waiting for things it makes casual play feasible you can log in and not have to worry that a fleet of supercaps were hotdropped while you were sleeping and completely demolished your home in a matter of hoursplus where else are you going to do manufacturing low and null sec come on now thats just silly given the limited number of manufacturing slots in null sec stationsoutposts and the limited number of stationsoutposts in null sec in general manufacturing out there just isnt feasible no point manufacturing at a pos if a supercap fleet gets hotdropped in and demolishes it with such ease anyways to me high sec is mediocre at best sort of like bland cereal not great but also not terrible low and null sec is just not worth it for a variety of reasons yes it is highly profitable but its also not worth the hasslesummary of eves last four expansions
this is the kind of thing that piques my interest as you said the key word career living in empire should be a viable career path and have the same depth of experience and things to do as nullsec empire in my opinion should be an end game as much as 00 just different for a different playstyle
corporate bribery to increase standing just for pos anchoringif youre a corp of any real size and you dont recruit specifically for it you cant anchor a pos in highsec as youll never get the faction standing for it how about the ability to temporarily increase your corps faction standing say for a week or so so you can anchor a pos have increased charter costs if youre below required faction standing
problem with hi sec is that its so easy to do industry there it makes most industrial activites useless in low sec or 00it would make hi sec much more fun if you could actually go to pos and loot tech 2 bporemoved navigator
nice thread though i dont have time to read it all im not pro at eve so be kind if these ideas are ditsy 1id very much love to be able to insure my implants with how they work now i figure wearing good ones on a mobile character transporting valuablesdoing combat stuff is less viable even mining with them could be risky i suppose2it sounds like insurance pays out badly on nicer ships which makes me more freaked out to fly them it sounds like currently the insurance is based on mineral construction costs and not on the risk factor i wonder if its poss to make it a bit cheaper to insure noncombat ships like miningtransport ships than combat oneson the flip side maybe later when im more established with more isk insurance costs might not seem so extremethanks for the thread pixxieb new player podcast  pixxies eve online podcast  latest episode episode 10swtor diablo 3 inferno hulkageddon  on itunes and at
i dont give a crap if the ideas are the worst things in the world im grateful that you contributed to this and even if the core idea doesnt work out elements might be awesome so thank you
then though i think this is more metagame coming from the kugu circle jerk club i will give you the benefit of the doubt ratyou are looking for career paths how about burglar like some of the other posters have stated make it possible to rob posses in all areas of space expand on scanning code breaking and analyzing skills for this make the risk high and make it hard but possible if you fail you are destroyed by the pos defences but if you succeed you are the pink panther stealing all the goodies and leaving your calling card behindthere are some good ideas in this thread i hope you take them seriouslyedit also something about suicide ganking i like ganking and it should stay but it is unfair that the ganker gets the killmail and all the loot and the victim nothing the victim should also get a killmail for assisting concorde even if they donUFFFDt have time to fight back this will make the gankers think twice and also give the victim something to show for it or remove killmails all together concerning suicide ganking for both parties doing it for profit is one thing but buffing your killboard is just weak sauceps the mattanis killboard is getting nicely buffed cowards
dont wanna repost so linking to original
i would like to be able to form a small corp without being decked all the time  remowe war dec mechanics from hiseci would like to be able to do moon mining in hisecas im into mining manufacturing and the like i would like at lots of other players allready has suggested larger belts with roids consisting of multible oretypes
no as much as i hate the grief wardecs i have participated in a handful where they made sense ie we showed up ate all the rocks got decd  or someone else showed up ate all our rocks and got decd  fun as hell type wardecsno makes sense that theres no moongoo in hisecgo out to lesserinhabited systems chances are itll be a lot easier to get the rocks you want
i would like to see instanced pvp battlefields pretty much standard in any mmo these daysa queue system with equal x amount of players required on each sideship restrictions would apply for example frigates in high secthis would allow new players to not only get involved in viable pvp at an early stage at a low cost but also a great way for players to meet other like minded people this could be tied into faction warfare or just random fightsim sure this has been mentioned before and of course there are plenty of pros and cons but it would definitely add a lot of fun
supported gas harvesting as is involves sitting in a cloud for hours dropping stuff into a can so anything thatd reduce the time involved would be great
i like the idea of a dedicated gas harvesting ship and giving the procurer a role that doesnt involve being the raw material for skiffs is good too but i disagree that there should be modulesrigs for gas harvesting the ones that already exist serve just as well make mining upgrade modules also apply to gas harvesters and leave it at that in my opinion
thanks man appreciated
ive talked to my excorp mates the second ccp released their plan and all i got is i gonna quit eve if that happensmost of them are highsec dwellers and to be honest their point of view couldnt be narrowerall that crying about highsec dying and other sludge coming out of many bears brains is just not valid in any way shape or formprices would rise thats almost a certainty this does not make highsec productionrd impossible it just makes it more expensive and when in the real world production costs rise so does the products price its the same in eve if your pos fuel price makes 10 of your products cost and this rises by 100 you better make sure to sell your product for 10 more to cover the price increaseone argument i do get though is the fact that it will give nullsec more power over empire a bit like the goons have right nowit might on the other hand provide an incentive towards on site production in nullseclast but not least nullsec and empire right now have a pretty onesided relationship except maybe for the russians providing compoundsfrom what ive seen correct me if im wrong a large part of the production volume from highsec gets shipped to nullseclowsec since thats where stuff gets blown up the most i myself bought almost everything in jita and had it shipped which basically means i was at the mercy of the carebears on the other hand export is pretty small mostly moon goo factiondeadspace stuff compounds and iskoh and by the way i would really love to see highsec moved from tranquility to sisi including all its dwellers and see the market implode any thoughts might be worth a proposal as well

continue to laugh better that way
1 csm has proven to be totally ineffective and childish with their approach and they are only helping themselves2 csm are gsf and aaa puppets and they represent only their point of view in addition to a bunch of other griefers3 nobody complains about pvp you cant be serious akara pilots after mackinaws or hulks are not after pvp you know that better than anyonethere is a false impression that miners dont like pvp this is what the game is aboutbut a totally different aspect is making noobs life miserable ur just ruining the gamegriefers are just coward enough to fire mining barges instead of doing incursions that are much more profitablebut dont you worry things will changesoon
good points bad reasons1 csm has been effective just not for you2 this is because csm does not represent the community it represents the most powerful entities in eve its a plutocracy disguised as populism not a democracy when the csm project was first announced thee was a call to allot slots for various aspects of the game a more structured system but ccp is an icelandic company and they believe that populism is democracy and that the popular vote represents the greater majority of course its broken 3 um  firstly pvp is complained about a lot and its based on risk and reward i suppose the real point is1 eve is hard2 eve is a pvp game  whether that is market pvp or ship pvp or caliming you belt pvp  its all pvp bcaus you are competing against other players3 eve is more kind and soft to the newer players then it ever has been and the declining numbers of players are not leaving because their mining ships have been blown up people have been killing miners forever but because ccp has consistantly given into the notion that empire is safe space as i and many others see it there should not exist any safe space outside of the station  when you hit undock the famous saying goes you are consenting to pvpnow if people are looking for a relaxing pve experience i think they should go find another game what has so many of the older community upset is that eve is challenging and rewarding because it is hard  and at this moment  it is far too easy if you are the kind of person who will quit because you got killed then move on because it only gets harder the trick then is to figure out a way to beat them  and that is the challenge join a corp get protection pay the man off  whatever you do  know that there are a lot of other people out there that are competing for the same stuffhigh level missions in high sec ice mining in high sec  all this stuff should be moved into lowsec and perhaps review wt0 will it be unpopular yes will it lead to a price increase yes will it make the more challanging and therefor more rewadinb yes its really up to ccp at this point  is eve a game people can come home from work watch tv and eat crisps while they afk mine and relax or is it going to be a game that requires thought and attention with dire consequences for those who decide to afk haul or afk mine or take whatever easy shortcut id say that eve should strive to be more engaging more difficult and maintain the high dropout ratio due to difficulty griefers are like quality control
wow u will get a pullitzer for thatinstead go and post elsewherewhy do you guys bother posting here if you are not interested in the post what a bunch of useless trolls you arego find a thread more of your profilesomething more related to justin b
get a little bit more informed morons
we post here because what you are proposing affects more than just you it affects many different walks of life in eve and so they all have a say in the matter just because we dont like andor fight your idea it doesnt make us trollsthat was a proposal made 2 almost 3 years ago at the time ccp somewhat dismissed the idea saying something along the lines it wasnt that big a deal and that newbies make very dumb mistakes so they need a bit of a net to recoup from their lossmore than that ccp has yet to hint at any changes to the mechanics which somewhat implies that they are fine with the system as isi should also mention that the csm that proposed that idea was mired in controversy and eventually got herself expelled from the csm something related to her irrational behavior or something
u mad brosome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
why do i have to explain everything to you guysyou already ruined the postbye the way aliens there is something called ironydone with you chimps
someone is mad in this thread and its definetly not usof course you can be ganked every now and then in your mackinawor you can tank itor warp out if some suspicious ship comes inyou know if i liked mining in deklein or another 00 region a neutralred comes in ill just warp to a pos and ill just wait for him to get out you could do the same thing in highsecor you could also pay this amnesty thing it would helpor you could also mine ice elsewhereyou know its only targetting 17 systems those 17 systems who contains blue ice you can justyou know mine somewhere else and you would be fineor you could mine ice in a tanked hulkyou know you can put tank modules on that ship and you can reach 25k ehp or something which is quite good and difficult to alpha when i fly my machariel im forced to choose between having a big ass armor buffer tank and a paperthin shield tank the thing is ill get less dps and less speed out of my mach if i choose the armor buffer you cant have safety and efficiency at the same time deal with itor you could ask a buddy with a logistic shipif you dont want to train for one or if your buddy dont want to train for a logi then you can use a cheap osprey or something it still works or you could also mine ice in a cheap and insurable ship like a retriever easier to gank less efficient but also really cheap i mean 4m or something you can even reimburse your loss by looting the attacking ships wreck or you could join one of the resist goonswarm stupid thingy and try somethingthis one is  but if you still want to try feel free to however it will failor you could also quit mining for a little bit and do missions and whatnotlets say gsf loose deklein and all that to a bigger coalition i would not be able to rat in deklein anymore without being bullied by that same bigger coalition and what would i do  i would deal with it by just ratting elsewhere or lvl 4s in empire and whatnotif youre not willing to choose one of the many solutions im telling you about well do as you want and die from a brutixs mighty space cannons
high security is still no security until those that kill other players in highsec are prevented from coming back to kill more players by concord it is still far too easy and far too profitable to suicide gank the risk vs reward is completely off balance especially if you get an insurance payout on your t1 fitted  ship designed to be killed after you mercilessly  a defensless miner or hauler
apperantly the op forgot what game has was playing
specifics on aoe explosions is a tricky question though itd make 00 tactics more interesting it would require a good deal of care to avoid all kinds of problems in hisec of course if youre already willing to sacrifice however many ships it winds up taking to actually pop things from proximity damage alone you can probably already manage to kill them anywaysas for static noise thats a fairly clumsy mechanic but is similar to a somewhat more elegant idea from the commonly proposed ideas list namely making the process of locking slow proportional to the number of active locks on a target that would make fleet combats more dynamic since you cant just run a 60 man fleet with everyone targeting the same guy and would encourage more use of utility ships since having people running around targeting your allies would interfere with enemy targeting to some degreeyes thats a mechanic thatd take a bit of tinkering to work out satisfactorily you dont want it to simply be a question of everyone target the friendly logistics ships so no one can shoot them and youd want some way of countering it maybe sensor boosters and eccm can help cut through the static and target painters can make it far easier for other ships to target the painted ship in addition to increasing damage on hits those are ideas that are already discussed in the relevant thread and deserve further consideration in any implementation of this idea
it doesnt matter at all what you fix about gcc an aoe weapon usable in highsec is badsmartbombs work because they cant be used at undocks but you can hardly restict the destruction on shipssame goes for abuse of this for suicide gankingalso saying my idea will work somehow because somebody sure find a solution for its problems is a very good base for a proposal
how about stations having some sort of antiaoe equipment to protect its guests from non targeted weapons so that a ship that explodes near a station does 0 damage to nearby ships
we already covered this if you are too damned lazy to read then that is not my problem
there are a couple of ways that ccp could make this new idea of custom stations to be built even in null sec would be1 place a concord station with a high tarriff2 make the surface to orbit delivery nurffed by about 75 they have to get eve ready for the dust 514 offshooti have thought of quite a lot i have dabbled in politics criminal organizations and corporate greed in responce to your points 1  2 most of this is basic economics if you 4 system you live in is to you invaded by a 10 alliance and they build a pos and start taking over all the planets with custom stations and they are able to hold it against all comers and you spend most of your time on your alt because your 10 toon wakes up in a clone vat every time you undock you will probably try to find a new home way before ccp would ever change the security status of the systemyour number 3 is not a good example udema is a major trade route inside a major empire house whereas limited ganking can accure if enough traders get ganked over a period of time then politics ccp may raise the sec status to lower concord or milita response time a better example would be actee an island high sec area that with the current ganking of miners has curbed the total economic out flow of ice and minerals from the system and if over a period of time it would be uneconomic and politic to remove concord and or milita assits therefore lowering the security status of the system
i read push people out of highsec and i thought to myself how much of a idiot you must be you try to force someone to do something and they will do the exact opposite
ive heard a lot about fixes with hybrids and 910 of that discussion is of blasters and trackingfalloffdpsthis is not a discussion about thative put up thoughts about railgun changes and some were rather tricky i guess to implement and some pretty overpowered with damage bleed etc now i have them out of my system and time to think about other areas of fleet warfare that could be exploitedthis is my proposal set railguns to add a small 5 per turret increase in sensor resolution lock range and sensor strength of the ship its fitted on im open to dropping the sensor strength bit possibly but its a nice addition set railguns to do a raceid check on the ship its being fitted on if its not one of 2 ids gallente and caldari the bonuses above dont get applied the less peculiar change is a rof increase and tracking increase what this meanswith a 6 turret hardpoint ship like the ferox youd get a 30 increase in scan res lock range and sensor strength equivalent to a non scripted t2 sebo and less than 13 of an eccm t2 boosting sensor strength to 247with an 8 turret gallente or caldari bs its a 40 increase with a sensor strength boost to a mega from 21 to 294gallente and caldari lr ships will fill a fleet niche of getting between logi reps being able to lock faster and swap targets faster and further naturally you dont encroach on the alpha of artillery you dont have the speed at swapping out ammo like beams do but you do fill a unique niche that may actually be effective with decent fleet discipline against another fleet with logiso with these fleets ud look for long range dps not alpha it would not be to the scale of acs or pulses at all but enough to take advantage of being able to pull dps away and apply it quicker than any other long range platformplus it also means that although rail based ceptors would get a bit of a boost its wouldnt be much due to turret hardpoint restrictionsrpidea behind a rp reasoning for the bonuses is that initially a gallentean design built in secret into gallente turret hardpoints to be a secret weapon against caldari military advances unfortunately the plans were stolen by caldari spies and passed to caldari shipyards to even out the fight since the discovery of the leak gallente have activated the tech with caldari following suit
i think this is one of the more off the wall suggestions i have seen in a while not saying it wouldnt work but i think if you did this with one weapon subset you would need to do something similar with them all
it would be nice to have the skill book group listed somewhere in the skill itself text only is fine just somewhereand a bonus  a search button in our skill cue to find it here is the example i want to inject a skill it requires metallurgy 5 but its a circle so i know i have this skilled to somethingi now go to my skills and start looking for what my metallurgy skill is at since i do not want to replace whats in my current skill cueclick on each group  scroll down  next group  scroll  next groupso it would be nice to have at least in this case science listed as its skill group somewhere
great idea i cant recall how many times a corpalliance mate has asked where do i find that skill and having to look around for it
easy solution link the name of the skill in chat look at the info on it see skill group information in the topleft corner of the info window telling you what group the skill is in
the ability to search for a skill in your queue would be nice just have it work the same as the inventory filter good candidate for the thousand papercuts list
it is already possible to train a required skill from right clicking on it on a skillbook and it will give you the infos you ask forlook heres a show info of a random skill i checked on the market 
the csm issued numerous public statements through these forums when they started this reform ball rolling now that ccp has done everything you wanted and real people lost real jobs where are your replies and statements its time to step to the microphone mittani and accept responsibility for your and the csms actions youve taken metagaming to the next level with your war against ccp you cant claim its just a game anymore step up to the microphone sir step up
so your posting about what againhow is this for the betterment of the gamewhat does this have to do with real life jobs againis this just an another  post over csmif sokindly leave from whence you cameno proofno contextwaste of time stop the evemail spam
you seem to be very very smart please join my corp with your main characterwe need smart people like youno jokesreally
came looking for a well thought out message to mittani about the layoffs left disappoint110
another lame meme response am disappointlol mr goon alt ive got 2 kms for you i dont work with losers and fail pirates
i think youre trying to draw a connection between the csm calling for focusing on flying in space and the recent layoffs but i dont see the evidence to support this viewpoint
watgoon altwat
mittani is the 1 maaaaaannnnnnnnnn
to be fair to the op it hasnt gone unnoticed by many players about the lack of csm response to this whole situationchances are of course they knew absolutely nothing about this or are indeed worried about their own future positions as a working council
wait a sec youre really blaming the csms for this are you that narrow sighted so heres a hypothetical situation for youlets say i buy a hamburger from a fast food restaurant that burger it turns out is undercooked and gives me food poisoning in fact this fast food joint has a nasty and reoccurring habit of not cooking their food properly and giving all their customers food poisoningthe employees know about it and have voiced concern that their manager keeps rushing them and not allowing them to cook the food properlycustomers complain file grievances to the fda and raise such a commotion to the point that the manager of this fast food restaurant can no longer ignore it the manager issues a public apology and promises to clean up their actnothing happens after his apology for a month then he fires half of his employees out of the clear blue so whos at fault herethe customers who complained about getting food poisoning or the manager and his negligencejudging by your narrow understanding of the situation it wouldnt surprise me at all if you said it was the customers faultits not the players fault for the situation eve online is in its not the csms its not the online news press its nobodys fault except the management of ccp this is really really obvious but it seems there are lone individuals out there who still dont grasp the obviousand yeah that ten ton hammer article you cited that was written back in september 7th today is october 20th at least try to get your facts in ordersummary of eves last four expansions
nice  1 stop the evemail spam
this very recently any new dev blog or announcement from ccp with anything positive in it was manipulated behind the scenes so the csm andor other devs dominated the first 10 responses in an effort to either try to take credit or to try to tell us how we are supposed to feel hope they have permanently stopped doing thisnow on this  silence its noticed
we certainly didnt advocate for ccp to lay people off our preferred solution would have been for all those devs to be working on eve blaming us for ccp managements failings is a little unfair we and the csms before us told ccp over and over again when they were heading in the wrong direction they sometimes listened and changed course they didnt listen to us about incarna the nex store ship spinning and the general neglect of eve for the past 2 or so years that is the fault of hilmar and his managers not us and certainly not the poor grunts who got laid off this weekcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
whose business is it to dictate what ccp does or doesnt do when it comes to how they manage their businesshow the hell do you know there arent any valid reasons for those actions in the first placethats what i thoughtthis is a gamecsms purpose is to make suggestions based on the majority opinions and try to lobby if i would dare use such a term to get ccp to do thingsyes the csm does a horrid job in a number of areas but i will not fault them for thisthats for surethe csm are not shareholders nor are they employed by ccp last i checkedwe are customersthats itdont like it quit the damn game and leave thats the best your gonna get for a protestthe sooner people start to figure that out and accept itthe sooner they can get on with their livesif such a thing is even remotely possible stop the evemail spam
why is this even a topic of conversation what ccp does with its bottom line is not the players concern if they laid people off they did it for a business reason and we as players shouldnt be involved or have any say in the slightest
i think you should only be able to put one jammer on one target so it isnt completely ridiculous in small gangs while still being just as effective in large gangs
faction harby gets my votealso more t2 bcs
because there is no room in the ship lineups the tier2 bcs are already dangerously close to tier1 bs performance and only really lose out due to range difference between m and l guns  why do you think that bcs are so damn popularnow take those tier2 bcs assuming you want navy versions based on those and add the navy bonuses of 50 base ehp armourshieldshull roughly 20 base primary weapon damage better maneuverability more relaxed fittings more slots more drones moremoremorewhere do you propose they fit into to current ship lineups how many ships do you have to nerf to make room for your op blingin short the only way to do it is by giving the navy versions such a unique role as to make them as undesirable as the tier1 navy cruisers
nice idea bcs are my most favorite maybe even pirate faction battlecruisers if their npctypes would get their own hull but what about tier 3 battlecruiser ewar battlecruiser tank bonus  neutecmscramweb range

wrong thread
indicatei thought it was expressed in no uncertain termsdont you think so or you were just stupid in a desperate attempt at writing something clever pain is weakness leaving the body
i only got through half the thread before i realized that you need to think and modify your ideayour original idea is terrible but the premise is something to be noted i would suggest that you instead switch the concept and make it seem like a boost instead of a nerf add a fuel to the game that increases your warp speed a gas cloud product that you keep in your cargo that will be consumed when you initiate warp this way you get across the big systems faster and respond to threats more quickly this will act like boosters for the warp drivejust a thoughtari
i was being gentle
any more feedback please like at least if you agree thx
this people are laughing at it ccp would take action if anything wrong was done goons making a rukus it just makes people wonder what the noble goons are after to help themselves yet againif a miner needs to go to the bathroom for instance i ask that they dock up first or at the very least ask the supreme protector for permission to go  james 315  aka  the miner bumper
i support this his counter evidence is that it was a lowercase m seriously
make him chairman instead of kicking him tbhspace credibility
low sec needs buffs any it can get when talk of big changes comes around you always hear the changes will affect high sec like this and will affect 00 like that  and so on and so forth low sec is completely kept out of the conversation which just shows the state that it is in its really quite sad sure population wise it isnt as substantial as hs and 00 but people still live there or would if its pathetic state didnt nigh force people to leave and it gets absolutely no representation in major game updates or expansions it might not be as influential as hs and 00 but it is still a part of eve and has gone ignored for years with a few small and inconsequential exceptions
i think its time to get this thread up on the new forums it seemed to go relatively well on the old forums so here goesas awesome as the characters are in this game with the new character creator i still want to see more the realism so far is great i love it but i still want to see boobs bounce make a fat guys belly jiggle a bitmake boobies bounce just a little make it realistic i dont want to see dead or alive style boobie bouncage but something realistic it has always been a pet peeve of mine to see boobies stiff as marble in games even free to play cheap ass crap games like vindictus put a little boobie sway on the characters so why cant ccp do it and do it rightyeah yeah more important things we would rather see ccp fix and do blah blah blahstill would like to see itagain i want to emphasize realism here not anime floppage but realistic movement and sway to breasts and even other areas of fat like the stomach on some charactersflamesuit on
the difference is that some of those other games you were talking about dont really have much to offer besides bouncing boobs we have better things to do in eve especially since seeing your char at all other than a static picture is secondary to the main eve universe i know i and probably half of the rest of the eve universe havent seen my avatar beyond the head and shoulders for months dont try to get the devs to spend more time on incarna people play eve to fly around in ships not walk around in a box looking at their character
i happen to enjoy incarna for what it is there is absolutely no reason to ask the devs to stop working on incarna at all i say the devs they already have assigned to incarna can keep working on it since they already have enough devs working on spaceships in space if other less technologically advanced games can make boobs move even a little then so can eveedit i realize months later that i probably came across a little harsh in this post i wasnt intending to i feel there is room for both fis and wis in eve each have their place it has been made clear in the wis thread that it is still strongly desired by the majority it will have its time
now i remember why i started muting your posts stop the evemail spam
thats a nice troll now move along unless you have something constructive to say
as terrible of an idea as i expected it wouldnt be too bad to have more realism to incarnanow with this said i believe that fis is always going to be the first priority and the rest of incarna should be released upon completion establishments minigames et cetera a little more realistic movement to characters even finite ones would add to the overall immersion factor such as facial tics blinking or even the light bounce to the breast when a female toon moves but at present this isnt a priority and can wait like so many other things that are put on hold due to the fact fis is the priorityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is eve onlinego look at google or bing for your little fixsmove along troll stop the evemail spam
just because youre flaming and no i dont mean your posting style but rather orientation doesnt mean everyone else has to be then again youve probably never seen a real boobgtfoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im not saying put fis second seat to wis ccp has devs assigned to both projects i am sure and the fis guys far outnumber the wis guys the problem with too many people on these forums is they make the blind assumption that any idea presented would take priority over everything elsemost that read this probably failed to even read the op and assume what i am asking for is massive neck breaking boob bouncage although i mentioned several times that i am looking for more realism to our characters not some obscene crap to get my rocks off on the only people who think my request is perverted are the perverts drake
some of us would rather have the devs focus on fixing ingame issues and less time on boy fanatasies of staring at boobs all day stop the evemail spam
i put breast and other areas movement as low priority before even considering it ccp should1 finish incarna to a reasonable amount2 fix bugs3 finishfix fwnote in no particular order
againa proposal for an idea is not a ccp do this right now its a proposal for an idea when and if it is implemented is something for ccp to decide perhaps ccp in passing could set jiggle  1 instead of  0 while working on something else who knows
years is more like it 
hey there op going emo here this is my opinion on your opinion so take it or leave itif you consider all the proposed regulations and balances listed a UFFFDwhimUFFFD then iUFFFDll just UFFFDleave itUFFFDiUFFFDll UFFFDtake itUFFFD that the most vexing aspect of character transfers is the absence of accessible documentation again name changing provides a regulated alternative to thisthe magnitude of importance in developing name changing is kinda directly proportional to those suffering since you donUFFFDt care to empathize iUFFFDll UFFFDleave itUFFFDiUFFFDll UFFFDtake itUFFFD that the absence of name changing in such an epic mmo makes it UFFFDbrokenUFFFD that you want to let eve stagnate iUFFFDll UFFFDleave itUFFFDand before the poster goes allUFFFD
ive advocated name changing with character transfers in this and other threads i want to amend thatone thing to remember a lot of people use neutral alts in highsec to accomplish various things during wartime the ability to easilycheaply rename alts without them being transferred means that neutral alts would be considerably more effective as they could be renamed on a whim to avoid being spotted even limiting it to being done when a toon is transferred would just mean that two corpmates would need to trade neutral alts in order to rename themto that end i would suggest that once a character has been transferred to an account and renamed that name is permanently associated with that toon on that account this would limit the number of renames to the number of accounts a group controlledand of course contacts need to follow the name change so that they retain their standings with players and corporations
much respect for the thorough post you too smiling menace i believe the only thing that isnt currently included in the op is 2 your new name is y aka old name for like 3 months and then it is just y where y is new name which merits addition to the debated feature list the important thing is that we agree that name changing is feasibleheheh how bout names with numbers andor irregular capitalization while were at it
yeah i agree with you on everything i would just limit name change once per accountthat would eliminate constant name changing during wartime or any other reason for which people dont agree with name changing so if you change name even if you transfer your character to new owner he would still have the same restriction so if you changed name once he cant do it and vice verse i would even be happy if you could change only one part of name and yeah there should be some option to report name or something if lets say you character name is ian ian and some other character has name lan lan because that can because it can lead to confusion but with list and standings that is secondary in my name since its not so easy to make a mistake if you are careful but it can happen
dont worry paulize giving quarter to some counter arguments isnt going to hurt your campaign to run for csm actually it really helps to improve your appeal to the moderate and right center demographic
again supporting a worthy cause
mnagy as my mom you taught me there is a difference between millions and ten thousand or was it your brother and my dadalso people are getting various sp per hour  especially in nonsecure space the richest get the most as they can afford fly with the best implants
my point yes i have it but you could find it only if you were willing to read and able to notice that it is not a double post
my personal opinion they should get the amount of sp that would have been learned in the time of the mass test as a thank you for helping kind of thing these mass tests are really important for the fixing of problems before we get the stuff and the more people that show up the more test point there will behowever there should be no bonus to bug reports individually way too much room for exploitation imo

note this proposal is to ccp and not to the members of the council of stellar management csm however since there does not seem to be a forum for directing proposals such as this to ccp i will use the assembly hallafter reading the white paper on the csm i propose that the csm be ended and replaced with a better method of determining the voice of the customer from reading through a number of threads and posts on the current csm its members and some of the current issues surrounding ccp and eve online i am proposing that there are better ways of determining the voice of the eve online playerbaseif the current csm was elected from only 10 of the playerbase and 2 current members are in the same alliance it appears that the csm does not constitute a representative sample of the eve online community if the csm is not a representative sample then the risk that ccp is not getting a clear picture of the eve online playerbase is increased it should be clear to ccp why an accurate understanding of the concerns and desires of the player base is of vital importance to ccp and the future of eve onlinethe idea of an elected group of experts called upon to provide the voice of the customer to ccp appears to be a version of the delphi method of decision making this method is dependent on the belief that the panel of experts have an accurate understanding of what the eve players want given the low turnout of players voting in the csm elections i would question csmUFFFDs ability to represent the eve online community to use a democratically elected nongoverning csm has no power only voice panel as a proxy to the eve community is a strange and dangerous way of determining the voice of the customer analysts from marketing sales and customer service departments of many organizations use more quantitative analytic techniques in order to determine the voice of the customer i propose that ccp remove the csm and implement a more robust method of determining the voice of the customer one that is more representative of the playerbase of eve online
ladies and gentleman we have a winner1
what do you propose be used instead the size of threadnaughtsyour issue is not with the csm but with the community as a whole  the fact that less than 15 can bothered to read a few pages of text and press a button is what breaks itas for not being representative there is a country in this world of ours that runs a two party system with a turnover rate in its chambers worse than the oneparty system of the ussr in which you have to be a multimillionaire to even have a chance of competing and where voter turnout rarely exceed 50  that country is supposedly the shining beacon of democracy oversimplifiedbut fear not as more and more countries are heading the same direction chances are that it will be become the norm and thus validate the democracy claim since it will be the only option on the blockthe csm system is a lot more democratic since everyone read everydamnone can run and get their message out sure you get situations where large flocks of sheep hiya goonies o can guarantee a spot for their guy but unless they truly spam the roster theyll never get more than the 12 peoplewhat we need is reps from the three security bands in eve as the issues that they need to be educated in are more often than not specific to highlownull and a homogeneous csm like we have now damn null monkeys is ultimately detrimental to a fluidconstructive process
your complaining about this csm being null heavy but at least theyve done something unlike the three previous csms that were so full of empirebears who on the whole didnt care about losec and null rotting in front of their eyes as long as hisec was buffed buffed buffed
this is a gamedo we need representation like some kind of world government let ccp developed their game as they see fit if you donUFFFDt like it unsub simple they have many tools better than the csm send an email survey talk to people in game  i would love that read their forums look at 3rd party forums the list is endless which other game does this stuff i think this community is spoiled and acts like a gigantic crying 12 year old i really hope ccp just ignores us for a while and completes their vision they have come this far they have made a fantastic game even with its faults i trust them a hell of allot more than some goose stepping jackassi know i will hear UFFFDbut look at their track record we are saving the gameUFFFD bull  i think the game would have been a hell of allot better if they didnUFFFDt give into the cry babies sure we lost some whiners that is a good thing we have had almost a decade of space expansions and now we get yet another 00 expansion go play another mmo and wait years for an expansion and months for updates we can bite the bullet and play this fantastic game while ccp changes it into a game that will last another decade and i am sorry to say but that includes incarna micros transactions and much more scarry changes to fill your diapers with what this game need more than supercap balancing is new players ccp was on the right track with incarna if they have a chance to finish we derailed the train now let them get back to work i hope they swat the destraction that is the csm like an uwanted fly buzzing in your earnot directed at anyone person
i hope they start by ignoring youdirected at one person
this again no
it doesnt really matter how democratic the process is  if youre looking for the voice of the customer having a democratically elected panel is not as useful adds less value to ccp as the more quantitative techniques much like the ones outlined by deucalion
not really what im saying is that there are better more effective ways of tapping into all areas of the eve universe from what i understand null sec is one of the more interesting aspects of this game  i appreciate those that try to carry this message to other players
as someone who works at a higher tiered customer support companyservice your full of quite literallyas inget to the bathroom before it becomes a problemyou cannot and will not apply your so called logic of real world governments or businesses to a world of encouraged metagamingpiraceyscammingtheflyingcheating all of which is encouraged and what notspecially when you get yahoos like yourself who show up and start throwing around big words and so called i know better than you do about systems people who could make this game entirely worse offand what makes me think i know betterwell look at that start of your postdirected at ccpas if they would give you the time of day let alone the attentionintelligently writtenbut its obvious its coming from someone who has no idea how this game really workshell even i have a hard time grasping itbut its sure as hell not what you think it is stop the evemail spam
if you do work at a higher tiered customer support company they have tiers i would assume that while you may not someone in your organization is interested in feedback from the customerim not sure which words were big for you but i apologize if it wasnt clear this proposal is for a better way of capturing the voice of the customer what that voice says is not something im concerned with ccp is though how the game really works is an important part of the voice of the customer  since you claim to have a better grasp of it than i do im sure cpp would be interested in your opinionmost organizations with a strong customer service focus even higher tiered ones care about what their customers have to say  why do you think ccp would ignore a customer who wants ccp to improve upon capturing the voice of the customer for the benefit of their product
ill make it easy for youcustomers are stupidthey think they know betterthey want whats only gives them better advantage without care or concern for othersthey would sooner destroy something such as suicide ganking in the name of their money and ignore the ramifications of such an action whilst giving the community the fingerbased on that with the way eve online isyou have literally no hope in hell of getting even decent let alone quality feedback with all the garbage that comes flying through the doorit wont happen everlike it or notthe csm is currently the best system in placegranted its a train wreckbut better than the foolishness you keep postingand the worst part is you thinking ccp would give a crapyou want their attentionquitotherwise you should vote or run for csmedit scratch that im arguing with a bloody noob stop the evemail spam
while i disagree with your belief that the eve playerbase is stupid the intelligence of the customer doesnt matter ccp needs to be concerned with all paying subscriptions telling the customer what it wants is a dangerous thing to do in businessyoure beginning to make me doubt that you have any idea of what customer service really isyour ad hominem arguments dont help my tenure in the game is irrelevant to value of the voice of the customer
10
and whos voice is more valuable the guys who create content for thousands even tens of thousands of players out in nullsec who create the things that actually hit outside news sites like the bbc or the guys who sit in empire in a one man corp and run missions all day and never speak to anyone
its clearly the guy that creates the blobs yeah awesome content eve would be so much worse off without them
as this fine gent pointed outyou missed my poitn entirely and just picked apart the parts you where offended byi didnt say the customer player base in eve is stupidi said customers are stupid in its literal form there is no relevance or relationshipits a general metaphorical termyour time is relevantyouve played this game for a little over a monthmaybe 2and you think you know whats best for usseriouslyget outsome of us have things to take care of and we dont have time to hand hold youeve online is a cold harsh gameand your so called war drum beating in the name of customer service is heavily biasedand poluteddo i like suicide ganknig nobut until someone can come up with an alternative method to nail someones  to the wall in high security space with concord protection i suggest you take a hikethat is one of many examples of your so called customer service mantra that would ruin this gamethe so called majority you see is not a majorityit is a mob of a small percentage of the population that thinks they know how this game should be when they are utterly outgunnedoutnumberedand over poweredccp does listen to customersbut only in terms youll never understand in your current prespectivesure as hell not going to give a crap over 1 little customerneeds to be something in the terms of 500 to 1000 before they pay attentionuntil youve put a good solid 6 months to a year into this gameyou have utterly no business making game breaking decisions for the rest of usand even then its suspecti never suggest anything without weighing in all sidesincluding the dreaded piwat sideits their game too after allthatis the real world of customer service customer service by defintiion doesnt mean give them what they wantit means give them quality serviceand that includes giving them the hard meassagelike your  outa luck bub with a smile and a grin they couldnt yell at or punchin shortget over yourself stop the evemail spam
the same each pay the same sub fee some of the news created by these people can be taken good or bad stories of scams and death are great to some but stories of adventure and freindship appeal to others if you love the game you will tell your friends do your own advertising in your own way just becasue 00 have the loadest people kicking up the most dust doesnt make them any better than anyone else playing this game get off your high horse you have no idea if the silent guy that plays by himself brought 100 of his freinds that play similarly is it just me or does 00 sound like the babies crib of evegrow up ffs
my experience of tiered support organisations is that a million appeals get ignored with a not broken wont fix response whilst major accounts get their badly thought though demands agreed to over dinner with the ceo completely outside the support organisation oh
my experience is 9 times out of 10 the customer is utterly stupid and knows better or doest read the bold typed large type print stop the evemail spam
the timing on these threads is so transparent it makes me laugh for months csm6 has worked hard to bring home a whole pile of successes past csms have rarely had more than one or two items they can declare theirs csm6 is the most effective body yet and the truth is most of the null csm folks that feed your conspiracy theories are relatively inactive trebor two step and meissa are incredibly active in csm6 and they hail from no alliance  wormholes hiseccers and lowsec and working with them the active null reps have gotten a lot done but of course thats not what your thread is about your thread is about miners being blown up in hisec so you woke up and wrote a lot of uninformed words about goon control of the csm while mourning your lost mining barge
well here is my thoughs on csm  ccp  evewhen i started playing eve going on 4 years ago now the general warnings that were being handed out at the time were  eve is a game that you need to be committed to for a very long time read years and will cost you money to play eve is a game that is mean difficult to understand and even more difficult to learn in the extreme most waysit seems to me that these two messages have been lost sight of here in the last year or so these two reasons above are exactly why i play this game there are some of the 5000 that have now left that i really hope come back because they had the smarts the patience and the endurence that this game requires my advice to the csm and ccp is ignore this call for ending the csm because its the bad and wrong advice that got you sideways with the players that are really eve the renewed direction your speaking of will bring you back to what you need to be  the best the toughtest the most difficult to play mmo in this worldccps sand box is eve online the sand is owned by ccp we pay them a monthly fee to throw the sand at each other that is all that is here so move along nothing more to be seen
even i have my misgivings on the csmbut ending them is the wrong answerthey arent perfectand they are a little biasedif not morebut they are not the problemand until people get it through their thick skullsi fear this will continuebut i sure as heck wont allow smoe noob get it in his head he knows betternot until he gets alot more experince under his belt stop the evemail spam
excuse me mr mittani sir can i have a minute of your timeyour UFFFDsuccessesUFFFD as you say will help if i may quote you again UFFFDa small and insular group of playersUFFFDif i am correct in assuming that 80 of all eve players live in high sec and will never venture to 00 then 80 of the people playing eve dont give a  what you have accomplished they will never see it this is what the thread is about not stroking your new found love of gankingthanks for your timeyour typical high sec execrable iskmonger
youve missed the point of what i proposed its not about you or goon control i would of course assume that yourself and the other members of the csm would disagree with my position its also not about the relative successes of csm6 vs any other past or future csm group this is about finding a better way of reaching out to all of the players in the eve community  this doesnt appear to be happening currentlya common argument is that people should vote if they want a say thats a fine position in government but terrible in business the csm was made to represent the eve community and provide feedback to ccp on how the playerbase feels about game elements what im saying is that there is a better way to accomplish this goal
by goons for goons
you need to calm down you also need to learn to read betterim not making any suggestions on how the game should be played im making suggestions on how the feedback to ccp should be handled please take a moment to consider the differencesyou have said repeatedly that customers are stupid from the point of view of ccp we are customers i have combined those two statements and concluded that you think eve customers are stupidif you reread what im suggesting youll see that im not at all trying to tell you or anyone else in eve what is best for them im proposing looking at a solution that incorporates player feedback from a larger portion of the eve community customer service isnt about giving the customer what they want but only a fool would think that a business wouldnt want to know what the customer wants and make an informed decision based on customer feedbackof course youre welcome to discount my opinion using any reason youd like including ad hominem attacks
only a fool would listen to a noob make suggestions and expect to be heard when he has little to no time put in stop the evemail spam
youre wrong on this the strength of an idea has little to do with how much time someone has put in you sound like the posterboy for entrenched thinking and the old boys clubi would bet that ccp sees my money as just as green as yours in fact if youve been playing for years and make enough isk in game to buy plex each month to fund your monthly fee mine is greenera business doesnt care about the money you paid in the past  theyre concerned about the money youre going to pay them in the future which makes us equal in terms of voiceyour opinion is appreciated
drake calling someone else a fool or noobonce again the pot has called the kettle blacki am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

i find it so gratifying when i hear gamers from other mmos and even those from other games talk about the bad reputation that goonswarm has among the gaming community its calling  mud but still funny none the less you are basically the worst that gamers have to offer and unfortunately you decided to join eve i still find it amazing how you think you are accomplishing so much when in fact you are doing more damage than good and that has nothing to do with the csm as a whole that has to do with who is currently on top of the csm not representing anybody in eve except his little minority and his own interests
actually neither of those are true however it is somewhat amusing to see what lame meme youre going to come up with next or other unintelligent drivel youre going to sprayi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yes jackkeep talkng because you cant help yourself stop the evemail spam
look whos talkingafter mulling this one overi dont think calling for an end to the csm is the answer i think having some representation to ccp is better than having no representation at all howeverthe problem does lie in the csm representing a small minority of the playerbase primarily goonswarm due to mittani and vile rat when they should be representing the entire playerbases best interestswhat is needed for the csm is people who want to bring balance to not only nullsec but lowsec highsec and wh space as well right now the csm is pushing for everything to go to nullsec they arent pushing for anything else because mittani believes that the only part of eve that matters is his little corner in null right now it is all about take abcs out of wh space and make them null exclusive take ice out of high and make it low and null neither of which bring any balance to eve at all but simply server to line the pockets of those in null they will whine about the risk vs reward of null when in fact you can already make a vast amount more isk in null than you possibly could ever dream of in highsec next upremove gas sites from wh space and only put them in null the point is an overall balance for everything needs to be reached and it wasnt accomplished with the past csms and certainly wont be with the current csm i would say vote for change in 2012 but we all saw what happened with that one we need a csm that has no specific interest in any specific part of eve we need a csm that isnt comprised of leadership from some of the worst that gamers have to offer we need a csm that has a leader dedicated to improving eve and helping ccp not creating drama and embarrassing ccp to the general publicunfortunately what we need and what we are going to get are likely two entirely different things
everything you brought up is nothing more than rumoring and conjecturegossip at bestcsm talks about alot of thingsand most of them get rejected or dont go that fareven then most of those subjects are not raised by csm but by other peopleif your going to live in sheer paranoia then thats your choicei gave up being fearful of changes in this game simply beacuase the bulk of what they bring ininspite of the ingame problems not taken cared of are not all that badcsm is electedif you got a problemvote for what you want or run yourself stop the evemail spam
youre wrong again on this the csm only has 10 members not all areas of eve are going to be represented with only 10 members this should not be a question of the most votes get to be the voice of the players especially since the voter turnout was so lowagain this is an issue of listening to the customer even the stupid ones not just the customers who voted ccp has an obligation to the eve community and to itself to ensure that it understands the concerns of the players  not just the ones that have played the game for several years and not just the ones that are parts of large voting alliances
how many people are in thie united stateshow many representives do each state havepretty damn good to have 10 people for how many actual customers againlast i checked its really 20they have auxirarly members as wellall this keeps showing is your lack of experince in thisccp is obligated to make money and be a businessthey will listen to cashlike it or notwere lucky when they actaully do pay attentionand the only time they tend to do that is when they start losing accounts stop the evemail spam
i have never heard someone blow so much smoke up his own ass thats laughable timing being people have had enough of you and the csm your fellow goons may troll and kiss your ass mittani but its clear you dont have the support you think you have outside your alliance buddies its a little strange that lots and lots of people are now speaking out against you and goons quite frankly ill say what people are thinking gtfois that hurting your ego get over it
csm6 is obviously rigged on what they battle forhowever its a csm who make more changes needed happen to tqthats an huge improvementif you want them to listen to you make sure to vote for the one who will represent your playstyle next time thats allbut anyway i doubt csm7 will be so nullsec focused as people will have realized they need to elect more high sec  others guys and anyway the big changes for null will be already done
blaming the goons for something everyone does ingame on a daily basis is a bit of a waste of time stop the evemailUFFFDspam
it seems that a large number of wh space seems populated by farmers who experience very little danger from other players in wh space even without local and think the reward is too big for the risk involved i would suggest removing moons or removing the ability to anchor a pos in wh space think this changes would also slightly improve lowsec because pilots would need to explore more instead of basing out of one and collapsing other wh until new spawns
wtfi expected this from mittanithis is stupid have you ever even lived in a wh do you have any idea how much time and effort it takes to scan every day to keep your pos fueled every day have you been in a fight in wh space do you have any idea how much risk can be involved with collapsing a wh even if you are keeping track of the mass going through appearently not

this indeed my main gripe is not really highsec or most of the thing in highsec its the overflow from null or lowsec its the mouthbreathing vocal minority on the forums and often ingame that get some sort of twisted joy from ruining the game for othersthe first paragraph of the ts is a direct reversal of the feeling most pirates have hurr i blow up ship derp you no want learn2play nub you play my way in which i force my standards upon you because ccp lets everyone play the game the way they want to play it or the highway no i wont let you execute ccps prerogative to play the game the way you want youll have to play it the way i want and for what the only thing i can think of is causing grief because killing a miner or even a mission runner is just about as exciting or difficult as running a level 1 courier missioni do realize however this is difficult to address and i also realize highsec isnt supposed to be 100 safe but there are a lot forum threads indicating this is a regular problem for highsec dwellers to me its not even the blowing up part even though that is quite annoying its the total censored attitude displayed very vocally by those l33t pvpers killing defenseless miners its like all human decency gets thrown out as soon as they board their combat vesselbut then again this is eve so i grew a pair and huffed up i dont have to like that particular part of the game though p
time to remind what the wise man saidpain is weakness leaving the body
time to ask you to read carefully  or perhaps to not let your misconceptions cloud your judgementsit may seem ppl are asking for happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures if youre always on the receiving end of the stick and dont know any better but if you cant distinguish basic decent human interaction from badmouthing others and taking joy in their suffering youre part of the problemwell you already are because you are only contemplating one side of the equation the one having the guns it seems some ppl think happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures is ganking defenseless at least as long as they are playing the way they want to instead of the way you want them to play highsec dwellers so i guess eve isnt for those piratesgankers and therefor by your own words they should go to hello kitty online
note for vile rat about careersnot sure about the career path fixation there are career paths in hisec1 guys who work for paychecks mission runners2 guys who supply stuff miners pi building invention3 guys who move stuff around arbitrage traders station traders suppliers to lownull professional contract haulers4 guys who take stuff suicide cargo gankers can flippers marketipo scammers ninja salvagers corp infiltrators5 guys who blow other guys up for a living hisec wardec corps some of the guys from category 4 once someone aggresses6 guys who do metastuff write an app build a training program playerrunsponsored eventsin lowsec you have a few less options you can do about everything you can in hisec but some of it is less practical add on open aggression careers like pirate and mugger nullsec offers sovereignty none of these choices are appropriate for hisec lowsecs issues are many and theyre covered in a lot more threadsi dont think theres that much wrong with hisec as it stands today apart from little illogical things like insurance for ships blown up by concord ui issues terribad wardec mechanics including remote rep problems why not put them on the killmails and the like affect everyone no matter where they choose to play if youre looking for new and different career paths for highsec there are a lot of great ideas id like to see the existing problems get ironed out first though hacking into a pos to weaken its defenses sounds interesting as does being an organizerbookmaker for an open series of combat tournaments as does improved ai for npc rats but these take cpu cycles and developer resourcesnote for vile rat about bountiesflat death bounties have never worked in any game too easy to exploit only way to make them not profitable is to set up a bounty escrow with concord that pays out for less than the value of the destroyed items like sodead ship everyone on the killmail splits 50 of the base value of the destroyed ship and destroyed fittings not dropped up to the amount in escrow the killers also split the insurance payout if for some reason the wanted pilot had insurancedead pod everyone on the killmail splits 75 of the base value of the implants plus 75 of the cost of the clone up to the amount in escrowthis makes it unprofitable to get podded by your own alt makes the pod potentially more valuable to kill and a highbounty target can be hunted for a very long time if the target flies small ships instead of supercaps it lowers the value of an individual kill but keeps the escrow running longerexamplevile rat gets bountied by annoyed highseccers after he trolled them in assembly hall for 100m isk total cheap bastards this goes into the concord escrowhe gets his cruiser blown up by 5 attackers the loss in hull and destroyed modules is 50m isk dropped stuff is up for grabs each of the 5 attackers gets a 5m bounty payout 50m505 the escrow goes down to 75m still on vile rats headthey manage to nab his pod and all 5 get on the killmail vile rat had implants and their base value  the cost of his clone are 500m 500m75 is more than whats left in the escrow so each attacker gets 75m515m for the podkill instead of 500m75575mnow if the bounty was significant like 10b isk not only does vile rats pod become a potentially juicier target but the escrow stays high enough that he can be hunted again and again he can hide in a station or go out without implants but the clone value still makes it worthwhile and not having implants only makes the escrow last longeradding a bounty to the destroyed ship is just a thought as it gives a solo roamer a reason to go after a wanted pilot even if he might not be able to nab the pod if that gets too complicated just forget it and keep the 75 bounty on the implants and clone pricenote about security in hiseci dont want hisec to become safer than it is now you should have to stay on your toes for folks who think suicide ganks and the like are horrible keep in mind that eve lets you figure out solutions and execute them on your own you can shoot back you can learn to transport valuable stuff safely you can choose to not move ridiculous amounts of valuable stuff in a paper ship you can learn to run a mission without blinging out 2 billion on a space pinata you can even try being a bad guy for a while and if you go back to your old lifestyle at least youll be aware of what can happenif you think griefing in eve is bad theres grief play in every game its just that in most of them your only recourse is to petition toontown and puzzle pirates were fun to grief injust stay aware and dont risk ridiculous amounts of your net worth for stupid reasons
find out what ccps intended income is for high seccurrently it is possible to easily farm incursions for 100mil iskhr this is stupid and pubbie high sec players with the concord blanket of safety should not be able to attain these rates the risk of incursion rats is not true risk thus the reward should not be so high
1 to dedicated ore gas mining ships  t1  t2 versions please  its dumb that there are no industrial strength ships or modules for gas harvestingoh and the ships should look like maids with vacuum cleaners in their handle just like in spacebal
as others have said dont put a probe launcher on an industrial that would be silly the whole idea of the mining bargeexhumer is that its a purposebuilt ship that doesnt mix roles do one thing and do it wellim all for an ore gas miner
the facts speak for themselves if people wanted constant pvp theyd already be living in nullsec  but they arent  you think if you remove their sand theyll suddenly want yoursthats quite the big assumption  are you really willing to risk eves future on that
do itif you think we lost subs because of incarna implement this idea and you will really see a drop in subs and not just the whinny 00 dickheads but again that is the 1 objective for the csm kill eveyour doing a great job csm keep it up the more crap like this the sooner you will be gonedont forget to put a timer on the posses when they all go off line there are gooing to be 100s of offline posses in empty highsec systems i hope you retards like to mine becasue thats what you will be doingo wait you have bots
no thanks i like my ice in high sec
this idea is actually quite brilliant
what he saidseriouslyccp lost a lot of subs from the anomaly changes then more when incarna released do this and you will see it happen again but only because you are directly  over your largest player basethe high sec bears why would you completely screw over a larger group of players just to appease the smaller group nullsec doesnt need more ice nullsec doesnt need to be the only place to mine ice mittani already wants to remove abc ores from wh space so that nullsec can be the only place to mine that too see a trend here yeah
mentallychallenged idea even thinking about spelling out the reasons why its mentallychallenged is making me mentallychallenged edit damn filter
it is because nobody uses the word  correctly including me and those that call other people retards upset the retards and to keep the retards from crying other retards ban the word it is a cruel never ending cycleit looks like the plural of  is not a banned word though isnt that  lol
no i think you should grow a brain buddyselective reading is great noread what i wrote everything in eve is geared to pvp that is what i said just because you sit and mine in a belt all day without shooting at anything does not mean you are not actively participating in the pvp element of eve you are just doing it from a different perspective where do you think all your minerals go think about it before you open your gob and let hot air outi have done all aspects of eve from actively shooting at other players mining pi missions and plexes i have done it all as most have its still a stupid idea to have a simulator of eve in eve
i love hearing the veteral pvpers whine  oh no the only possible pvp is our pvp  no one elses sand is as good as ours and to prove it we want to take yours away  blah blah blah again if people actually loved nullsec  pvp as much as the only true pvpers claim  theyd already be living in nullsec  but they arent  veteran pvpers should be thankful to carebears for paying ccp to keep eve alive  and should be thinking of ways to retain new subscribers rather than congratulating themselves on how great they are at killing noobs
adding virtual pvp in eve is adding riskfree pvp that flies in the face of the entire notion of a sandbox where everyone is living in the same universe and everything you do has consequences if every time you wanted pvp you could simply hop onto your virtual console and have a few fights without risk of losing any assets you are removing yourself and the act of pvp from the sandboxthis isnt about our sand versus your sand this is the fact that you want to be able to step outside the sandbox and play in the house for a bit for fear of getting dirtythis wont retain new subscribers
if you love real pvp soooo much why are you so afraid people will stop real pvpingi dont see the problem  simulated pvp would come with no rewards no reputation no feeling of accomplishment  same as dueling or whatever in insert random other game name here with millions more players and millions more dollars to improve and sustain their game ecosystem even though its not as good as evetrue pvp will remain just that  beloved and accessible to the elite few who aspire to it  and the countless clueless noobs and carebears they love to prey upon  i get a kick out of the nullsec pvp elite telling hisec carebears how great pvp is  lol  kinda like the fisherman telling the fish to jump into his boat because of how awesome the bait there is  hilarious
not sure if trollif youre responding to me you must be as im the only one who posted since your last nonsensical post then you really need to work on your reading comprehension i never said people will stop i said that virtual combat virtual anything in eve flies in the face of the established notion that eve is one big sandbox and that the action of every player can affect every other player what youre asking for is something that directly contradicts thatright now if you run missions and bring back mission loot and sell it someone else is going to buy that loot and use it if no mission runners bring back loot meta 14 modules go up in price as the supply dwindlespvp is the largest sink of minerals and loot modules in the game if you introduce virtual pvp that does result in a drop in pvp losses then all the minerals and loot will drop in price damaging the market and making it harder for you carebears to make isk you dont realize it but you rely on us blowing stuff up i get a kick out of your assumption that im anything resembling nullsec pvp elite
again i disagree with your assumption that virtual pvp would decrease the frequency of real pvp  i suspect the oppositeand nah banjo im not assuming your one of the pvp elite though you or i even could very easily be for all any of us know  the reply was intended to be more general than that  and the term pvp elite refers more to how highly they a certain very arrogant class of pilot think of themselves not their actual skill
i again state more or less what i said earlier in the thread when you can get your rocks off doing ship to ship combat in a virtual environment against other players without gain or loss why risk actual isk and effort looking for real pvp
sweet god no no no every so often someone comes along with an idea to make arena pvp and we all hate it so just no
interesting that people hate the thought of arena pvp  but love the idea of alliance tournament etc  seem very similar to me  and i dont think isk losses compared to real pvp are the real factor at play  theres something deeper isnt there
how much pvp happens in wow outside of instances since battlegrounds were introducedhint its almost none
lawl really lawl the tournament is once a year and losses are real  eve real  that is you  and moan about bitter pvpers not wanting change but what youre after is instance pvp like wow or world of tanks if you really want instance pvp that bad play wot while your mining veld in the background leave eve alone
so if incarna and walking around in stations is going to be a permanent addition to the game then ccp needs to go all out and give us players machinima tools we all loved the clear skies trilogy movies even gamers who dont play eve appreciate them but the director had to rely on half life 2 graphics and animations to fulfill the non ship part of the moviesnow that we have incarna we have actual characters ccp needs to go all out and give us the tools for us players to create our own movies and clips ccp let incarna really shine by giving players some creative controlas it sits now incarna seems to lack any sense of focus or direction we get the impression that its more of a gimmick or an excuse to create a micro transaction business model rather than an actual part of the gamesummary of eves last four expansions
id rather see an inspace replay recording system first similar to team fortress 2s where you can load up the scene and replay it from other angles and such laterless space barbie more space ships
you know call me crazy but id rather ccp work on actual game content then waste time with moviemaking tools
i really just want to se the ability to run with my character in station im just sayingit already takes 5 minutes to get from my ship to the other end of my captains quarters walking if they want to make it even bigger i dont want to have to take 30 minutes just to get to the bar to watch the dancing girls make a  run animationtie it to shift and let us  runohand bouncing boobies
i wanted incana with sov wars inside massive stations not captain quarters i wanted to be able to leave my ship and gunup in station i wanted to fight reds or war decs inside massive stations i wanted a real time mmorpg element with 2k other payers in real time in jita 4 4the problem with ccp implementing my wish is a limitation of current computer technology ccp cant tweak eve to let it run a single instance jita 4 4 station with 1500 to 2000 players in real time and in the same station this was the real problem with developing incana in eves existing platformccp decided to develop fps avatar content to run on a separate platform in the form of the ps3 and on a separate instance on a planet surface rather than in existing space stations with existing eve charactersccp took this bold decision because of the insurmountable technology issues of making a reasonable fps with 2k players i dont think you can have a game like that with 2k players while maintaining 20fps even with wow graphics let alone wod graphics whats the point in being able to walk around in station if you cant interact with the other 1500 people in the station allowing us to walk out of an empty captains quarter and into an empty station or a station with only npcs to interact withwhats the point of that why even bother spending resources on that im glad ccp spent resource on a workable fp avatar model like dust than expanding cq into walking around empty station
you make it sound so fun how can i not gank stuff after posts like thisthe risk vs reward would completely disappear for miners if you had your way mining in highsec would be utterly riskfree and thats what you want when i enter a wormhole and run anomalies my pve ship cant take on most pvp ships thats a risk the noctis i use to salvage the sleeper wrecks is even more vulnerable thats another risk i take why do i accept these risks because theres profit to be madethis is eve go do something dangerous for a bit
you completely miss my point i am not saying remove the ability for someone to gank i am saying make it a lot more difficult the risk vs reward for the miner isnt the issue its the risk vs reward for the gankers that is gankers deliberately lose their ship with no risk of being podded and have a huge reward depending on the target usually way more than the dinky ship they lost that is the problem lose 1 100 mill ship for a reward of anything from 0god knows what only an idiot ganker targets a ship that has little of value in its hold we have seen gankers make billions off a single hauler kill and what did they lose a few measly points of sec status and a cheap ass ship is it clearer now risk vs reward unbalanced
if youre hauling high value goods in an easilyganked ship youre an idiot and need to shut up and accept that you took a big risk and lost remember that industrial ships cost far less than the battleships used to gank them what you want is higher penalties from ccp because you cant be bothered to carry a billion isk worth of goods in a ship able to withstand a single gank ship freighter ganks require a lot more firepower than 100 million isk can put on the fieldonce again risk versus reward if you want to be a cheapass and haul expensive stuff in cheap ships you run the risk of being ganked with cheap ships if you want to protect your goods get a freighter use a blockade runner so you can cloak up and avoid being scanned move it in a battleship hire a courier that can cover the price of your stuff on collateral dont autopilot learn to watch your surroundings there are ways to avoid being ganked ive never lost a hauler to a highsec gank even when transporting absurdly expensive goods in a bestowerpodding gankers wont fix the problem go ahead and do it itll save us the trip back to where we stored our gank ships
eh the only annoying thing about all of it is that the t2 exhumers are made out of paper and are easily killed with something costing a few million isk even if you do tank them its like spitting in the wind for the most part a fully tanked hulk is about 22k ehp while the mackinaw only gets up to 13k ehp if they had about 20 more cpu and another 5075 pg theyd be a lot more viablein comparison the orca was a well designed ship by ccp  because you can fit it in a variety of ways as anything from a fragile maxcargo version to a welltanked version or something in between
this the argument of well life sucks get a helment in eve loses its value when you start spitting hard data on tankability of mining ships these daysnot saying mechanics suckjust sayingits too easy gank sa it issomenot much but some consideration should be given to defensive capabilitiesits not enough for me to get loud and crazy aboutyetbut its a problem thats becoming a little too obviousit would be nice to require a little bit more than a single ship to gank a tech 2 mining barge ship for crying out loud stop the evemail spam
thats a better approach change corporation management to 2x with 1 members per levelbump mega corp and empire control to 5x and 7xinsert a new 4x skill giving 5 members and also needing social vanddrop the mechanic that allows an unskilled player to inherit control of corps and alliances
looks like he is listening to those bothered by the goon and nullsec slanted csm but some of my concerns right now relate to whether the csm is maybe focused on a particular aspect of the game and im starting to get feedback from players that they worry the csm is too preoccupied by a certain playstyle that might mean we may need to change the structureeurogamer interview
a proof or get outb dont hold your breathc all of the above stop the evemail spam
i to would like to see where you got that quote fromproof or it did not happen
op edited to add link
an itnerview isnt something id hold much stock inid be more keen on a devblog at that rate stop the evemail spam
assuming what is in this interview is actually what was said and legit then this can only be a good thing i take this article as a hint that ccp sees the problem but hasnt found a resolution yet i would expect to see a devblog someday with more information and what they intend to do to correct said issue
a step in the right directin is still a step 
why is it a problem that ccps pr tool is focussed on the part of the game that actually generates headlines and interest from external mediawhen was the last time you guys did something to affect the way thousands of people play the game
so i am not sure where this came fromi saw an image somewhere i think or i had a hallucination either way this would be cool we all want corp and alliance logos on ships i propose it not be a paintjob but a holographic glowing image that hovers slightly over the hull not sticking straight up in the air on top of the ship or nothing but placed in a few spots on each ship depending on the size of the ship and flat against the hull just raised up a bit and glowingif this was already proposed somewhere or ccp has already stated this is being done then please disregard this post but please provide a link to said image or thread
seriously this idea is far better than my boobies thread and its getting more attention nobody thinks this would be cool for logos on ships
restricting a module bonus to certain shiptypes seems dubious im all for railguns have integrated sensor systems thats a cool idea but if an amarrian or minmatar captain wants to mount railguns too i dont see any reason to  on them
tbh been looking at the numbers in evehq and looking at the bonuses itd bring compared to logi lock times the 5 is still lacking so id be tempted to boost it to 10 per turret with no stacking penalty btwyahh and drop that race id thing i think it was more there to encourage use of lesser used pvp ships bt tbh they individually need to be rebalanced instead of having additional trinkets bundled in with them

i can not resist this thread about boobs i do have to ask since youre av is alone in a room no one will see boobs bounce but you i must assume you have a female av to play with should ccp add some dance moves and maybe wiggling sexual poses to the sofa so you can um watch your av one handedsorry i could not resist dont take this response personally necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
youre in luck we now have the technology to minimize running programs and bring up pornographic web sites you can see all the bouncing boobies you want isnt the future wonderfulsummary of eves last four expansions
i support adding jiggly boobs in game anyone who disagree with me or other wise say boobs shouldnt jiggle a bit in a realistic fashion is a raging homesexual end of thread end of debate
i am sure that in time when wis is fully realized we will be able to see other players
simply because some of us namely you spend their entire life on a game and thus have never seen a boobflamers gonna flamei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the problem i have with name changing is the ability to see whos in local in the area i currently live in this means that i know most of the bad guys at a glance know what they fly and how they behaveallowing name changes for everyone would lead to a lot more effort for the people that do live in an area for awhileread nulllow less population so easier to know everyone around you i think i would allow a name change only once per character on an account if it was due to a bad choice of name for someone but as to giving people carte blanche to change whenever they felt like it a definite no go for me i am afraid i still think this would only affect a small number of subscribers as most people once theyve chosen a name identify with this name so are likely to keep it anywayi probably wouldnt have chosen the name i have on my main account but its me now and i will never change it
this topic has been going on for a year now with the same arguments going back and forth without any new contributions for the last 6 months you have touched upon the key factor here in your mention of the fact that this indeed should affect only a small fraction of the population i brought up this same point earlier this year in the old thread in the old forums anyone who has been been in these forums long enough and who can read between the lines can see that the real hidden agenda here has nothing to do with charity for those few cases of badly named characters who want to have it changed to improve their sense of self worth and enjoyment in the game thats just the charitable front what it is really for is the sanctioned legalization of systematic 1 time name changes for everyone which can only benefit 2 demographics those who buy farmed characters and those who sell farmed characters not that there is anything illegal about the farmed character market
and there is never a new bad guy whats the difference if there comes some new contact in local and blows you up or some of the old ones changes name and blows you upbut anyways most of us are for one time change per account so that wouldnt really be a great deal for pirates and alike
bigger voicewe need more xs to be noticed
this i agree with id like to say this ive introduced a lot of people to the game and not one of them has ever used a reactivated trial account to do it there are a few reasons for this people usually dont remember the login credentials for a 4 year old accountsteam often has 5 eve sales but these only cover new accounts not existing ones including trialsthe buddy system only works for new accounts not existing ones including trialsbasically theres zero incentive for people to use an old accountalso i know that new players dont really understand this but two weeks is not a lot of training time if they have to retrain it theyll deal with it somehow poor muffinsso ya if youve paid for an account that should reserve your name and account indefinitely but all abandoned trials more then a year old should be deleted
edit lowered ship explosion value to 25 due to insurance shenanigans see post 14 changed values are in boldpulled from vile rats thread on highsec since it affects players everywhereflat death bounties have never worked in any game too easy to exploit only way to make them not profitable is to set up a bounty escrow with concord that pays out for less than the value of the destroyed items like sodead ship everyone on the killmail splits 25 of the base value of the destroyed ship and destroyed fittings not dropped up to the amount in escrow deleted the insurance thingy since i forgot to do it before doh yeep reminded me about itdead pod everyone on the killmail splits 75 of the base value of the implants plus 75 of the cost of the clone up to the amount in escrowbase value determined by typeid not by market value i need to look up implant base values to see if they need adjustment  clarificationthis makes it unprofitable to get podded by your own alt makes the pod potentially more valuable to kill and a highbounty target can be hunted for a very long time if the target flies small ships instead of supercaps it lowers the value of an individual kill but keeps the escrow running longerexamplevile rat gets bountied by annoyed highseccers after he trolled them in assembly hall for 100m isk total cheap bastards this goes into the concord escrowhe gets his cruiser blown up by 5 attackers the loss in hull and destroyed modules is 50m isk dropped stuff is up for grabs each of the 5 attackers gets a 25m bounty payout 50m255 the escrow goes down to 875m still on vile rats headthey manage to nab his pod and all 5 get on the killmail vile rat had implants and their base value  the cost of his clone are 500m 500m75 is more than whats left in the escrow so each attacker gets 875m5175m for the podkill instead of 500m75575mnow if the bounty was significant like 10b isk not only does vile rats pod become a potentially juicier target but the escrow stays high enough that he can be hunted again and again he can hide in a station or go out without implants but the clone value still makes it worthwhile and not having implants only makes the escrow last longeradding a bounty to the destroyed ship is just a thought as it gives a solo roamer a reason to go after a wanted pilot even if he might not be able to nab the pod if that gets too complicated just forget it and keep the 75 bounty on the implants and clone priceclone cost since clone cost is in flux and not necessarily directly related to sp use the cost of a clone that would cover the wanted players sp over or under cloning doesnt count and just results in expense or sp loss as normal

as someone already pointed out the csm is better than nothing at this point in timehow do you propose we get a more balanced view of the customers of evethere are 10 members only 2 of them are goons so i seriously doubt that mittani and vile rat are running the show and telling everyone else what to agree to you also have ccp representatives there who will not allow one alliance to run eve their way there will be balances and checks on anything proposedeve has been here since 2003 its now 2011 and its still the best mmo out there because ccp do listen eventually to their customers csm just helps them a long a little but doesnt dictate ccps ultimate strategy for their business only ccp can do that
for youthis is a space ghost from coast to coast talking about csm and goonsenjoy
i wholeheartedly approve of this product and or servicegive this man a bells1
csm are hardly even active within the community even their own forums section they work more for their alliance than the game community as a hole i see their posts once in awhile nothing really productive comes from it yeah sure you read their logs but what good is that reallyi support their removal due to their uselessness to the community as a whole
feh not even an interesting troll
youve obviously never lived in a wormhole ever your ignorant statement is proof enough just yesterday we lost an orca in pvp inside our wormhole we get neutrals coming and going inside our wormhole all the time we have to arm ourselves and keep vigilant at all times to stay alive very little danger from other players my assthe reward is only for those who can take it not every corp who waltzes into a wormhole become wealthy many corps who choose wh life fail because they cannot keep up with the costs of pos fuel or the constant harassment of other players i would suggest actually living in wormhole space first before forming an opinion about itwithout exploration theres nothing to be had in wormholes seriously your ignorance of wh mechanics and life is one thing but having the gall to form opinions about a subject you clearly know nothing about reeks of stupiditysummary of eves last four expansions
troll or not biomass yourself
remove pos for c1c2 maybe c3 holes theyre impossible to kill given wh limit and it would free up holes for beginner wh explorers from highsec to get into the trade
not anymorewait for tier 3 bcspos bashing just got a little more interesting stop the evemail spam
doesnt even say it my iq dropped reading this
or  maybe throw up your own pos build stuff bash theirs yes its a long campaign but if youre that interested in bashing the other pos
too much of space is taken up by people putting up structures that are too hard to destroy  theres no reason casual boneheads shouldnt be able to easily destroy other peoples weeks and months of hard work hauling constructing etc structures on a whim whenever they want easily and without having to work hard for italso just bc theres a pos inside a wh doesnt keep you from raiding all the sites which is evidently all you intend to do anyway 
this is a great threadi know ive been conditioned as a young player to not trust anything with goon as a prefix  but from reading this thread i have new found respect for the opthis idea seems pretty out there  but what about the idea that players through large cooperative actions could change the security status of certain areasie through a concord directed set of objectives a section could move from 04 to 05the reverse could also be true  by connecting with pirate groups a system could be moved from 05 to 04
half page long post eaten wonderful attempt 2ok the opinion of a mostly high sec resident who transits low regularly and used to live in null prior to warp to 0 i honestly dont think that high needs buffing in any way in fact my feeling from a few runs is that incursions have excessive payouts though the benefits of gang experience is great what high needs is bug fixing which would improve life in nullwh also i know pos are being worked on and thats great my big concern is honestly more that there are large powerblocks in null that feel high needs nerfing to death they have messed up their own kitty litter with supercaps online and too many blues and seem to feel that the cure is to destroy high sec all this would achieve is more lost subs and even less devscommunity reps than we currently have the fix my discussions with alliance members and randoms in high sec systems seems to indicate that a large portion want to move to null or wormholesuu however the price of admission is too high be it time which there isnt much anyone can do about or more importantly the repulsion towards being renters or pets to a massive superblob alliance so in a funny way the best way to improve high might well be to concentrate on null and likely add a series of new wormholes this would have the benefit of improving high sec markets giving people something to aim for outside of high sec and encouraging the bored exnullsec types to get out and stop annoying the living  out of everyone in high this has been a problem since maybe febmarch at least  the death of the nc was not kind to high secmy reading of various solutions lead me to some by malcanis on how to limit easy travel and reduce the superblobs influence without artifical means that would ruin the sandbox feeling i must admit to being impressed by themin summary fix bugs which helps everyone and do something about the mess in null the flow on effects should be outstanding for high sec residents ps in my time of living in null we had no warp to 0 no jumpbridges very few eggs ascn had only just laid their first one iirc no anoms and no billion isk plexes yet we survived and thrived extremely well isk is not the problem imho bring back the feeling of being of an adventure in a wild frontier limit the superblobs ability to project power anywhere on the map and give people something to work on as a group outside of random destruction and structure grinding and i suspect null will thrive oh and kill the botssadly many of the problems seem to be player created null is now basically a crappy version of high sec run by super factions with the main difference being war decs are not required to shoot at opponents it should be a frontier of adventureapologies for the derail however i really feel this is relevant to your question all eve is interconnected and if one part falls ill we all suffer as has been the case over the last 12 months derail off 
agreed  null already has the best isk in the game  yet only a minority of players live there  isk is not their main concern  theyre looking for adventure find a way to actually attract players to nullsec rather than trying to force them there  forcing will only result in lost subsat the end of the day most players simply arent attracted by 24x7 pvp living under the thumb of some large powerbloc  that level of politicking and for average pilots isk loss is simply never going to be fun for most players  your average joe already slaves away 12 hrs a day working under someones thumb or feeling bullied by people with more money than they can ever hope to have  why play a game nullsec thats just more of the same sure its great for those on top  but most people by definition will never be on topnullsec alliances are great  they have their critical place in the large backdrop of eve  but what will attract and keep average players are new types of gameplay and new territories made more accessible to a lower experienced  less pvp skilled class of pilotthe nullsec elite can denigrate this all they like but should realize that its this huge bulk of more average  armchair players that are needed to feed the ccp subscription engine so we can keep eve alive if you want them to stay and keep paying youve got to give them a reason  and theyve already told us by not living in nullsec that nullsec life is not very attractive 
1 on this bounty ideanecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
no it doesnt what makes sense is that there is more profit in null and low moongoop there is nothing stopping ccp from having a new set of moongoops that can be found in high sec that are all new and take none of the profit from null or low secwhat doesnt make sense is keeping moongoop and moon operations a mystery to those that would like to try it out and then perhaps grow into low and null sec operations having something in high sec to fight over moons planets resources may be just what high sec needs and may be just the right level of training ground that encourages more people to pvp learn the ropes in saftey and then go out into the big red part of the mapnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
oh my underwear what did you do but seriously though this idea is awesome some csm guy or ccp devs please give some feedback about this thingy it looks wonderfull really awesomeness concentrated in a wall of text
what im looking for in high sec is exactly the same that i look for in low sec and that id probably look for in null if i found an incentive to venture therei want to immerse into the illusion of a living breathing world not just a game places i visit should be interesting with backgrounds by both players and npcs visible and easily accessible i want to see a difference if the planet next to me has a population of 10 billion or none things should make sense and not disrupt the illusioni want a universe that changes i want random events that change the game locally i want markets rats and system security that change dependent on player activity i want places that are not frequented to offer more and better missions and former hubs that have become deserted i want a different jita every few yearsi want lots of things to do that are actually interesting with depth and variety missions that are not everthesame smuggling that works trading that requires more than updating my orders mining that includes a set of tools and decisions that make it a challenge etc i want to be able to get better at things not just by training to level 5 but because i devised a better tactic i want every of these systems to be as complex as fitting and combat currently isi want there to be choices and consequences i want standings to npc corps sec status and fw results to really affect my options i want to be able to antagonize faction x so that they will never let me dock again i want there to always be a tradeoff with every decision i want death to really hurt i want to be surprised at every corner i dont want to be able to predict everything i want branching missions that i dont know where they will lead by visiting a website i want to be able to get incredibly lucky or really misfortunate
also this is brilliant  1 a billion timesshouldnt there be a seperate proposal for this somewhere
so the actual bounty is escrowed and the payout depends on the actual cost to the person losing itthis is really good i like this a lot it doesnt create new money in the game since you have to put it up front and it causes you to only get paid if you cause hurt to the person who diedthank you for offering this idea im going to see if it can get some legs
okaymuch obliged yes its an isk sink makes it financially incorrect to kill yourself and bountying the ship makes the target a primary in gangfleet which can lead to interesting dynamics like a highbounty player in a pure bait tank and also gives a solo player a reason to take a shot
i support boosterlow sec improvements boosters are really just used by active tanked cap pilots and so hard core low sec players other than that not really used would love to see more of them
eve sounds need a redoeve needs a new sound engine as the foundation because the current one is obviously too poorly written from the ground up better sound channel management no more cutoffs no more disabled sounds better sound playback engine no more superloud guns which is stupid in the first place soundwaves or the volume or the power do not multiply or stack they simply overlap so 8 guns firing together should only sound slightly louder not 8 times louder and blowing up my speakers better directional enumeration like a real directional engine not just louder left louder right on top of the technical foundation of a new sound engine we need better made sound effects hollywood class recording and sampling and production we like they way you did the new nabulae do it the same way to the sounds trash all the effects you got from that cheap soundeffectlibrary cd no more lofi cracking sounds that clips the sound some sound effects are made too loud to begin with the overall feel of all the sounds should be deep and rumbling and epic low frequencies should be the dominating tone of the sounds things in eve are all in massive scale and they dont really give off much high frequency noise not sounding like the ships come with cheap plastic toys speakers feel free to add to the listtldr 1 new sound engine 2 new sound effects

not emptyquoting
lets face it in order to survive eve needs more subscribers  if you want to keep them youll have to appeal to a broader audience and yes that may mean doing a few things like  the other mmos out there  that may mean doing things hardcore pvpers dont respect  but most players are not and never will be hardcore pvpers  the magic if ccp can make it happen will be to please both playerbases  not one or the other  the game ecosystem cant survive nor expand like it needs to based on hardcore pvper subs alone  it doesnt matter which side of the argument youre on this is the reality
lol man i hate to say this becasue i hate it when others say it in the forums i just find it a stupid thing to say but im gonna say it here and i mean no offense at all by iteve is not the game for you sorry 
i agree with you that t2 barges are a bit too easy to kill but having said that if you are not afk mining and an obvious combat ship jumps into your belt wouldnt you be likely to watch them closely if they start burning towards you wouldnt you be spamming the warp button of course you did align to a station or a safe spot rightif you are afk mining then this is your own fault if you are not watching local and you allow another ship thats obviously not there for some ore to close on you then this is your faultsame with being ganked in a paper thin hauler use the tools you have and you will be safe from gankers a corp mate and i recently had to move 2bil worth of faction mods through hi sec we used a battleship that was tanked to hell with the other as scout guess what we didnt get ganked even though there were gankers on the gatesi have not been suicide ganked by anything in hi sec in the nearly 5 years i have been playing eve i learned very early on from other peoples mistakes not to let your guard down once you undock the only safe place in eve with 100 security guaranteed is in station undock at your peril
nothing wrong with mining ships not being able to tank  just stop insurance payouts for ships destroyed by concord gankers and all will be fine
with all due respectno  sherlockand further more its a little late if someone warps to your belt and approaches you with intent to kill ever try warping out in a hulk at full 180degree turn radius to escape from alpha strikethought soyou can say what you wantbut when the data hits the papergankers have the advantagefull alert and alldont get me wrongnot saying we should nerf suicide gankingbut a balance would be nice stop the evemail spam
in general yes you need to watch local carefully  we always tell the new folks that more then 1520 in local is too crowded for a regular mining system ideally you want a system with fewer then 10 regulars and not a lot of through traffic so that you can spot possible trouble when it hits local and if something enters the belt like a newbie frigate shuttle etc it does raise the nerves a bit and you do start paying closer attentionbut once the hostile lands on grid often at optimal range because youve been scouted by a cloaky its basically too late to warp out a mack  hulk  you will be locked and alphad before you get up to speed align time on a mackinaw is a lazy 129 sec the hulk takes 174 seconds to warp off from a deadstop both are the size of a large barn with short lock times from a bcbs sized ship the only solution to the align time is to have each hulkmack web another hulkmack so that everyone can escape faster not really possible in a fleet with members from different corporations and it makes the tank even weakergeneral concepts that we try to explain to the younger players dont mine where the gankers tend to look newbie systems market hubs main travel routes dont mine where there is a lot of traffic look at  of jumps in past 2448 hours dont mine where there are more then 1520 in local tank your ship watch local watch the overview make sure that you are always clear of the asteroids so you can warpout easily dont engage a canflipper just dock up at the first sign of trouble
sound advicebut you cant tank your shipyour dead anywaythats the problem stop the evemail spam
op is a butthurt pubbie lots of other pubbies rally round him they all propose to fix highsec high sec is fine stop yer bitching you dont like being picked on in internet space ship game either fight back or stop playing sure you can dock n hide but that just staves off the inevitable so stop filling up forumspace with useless 
 perfect example of useless particularly when they dont read stop the evemail spam
enjoy
wow you are so smartgo get another thread loser
this is hilarious if you dont like the brutality of eve go play something simpler like bubble spinner or wowdont get me wrong i hate goons too but for completely different perfectly legitimate reasons what they did to you was funny
you mean the op or whom
if translated in the context of current eventsmyself and some friends were in africa mining minerals in a territory we have no claim or rights to and the local warlord said he didnt care about the minerals but that we needed to pay him protection money or we might have an accidentthats not fairgood luck with thatoptions 1 go somewhere else2 pay the protection money and hope the warlord keeps his word3 bring your own protection and risk protracted conflict with the warlord
haha funny  more pissed off publords also this is eve if you dont like that no where but station is safe stop playing nothing regarding the sec system and concord is broken this thread is rather useless suicide ganking is part of the game as much as mining is so deal with it
maybe if you took the time to readand think theres a concept you might realize we where discussing the problem that the suicide gank mechanic is increasingly easier these days due to the fact theres not much to do in the way of defense as far as balance is concernedbut your soo busy strutting your stuff like some crazed apeyour too busy beating you chest and saying you sux haha that your looking like a total idiotso pleasegive up while you still can before you embarrass your allianceagain stop the evemail spam
i  hate it when drake and i agree on something it means the end is near

1 no one will fit an orca with remote reps you noob theres 3 high slots and 2 are always fitted with gang links and i seriously doubt 1 remote rep will be enough to stop a gank try flying one sometime before you start spouting nonsense2 oversized local reps what the hell are you getting at again local remote rep you ever fit a hulk with such a thing you even understand the concept of fitting mechanics in a industrailist sense3 agreedop never had any to begin withnor do you when it comes to miningthe problem is obviousone you fail to understand because your too busy acting like an expert short of blowing  up so let me spell it out for you noobletif someone wants to suicide gank they will do so without resistance or hesitationand they will always 99 succeed in doing so a protection fleet will fail at that point waste of time to debatethat is why people hate ityou cannot and you will not fit any mining barge in this game to withstand even an tempest fitted for alpha strikeas that is what seems to be the benchmark for most ganksi here people do it with smaller shipsdestroyer or cruiser classthat is a major gapthe problem is not the gankhow the hell else can you eliminate someone with concord protection in the first placethe problem is inability to defend from such a strike in any shape form or fashionit only takes 1 salvo to do the jobpossibly 2 if your in a lower rated security systemso for once angryengage that thing we call a brain before you respondwe already know you hate mewe already know your a nice big strong pvper who preys on easy targets with little to no effortthats not what we are discussing hereget with the program or get out stop the evemail spam
someones just mad that their free isk isnt without riskand if you want to spend 125m on a t2 fit pest to gank a hulk on the off chance that you get a wrecking blow feel freequestions see above fitpost342k ehp vs quake285k ehp v rf phased plasfoolproof no but unless the tempest gets a wrecking blow chances are youre in low shields or armor not your podalso if they use 23 tempests to guarantee the kill theyre wasting a lot of isk for a 50m bounty d
where the hell did my arguement go damn  ingame browser oh well hiro is making my point clearly and simplytank the  ship and use common sense
according to a recent dev blog ccp is trying to introduce a new class of batlecruiser that uses large weapons and will be capable of similar damage output as a battleship url is
honestlyas scary as it looksim interested in seeing what it will do to the use of the battleship overallif anything if it fails or gets overpoweredtheyll just nerf the crap out of it later stop the evemail spam
the tier 3s interest me just in the sense that while they have the ability to fit large battleshipclass weaponry they also will not be able to tank like a battleship and will have to rely on more maneuverabilityso you have a couple options fit large weapons and half tank fit medium weapons and massive tankeither show potential to either be an incredible strategic tool or an overpowered piece of  that needs to be nerfed severelyonly time will tell i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
gentlemen it is largely speculated that tier 3 battlecruisers will receive bonuses that reduce the cpupg requirements to fit battleships sized weapons similar to the way stealth bombers get reduction bonuses the idea behind them is that they will pack a punch but wont be able to fit anywhere close to a battleshipclass or even a highend battlecruiserclass tank
agreed the last thing this game needs is another bc hull much less another t3 fix the broke stuff first
bc costas much as i enjoy wild kneejerk speculation theyre  t3  how cheap do you think these things are going to be not only that but theyre obviously designed as glass cannons making them an even larger target than they would be on price alone until we see what the hulls can do on singularity this is a complete nonissue as we simply do not know what the ships are capable of
buff battleships battlecruisers are currently really close to battleships in terms of damage which isnt how things are supposed to workthe problem is battleships have troubles applying their damages to smaller ships basicly everything is smaller than a battleship and when they manage to really apply their damage they dont do much more than battlecruisers and its pretty sadtry yourself almost every battlecruiser can achieve 700 dps the brutix can go over 1k but hey blasters battleships can reach 1k some of them can reach more than 1k blaster battleships maybe the raven battlecruisers will apply 90 of their dps battleships will apply say 70 or their dps if i keep the numbers from the previous paragraph that gives you 630 dps for a random battlecruiser hurricane harbinger brutix the drake being an exception or maybe not didnt try the ham fit yet and 700 dps for a random battleship those are ingame real dps against a decent target not a structure or a ship that is sitting stillall that with a tracking problem more tank less maneuverability more skills needed for large weaponry and 3 times the price the few added dps doesnt make up for all that the added range however is great but still pretty much the only thing thats great about large weaponry aside with alphastrike for arties
alternatively nerf tier 2 bcs there  youve now indirectly buffed both battleships and tech 1 cruisers
i would like to be able to see by way of the api or other means on a monthly schedule two numbers how much new isk entered the sandbox and how much left the sandbox i would even accept one number the ratio of in to outthanks
i think weve all trained a few skills then looked back and thought why did i do that  its basically wasted sp usually in stuff that players never use and have or will subsequently train an alt forthe learning skills redistribution demonstrated that ccp have the ability to implement this in some fashion not sure if they were considering offering sp for aurum but id imagine that will be on long term hold now and not welcomed by the community that doesnt mean that players would not appreciate being able to redistribute wasted sp so i think given the current climate might be worth a look from both devs and players see if its viable and if it could be done should it be if so howsome ideas once a year fixed sp redistribute i was thinking 13m sp enough to train a couple of skills but not max or no more than a months worth of skill training players could either take it up or chose to accumulate as remaps are handled now the ability to redistribute any amount of sp at any time for a fixed penalty say at a 20 loss perhaps add some fees to that a plex or two as character transfers are handled now or leave it iskmoney free as the player will ultimately end up paying more in subs to cover the penalty loss long termits a relatively simple idea but i think its something that many players would be happy to see and hopefully isnt disadvantaging anyone or causing additional hassle for ccp if anything it might make a nice bit of side income but i suspect the key to this is if ccp does decide to charge for the service it should not be done via aurum or the nex store as it will immediately be treated as a non vanity micro transactionthe fact is it is a non vanity mico transaction but depending on how it is handled and my preference would be for the first proposal as opposed to the second not one that should disadvantage the wider playerbase cleaning up your skillsheet from training mistakes made as a noob or by previous character owners might well be considered a luxury but in moderate increments should not have a massive effect on gameplay advantagedisadvantagesthoughtsapologies if this has been proposed previously

you somehow think that the media only paid attention because the csm is slanted towards null sec i am sorry but that isnt the case at all the media only became interested when folks in highsec started attacking monuments in the trade hubs i assure you the media doesnt give a crap or even knows what highsec lowsec or null sec is lol
when was the last time anyone did something to affect the way thousands of people play the gamewhat have the big nullsec alliances done recently that affected anything besides other big nullsec alliances and dont say the goon icecapades ive seen too many ice miners happily operating unganked to believe its had that much impact and it hasnt affected most of us at all

lets try to keep our comments in list view its easier to read and this thread isnt about one thing its about all the little things that combined could give eve a bad image theres potential for a lot of posts lets keep it simple for ccp in case they want to take a look
i like the idea of the bounty not being fully paid each turn
great idea 1
1but i hereby offer a 100m bounty to the first person who can figure out a way it can be gamed so the guy with the price on his head makes a profit
trebor in my humble opinion there is no way to be gamedthe bounty is based on 75 of how much did the hunted guy loose if he ask a friend or if he destroy himself with an alt he will still loose 25 of his shipnondropped items valuehowever the hunted guy can repeatedly kill himself so he can basically consume the bounty that was put on his head but it will cost him the bounty  25this means whatever you do if youre in any way related to the hunted guy you dont make a profit a third party wont care about the hunted guys loss so its all good
wanted man gets podded once then doesnt pay for a medical clone upgrade and lets his alt kill him repeatedly losing skillpointsplease send isk edit you didnt say it had to be a sane way
hi please pay attention to this post if you care about this at alli love caps i like this idea a lot i think it can get some traction a possible part of this mechanism has been suggested that id love for you guys to smell testmaybe if you get below 5 insurance payouts go onto your bounty instead of your wallet or somethingthoughts i personally like it rip this idea apart if you can
insurance is its own bucket of worms the problem with insurance going to paying down a bounty is that insurance pays more than the investment so then you create isk out of nothing if thats the mechanism suggested plus you get to profit as the wanted man get an empty hull and platinsure then destroy it a lot i think i originally posted that the killers get the insurance in addition to the bounty escrow portion without affecting the bounty at all but that gets messy and mathheavy would it make more sense to say that wanted people are uninsurable due to the increaed risk of shiploss when everyone is paid to blow up your ship and existing policies just dont pay outof course im not sure what happens when you are at sec 10 you get a bounty and then rat your way back to 0 id recommend staying uninsurable for as long as you have a bounty on you regardless of security status
could a person be allowed to simply buy out whatever bounty remains on his head btw
100 and a few guardians to boot bump this idea needs a csm champion tbh i wonder if anyone from hark has seen it yet btw
we need better poses
looking at ccps winter expansion list it just says starbase logistcis management it sounds like a change to hangars and stuff instead of the whole pos systemi dont know about you guys but i need to see this whole plan contained within this thread go into the winter expansion to be happy its been far too long and im not going to wait through another expansion for something as epic as this heres to hoping ccp has this up their sleeve and are underplaying it on the expansion list
i agree the pos needs revision
only if you are incompetent
youre right that would make its role appear a bit undefined then i think it should have a good bonus to harvesters cpu usage at least
low sec can use any buffs it can get low sec always seems kept out of discussions when it comes to major game changes its always high sec this null sec that but never anything about low sec and its gotten depressing seeing this happen for so long low sec might not be the most populated area but its still a significant part of the game that is being left to deteriorate
double post
this is probably the most wellthought out and presented idea for the improvement of low security space that i have seen in a while all of the suggestions are ing awesome and with these suggestions especially the gas cloud spawns it may draw more of the minerindustrialist element into low sec as they could be working for varying local pirate groups as a contractor to assist in the manufacturing of boosters thus it is quite well rounded and has an appeal for just about everyonei definitely support this idea 1i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i like your ideas for faction contested space which yes should include piratesbut eve is a universe which should be diverse so not all of low sec and while pvp is a draw there are many of us who dont want to play pvp in ships but do want to play in a dangerous universe where this happensother options should exist for low sec as well in areas not involved in faction conflict to allow people to play as they wishbut for faction areas good call
hi if you dont know what siri is check the following vid
no support
i respect you opinion but why i think we should introduce new technology to eve before it comes out on other mmos
me too dont want thatccp really please dont use upgraded limited experimental and prototype in item names it sounds like the item is actually worse than basic meta 1 item use calibrated enhanced optimized and upgraded its really easy to understand that the item is better than meta 1 and its also in alphabetic order
no there are plenty of voice recognition programs out there i know dragon naturally speaking is the most popular if you want to talk to your computer then you should use one of them they should be able to interface fine with eves text boxes so you can dictate mail like thati see no reason at all to spend developer time implementing a new control system thats less accurate and efficient than the current one just because its something different that kind of feature bloat of adding things that dont actually add anything to eve just because it sounds cool is what caused all of this uproar over the last 6 months so no just no
i think there should at least be an api exposed for softwares such as this so handicapped and non handicapped if they prefer can make use of the software to actually have a chance at playing eve most of this software cannot recognize buttons and other objects on the eve screen the farthest that i have seen in terms of compatibility are something along the lines of move mouse up click move mouse down etc programs with a standard windows forms interface can be accessed by these programs in an easier manner such as click submit select name textbox if a similar mechanism was exposed for eve even if ccp didnt do the voice recognition themselves software may work so that a player can say more intelligent things instead of  move left click here etc a player may say click science and industry click agent finder etc i think that would be beneficial and may not require much work on the part of ccp
ive used sirithe problem is reaction time and accuracyif you need fast voice recognition will not be useful and it still makes mistakesand cost i dont think ccp can afford to develope their own or purchase the license for someone elses
although exposing information so that a number of voice programs can use hook into them shouldnt have a prohibitive cost associated with it and would be a huge leap for disabled and lazy gamers
hmm if the cost was passed onto the gamer in the form of them paying for the licence that might be doableand as you said it would help those with physical disabilities dont care about the lazy ones
the cost should be minimal and it is unreasonable to charge for this i am not saying license out voice recognition software  i am saying expose an api or informational system of some sort so existing or new programs can hook into eve and play one shouldnt have to use a specific voice recognition software to use it
someone still has to buy a license to use the voice recognition software unless a freeware version exists that i am unaware of
any kind of external api to allow interfacing with the gameplay would be heaven for all botters itll never happen and no rmters will not care at all about paying 30 for a license to run their bot farms
right however the software could be left up to the end user much like many other applications as for the concern of botting it only makes it marginally easier to write a bot however most botters do not write the bot but pay for the bot and bot all day writing bots isnt the issue it is the use of bots from an end users perspective bot usage is the same either way bot detection still has to be done another way
yeah mocam hits the nail on the head here although shortening the clone timer does seem like a slightly higher priority as it would make clones finally useful for wspace dwellers as the 24hr jc timer atm interacts with the 24hr cycle of most kspace whs to create a cycle of unwanted clone movement all over the place in fact i may need to take a weeks sabbatical from wspace in the notsodistant future just to do the clone shopping thing without interference from what the kspace exit from home is doingso in shortfirst priority infomorph interfacing rank 5 skill charismawillpower requires informorph psychology 5 and science 5 shortens ones clone timer by 3 per levelsecond priority advanced informorph psychology rank 6 skill charismawillpower requires informorph psychology 5 and science 5 gives 1 extra clone per level
only 3  id rather see the timer reduced by 10 per level otherwise we would still have to wait over 20 hours even with the skill at lvl 5 heck why not 15 so at lvl 5 its reduced by 75 most people i know of use jcs so they dont have to risk their expensive implants for some casual pvp and having to wait 24 hours before getting back to your 4s or 5s is the main reason i and lots of people i know dont pvp very often a 20 or 12 hours is till a long time to wait and most people will have gone back to bed by then the best solution might actually be to add a skill that allows several s each cylce rather than shorten it that way you could do your business and then not have to wait all that time just to back

congrats for making it clear to everyone that you dont know a thing about internet advertisingseriously stellar work
certain ads only appear based upon your search history which would implyoh dear
free kugutsumen
good site interesting and insightful lots of content all the major personalities of eve are represented there and many post regularlyoften linked as a source in evenews24com for bad or illthe fact its banned from the eve forums and the reason why kugu was banned in the first place lends legitimacy to the site incase ccp were wondering
we have a policy of asking our advertisers to not give us ads for eve gold selling sites or sites related to activities not allowed under the eula however many of our advertisers use google analytics and other such services to provide ad viewers with advertisements typical of their common internet browsing experiences this means that the advertisements you see are related to the sites you commonly visitif you are getting advertisements which advocate botting this means that you often frequent sites whose contents include botting this does not mean you bot  i would never unjustly accuse someone of that  but it does mean you might often visit conversations about botting it is an irony that a person who often engages in discussion against botting would receive custommade advertisements for bots but that is the way it worksthis is the same reason that people like vile rat moderator of a political forum on a comedy website gets ads for things like ron paul
if you could pull this off you would have my axe and a few bows and a few swords
it would be pretty awesome to see if yo can pull it off im always in favour of war no matter who starts it or whythe biggest stumbling block will be the enormous apathy and discontent that the hisec alliances seem to hold perhaps the time has come  hisec vs nullsec
i hope that ccp does keep 1 team on the wis at least so that progress can be made on establishments even though it may take a full year to come outthere has been a lot of work done on in wis i would like 1 team to tie it up together and produce somethingi am willing to accept buggy incarna if given a heads up that it is buggy and optional i have been waiting since 2007 for this expansion when it was originally called ambulation
uh i dont think incarna was ever intended to be an fps space stations are delicate enclosed artificial ecosystems like aquariums you dont let people run around with weapons that can poke holes in them jita 44 is a military owned space station no way would the caldari navy let civilians run around with guns if you want to shoot people in the eve universe youll have to play dustincarna is a social simulator like second life in space but without furries or flying dongs boring for dedicated pvpers but a goldmine for social players and roleplayers apparently roleplayers already have tavern channels where they all pretend they are in a room together incarna just throws them a bone more subscriptions is better for all of us even if some of the new players are playing the game the wrong way on the upside not needing combat mechanics means it should be relatively easy to get a basic multiplayer version functional they just need to code a few basic social animations appropriate to the setting please not the macarena  a couple simple table top games like space poker and space chess so players have something to do and figure out a way to have more than one avatar in a room without melting graphics cards1000 avatars potentially all being the the same corridor together is probably unfeasible for the first iteration instead of having the door open to the station the door can open to an elevator you enter and select a destination if the destination is full or the owner doesnt want you then you dont get to go there im sure fire codes and environmental regulations on a space station are quite strict so there will be no problem coming up with a lore reason why hundreds of people arent allowed in the same room if all the public establishments are full your buddy can at least invite you to come to his cq and watch space tv together even as few as a dozen people in a room would provide something for social players to latch on to and give people a reason to buy expensive shoes it could be like the sims but in space people love the sims

wuts goin on her
a few notes on aligningif you are at a deadstop then it doesnt matter which way you are pointing when you click alignto or warpto or doubleclick in space your ship instantly turns ignore the graphic and immediately starts accelerating to 75 max velocity in order to enter warp doesnt matter whether you were originally pointed in the right direction 180 degrees opposite whateverwhere alignment does come into play is if you are at a nonzero speed in order for your ship to warp off in the direction that you want it to the engines have to beat the inertia of the moving ship around and line it up on the vector at the same time that it is trying to get to 75 speedfor those curious to test this  try webbing a corpmates freighter sometime if you apply the web when it is sitting at zero velocity youll find that it warps off almost immediately such as after a gate jump if you apply the web as it exits a station or when it is moving at full speed the freighter will spend a lot of time turning around to get on the outbound vector before it can warp off
thats okay we dont mind role playing the bad guys so that other players have the opportunity to role play the heroes just think of us as rats like sanchas or serpentis but with slightly better ai and a terrible forum presence once you learn our moves were not much more troublesome to deal with than belt rats

what the hell does aggression mechanics have to do with gccsand saying that in high sec ships dont explode because concord says so is ahem dumb or any other entity for that matter
i too like the idea of exploding ships howerver because the ship scraps spread out like a shotgun the explosion radius would be more like the closer you are the more damage you recieveand whats more because the captials have such big jump engines the explosion should be much more violentto balance it out against smaller ships the explosion of capitals should be prolonged for about 1015 sec enouch time for smal ships to get the hell out
no they arenttheyre tier 3 tech 1 bcs the same way a maelstrom is a tier 3 tech 1 bsand we dont have a clue what theyll be like so lets not scream for nerfs yet v
that doesnt look nice i think that if they want to make t3 bcs they should improve bss in general as theyre too close to bcs right now
battle cruisers as far as i am aware were supposed to be less capably tanked battle ships with similar damage output bcs make up for this in speed and agility though this new tier 3 bc is just an extension of this although magnifiedship for ship even the new tier 3s will die in a fire to a bs so why do bss need buffing
i might once have agreed with this proposal but for the fact that alpha tempests kick the snot out of bc fleets one may argue that for this to be viable that the battleship must be in a large fleet but thats the nature of that particular beast the battleship isnt a small gang roamer its the backbone of fleet combat i dont think they need buffing for a role they already fill nicely
i am very interested to see exactly what these machines do to the face of the battlefield will they be able to fit 7 or 8 of the largest bs guns probably not will they tank like an abbadon no way will 10 of these things be able to outfight half a dozen bss i guess it depends on what fits are used and so oni dont think they will unbalance play or make bss redundant i think it will just make for a changing and more dynamic battlefield exactly what we need
thank god you dont work for ccpif you had your way these things would be 100 worthlessas a whole people are freaking out way too much about these ships they will not be doing 1200dps like many bs are capable of and they will not be tanking 1000 dps like many bs are capable of chances are they will be a faster bs with 1 or 2 less guns 12 the cap 12 the nuet range a smaller drone bay and about 12 the hp i dont see these new ships greatly exceeding the dps of the current bcs instead they will be trading the tracking and cap consumption of the medium guns for the range and alpha of the larges expect 6 guns with a single dmg bonus
theyre just mad little carebears theyre mad because they didnt get a shiny new toy before the pvperswell heres the harsh realityeve is a pvp gameeverything you do in eve is pvpcombat pvpmarket pvpcontracts pvpscams pvppi pvp either by marketting or using it to fuel a postrading pvpmining pvp competition for belts marketting marketting of manufactured goodssingle shard universe folks i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
lets clear up some things about le new battlecruisers shall we1 while they will have the damage out put similar to a battleship they wont have a tank anywhere close to it2 they are a tier 3 ship not a tech 3 ship what this means is that they will be more expensive than the other two existing battle cruisers and will hopefully perform better they will still be able to be one upped by hacs or strategic cruisers assuming both pilots arent stupid3 these new battle cruisers will be very effective against battleships and other battle cruisers but the effectiveness against other ships of smaller size will be less due the slow tracking speed of battleship guns and the increased speedmaneuverability of the battle cruiser 4 it will still have the tanking ability of a battle cruiser so it wont be a very hard nut to crack5 they are fulfilling a specific role in the standard fleet that has been missing tldr  stop bitching about new ships that are actually a good idea
hmm bc with large guns slower and less accurate then hac or t3 yeah an engagement between the two will go badly for the tornado pilots i think sounds about right
agreed this thread is totally jumping the gun they havent even been tested and were already tearing down ccps ideas our ideas i love this community but were a bunch of premature whiners

definitely not ever
i think this goes back that people need to be held accountable for their good andor  poor decisions therefore i cannot support this as it would be  near gamebreaking as it would create a huge imbalance furthermore accountability for ones actions you make a good decision good for youyou make a bad decision live with it and learn from it furthermore figure out what the  you want to do or where you failed to make a good decision and train said skillsand if that doesnt work i agree with sketch biomass your tooni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

insurance isnt going to help a hauler pilotagain insurance doesnt help here and the problem with t1 haulers isnt the ship its the cargothe only tanky haulers out there are deep space transports and orcas both have quite large vulnerability windows on gates and undocks due to their long align times at least the orcas cha doesnt drop its contents when the ship pops making it a semiviable option albeit one that takes a while to train for blockade runners despite their covops cloak and fast align time have trouble when they land short on stations and get decloaked by the station rendering them surprisingly vulnerable to a waiting gank fleet pl lost a 6billion isk viator in jita this wayill leave points 45 and 6 for others to answer with one exception that fastlocking alpha ships within a few seconds can gain an unexpected edge because even if you click warp as soon as they land on grid theres a good chance theyll simply pop you while youre still aligning out to warp and instawarps out of belts arent practical given the requirements of mining one
hmm yes insurance should be removed for criminal activitythen again it should also be removed fordying in a warzoneself destructingit should alsohave increased rates the more you lose shipshave a ridiculous 30 page contract that you must sign and follow to the letter or risk voidance of insurancehave an actual budget instead of infinite iskforce you to pay to get anything ie no free 40you want all that too

this whole thing is ridiculous back in late 2003 when my at the time bf started to play eve he also felt the need for a bit more of a female touch to the game including boobies and everything else that comes with a lady it took him a few months but he eventually in early 2004 got me to play the game with him then he had the best of all worlds he had eve and could see boobies while he played he had a girlfriend who enjoyed his weird obsession as well as had fun playing eve with him but most importantly he had the ability to have s3x while eve was on i can not tell you how many times we did it to eves sound track miner stories and nouvelle rouvenor hero ftwso instead of implying that ccp should do this soon no you didnt say it but you did imply it maybe you should get a girlfriend she might not play eve with you but at least you can see some realistic boobage oh wait youre whining about a lack of boobage in a game thats primary focus and pretty much only focus is flying around in space ships doing things whether those things are done at poss or in missions or asteroid belts the primary and only focus is with ships now granted theres also a focus on how ships are fitted and what you do with them but guess what that includes what shipsso yeah go get a girlfriend if you cant then change your life style so that you canedit oh yeah forgot to mention that the ships we fly in this game dont even have crews were in pods that allow us to control the entire ship thus negating the need for a crew
im married and i wouldnt object to realistic fluid motion in incarna but adding jiggle to models is a lot more work than then op probably thinks and isnt worth ccps time until wis becomes a compelling reason for new players to subscribe to eve
im marriedmy wife agrees with me on this topic ohand our ships have crews clown i figured that it wouldnt be too hard since they managed to get hair done pretty well and after seeing the carbon videos on youtube and how they are going for realism i figured this shouldnt be much to ask for i could be wrong though
its bump time
i support punchingwarps they look so cool and the current warp effect is so old and lame
for further inspiration
do like its awesome though we might need some kind of effect showing where is the target warping it would be a bit too far if there is literally no way to tell where did the target warp even if we had our eyes on it

oh there always is bad guys are like cockroaches where i live but heres the thing once identified i dont need to check again because their name doesnt change at present saves me some effort trying to decide if its a threat or not but of course this is eveyou are all a threat curse you all 
again an argument based on an assumption that everyone will change their name as soon as this feature is made available this is simply not going to be the caseif you can afford one glance surely another glance at their aka tab would not be too much trouble to go through to have this feature implemented alternatively set standings with your bad guys and your oneglance scenario returns with amazing efficiency
case in point sentenced 1989 if that name doesnt scream made in china i dont know what does  not that there is anything wrong with that
alliance sets standings and it wouldnt be that great to have corp or even worse personal standings in null secas i have previously said i am all for 1 change and 1 change only per account this way anyone that made a bad choice of name can change it just be alot more careful picking your new name
if this would work i may have to pay out but i must insist you provide a personal demonstration

since ccp is on a roll these days fixing internet spaceships i find it appropriate to request the return of rigs to your ship fittingswhen i autofit a ship these days i die on a regular basis i find it annoying having to scroll through 700 different items to find my rigs and i sometimes even forget to do it causing embarrassing lossmails it used to be that when you fit your ship with the autofitter rigs were included and if i remember correctly they even gave a warning about the rigs this was removed when fittings were moved to server storage instead of local storage i want it backi therefore propse the followinginclude rigs to the autofitting toolallow a warning that can be disabledinclude an option always include rigs when fitting your ships that can be reseti believe this will remove a source of great annoyance to a lot of pilotseditoh and while youre at it ccp how about including a standard ammo loadout as well
i support this initiative
supporting this
supporting thisin addition for those of us with serious hangar ocdthe ability to configure the load fitting button to allow access to certain permitted station containers would be good ie only access to unlocked containers or only access to containers with password xxxx etc in this way the button would access modules you have stored in specific containers unlike currently where you have to drag them out individually without disturbing stuff you had stored in other containers for whatever reasonone way to achieve this may be the creation of a specific loadout container item to seed on the market which would be the only type of container to have modules pullable by the fitting tool thinking from an ease of programming perspective here

perhaps expand this idea to include sov mechanics and outpoststhey could have the current small med lrg towers but then add outpost and station class towersthe outpost class towers could be anchored to moons or planets and would function as the current tcu and ihubs do while integrating some stuff from normal possthe station class could function like current outposts do and only be anchored to planets but have the benefits of being able to add defenses and balance it with limited storage space still way more than current poss have ofc and perhaps a limit to the number of people who can be docked at oncethese would follow the modular setup and would work well with the current ihub and outpost upgrading mechanics while allowing even more flexibilitythis could be great for small alliances that could use the defensive abilities around tcusihubs that are cost balanced with the other functions the modular system offers and it would allow all pos like objects to be in one organized category instead of the huge gaps between the current structures ihub outposts moon pos

1hate to resurrect but this deserves another day in the sun and needs be picked up by csm not so hot about the bounty system here  ogopogos idea yonder seems better and so much more elegant and easy to implementedit sorry link added
i havent seen his but im sure there are betterplanned bounty ideas out there i just think that an expansion that features such an emphasis on concord and piracy should also include the new bounty system so many people wantim curious to see what new content is coming in the winter expansion
thank you for resurrecting my epic afk cloak thread i wouldnt know what id do without it
the zombielord strikes again
if its afk just ignore him
stay on topic this thread is obviously now about necromancers
i think one of the more important things is just having more stuff to do especially with others more group related things or just more things in general need to be added maybe a smaller scale privatefleetwise incursion or other random events
for hi sec a lot but then again not that much mainly a bit more contenta bit of a rebalance on the suicide ganking but no removal under any circumstances insurance seems the most popular optionwar decs need something to stop the griefing types but allow for in game problems and rivalries to be played outa bit of protection from pvp for noobs id like to see a trial period protection so they have to initiate it through being stupid so yes can flipping to remain but lets ease them in to harsh world eve ismore or variable missions would be nice as once youve learnt them they are just an isk and salvage generator which are so boringmy personal likes scan sites could do with more variation on types and throw some ice in there please yes i love grav sites magnetic sites are not really worth the effort make more salvaging a lvl 4 missions even the odd t2 part doesnt make make up for the isk you get for the same time on a lvl 4 so a buff there neededmore wormholes to low and 00 would be nice too i enjoy the odd foray deep into the wilds and the danger it bringsno more nerfs though until low sec is fixed in various ways and 00 expands to allow remote areas of space most will stay here and if ccp is to finance greater changes the subs are needed
i definitely support more content in lowsec i especially like the idea of an underworld component
a criminal underworld element would give a whole new facet to eve gameplay thus expanding the sandbox in which we play and give players many new options would they spend their time smuggling which actually would now be a legitimate career path or patrolling the spacelanes which would give a new element to the antipirate and security based corporations would make for a nice isk sink and actually would tie in quite nicely with incarnas future imagine walking through the station and an npc approaching out of a dark corridor to talk to you or the opening of establishments that could serve as fronts for more illicit operations a bar hiding a narcoticsbooster smuggling operation would also open up a whole new facet of immersion for the roleplayers within the game so this idea benefits everyone with the exception of the lazy carebears that are too afraid to leave high sec but you never no this could even get them off their esthis needs to keep receiving attention so ihe devs see the attention it is getting and maybe pique their curiosity i dont mean shameless plugs and hollow bumps but feedback with content suggestions et cetera this needs to happen on some leveli am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i had a thought about a boost for low sec and outlaws this will seem very heavy handed but low sec really does need a boost this big so bear with me i will try to balance it out keep in mind this is also a rough mental draft and i can understand why people would be against this i welcome your criticism i wouldnt be surprised if this idea was thought up in part somewhere else but here goespos raiding warning no tldr introduce a new ship for each race possibly of a new class or as i would prefer a new electronic attack ship for each race allow them to fit a specialized module that offlines a poss shields and weapons for a short time a very short time this will allow pirates to make off with some nice goodies and give some more income potential to low sec pvp this will bring some attention and purpose to eas but their extreme fragility will not make defense hopeless for pos owners if a new ship cant be made for this purpose then a specialized module could be introduced that can only be fitted to electronic attack shipsthe possibility of raiding will force pos owners to actually defend their holdings rather than putting up death stars in lownull and just gaining massive passive income from moon minerals and such raiding parties can head out to null and bring some action with them if ccp was feeling particularly evil they could make this allowed in high sec sec status loss and all the rules of aggression would most likely be similar to can flipping smaller 00 alliances would be able to actually deal some damage to the big ones through their infrastructure pos raiding done right could be an integral part of 00 warfareof course there will need to be balancing to keep raiding in check being a part of a pos raid will result in a loss of security status this makes low sec living more attractive as it is another avenue of pvp and profit for people not allowed in high sec this will limit how widespread raiding is to those only willing to lose lots of sec or people with none left to lose  the time window that a pos is offlined will have to be very small in order to prevent abuse say only a few minutes this will also insure a degree of skill is required on the part of the raiders to make it worth the effort a pos can only be raided so often perhaps once per day or a system can only have so many pos raids happen in a space of time say 2 per hour such a limit would be dictated by ccp when a poss shields and weapons are shut down by a raiding party the owning corporationplayer will receive an ingame notification so that they may muster a defense if you are half a universe away from your pos and unable to defend tough  you shouldnt be reaping the benefits of something you cant protect dont set up what you cant afford to lose  this goes back to forcing people to actually pay attention to their holdings as previously statedlike i said this is only a rough mental draft but one i have been thinking of for some time and yes i know that because i made a lengthy post that does not automatically qualify me as a game designer or that my feature will be adopted  at the very least i am throwing my hat into the ring and trying to foster discussion on fixing low sec
i personally have never felt the need to use voice activation software to play eve as i am quite attached to my mouse and keyboard i also use tsventmumble so it would be a pain to have my cursor bounce all over the place when i speak to someone apologies if this is not how it works never used iti think it would have some merit for those that had difficulty in using a mouse or keyboard but as already mentioned there is already software for this and i do think it would have an added cost for the rest of the eve players however minimal if it was to be implementedi dont support this proposal
this clearly could be toggleable and configurable so your first issue should not be a problemthe software out there as previously mentioned has no way of detecting items in the game and is hardly useable all the eve client needs is some sort of interface for these softwares to hook into
blahi completely missed the point
this opidea is utterly insaneas much as the idea may seem nice it would be an utter nightmare with the issues that already persist in this gameeve online is a complicated game as it isadding an another layer of voice commands in the midst of voice communicatinos is just begging for disasterif you have trouble understanding thisevery time you click your mouse buttonthats a voice commandcount the clicksthen you start to get the picturemacrosthats not allowedno chaeting nowyepnot a good ideanot supportingps this excludes out of game assistance due to those who require voice commandsbut even thena game like thiswouldnt work very well anyway stop the evemail spam
system name pronunciation alone would wreck thiswarp to the maadirmilire gate at 100 kmnifty as it would be for disabled people who have trouble using the mouse for extended periods of time i cant imagine giving targeting and module use orders it would be hard enough as a miner telling it which asteroid you want targetted and making sure your lasers dont double up on the same rock now think about what it would be like for a logi or ecm pilot trying to issue voice commands

contact me please inside eve
its not a trollits total war
contact me
im in your public channel
tried to reach you but u loggedmail me please and ill give u some further detailsroldanus
not really orisaim ok with pvpi just dont support abuseslow and null sec are great to continue the path to territory claims and sovereignty but not making the life of newcomers and players interested of other aspects of the game suckpvp alliances can have their thirst for war quenched in null and low and i can say its a big and vast placethe only reason is that at some point these alliances do not want to mess with each other often and they go and find miners and noobs to blow what makes eve economy work is pvp in the end what big alliances are doing is just distorting the market and slowing down economy instead of going after real targets they kill miners its like hunting in the zoo much easierbut quite coward at the same timei do believe that the final intent of this is to balance the equation and restore high sec fun if the concord cannot then we willenjoy
hmmm total war against the null empires this sounds like fun if all the high seccers took arms against the 00 seccers then this would be like a  galactic civil war and you guys would be some kind of empire trying to subdue its outer ring colonies from rebelling where have i seen this before
i have 3 questions1 why is targetting our enemies primary source of vital materials not a valid tactic in war2 why cant we just use neutral alts to do our highsec shopping for us you know like we usually already do3 most important question if i train my alt to fly logistics as well as my main could i call myself drizzt dourden because i would be dual wielding scimitars
i said i am in favour of it i wont be joining you i will be fighting you
this i heartily support all of the people who want to form highsec into a giant coalition against nullsec not because i want to fight on your side but because i want you to fight i fully plan on fighting against you but even if you formed up and attacked stainwagon instead of cfc i would encourage you because at least you will be playing eve instead of shooting rocks while half afk
im in favour of anything that gets more highseccers actually playing eve rather than existing in the persistent vegetative state that endless highsec pve brings on
id consider it if your charisma was higher than a potato
tyou dont need to be so rude mr potatogo find a thread of yourself
talk about bringing a knife to a gunfight
ccp needs to cut their losses with incarna and again move in the direction of fis content
hint  thats exactly what it is
the new direction of ccp is great and i am more than happy with thatbutnothing is being added to the game to adress eves biggest failing that eve requires a large time investment each and every play period this is true for empire and 00 playersmany gamers have other commitments and can only play for 12h on a given night a certain timeafter kids go to bed so we can not play for hours for long roams or large fleet form up or make scheduled ops for a pos bash outside our normal play timeso what is a player who can only play a few hours a night to dothere is a lack of fun interesting accessible meaningful content1there is a lack if things to do in a short play period short being 12 hours a night  a incursions take a long time to travel to and then join a forming fleet and it is almost time to log of b pvp roams are great but often include many jumps and if you start you play period right when itUFFFDs forming up greatUFFFDif not you often have UFFFD 1h of pay time left and simply log because the op will take longer c missions sanctums are mindless isk done to reach a goal or pay for pvpUFFFDthey are boring and the though of that being the highlight of logging on makes me want to stab my eyes outd mining is UFFFDwell mining e wh also take a decent amount of form up time past class 4so iUFFFDm left with solo pvp and while fun is feast or famine in terms of availability and is done more to kill time than anything else2 no new content that really affects what i can do in the game 3 sov warfare is boring yay we fleet up they run away or we stand down been blue balled in fleets so often iUFFFDm glad iUFFFDve already had kids if we do fight itUFFFDs a pos bash or a lag fest so what is a player who plays between 800 to 1000 local time monfri to do what is to excite me about eve any longer and want to work towards something what is fun and exciting to log on and participate in eve that is available on a consistent basis eve is simply not as accessible as it needs to be i think 90 of eve players currently play wot on the side for this very reason posts show eve is not growing and eve will not grow unless it provides fun meaning full content that is accessible to players who donUFFFDt schedule there life around a gameso for these reasons i go sit by at the pc turn on eve only to really lack any desire to play so log and go do something elseeve really needs moreso i sit here subscribed and with eve installed and iUFFFDm looking to play for 1hand i have 0 motivation to log onis anything planned for this would really help out eve a lot if more accessible content was present these could includedynamic missions using sleeper aidynamic group missions that scale based on your fleet fleeting is more fun that soloing a level 4incursions take to long to get tofaction warfare for quick accessible pvpthat may eventually mean somethingim sure there are others but believe give us something to do that is fun and meaningful that can be achieved within a shorter play periodthanks
i do not mean to come off as uncaring but while they can implement short and quick things players with low time investment can enjoy they cant be all that meaningful or contribute to any large longterm goalseve is a game that is all about riskeffort v reward if you can only put in 12 hours a night in effort you will eb rewarded as sucheve by nature requires a lot of interaction and activity because it is not a casual game so by principle a casual player will find much less to do and much less reward to be had making it so that a player with little capable time investment can have any large goals compleetd in a productive time period while only playing 12 hours a night would defesat the purpose and then everyone would use this 12 hour method of play to make just as much money as people who devote 56 hours a dayi believe what i am trying to get across is that yes i agree that with the micromanagement required to play eve it is difficult for a casual player to enjoy and this can be improved but hopefully not to the point that eve loses either complexity or benefits from longer time investment because as i said eve is not a casual players game however casual players should not set their sites on large longterm goals as the only way for them to have something implemented that would allow casual players to achieve a significant goal would be to remove the complexity and timeinvestment required from the task which would hurt eve overallim sorry if at any point in this post i seemed incoherent or lacking of sense in wording but i have been working on calculus for the past 3 hours in studying for an exam and i am awfully tired
i think you are looking at this the wrong wayyou should be asking what can i do that interests me in the time i have with eve instead of what can ccp give mei used to only have a few hours to play each night as well but i always found something to amuse me in evei went looking for plexes picked fights with can flippers in hi sec went to low sec to annoy the locals did some mining did a mission chatted with corpies on tsvent about football or the weather i was never at a loss for something to do for an hour or soeve is what you make it
i can and have flown a hulk i do actually tank mine rather than go for the paper thin easy to die variety that you obviously fly however i do actually do expect someone to try and suicide gank from time to time and prepare for itdo you happen to know the actual raw hp of a tanked hulk do you actually know the total max damage a single bs can do if fitted to gank do you know the total cycle time of arty suggest you find out before whining anymore about those nasty suicide gankers make it challenging like getting free isk from a belt with zero challenges there already next it will be gates on belts that only barges can use lol can see it nownerf drones nerf everyone elses ships but mine have you bothered to ask any suicide gankers if they want things more challenging since when did you decide that they need this challenge i suspect all are very happy with the way things arei am actually of the opinion that you are just trolling because noone can be this dumbback on topic i do not agree that there needs to be higher penalties for suicide ganking its fine the way it is and this comes from a nonsuicide ganker go figureoh and btw  whining  whiningplease stop its embarrassing now
draconis you know that thing about talking out your ass that everyone says you should stop well youre doing it again1 it takes up to 4 or 5 salvos for me to kill them why i use autocannons because theyre the proper tool for suicide ganking not howitzers do i really have to explain this part out i dont want to2 it is more than plausible to fit a passive shield tank on your hulk that will last long enough for concord to arrive wanna know how i know ive seen it work3 the reason why fitting a tank on a hulk isnt popular is because of the people who fly them that think high sec is a perfectly safe happy place to be so they lose their hulks because theyre dumb back when i did mine i had a passive tank on it and it worked4 the challenge in suicide ganking is not popping the hulk it is beating concord there is no fun what so ever in destroying a defenseless ship ok just a little bit but destroying the ship before concord arrives is where the fun and the challenge lays in that was just an fyi for yaso please shuttup if there is a thread about being station camped 247 go ahead and post away there cause you would be the expert there but dont try to look smart in fields you dont know about
nobody is trying to look smartonly youdont generalize your ideas about what ganking is or its nottry incursions instead
roldanus you somewhat missed the point of my previous post i am attempting to help draconis understand something he knows nothing about while my post does have what i believe to be why some people gank and how they do it i do know other people use other methods i take it that youre one of the many who are the receiving end of ganking no the issue at hand here is not an issue at all but just a result of goonswarm
sorry misunderstood your posti ask for your apologyenjoyed the discussion
no worries good friend i too enjoyed this small discussion we had and as a sign of good faith here is my apology for a misleading forum post carry on and hope to see you around here
sounds like someone herped when they should have derpedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
eve is a big universethere should be room for all styles of playpeople play online games for entertainmentsome chose a style of play opposite their rl circumstances some people want an adrenalin pumping experience some dont some want to be bullies  before flaming me as a care bear i am a rl veteran of the vietnam war so flames will fall on deaf earsi agree somewhat with the op the balance of risk vs reward favors the wanna be bad boys i would be a fool to solo mine in 05 and expect to be immune however the perception of accountability for your actions and the reality are where the problem ariseswhen you have a csm member posting on how to exploit the agression timer the mittaniit is a sorry commentary csm and ccp should be addressing exploits many suggestions have been made for accountability for your actions few if any have been instituted
fwiw i think its dumb that you get insurance payouts for suicide ganking
insurance for suicide ganking and self destructing are both pretty bad that poor insurance company
as much as i love to flame and hate on mittani that unfortunately is not something i would call an exploit he is legitimately using two characters in this case this can only be blamed on ccp for encouraging multiple accounts and characters cant really blame them as it does make them more money thoughnot only should one not receive insurance payout for being concorded but i think you should lose the option to receive insurance if you die while gcc is active and also when your sec status is below a certain levelsay anything below 5 even if you are ratting and lose your ship to a rat but have a 5 statusno payout
if they deny you payout they should at least refund your premium if you bought insurancei fly logistics and a few times i have gotten sec status dinged because i repped a guy in my fleet and then he did a dumb thing with rr fleets one guy being dumb can start a chain reaction that causes everyone to lose sec status sometimes people even do this deliberately as griefing  not everyone with low sec status is necessarily an evil serial killer

wow you lie and sling mud worse than most sleazy politicians and the sad part is you dont know a damned thing as to what was going on pvpers dont throw hardware into harms way we go looking for a fight you find one some you win some you lose i didnt know that the following classifications of ships were frigs or noob shipsdestroyerscruisers note the faction onesbattlecruisersbattleshipscommand shipsmining bargesexhumerscontrol towerspos modules you know nothing of leadership as a real leader respects the wishes of his people and will do just about anything to help them out as a leader believes in respect but once again that would require you actually knowing something about leadership ive been in combat situations real world and its all about trusting the people that are around you with your life what about the rorqual that you sold off to fund your own faction t2 and t3 ships the one that wasnt yours who the  do you think you are to tell someone they dont have a life youre the one that spends every waking moment on the bloody forums only reason i have an overabundance of free time is because im sitting in a third world country defending your right to be a worthless piece of  unlike you when im home im going to spend time with my friends which you need to find some your mommy didnt acquire for you and family which obviously didnt teach you anything about social interaction on tactics you cant speak of anything you have no experience with and despite losses we still have fun which what you fail to realize is this is a game and that is the goal and now you can go  yourselfi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

the point of it being an exploit is that there is a timer being able to let the timer run out by parking in a station or switching to another account defeats the purpose of a timer and reinforces the advantadge to the wanna be bad boy stop pretending that the timer is anytype of consequence do away with it or make it run only while online and out of station

i get the point i am just saying it cant be technically called an exploit since he is playing by the rules ccp made i guess my suggestion to resolve this would be to deny logoff while you have a gcc if you have gcc and disconnect then your ship stays there completely vulnerable until your gcc is up or you are destroyedin fact if i recall correctly didnt they already say this is being doneagainwhat he is doing isnt technically an exploit it is probably something every pirate does on a very regular basis and i wouldnt personally call it an exploit i do however agree that the gcc mechanics need some changing to make them more fair to the gankee

none taken as i appreciate good humor unlike some people around herei actually laughed and is draconis still posting i stopped paying attention because i was busy doing something productive like making iski am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i dont read between the lines i answer your points as you have raised them as have many others in this threadthe fact is you are quick to make assumptions about others but you get all bent out of shape when others do this to youi find it incredible that even in the face of so many people pointing out the flaws in your points you still cling to the belief that you are right and everyone else is wrong now that is colossal arroganceyou are trying to push your game on everyone else your point is to make it more challenging for people to suicide gank if thats not pushing your own agenda then nothing is you still havent answered my question as to whether you have even bothered to canvas opinion from suicide gankers as to whether they want any changes i have done my best to remain reasonable with you but you are clearly the most moronic excuse for a human being i have ever encountered good day to you sir
reallylast i checkedits just you and jack carrigans gang who constantly smacktalk me upside down and everywhich waythey count for nothingyou however are just 1 personand until you can come up with a reasonable rational argumentas opposed to eftwarroioringthen you have nothing more than yourself to blamei meant what i saidthe ganking is easydefense is  poor on a mining bargeit is designed to mineto tank them is to decrease the profit margin at bestthis is why i do not mine in obvious placesand if someone wants to take your ship downyour going downthere is no defenseconcord will not save youthat is a factcommon sense says not to mine at that conclusion stop the evemail spam
for the third time try and read this time i have a tanked hulk and i have never lost a ship to suicide gankersthis is not eft warrioring as you so quaintly put it its a real ship that has a passive shield tank how many more times do i have to tell you this i dont use eft stats are no substitute for actually using the shipyes you will have a reduce profit but as you are getting isk for free from a belt anyway whats the problem i would rather reduced profit than failfit my 200mil ship and lose it to someone in a 800k thrasheryour point is moot doesnt matter what ship you fly least of all barges you will die if the suicide gankers bring enough firepower to bare but this is at least a challenge as they will need to coordinate their actions to take down say an orca in a 08 system with 40 bsssigh for the love of god for like the billionth time on these forumsconcord is not there to save you they are there to punish the guilty just like in real life a cop cant throw you in jail for thinking you really wanted to murder the stupid posters on these forums you must actually commit a crime firstif things were as bad as you think why arent the cost of minerals on the market spiraling out of control the basic minerals from hi sec are pretty stable so this means that people are still mining perfectly happilyi still stand by my earlier comments you really are a moron
can someone give me the tldr version off this it looks as if drake is posting his topical book of constant  like he did the whole time i was in his alliance and i didnt read them mails either
similing menace i tip my space hat at you you know whats up but you had the blessing of not having to deal with for 8 monthsdraconis he got ya figured out from one thread not sure if its pathetic on your part or intelligence on his part probably bothi have also never once took a jab at your personal life outside of my previous post you claim we gave this right to  talk our lives when we started it but it was you that started insulting us personally not the other way around you lie and lie like their isnt a tomorrow out here because others dont have they knowledge jack and i do about you as smiling mentioned your arguements have been invalidated multiple times with various reasons that have truth and facts behind them yet you continue on to say nuhhuh your wrong and im right i can type more than you listen to me goddamnit  is what 90 of your arguements are the other ten percent is you attacking people publicly now you refuse evidence from people who actually practice tanking their hulks damn you are stupid now your gonna reply calling me immature again but im not spewing idiotic nonsense out for everyone to seeso again get out boy
1 to jack carrigan angry onion and smiling menace1 to drake draconisjust some unsolicited advice drake get off the personal attacks reguardless if they attack you personally state your opinion backed by facts and those that agree with you will 
the gist of this postthe op got asploded in hi sec and thinks this sucks so wants to make life harder on suicide gankers so he can mine in peace with no interruptions whatsoeverdrake has made points agreeing with this that gankers need a challenge without giving any real indication that this in fact is what suicide gankers wanthe has made lots of nonsensical arguments about not fitting a tank to a hulk as you will be instapopped by a passing velator because the suicide gankers have all the cards in this scenario tldr versiondrake doesnt want his shiney ships asploded in hi sec and wants concord to sit and mine with him so he has companydisclaimer i am not a suicide ganker but it is a fact of eve life once again they pay to play like the rest of us and if thats what they want to do more power to them for enjoying the game their way
i think we agree the mechanics are broke i consider it an exploit it appears you think of it more in the vein of a workaroundlike many of the mechanics and rules in eve they seem to be introduced with no thought as to how the clever or dishonest can workaround the original intent i do blame ccp when something isnt working the way they thought it would or hype it as a consequence for ones own action and corrective remedies are delayed or ignored
wrongdrake doesnt give a  if he loses his shipif someoen is out to tan my hyde its gonna happen regardlessid just rather prefer to lose that ship with some sort of chance of getting out of it aliveand not hvnig to rely on the concord to save the dayif you had been paying attentionyoud know that by nowi have yet to lose my shiny ship to a gankerand im sure it will happen one way or anotheri couldnt care lessim only arguing what i seeknowhearand readstop jumping to conclusions and you may get somewhere with me stop the evemail spam
a bit like the activities you pursue and the things you have done in your eve career am i right or am i right drake
ummm wrong thread you replied to
i was going to refute your comments yet again but instead i will just lol
additionally i think i speak for all of us here when i say that we dont really want go anywhere with youespecially as you are someone who refers to themselves in the third person which is incredibly lame and sad and not at all as tough guy as you would like to believe
drake if you knew how to properly tank a hulk then you wont lose it to a 1 man gank as people have stated it can be done rather easy this anit just point at drake but being ganked is part of the game eve is one big pvp server it does suck but put on your big girls undies and deal with it that or get eve people are going to gank people or bait them no matter what even if ccp put a penilty on said actions
cant argue with ya therefor the love of god people stop feeding the troll i know i knowi fed him by saying that
notice how he only argues what he sees hears and reads but not what he knows i found the problem
thank youhoweverthe very things you tell me not to dothey did in the first placeam i not entitlted to answer the accusersyoud rather i roll over and just take itno thanksthat would make him keep it upand he will not give uphe never doesthats why im hopping someone will test him and see if he really is all dati already know im not when it comes to peeveepeehe sure as hell isnt stop the evemail spam
i would like to see a mechanic that affects the whole primary  boom tactic that is applied in fleets a lockstacking penalty may be an appropriate way to do this it would make tactics more intricate and rolespecific ships more useful i could see a larger diversity in fleets except the standard blobshowever there are still questions regarding chain logistics for example and the effect a friendly lock would have on enemy ships locking time ccp would have to carefully consider the abuse factor of this mechanic should it be implementedwith regard to aoe explosions this would be grossly tipped against close range ships and especially so for blasterboats that need to sit on top of a target to deal optimum damage
not too sure about the other proposals but i like the aoe of exploding shipsi think a simple solution to this would be have it only on capital ships as the subcap ships dont have enough mass to cause an aoe effect death of a capital should be spectacular not the damp squib we have now this way if you want to blob in your capitals make sure you are very very far away when one goes boom
i am not to worried about these new bcs yet since we have not seen them in game but the sad truth is that battleships are not the dps powerhouses and valuable fleet asset they use to bethe role bs use to play has been eroded over time the large tank big guns lots of dps battleship but being slow and cumbersome is not as desirable as it use to be in small fleets nor do they have a place in large fleets bs use to be used to overwhelm enemies fleets with there shear shock and awe power and ability to soak up damage other ships have started to infringe on their roles as well as capital ships being so common now they sort of take the place that bs use tobs ships just have not scaled well with changes that have happened over timemaybe they need a looking at to find a new place in fleets in the gamemaybe having large tanks lots of dps if you can hit it and being about as slow and agile as a brick in molasses is not working out so well for them
these ships are going to be pvp ships but we need a thread maybe use this one to say what we dont want this ship to be i dont want a small ship that takes longer to lock killing me with large guns before i can even lock it if this ship is going to be balanced i think it cant have tracking bonuses a fast lock time or enough medium slots to sebo the thing up to 2000 these things are pretty much going to be paperthin gun boats so they shouldnt have more than 3 small or mid slots
theyre not frigates or dessies if that happened it would completely invalidate their usefulness theyre all ready going to be paper thin as it  giving them such a stupid low amount of slots is practically making the ship useless they will be hopefully designed to hit hard and fast and by limiting them to such low amount of mid slots you reduce them to literally guns attached to engines with no useful purpose besides fire crackers lrn2pvp
would suck to be caldari again with this proposal and to a lesser extent minmatarthe bcs we have now are pretty good unless you are gallente in which case winter is almost here and they do pack a mighty punch arty canes spring to mind but they still die very easily to bs fleets bss are still used extensively in null sec to combat faster nimbler bcs so i really dont think bss need a buff they still fill their role well unless you are gallente in which case winter is almost herei think with this one we will need to wait and see cant really make any sort of informed opinions without knowing the specs of the new tier 3 bcs
im looking forward to these new tier3 battlecruisers however i do believe they need to have their own role and should not simply be a better hurricane or a more agile battleship having said that so long as their strengths are balanced by suitable weaknesses and so long as they do not overshadow battleships or their tier2 cousins they should be an interesting addition to the lineup ill reserve judgement till ive seen some more details about their stats and performance
i disagree angry these ships need to have there low mids limited you give them too many mids and lows they will replace the canes drakes etc i think they need a 543 for mincaldari and 534 for amarrgal that way they will be glass cannons for sure
i am fairly positive these will end up being pure dps boats likely they might work for pve a little and they will end up being capital busters small enough that supercaps have a hard time hitting them but big enough guns to do the damage to take out a capital ship
along with other marketing and financial considerations there is a big group of eve players interested in economic development csm has seem to have very little interest in pushing for such addons that are not very complicated and are already monitored by ccp economistplease all people interested put your comments those not interested please dont spoil the thread with useless comments just omit it and be fair with othersfood for thoughts1 market informationi guess this is the first thing i would like to raise as a concernwe are so posed to be living a futuristic ingame life experience based on the technology designed by ccp but market information transparency regarding what is being sold or demanded elsewhere your current region is very difficult to get and follow as well as in eve central market one should be able to easily sort market info from anywhere in the gamea pricesb quantities supplied and demandedc select timeframe for queryd customized dashboard of indicators for watch liste ability to download to excel files numbers mac worksheets any information request2 marketing toolsprovide a place to put advertisements space cans and cargos with long texts are not fulfilling the needim not asking to populate eve space of crowded communications but we could eventually have a couple of systems were you can put your own station or advertisement to make people enter and buy only your stuff moreover being able to better communicate your offers and not just morse code messages in trading channels3 financial servicesits quite a complex market but we are not able to have banks this is really needed when you are focused in tradingi know that most players are mainly interested in pvp but there is at least a small community of professionals that really enjoy and have fun with the cycle of mining manufacturing and selling my casein these cases npcs financial services would be an interesting concept to develop and i do believe is quite simplecorps could also be able to set their own banks and communicate it to the eve community not saying this should be easy to get probably more difficult than to open a corp4 corporation stock marketif a corp is doing very well but would like to take their economic growth beyond why not enabling the possibility to corps and investors to interact in a digital stock market placethis will also bring improved market performance and funding5 freelance sales representatives contractsif we do have contracts for people that are able to provide distribution services why couldnt we offer products for resale and paying a commission without needing to sell the full items and then make the salesman bare all the risk some enthusiastic sales people could power up items availability and market competition benefiting everyoneok guys have other suggestions regarding the subject but not as important as these onescould u provide feedback if this can be escalated to ccp or notthanks and good luckroldanusblack anvil industries corporation

bad idea no support from me on this one
dynamic sec status sounds very good  id definitely want to see that all those trying to protect their play style and ingame habits just fear the need to adapt even a little sec too lowhigh for you get to work lowering it back to your needsthat said i wont support you proposal it does not seem complex enough and thus far too likely to be gamed in some way activity involving risks and costs should be required to affect something as fundamental as sec status and it needs to be kept up for months sec changes should primarily reflect player behaviour not targetted campaigns
should be no insurance payouts for any ships we should all be friendly peeps and not shoot the crap out of each other so that one frigate you buy will last a lifetime seriously i like this one 1fake editwhy dont we have troll quotes yet
as in the previous thread 1
1 for realistic boobies
with t2 gang links this is only going to get worse more bonuses at the cost of additional cpu and grid will keep promoting ultraspecialized characters who can fly all of your links on a single platform that is never exposed to any risk
necro posting bad bad bad boystill supporting making gang links only work on grid
bumb cos links ships are dumb
1 because its silly to project fleet bonuses across solar systems if youre not on the same grid you are not an active part of the fleet
not supported unless the grid mechanics are also dramatically reworked as well after all if youre wanting to talk about weird meta stuff that affects combat in counterintuitive ways there is nothing that does this quite so badly as the grid if you make any kind of ongrid requirement for command ships then what happens next is that more people start playing gridfu and suddenly all sorts of fights are taking place on ridiculous grids designed to isolate the cs from the battle while still keeping it technically ongrid
this looks delicious

i always liked this dropping out of warp effect linkage skip to 54 seconds inor this linkage
something like thisinstant warp with a flash of destination directionlinkagei like the direction of this thread
UFFFD i miss the wob wob wob sound the warp scramblers used to makeUFFFD id like each ship to have a unique sound the same way pod racers in star wars tpm had different sound the same way ships in i was there trailer had different soundsUFFFD strip miners and ice harvesters look too similar
wall of math insurance fraud aheadbah i may need to clarify based on some chats ive had on the matter of insurance and the bounty proposal the way i understand it vrs 50 sec idea means that when you are below 50 security your insurance goes to paying off your bounty cost correct me if im wrong not sure how else it would work in this case the hunted man can gain equity by simply plat insuring or insuring at any level even the default as the amount of bounty goes down every time he gets a ship destroyed with no corresponding payout to current or future killers they way it would be exploited is as follows based on pend rates for a t1 ship1 hunted 100m bounty buys 100 insurance on a 10m ship policy cost 3m2 alt blows up his ship and gets 5m the hunted s bounty now goes down to 85m instead of 95m and he gets his insurance back loss  cost of policy 3m hunted manalt profits by 2m and 10m extra potential disappears from bounty hunters he can do this until the escrow runs out for if he calculates his ship cost carefully a profit of 1267m isk and a loss to the bounty payers of 100m since its their money in the escrowif the hunted man can buy insurance but it doesnt pay off the bounty he actually profits more as the escrow runs longer1 hunted man plat insures a 10m ship for 3m2 alt kills his ship and gets 5m hunted man loses 3m as before3 he can now do this 20 times earn 40m isk and still cost the bounty payers 100m iskeven if the hunted man doesnt buy insurance he still gets 40 of his ship value back so he can pay down his bounty at a 10 loss in ship valuesthe only ways to get around this are 1 decrease the ship value payout of the bounty to 25 instead of 50 or 2 simply void all insurance even basic while bountied since it requires less math im in favor of decreasing the ship payout at least until such a time as the insurance mess is fixed
id like to see this tied to killrights so that miscreants cant simply place a bounty on people that smiled at them the wrong way you can do that the unofficial way so you could only place a bounty if you had killrights and placing a bounty would use your killrightsid also like to see killrights changed so that they are granted any time a pilot gccs and successfully destroys the target as they are now you wont get killrights if you return fire which includes ecm tracking disruptors and other defensive measuresthis would make criminality more of a choice and people might start thinking before they shoot and before you know it people are flying into lowsec because its not simply instant helldeath who am i kidding it wouldnt change anything  but there would be a plethora of bounties for pilots to collectsome good ideas and discussion at this guys blog and its from a pirate perspectivei was against voiding insurance because i thought it would penalize criminals too much  but some pirates convinced me they were okay with it seems like its the best solution
supported 1
5 sec status should void insurance policies on all your ships its supports the risk vs reward myth that is the weak link lynchpin of eve that is constantly tossed about in discussions if you are willing to risk having no ships insured at any time you
while it makes a lot of sense to tie the question of kill rights into this much like the insurance dilemma i fear this would overload this proposal and thus reduce its chances to get to ccp thing is there are quite a few proposals on kill rights out there and im not sure wed get the uncontested best in this proposal making it more likely that someone will shoot this bird down on its way to icelandwhats more the suggested changes here would work in their own  making the kill harder for sure often completly illegal but still possibly worthwhileone small change i would suggest let it not be concord that keeps track of bounties but pend insurance its just silly if concord pops you and then hands out the bounty for the kill it popped you for

jesus we have likes isnt that enough
what use are they they target people or more precisely postings check out a proposal with lots of likes and youll find that they do not necessarily signify brad support but often just gleeful support of a derisive answer just as the like for your posting now seems to give support to my proposal
youre right they do support individual posts which is better because its more granular and youre thinking about it the wrong way once you recognize that those likes for dissenting posts are also dislikes for the op it makes a lot more sense
why it just jumbles all likes of individual posts into one  you have to leaf through the thread to see what the total likes in a thread actually signify yes you may consider it a measure of the heat of discussion within but it might as well be one of general consensus or ridicule a support button on the other hand would be far easier to interpret and use if we left the like button as it is what problems do you see with adding a op support buttonbtw i see what you did there 
the support feature of the assembly hall should return in the form on two buttons supported and opposed buttons would go a long way in showing ccp and other readers how popularunpopular a topic is that said i think the like button should stay in its current form
they are proposing changed to the pi stuff and it looks greatcan pos borrow it ploxie use different standings  relationships owner corp alliance to access different mods but easier would be nice p
this is a good idea pos now look more like scrap piles trapped inside a force field this is an upgrade that changes no functionality unless you give us a cq in the corp hangar which would greatly improve playability imo ship maintenance arrays should display ships like the current in station hangar with different levels of completion and swarms of workers drones on scaffolding around the ships simple animations like those used in station hangars should not over tax servers i support implementation asap
this is a proposal i decided to make its own thread for since it was part of another thread i made and seemed to be the only popular proposal of the 3 i also had this thread in the original forums and it seemed to be split in terms of support i will try to be a little more clear on this proposalso the idea is to have aoe damage from ships exploding in space from combat damage it was brought up in the previous thread that self destructing your ship should not cause aoe damage i agree with this and a good reasoning would be that a self destruct is a controlled explosion achieved by purging your power core when it comes to exploding from combat damage taken an aoe explosion similar to a smart bomb would occur the explosion itself wouldnt have to be too different from a smartbomb in itself in fact damage type would be based on the faction of the ship that is exploding damage radius based on ship size amount of damage also based on ship size smaller ships would be able to mitigate the damage better than larger ships thus taking less damage total distance from the exploding ship and also your own ships speed would also be a factor in damage mitigation the further away you are the less damage you take and the faster you move the less you take the damage itself should be enough to do decent damage but not enough to take any ship from full shield to gone i wouldnt say the damage should even be enough to do 20 of a ships main defense in damage one main concern is that of this occuring in high sec with pirates mass killing people in jita and what would happen with the resulting gcc this one is simple no aoe damage in high sec this is already done by the fact that you cant use smartbombs this will prevent pirates and gankers from using their ships to mass kill people in jita no aoe damage in high sec very simplewhen it comes to low sec however we could either apply the same rules as high sec or allow it and assign the gcc from each explosion hitting another player based on the last person who hit the exploding target whoever got the killmail gets the gcc for each person that exploding ship hit with its explosion personally i am for the latter train of thought as it is low sec killmails themselves should also be assigned to the last person to hit a ship in cases where a possible chain reaction of exploding ships occurs in large fleet fights so it would be possible for one person to get 2 or more kills with his final blow on one ship that part i am sure is highly debatable this damage is not meant to be a tool for doing massive aoe damage but instead another dynamic part of the game to mix up pvp and separate the blob a little i am looking for constructive feedback and opinions on the issue
so exactly how from a lore perspective could you justify this not happening in highsec if a ship explodes it explodes doesnt matter if its in jita or ecp8r the explosion is the same so it should do the same thing
thats actually a good and valid question one which i knew would come up before someone had brought this up and suggested something along the lines of concord placing some magical tech device that supresses ship explosions so they do not effect other pilots i believe at that time i suggested this only be implemented near stations and gates so that gcc and damage from exploding ships could occur everywhere else in a high sec system but just not within a certain range of gates and stations i think i was thoroughly shot down on that idea for some reason i still feel it is reasonable however
see boldunderlined textit is made of faili am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i didnt say it was a good lore idea i said it was something suggested by someone else in the previous thread frankly for the lore aspect of it i could care less the mechanic would only be in place to prevent the massive carebear tears in high sec that would ensue did you have a better idea jack i wouldnt mind seeing it if you do
i foresee small amounts of lag with this proposal
couldnt gates and stations in highsec be outfitted with an antiaoe device that has been stopping smartbombs so far but now also ship explosions
that was kind of the point yeah its already been done with smartbombswheres the lore in that and just build off it
10
came in expecting carebear whiningfound an excellent suggestion i myself would love to hunt down the scum of the game if nothing else having an option to be deputized by concord and get extra rewards for bringing down the hammer on criminals would be an awesome option to have concord needs to do something they seem to be engaging in epic failure at the moment cant even keep highsec safe from the wretched hive of scum and villainy that is eve
i might have done that on purpose
there are a lot of mechanisms in this game for being a bad guy it would be really nice to see a system in place for the opposite and i dont think the effects on the piracy business will be as grave as some suggest instead it adds depth to the piracy system instead of just jumping into a low sec system and killing the first ship you see it would require you to check out systems see where concord militias are active similarly if good players can gain control of a bunker to become deputies pirates should be able to kill the bunker to remove that ability as far as the gcc beacon following pirates around i think this is a good mechanic if youre just one ship youll have to keep warping around again running from the deputies if youre a gang there are a lot of different approaches you can take have one ship agress a player and draw out the deputies while you have a group go hit the outpost kill the bunker and the gcc beacon goes away since it is only available to deputies and there would be no deputies in a system without a bunker or agress with a smaller ship and warp to a large gang concord deputy shows up and gets popped this encourages not only small group piracy but small group anti piracy if youre just one ship and warp to the first gcc beacon that pops up you risk jumping into a trap on the other hand agressing the bunker would generate a gcc so the deputies in the system could warp back to defend it again preparation coordination fun i think this system adds some great things to the game for one it makes it possible for industrypve type people to live in null without taking away the pvp aspect of the systems it also encourages larger scale combat for low sec systems there is no x corp controls this system but rather there is or isnt a concord presence in this system and that control is something contended for by pirates and deputies pirates want no bunker present so they can kill freely deputies want a bunker so they can hunt pirates at least provide some semblance of protection for small corpsolo industrypve players it also adds a great mechanic for small group pvp which is something a lot of people have been asking for 12edit another note about encouraging the population of lowsec i will freely admit to being a carebear i like my highsec missions on the other hand if there were some lowsec systems that popped up as having a concord presence in them i would venture out for some lowsec missionsexploration it doesnt make it safe you can still get scanned down and jumped by a gang but it provides at least an attractive feeling of safety and honestly if you can implement a system to get more 4bil tengus roaming around your systems who would say no which is all besides the fact that you can still gate camp the systems leading to the concord deputized areas you can use the illusion of concord safety to bait people attracted to it ultimately it adds another level of challenge to piracy its not actually harder to gank anyone it just adds the potential for conseuence for doing so plus if youre prepared getting one gudfite practically guarantees another kill your target in pops another it basically escalates pvp in lowsec if you want to solo pvp roam the unoccupied systems if you want gang pvp fleet up and kick out some concord deputies then gobble up whatever minersmission runners are left in the system or fleet up and kick the pirates out of a system
3 things spring to mind that may have been covered in these postsfirst timer for pirates without instant warp to pirates youll need a long timer to hunt them down second it needs to allow deputies to roam or we have the crossing state line to safety gamelast why concord why not deputised by faction min corp faction needed then off you go i know its a bit of roleplay but why would the factions want more concord meddling much better to secure their own spacegreat idea though and gets a 1 from me
unless its a hexagonthere is always someone asking for some way to decloak afk cloakers but why if they are afk then why are you bothered would you be as concerned by that red that sits in station all day instead or as pointed out by the wh monkies if there was no local and you didnt know he was there would you still be worried about the possibility there was an afk cloaker around910 they are in a sb and as soon as they try to kill someone they will die in a fire if people are paying attentionif you are worried about being hotdropped should you really have been miningplexingratting in the first placequite happy with the way cloaks and cov opsrecons work and dont think they need changedhowever it would be good as someone else pointed out in another thread if there was a specific mod that could be used to uncloak ships in a 15km radius i remember the snowball launchers we got a few xmass ago did this very well

since your focus seems to be careers i have three suggestions bounty hunting this has already been suggested a few times in this thread but im adding support because this career path is pretty desperately needed in a game about shooting other peoples space ships this isnt specifically a highsec thing but it would promote pvp in highsec taurean eltanin wrote a blog post outlining an idea  while i dont agree with everything he said its a really good base to work from it works based off turning killrights into a bounty and part of the idea is depriving the criminal of his insurance  but only allows registered bounty hunters to collect taurean suggests some minimum security status but i dont see why you cant just let anybody do it maybe some of this can be combined with mogopogos suggestionsmercenary work we already have mercenaries but its a sort of ad hoc thing generally used to harass or demoralize a target it quite leaves out any sort of defensive work i wrote a post about this quite a while back it would be great if you could have defense contracts with mercenaries which would put them into the war immediately as sort of an extension of your own corporation clearly theres still room here to be vile and cause problems by not actively doing any defense even when hired but with the right kind of contracts in place you could ensure a decent reward for active mercenarieslawmen i think we ought to remove or greatly delay the faction navy spawns that harass criminals moving in highsecurity space give players a chance to do some of that work if they want to  i know i would but i think youve got to couple this with changes to security status  make it harder to work off your negative status seriously it makes no sense that a primary moneymaking activity fixes your status as a criminal i wrote a little more about it but its not as important as the core of the idea  specifics just bog things down sometimesbring pvp junkies to highsec
i think it would be easy enough lets say you are in a system with 5 gates the software eaven though you pronounce the name incorrect would recognice which of the 5 gates you mean and if it still cant you could just say warp 100km gate m a a and it would figure out what gate you mean just by the first three letters and warp you there and with regards to astroids you could just say mine the closest astroid or lock and mine astroid 20 km to my leftwith regards to logis you could just say something like primary task dont let fleet get below 50 shield secondary task keep fleet at 100so it would actually make things easier and would let the pilot concentrate about other thing
you must never have been in combat situations where you needed to warp immediately heres the conversation as i picture itwarp to the maadimilire gateerror celestial not foundwarp to mad gate at zeroerror celestial not found please spell namewarp to m a a d gate at zerowarp target found initia boom your ship is toasthave you ever been in a belt and looked at the overview do i even have to explain how often this would frustrate peoplewhere i come from that would be called a logi macro youre not just talking about making it easier youre talking about removing all the difficulty of running logi for a fleet with your system there wouldnt be anything for the logi pilot to concentrate on as youve just automated the only task they have in combatwould you like a win now button with that
p it looks like there will be some changes coming to the csm process so it will be new for most of us next time round taking part in the assembly hall and having an active interest in the future of the game is a pretty good start though p

 friendly bump for an important topic 
i take it you have never been on an aircraft carrier submarine or any sort of metal moving structure at all things such as that make highpitched screeching noises iwth very quiet rumbling as a abckground just sitting still and with space and all the debris in it not to mention if your taking hits in battle with metal buckling and stressing there would be alot of highpitched noise heck any metal joint in a ship when exposed to stress will creak and any turret mounting on a navy vessel without a whales worth of oil will screech when turningbut maybe ive just been on really old falling apart ships and have no idea what im tlaking about but that is unlikelythough i will agree eve could use some cleaner more finsihed sounds than current but nothing to the point of ridiculousness remember space is a quiet place where no one can hear you screamgreat now im going to ahve nightmares about reavers and that halfhuman halfxenomorph thing from the alien movie thanks alot for making me post op

well said
as is immediately obvious to anyone who has worked with them the rorqual really doesnt do what its marketed to do no one in their right minds would have their hugely expensive rorqual sitting in a belt grabbing the cans instead the rorqual always and exclusively sits in a pos passively radiating its bonus while chewing up ore thatd be pretty bad design in general but most people who use rorquals have mining alts anyways so its probably not like an actual person is sitting in the pos cooling their heels of course that does mean that the tractor beam bonus on the rorqual is pretty much worthlesson the other hand we have the orca which is usually found in the belts sitting there radiating bonuses and grabbing the loot they arent plagued with any kind of siege mode that renders them supremely vulnerable so clever orca pilots can reasonably flee when hostiles show up which is why orcas can afford to sit in the belts where clever pirates might manage to gank themaccordingly i propose that the rorqual be stripped of its scannertractor bonuses and instead be given a bonus more suited to what it actually does fuel consumption on its jump drive for instance at the same time replace the orcas bonus with ordinary tractor beams with the ability to use capital tractor beams that actually makes capital tractor beams kind of useful and something orca pilots would want to use over regular tractor beams and at the same time replaces a totally useless bonus on the rorqual with something that people will actually benefit froman alternative would be to instead tweak the industrial core and the rorqual in general such that sieging a rorqual in a belt doesnt necessarily mean doom probably give a sieged rorqual some of the usual capital protections and generally make rorquals more buff so it can handle some pew pew if properly supported lots of options to choose from on this route a bonus to sentries while sieged perhaps possibly including an additional drone per level in any event the end result of this choice should be that a rorqual sieged in a belt offers a degree of protection to a local mining op instead of representing a huge vulnerability and should require nontrivial effort to take downthoughts
i have always thought it would be cool that if the rorq would have an automatic mini hauler drone in it kinda like a droneyou tell it to fly to a toon and back and it would just fly to the toon  and warp right backthe toon that is mining would have to put the ore in the mini hauler b4 it does a turn around and flys back to the rorqthe price of the rorq  being in deployed mode  ice fuel being used should justify itthe more skill you have in a mining drone  the more little haulers you can have wizzing by to pilots to pick up orewho in their right mind would pull out a rorq or an orca in ls or null or wh 
are you saying a mini hauler drone that actually warps out to the mining op in the belt to get filled with ore and then warps back to the pos that sounds like a little much tbheither we want the paradigm where the rorqual is a glorified pos module or we want the paradigm where it is beefy enough to sit sieged in the belt the two are mutually incompatible if the rorqual is doing the job of the haulers it should be at risk in the belt if its not a hauler is needed
ship spinning is not a group activity in the mmog eve but when this solo pleasure was removed the wails of numerous individual pilots finally forced ccp to recalibrate their thinking so how is it a bad thing for other solo pleasures in eve to be spoken of openly are the captains quarters open to other pilots you invite in nope solo pleasure what about those nex purchased boots anyone going to see them in your headshot portrait nope solo pleasure so when ccp establishes a solo pleasure it is good but when players aka the people who pay the bills for ccp find solo pleasures where none were intended its bad i would like to see the different styles of game play openly embraced by ccp and not seemingly disregarded if solo players are a small fraction of the ccp revenue stream do they really want to reduce it even by a small amount most business plans seek to grow and cultivate paying customers when doing so does not force them to give up their primary mission goals working to accommodate solo play without sacrificing the group dynamic of eve is not impossible or even that hard i have accounts that cover the spectrum from alliance to corp down to solo each has a different return for my investment of time and money i only hope that ccp appreciates all styles of game play even when its not happening exactly as they planned or projected

dear anelayou cant have sims in space with the eve server the most people you can have in the sims is about 40 in one roominstance eve is built on a single server eve is not built with on an instanced platform just imagine the lagg in jita if ccp tried to build a sims in space allowing 40 people per room with incarnas graphics you would get a fps of 0000000001 if ccp did allow sperate servers to run room instances for 40 people at a time say a portion of your corp then what would they do with this ccp would not be able to integrate this in real time into the main eve server becasue of laggregardsastor
as of right now the concepts being discussed are a bit too much for the current tech i love the idea of walking out of my cq into a hallway full of other pilots calmly walking down to the elevator find which cq my wt is using  cant have a dedicated cq for every single pilot also cant fit a couple thousand cqs in a single hallway go to it kick down the door and then kicking the  out of said wt and maybe stealing his ship  but any interaction on a massive scale that would be good for the game is too much for the hardware and i love my laptop not catching on fire put station interactions with other plays on the back burners till the tech can catch up some 
eh why ever not its a totally separate environment no need to interact with the server running the rest of the systemmind you time dilation might be interesting you could pop into station for a cuppa and emerge after half an hour having only missed 3 seconds of fighting
sorrythere are many things you can accomplish even in an hourthis is not the game for short play tmies and big rewardsyou get what you put into itand just thati suggest pi or perhaps a couple missions or some sucheven a quick juant around low sec for thrills an gigglesif your into that sort of thingthats just a short list of things that can be done inside an hourwhether they are profitable or rewarding howeveris entirely up to youbeauty is in the eye of the beholderthe case is the same for eve onlineone mans waste is an another mans richestime is applicable in this case stop the evemailUFFFDspam
i hear you personally my eve time tends to be chopped into 12 hour blocks before and after work so during the week i operate under the same restrictions personally what i usually end up doing is spend my midweek maintaining my economic activities pi market orders hauling manufacturing whatever and thus have plenty of isk to burn for my weekends which is when i get involved in ops and whatnot try and find a balance if you dont have much time to sink into eve on one day at least get the grunt work out of the way in preparation for an op later on
no one is asking to make the same reward you get in 46h to be achievable in 12h play periodsbut let me work towards the 46 goal so in four 2h sessions i can come close my reward per hour shoudl be lower but i still should have fun accesable content fir both pvp and pveeve time is after the kids go to bed and before i do every dayi dont get 6h play time all i do is maintain and do little thingsnone of wich are really fun or intresting
ok i have a couple of issues with asteriod belts1 warp to 50km or whatever warps you to within that range to the triangle but this isnt really what your trying to do is it you want to be 50 km from the belt therefore you should be 50km from the outer most belt whats the point of saying warp to 50km then end up in the middle of the asteroid belt this has issues for instance covert ships when you want to just sneak up and see whats going on covertly not great when you get instantly decloaked oh hai another is when you get caught in the belt which im coming to next this is just a couple of probs2 asteroid collisionproximity detection is this a mechanic or just poor collision detection how can you be seen to be xkm away from a roid and still be getting stuck on it its a bit stupid if this is meant then why if not then why after all these years its not been fixed because when your fightingg or ratting the worse thing is getting stuck on a roid you think your nowwhere nearbefore you say it yes i know this has been like this for years but these are issues i dont understand either is it purposely there or is it just not right and if its not right why hasnt it been fixed it can have a serious affect on gameplay
1 if you want to be a sneaky ninja you need to make bookmarks first im too lazy to get proper bookmarks is not an acceptable excuse if you really want to be all sneaky and covert failure to do your homework here will lead to your destruction2 yes collision detection is bad in a number of ways some big asteroids you get stuck on some distance off and some you can fly through needs work for sure
dude im not scouting and living in the area now if i was your point 1 would be correct but when your roaming about its a different matter also you cant be very sneaky say in a pilgrim where in your case have a bm say 100km out to ensure you dont hit a roidits gonna take you ages to get to the target because it takes so long when your cloaked to move he will be gone be thenhowever cloaky was just an example also even if you wsnt cloaky it causes so many issues the simple fact is when you warp to 50km you should warp 50km from the outermost roid
i fly pilgrim all the time warp to 10 km youll land inside the rock belt away from the beacon and unless youre crazy unlucky you wont bump any ships in that range
im just roaming is exactly why you fail to get that precision if you want specific and useful warpins you need to go out there and get them first i highly recommend investing time in a covops to scout through the space you like to hunt in and bookmark key strategic places thats the sort of preparation that makes the difference between success and failureas for expecting to be 50 km away from the outermost roid that really isnt how eves warp system works and i dont feel that the asteroid belts need to be an exception if youre warping to the asteroid belt you arent warping to a rock youre warping to a beacon in the middle of the rocks and your distance from any given rock is determined by the composition of the belt and how busy the miners have been dont like that bookmark said outermost rock warp to a celestial outbound of said rock warp back at 50 create another bookmark problem solved
atm self destruct is one of the big enemys of smaller gangs like ones i fly usually as even when you managed to tackle a capital  they can always selfdestuct last 2 months or so i think im seeing like 10 capitals to go this way both in low sec and 00last one was chimera last night in syndicate and about this take more firepower issue lets take avg carrier 13m hp  so if you avg roaming ship is making like 400dps you need like 30 of those to kill it with 2 minute  and sry 30 is already quite a big gang or you can make it capital online and then everyone wines that nerf capitalsalso one of the bad things atm more is  that usually in fight with lot of messages displayed all the time gunsdrones damage scrambler messages etc its quite often that self destruct messages will even not be notified before ship will actually self destruct  so even when ccp desired that they like self destruct as sucks and they will go fot it  they should add some kind of red timer to overview or something if there is ships in grid who have self destruct timers onlineits only a question of time before some supercap fleet is beginning self destructed as they are losing fight and all doomed and no hope to save themself with logoff  so they will make only thing they can to hit back and self destruct and deny km with enemybut well  i hope this happens fast and generate a lot of wine so ccp will hopefully do something i understand you 100 this was nice bait frig fleet and then nice escalation half the gallente low sec was there i think and you actually managed to kill one of the anchors before this was self destructing what should give you as reward some nice capital km  however as last alternative for you enemy they can always self destruct and so deny your your reward as you was better today  maybe next time this is other way around and in the end there is large number of unhappy playersalso this archon who self destruct was piloted by my alt  so i know what im talking and until ingame why not to use it as weapon of last resort but there is very few things in eve what would make my more happy than removing of self destruct as way to deny km
nothing irritates me more than people who get cake and then  about the color of the icingyou killed the ship even if they decided to blow themselves up you know you did it yet youre bitching because you didnt get the electrons to hang on your wall of epeenso is your goal really to kill ships or is it to earn bragging rights if its the former congratulations youve accomplished your goal if its the latter then either bring the dps to get the job done or pick targets you can actually kill before they selfdestructthough i have to admit its funny seeing the hardcore pvpers being the butt hurt whiners for a change
killmails exist and should be accurate
ccp manifest said thiskillmails are great they serve as reminders of good fights or dubious mistakes they let you measure losses inflicted on your enemy in cold hard isk they also demonstrate some interesting choices in ship fitting or cargomovement attempts if youre so inclined they provide a way to track your killdeath ratio and measure it against your peers i especially like the ones where a pod gets squished but iUFFFDve always felt that those podmails were missing a certain somethingin the forthcoming winter expansion weUFFFDre adding a muchrequested piece of additional information to capsule killmails they will now list the fitted implants of the unfortunate victimnot only does ccp endorse the use of killmails they are putting more information on them to better reflect damage done my proposal has the same result in that kills cant be hidden by the victim self destructingits more than butthurt or epeen damage done is often a goal in a war or a win condition in a merc contract the inability to prove youve dealt damage is a problem
if you are trying to prove stuff for merc contracts then i would like to point you in the direction of your logs they have all the proof you need
logs can be faked apiverified killmails cant that im aware of

im wondering if there are any additional thoughts on this given the announcement regarding player owned customs offices pcos as it relates to pi and this thread topic
understandable drake that they started it so you want to finish it but in a debate such as the forums are isnt the place for that type of actionand no i would not like to have you roll over and take it why cuz you have the right to defend yourself as we all do but you dont have the right to personalize that retortas it pertains to this debate as soon as you or anyone else resorts to personal attacks to make a point they loose all right to be taken seriously you of all people should know thatif they resort to name bashing or humilation tactics be the bigger man and ignore that type of action and use solid facts of the topic to defend yourself i know you have it in you to do thissome days youre the bug and some days your the windscreen and some days youre just a man with a gun
tell you whatyou see if you can get jack to understand thatand ill be more than happy to obligeim not above calling it good and backing offbut this has been going on for nigh 2 to 3 months nowjust do a saerchim sure youll find it very easilyif they havent been scrubbed by the gms as of yetbut nonethelessvalid point stop the evemailUFFFDspam
zerosevenzerosevenzerosevenget some credibility and then come back in that other thread you were constantly puffing up your chest and spouting about how great you were now youve got a little more humility thats good but as others have said you are extremely quick to attacks others personally but get incredibly bent out of shape when others do it to youto op everythings working as intended
this thread is still hereoh wellon topic passive shield tank your hulk have an orca provide mining boosts assigned as squad commander have nighthawk with shield harmonizing links providing shield boost basilisks providing shield buffs with shield maintenance bots will help mechanics work as intended if this makes the game too hard you need to find a new game if you dont want to risk a hulk passive tanked mining rokh with orcanighthawk support pay attention to local and your dscan be mindful of concord being spawned at other locationsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
to add in some tips jack missed mine in odd locations such as grav sites or grab a mission clear it out of npcs then mine it thats 2 ways to get isk in one move if you mine in belts then move a bit dont sit at the warp in point thats begging for a ganking dont fall asleepif these previously mentioned tips n tricks dont work for you contract everything you own to me  isk included to me d
you can mine with a completely untanked hulkjust pay attention and always stay actively aligned with a planet or station or whatever i used to just bounce back and forth between two places while i minednever lost a hulk but was jumped many times now i make better moneyno need for the hulk
i have read many posts and threads about taking local out of nullsec and the opposite of players shouting to keep localmy personal view is a wish to actually keep local in nullsec but what do i know since im just a carebear in pvp disguise why am i making this thread of nonsense i am proposing that there be an interesting setup for intel with no local many people lose an intel toolok so it isnt really a tool for intel but it tells the player whether or not you should gtfo or fight onwards why not we take no local as default for nullsec but there would be an upgradeable structure of sorts that increases your intel usefulness in the system to get to the point  the structure would give you a local box and depending on what upgrade it has determines the effectiveness of local and intel from iti just had this pop into my head and its not fully laid out as a proper proposal but id like to see where you guys would take this do you think this would be fair if its not truly what you would agree with how would you change iti feel this idea as currently just an idea with no real hard thought could be expanded and possibly welcomed by players if you have questions please asktar
nokeep local in 00 there regular systems just like low and high sec just owned by douche bags instead of npcs pi could understand taking local out of wh space though
i created a new thread specifically for the aoe damage subject since this thread was for 3 ideas and i didnt want to focus on one in specific
i think you hit the nail on the head with paper dps time was all i wanted in eve was a cane with 8 turret slots i coveted this the thing is it makes the bs somewhat more pointless but if they are going to give a cpupg reduction for large turrets then those turrets will have all of the shortcomings that they have on a bs just without a bs frame supporting them which may be satisfying to eft warriors but results in a bs with worse tracking and likely havent seen the slots for them yet worse tank than a teirii bc to mine innocent eyes that looks like a gang rolefiller which would add flavor without removing balance mmmm the only fault in that plan is it relies on the forethought of ccp
hey all i had an idea on a feature that could be used to boost low sec and give eve more of the criminal underground befitting its personality this will seem very biased towards low sec but it really does need a boost this big to become an interesting and more viable place to live so bear with me i have also put in suggestions for balancing out the feature i am proposing to keep it from being too broken keep in mind this is also a rough mental draft and i can understand why people would be against this i welcome your criticism i also wouldnt be surprised if this idea was thought up in part somewhere else so i apologize if i am stealing someones idea but here goespos raiding the benefits warning no tldr introduce a new ship for each race possibly of a new class or as i would prefer a new electronic attack ship for each race allow them to fit a specialized module that offlines a poss shields and weapons for a short time a very short time this will allow pirates to make off with some nice goodies and give some more income potential to low sec pvp this will bring some attention and purpose to eas but their extreme fragility will not make defense hopeless for pos owners if a new ship cant be made for this purpose then a specialized module could be introduced that can only be fitted to electronic attack shipsthe possibility of raiding will force pos owners to actually defend their holdings rather than putting up death stars in lownull and just gaining huge passive income from moon minerals raiding parties can head out to null and bring some action with them if ccp was feeling particularly evil they could make this allowed in high sec with the rules of aggression being similar to can flipping smaller 00 alliances would be able to actually deal some damage to the big ones through their infrastructure pos raiding done right could be an integral part of 00 warfareto keep it balanced being a part of a pos raid will result in a loss of security status this makes low sec living more attractive as it is another avenue of pvp and profit for people not allowed in high sec this will limit how widespread raiding is to those only willing to lose lots of sec or people with none left to lose  the time window that a pos is offlined will have to be very small in order to prevent abuse say only a few minutes this will also insure a degree of skill is required on the part of the raiders to make it worth the effort a pos can only be raided so often perhaps once per day or a system can only have so many pos raids happen in a certain space of time say 2 per hour such a limit would be dictated by ccp certain skills must be trained in order to take part in or initiate a pos raid when a poss shields and weapons are shut down by a raiding party the owning corporationplayer will receive an ingame notification so that they may muster a defense if you are half a universe away from your pos and unable to defend tough  you shouldnt be reaping the benefits of something you cant protect dont anchor what you cant afford to lose  this goes back to forcing people to actually pay attention to their holdings as previously statedlike i said this is only a rough mental draft but one i have been thinking of for some time and yes i know that because i made a lengthy post that does not automatically qualify me as a game designer or that my feature will be adopted at the very least i am throwing my hat into the ring and trying to foster discussion on fixing low secplease post your comments or suggested changes to this feature
reserved
as i was forced to learn a while ago rough drafts are best placed in the ideas  suggestions subforum to have their edges smoothed or sharpened while your ideas have some merit i do not yet see a proposal ready to be either supported or shot down in this place
yeah no being able to disable both shields and weapons means that even an actively defended pos could be raped and thats counter both to the intent of this plan and to good game balancea better plan might be to take a more limited approach instead of being able to hack and totally disable a fullfledged deathstar for no reason and loot the entirety of its contents allowing a tech 2 frigate to instead sneak inside alone if and only if the pos doesnt murder it while it sits immobile off the pos and runs an advanced hacking cycle about as vulnerable as when dropping cyno seems about right which means itll need some nontrivial support and will be tough to do to a defended pos for example a pos gunner could simply target and murder the hapless frigate who would be unable to evade due to the hacking cycle once the tech 2 hacking frigate is inside the pos it can also hack into the poss modules and cargo in relative peace and thereby steal as much plunder as it can fit into its frigatesized hold before making an exityou might also use the same ship to hack into an offlined pos or perhaps other sorts of offlined sov gear and thereby steal it completely instead of having to spend long periods of time shooting the stuff down to no profit unlike a quiet infiltration of a pos thats something that would take some nontrivial period of time either with the hacker sitting immobile off the structure in the same way described above but for an hour or so boring or by simply running a single hacking cycle to drop a hacking module which would run for a 24hour cycle and send a mail to the owner of the structure who could easily shoot it down to stop the process if theyre actually active and able to defend it
im all for stealing goodies from poss as their are alot of poss simply left active with guns on around where my corp roams oh the moon goo sweet sweet moon goo slathering it up like jello on your skinbut honestly its not that ahrd to get into a pos if you want to simply open up the password screen start at archon and end with zomg yes i once got into a pos with zomg as the password and if those dont work you can always cycle through a aa ab aba abb abc so on and so forth into even jumbers until you have the password efort is effort and one should eb rewarded for persistence not given free goodies just because youd decided to raid some random pos for all the moon goo  corp assetsespecially since this would make living in wormholes near impossibletldr i applaud your proactiveness and creativity but with how things are currently set up it would lead to more problems than anything eventually ending with it just no longer being profitable to even own a pos
yeah i was afraid of that i was having a hard time thinking of ways to make it possible to defend against raids without shutting them down too much i know i dont really have a method for that yet and thats part of the reason i posted here any suggestions are welcome thanks for the feedback so far
1 agree whole heartedly time for your bs loki  to die
most idiotic statement said yet that is the one thing driving solosmallgang pvp away the most
bump this is something ccp should have done when the assist mods were released
bump
instead of shooting an idea down with a stupid reason such as yours why dont you try suggesting an alternative such asinstead of making the bonuses grid based make them based on range 250km seems to be a nice range to start at now endoviors complaint is resolved and we still accomplish the idea this thread is based around
im sorry but could you repost this in something approximating english or hell even american will do
since command links creately alter the dynamics of a fight it is sound that they should be vulnerable i think making them gridonly is nice in principle but i dont know how well it can be implemented fairly how will this hurt shield links leaving grid and coming back again means you could lose a lot of shield hp how will this alter the role of orcas and rorquals and carriers etc how will this moving them to grid only will alter several aspects of this game from plexing to mining to pvp i dont think this move should be made casually as it will have significant impacts on too many areas of the game not just fleet pvp
not sure if its been mentioned but if you suspect an offgrid fleet gang link there is a way to defeat them scan the git down and attack him its one of the reasons combat probes exist intel on the target and how it operates is a valuable tool
hi kaeliewait a sec i gave someone quarter where when UFFFDUFFFDohthe csm thing is more or less a joke since  if this thread is any indication  it would be highly unlikely that i could secure 2000 votes although i do think it would be really fun read arduous and progressive read gridlocked too tired to make a republican primary joke with your invitation about moderation maybe next timeargh this has been a difficult week so iUFFFDm just checking in  ill write replies soontm
i advocate this proposal friendly bump
my opinion on this is that you can change your name in real life ccp tries its best to make a scifi game as realistic as possible even though spaceship game besides i dont understand why ccp wont do it its another way to make money

as long as it only affects trial accounts as suggested1
agree but maybe also for paid accounts after 2 years of inactivitysend them 3 mails free up the name if there is no reaction  objection coming from them i even expect most of those email addresses to be invalid check the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
1this should be moved to the assembly hall as a genuine proposal
sounds like a good idea to me i wanna be elvis or maybe jim probably elvis
i know lots of people who have gone for two to three years and come back trials only
with my suggestion they just needed to reply  click i am still interested please dont release my name then they will stay untouchedcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
how can you tell exactly that the character has been inactive for the last 10 yearsand how can you tell it is a trial account
1 providing its neverpaid trials only i realise the op said this but some people cough el alasar cough have suggested taking out inactive paid accounts too this should not happenive never personally had an issue with name conflicts but this
i like this payout system my question to the new system is who can hunt of course we dont have a specific class bounty hunter but shouldnt there be a qualification ie faction standing or sec status to be able to freely engage a bounty that is in high sec ive been partial to the idea of establishing a kill contract like a mini war if you will for a limited time you fail to eliminate the target within a specific time it goes back up to a bounty pool that only qualified bounty hunters can obtain of course this is all theory crafting but something along these lines would help establish a much wanted proffession
what rewards p i cant think of a single advantage a 5 pilot has over a 5 pilot except the cool flashy name and a higher likelihood of having an interesting spacelifei missed the insurance loophole when i first posted my idea because honestly i was ignorant of the retardedly high levels that pend pays out i remembered insurance being less worthwhile and i didnt remember default insurance i seem to remember losing a ship and pend saying heres a free ibis and a trit htfu that was probably in 2004 or so i just never paid attention after thatbut if the purpose of insurance is to encourage hilarious explosions i cant see why the mechanic shouldnt apply to wensley if hes still poor in his little rifters as well as new bee who loses his firstever 75mmfitted bantam to guristas arrogatorsi can maybe see a system to allow for direct negotiation between the target and the bounty funder for the bounty to be removed at a service charge but to keep it simple and interesting i would say that this is a matter of negotiation between the pilots as in can you take this bounty off my head sure if you give me double the bounty amount in isk right now uh okay whether or not the bounty is lifted is purely up to the bounty funder opening exciting new scamming opportunities i would not ever propose that bounties be removed in any other way except through target killing thus encouraging pewpew okay but how many times would i have to pod you to win the bet im not advocating for any other changes to things like hisec kill rights etc if you want to go after a bounty declare war suicide gank or catch the target in lownull id rather keep the bounty proposal here as simple as possible so that it can be feasibly implemented with a minimum of goofy sideeffects to exploit once thats done and if bounty hunting becomes popular as an activity maybe further refinements can be proposed
one thing that just occurred to me have you considered the ramification this poses for newer relatively poor players that might get griefed with a huge bounty just for lulz how badly might that impact on them and their prospects of going about their business or moving out to low or null sec eventually and how could they rid their toon of the huge target sign theyd carry around that way
currently i believe bountying a pilot requires that the pilot have 10 or lower security if in the scenario you describe new bee goes around pissing people off and winding up with 10 security simultaneously i dont see a problem with someone shoving a huge bounty on him if thats a problem for him he can stay in hisec where its less likely that he will be killed by bounty hunters until he winds up at 50 security status at which point he knows what hes getting into unless hes a complete idiot in either case i dont see the problem
and this is one of the many reasons you would want to tie this to killrights or at least criminality somehow and then maybe you could limit the bounty to some isk amount based on the hull lost in the criminal action limit it to 3x the hull cost or something reasonablei wasnt proposing that the bounty hunters be allowed to pursue targets in highsec though i think thats a logical step rather i was suggesting a mechanic to prevent abuse
under such a limitation how would someones rich friend bounty someone for himhow would you bounty someone for corp theft scams pos destruction or other indirect asshattery
theres nothing wrong with this idea  however someone with 700 items in their hangar should know how to use the search bar at the top righthand corner of the item window shouldnt they its pretty easy and faster than scrolling no matter how much you have in your hangar

i dont care about workarounds i want improved or at least restored game functionality alsoshoo troll
when a wreck is destroyed the current model for a subcapital ship is dull and has almost no resemblance to the ship it was before it was destroyedmy proposal is to create a destroyed ship model for every kind of ship even capsules and make the wreck not the overview icon stay in space for a long duration even after it is salvaged if you stumbled upon a grid where a battle took place you should be able to see the wrecks and have a small idea of what actually happened there this would only work on player ships to avoid accumulated mission wrecks lagging up a system after a wreck expired it would break apart maybe because of a reactor instability or we explode a little and vanish instead of just fading away for no reasonor when a player ship is destroyed it would create two wrecks one default scrap wreck that you can salvage and one wreck that keeps moving in the direction it was and at the velocity it was when it was destroyed then after ten or 15 seconds it would explode a little and break apartimo the ship exploding animation is great but the aftermath when the explosion fades away is very very anticlimactic imagine the ship exploding then it keeps moving on fire with its frames showing and breaks apart after exploding a little again and only then the real wreck the default scrap wreck is createdpods would still be ejected on the first explosion
this falls under the category of much requested feature that most likely has feasibility issueswhile itd be nice eyecandy that i do support because well who doesnt like eyecandy i do question whether this would make the servers andor our computers hiccup and die when trying to id and render dozens of ships that may or may not be different from one another
supported but low priority itd be nice but its not important and its especially not important if itd cause nontrivial lag
all good and welland i personally would like thisbut when you arrive on to a 1000 man wreck battlefield and you try to render eachandevery wrecklife gets a little nasty for the computerdoable likelywill it happen doubtful1 regardless stop the evemail spam
well if it can render the ships and the drones during combat it can render the wrecks and the wrecks would be static objects with no further traffic relating to them once youve loaded the grid the wrecks are there until downtimeit would probably be a good idea to have selective code so that if enough ships arrived on grid the wrecks would be hidden to prevent overloading the local client but i dont really see it as a server issue
not supported unless it can be done algorithmically without any significant demands being placed on the art department
i actually made a topic at the old forums a while ago supported  but its true its not as important as other things and that needs to be done in an easy way for modellers and perfomance
i love the idea of aoe explosions the bigger the structureship the farther away youd better be having said that an explosion in null is the same as an explosion in the magical fairy land of empire so  not supported
the problem with not restricting the aoe explosions in empire is that 10 guys with the proper ships and timing could use it to kill a lot of people on the jita undock that would bring a new idiotic gank mechanic that really doesnt need to be there
and the problem with limiting aoe explosions in empire is that it would create an imbalance high security space is just that high security meaning it is heavily patrolled by faction police and concord will respond to criminal actions and deal with it in short order it is not absolute security nor is it meant to be new eden isnt a place that is meant to hold your hand it is cold ruthless and everchanging adapt or diei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i like explosion ideaif someone wants to somehow blow up a tonne of ships in hs for some ganking purposewould be cool if you got a killmail on a ship only cause ur ship blew up and laid the final blow on the ship pew pewing you1if hs is the only reason not to put this in  stop pampering everyone in eve and let hs have this quirk
1for those interested in facilitating an explanation within the lorein this game we have lasers ships that can cloak cynos and wormhole travel to say the least if all of that is technically possible in the game how farfetched would it be to have a
lolyay for eve physicists
hey lets nerf close range weaponry and small ships to cut down on blobs guys hey hey hey its a good idea heyin truth you can tell when one side is horribly outnumbered when they end up doing a lot more exploding than the blob also the smaller group will have more ships exploding right when they all warp in before they have time to spread out now not only are you outnumbered and exploding faster than the other guys youre also taking damage from being outnumbered and exploding hehoh also also itll end up doing things like blowing up dictor bubbles paradoxically making a rout less lethal by nerfing the main method of tackling dudes also also also theyll end up blowing up bombs making an already tricky antiblob weapon even more difficult to use effectively
and why exactly would this not be standard in low and nullsec why wouldnt it be default in npc controlled stations and an option in player controlled ones if you want ship explosions have them everywhere or have them nowhereas for the smartbomb thing not being able to activate a module is not the same as containing a nuclear reactor going boom
because just like concord isnt interested in protecting you in lowsec and nullsec they arent interested in investing time and money for station and gate upgradesagain i will state that i am not personally opposed to the explosions damaging players in highsec but there is the obvious problem of exploiting this kind of mechanic to the benefit of pirates and gankers most freaked out about it on the old thread so this was the solution to still allow the mechanic change without changing life in highsec for the bears
iUFFFDm sure most people would agree that the corporate roles system is pretty terrible and in need of a drastic overall however iUFFFDm also sure that most of us realise a complete overall is a significant undertaking and isnUFFFDt going to happen anytime soon however would it not be possible to look at two or three of the most serious issues separately would solving them not make the wait for a complete overall of the roles and title system much more palatablefor myself and many others the most serious by far is cancelling corporate science and industry jobs itUFFFDs currently not possible to give a player access to start corporate science and industry jobs without also giving them the ability to cancel any and all existing jobs this really makes absolutely no sense what so ever i know a lot of people take the view that this should be a trust issue and that corporations should be more careful with recruitment and who they hand out roles to i donUFFFDt accept this argument for even a medium sized corporation with industrial interests itUFFFDs very easy to get a science and industry jobs list billions if not tens of billions of isk where is the risk vs reward argument for giving a player access to that just because they want to copy a kestrel bpoif people do stupid things in eve they should and quite often are punished however you also need to give people the tools and ability to be able to do things sensibly and avoid problems right now the only option for such players and corporations with industrial interests is to just not hand out roles not recruit industrial minded players or make use of alts and alt corps to manage large industrial projects many of these are very much counter to the whole mmo experienceso i have a simple proposal change the role system so that only directors have the ability to cancel other playerUFFFDs corporate science and industry jobs this should be a relatively simple solution to implement and would solve the issue until a more complete overhaul of the roles system comes into place
why cant someone trusted run those kestrel copies
because someone trusted already has their copy slots filled with copying titan bpos
you have a shortage of people in your corp you trust not to be asshats if you are only trusting 5 people you have a problem if your only talking about noobs who havent proven trustworthy you should have plenty who can have the relatively insignificant rolesespecially if you keep the bpos somewhere else and remotely researchcopy them 
maybe trusted players are busy with their own personal jobs or corp jobsmaybe newer players have si slots free that they want to usemaybe newer players want to feel like they are helping and contributing to the corporationmaybe because it adds a lot of extra work and hassle for everyone involved UFFFD for example max single run copies for invention on many bpoUFFFDs is in days not weeksmore so than anything else why should they have to not sure you quite get the problem it really doesnUFFFDt have anything to do with hangers if someone can start a corp si job regardless of the type of job where the job is running or where the job was started from then they can cancel any and all other corporate si jobs
trust in this gameyour kidding right trollbut yesanythingliterally anything to improve the fail that is corporate roles stop the evemail spam
please yes this would be a step in the right direction of course there would need to be many many more steps on that path
why would anyone trust a director more than an ordinary corp memberit was a director that singlehandly dissolved bob and lost years of work that the untrustworthy corp members worked so hard for
to me at least the whole concept of security status should be dynamic the rp angle is that higher security space has more concord attention and lower has less matched up with what is supposed to be a sliding scale of riskreward it seems reasonable to me that players should have some way to impact this on some level as their actions would also have an rp impact on the overall security of said space it seems like it would be pretty cool that either through activities the players do or activities that rp storyline causes would cause the focus and attention of concord to shift around a bit im not sure how easy of a sell this would be to ccp since it sounds fairly timeeffort intensive but i like the concept
i would like this a lot like urban decayrenewal but what happens to the chars who resub and find themselves in a security shift highlow if youre a flashy red and you log on and your former pipe system is now hisec do you just get destroyed on the undock less of a problem people who have a hisec pos who are suddenly in low less of a problem because they just wind up taking them down or losing them i suppose or a returning player who say has all his crap in motsu and comes back to find out it will take him 4 jumps to get himself and all his crap to hisecwould a 01 system be switchable to npc null or viceversa or even more crazy would a null alliance be able to build an empire island in the middle of their sovereign space why they would want to is anyones guess though it might be funny to do it to someone elses sovereign spacei could see changing security levels in systems without bridging between highlownull as a dynamic system and a way to spread out missionrunner congestion without just moving the agents around in a patch 6 gazillion navy missions run in motsu implies a higher active population of citizens implied npc citizens which can supportrequire more concord which moves the security status up after a very long time which makes the agents less profitable which encourages people to move you may wind up with some goofy system security jumps like this though going from 08 to 04 for instance making the security map less sensible

currently you can do your own thing low sec and since not all low sec systems are contested in fw even with these changes you would still have a great degree of independence in the right systemsi feel these ideas for imporving low sec do provide alot for pver rprs to claim bunkers its like running a mission except you might get jumped by opposing factionsand honestly how is that different from running a plex or anom in null or low sec and theres the expansion of gas harvesting most of the yar bears in the game are geared toward that yarring most pirate corps dont have the industrial wing to handle gas harvesting and booster manufacturing this could be a niche for industrials either joining pirate or other faction militias or simply working via contract for these entities to harvest gas sites and manufacture boosters for themi tryed to put alot of thought into this and how it could reach out and touch all the different facets of eve if your an indy player or pver and these changes make you feel left out in low sec my apologies i did my best to see that these changes would throw you a bone as well
shields up red alert
i can give a number of reasons why this is just a terribad idea the amount of input would be ridiculous pronunciation of systems and certain caldari stations would  people up and make it hard to navigate mining would be a ing nightmare combat considering all the tacticallogistical telemetry youd be feeding the game would have more lag than it does now being able to get the system to respond to speech considering all the various accents would be a pain in the  this would take away from the work being done on fis and wisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
there are a lot of commands that simply wouldnt make sense to issue via voice while the op might want to tug his shirt a bit gesture vaguely at the screen and say engage the nature of eve doesnt suit that well in a system with more than a dozen stations and half a dozen stargates nine planets averaging six moons each thats a lot of celestials for the system to distinguish between based on voice commands then theres choosing the proper target when you undock from jita and see an enemy amidst the dozens of neutrals scanning probes dscan and other such tools would simply be impossibleeven if i wouldnt feel silly speaking orders every few seconds even if i didnt want to keep my mic and audio free for teamspeak such a system would be very limited in application and significantly slower to use than clicking
an another negative pointin the time you tell your ship to get say 5 jumps and do whatever it is your going to doill have time to take a shower and eat my mealok maybe notfact is keystrokes and mouse clicks are ultimately and always well be ever faster than speaking commandsthe problem is not so much the ability to do soits the time and compliexity of those commands stop the evemail spam

i would like to see a system put in place that keeps people from avoiding war decs my main idea is that once an alliance war dec corps are not allowed to leave until the war dec it over people can quit he corpbut he corp itself is forced to remain within the alliance or making it 48hrs to leave an alliance with a notification being sent to the aggressing corpalliance so that the voting period can be started on the corp that is leaving the alliance hat you are after
no wardeccing already vastly favors the greifers they dont need more ways to attack people there are already a few threads about this no need to make another
put awox corp into aliancewardec aliance with alt corpawox corp cant be kicked awoxers rejoice
considering ccp set a precedent concerning wardec evasionthis proposal is dead from the startthe numbers of people who protest wardecs outnumber the numbers of people who are agianst wardec evasionim for this proopsalbut if ccp says nothe answer is noin this case yes to evasion of wardecs1 regardless stop the evemail spam
its simpler than that attach wardecs to entities so that if you wardec a corp and they leave the alliance the wardec stays on them it would work something like this if you wardec an alliance the war remains active so long as you pay the bill and the alliance exists corporations can drop membership as normal to escape the war if they feel the alliance leadership is not handling the war properly likewise members of corporations at war should be able to leave the corp at will if you wardec a corporation and they join an alliance the war extends to the alliance but remains attached to the corp this way if that corp leaves the alliance later the alliance isnt stuck with the war you should be able to wardec a specific corporation that is a member of an alliance but pay alliance dec fees so that if that corp drops you are still able to conduct war against it this would prevent pos corps in alliance that drop as soon as a war starts in order to protect their holdings this way dropping the alliance would mean that alliance members could not defend the corpi have no objection to being able to leave an organization if you dont want to fight the war its in what i do object to is the ability to use game mechanics to shrug off wars that other players paid for
this made me laugh come back when wardecs cost more than chump change

so far im happy to see that this has triggered the right discussionsa game of these characteristics oftenly give you the possibility to see how human behavior works if you give someone the power you will truly understand how people are so far fewer chose to be good and a lot to be badi love pvp but none of you can tell us how to play the game or even to look for another one eve has its rules and i play it chosing to be the good guys i pay for my game time and want to make this game fun for everyone not planning to abuse or destroy anybodys game but yes to improve it including you guysgood luck with your endeavoursrolds
since the cq is nearly useless at the moment and having two players in the same room is currently impossible why not add a console for gambling in the room it could start with maybe one kind of card game made up by ccp or a variation of an existing one and you could wager isk on games if the technology is available at the moment itd be cool to be able to play against people you invite to games while placing bets down which would allow some player interaction from your room without actually seeing another player just yetjust a thought if you have any ideas of your own for thiscriticism please share
they already stated in dev blogs and at the last fanfest that gambling and mini game tables are already slated for wisbut not in cq i doubt having them implement it into cq would be a wise way to expend resources when they might be better off just finishing wis
oh wow i didnt hear a word about that thanks for letting me know
we will unfortunately have to wait until ccp picks up and works on wis some more though focus right now is fis as it should be until the masses are appeased unfortunately the masses will never be appeasedthe moment ccp says anything about spending even a millisecond on wis people will freak and try to chase them with torches and pitchforks until they go back to fis
keep in mind that there are already a few thirdparty sites that provide the opportunity to gamble for isk somerblink and eoh both come to mind and im sure there are more it seems a bit of a waste of time for devs to implement a system for gambling when players have already found ways to do so eve is a sandbox game ccp loves it when players step up and create services themselves why would they spend time working on a way to remove a sandbox element of the game by making their own system and driving thirdparty gambling out of business the only way i could see ccp stepping in and making their own gambling is if it dealt with aur which is tied to plex and their cash flow depending on how it was set up it might give a whole new meaning to losing the shirt off your back lol
unless you contract pl and they will probably just make it capital online then its not very probable that self destruct is issue to you  as only ships in game that can get use of this is capitals as is not hard to kill subcapital with too minute
gotta say in war we dont measure our wins by isk ratio but by who keeps coming for fightsnot like anyone is real low on isk
killmails used as penis extensions are bad yes however killmails used to track how good corps are are corps worth joining ranking in alliance and to see wether a corp is just a bunch of idiots who need to gtfo of an alliance well thats the purpose of killmailsi think the people who want the total removal of kms may be the ones worried about their pvp ability
logi pilotsbesides if all you are worried about is looking good join a pos kill fleet and pad the hell outta your kb
it isnt about looking good its about being able to see what a corp or pilot does i find the killboard absolutely essential to see who stays and who goes in my corp but its easy for me as we are a pvp corp so if i see a pilot who hasnt had a single kill for 3 months and i know who flies logistics alot then i know he needs to gokillboards may not be a perfect measure of a corporation but how else do you measure them and it isnt the actual stats people tend to look at its the actual type of fights type of fleets etc that people look at well i do anyway so padding with pos mods isnt any way to hide real statsmeasuring a corps use of logistics is always going to be hard there is no way out of that that i can see apart from to say in my corp i know who flies logi all the time
not saying there is a better method at the moment just a pet peeve of mine that certain support roles that can make the difference between wins and losses get shortchanged a bit on things like thisever since i failed to get my first km because i was repping someoneif killmails went then something new would have to replace them probably a score based on amount of damage you dorep which would have its own type of stupidkillmails are a flawed mechanic and should not be supported but they cant go without a suitable replacement
exactly all i need is a way to measure how effective my pilots are not to mention potential recruits even if the killmails were replaced with a single fleet battle mail for every engagement so you see who was on each side what was total loss etc for each side this would be better than actual individual mails you could see how many fleets a pilot participated in rather than how many killmails they are onthe total killslosses could still be massed into an effective metric for corp stats
ok i am going to do something i rarely do and backpedal just a little bitfrom a pvp corporation and mercenary standpoint i can see how kill mails are an important metric fora proving youve completed a contract andb rooting out the slackers in your corporationthough i do pvp when i am in the mood i admit i am primarily an industrialist and like most people i have blinders on about my playstylethat said how about a compromise position keep the self destruct as it is but send out a kill mail with no fitting information in it the kill mail can go out to the pilot who did the most damage with the final blow listed as the self destructthat maintains the intel denying purpose of a self destruct while still allowing the pvp corpmercs to continue to accurately measure a and b aboveyes it will mean your isk efficiency only reflects the hull  thats the compromise the pilot who selfdestructed still gets the benefit of denying loot and intelligence to the enemy in return the enemy gets a way to prove they were responsible for the loss of that ship

shield links already have a problem here but its a problem with gang bonuses in general and not simply links fleets are most commonly mobile and any time you jump through a gate you lose any extra shield hp the leadership bonuseslinks grant when they go inactive and activate again on the other side i think it should be addressed but i also think its secondary to this discussion also there are a lot of people who dont think it should be changed because of the additional benefits of a larger number of shield hp passive recharge i agree that we need to consider all the relevant casesi dont believe that pve or mining should be any different than pvp in this regard if you want the benefits of links you expose your link ship to the risks associated with the activity there should not be major differences in the way pvp and pve workgang bonuses represent command and control improving the abilities of their fleet if the fleet is not anywhere near the command and control it shouldnt benefit
this the t3 is a better booster than the commandship should be reverse
you do realize that in modern warfare command and control is normally not even on the same continent much less actually at the fight modern communications systems satellites and computers make it unnecessary to risk your cnc staff at the front lines all you need on the front are guys to receive and carry out the orders surprisingly thats very much how fleet bonuses in eve workthat aside i agree they should still be vulnerable so how about we simply do not allow them to be effective from inside a pos forcefield in the same way carriers have to expose themselves to provide fighter support by exiting the pos forcefield gang link ships will have to be positioned outside those shieldsthis means they can be scanned down and popped by an incoming attack force and if they play docking games or bubble games the effect is the same the fleet loses those bonuses eliminating the force multiplier of the ship iin questionediti also agree t3s should not be better command ships than command ships maybe on par if completely fit for it but not better
modernday command and control is not harmonizing your shields optimizing your armor repair modules boosting the strength of your electronic warfare and otherwise increasing the direct effectiveness of weapons and defenses modernday command and control is making troop movement decisions and making general strategy you are comparing command staff in a far off bunker mittens coming up with strategy for his minions with platoon and squad leaders on the front lines the fleet commander his wing and squad leaders and his boosters if platoon and squad leaders were not on the front lines with the troops they command they would not be effectivebut thats all just a bunch of worthless comparisonswhat you say about being vulnerable is true if we force the boosters to be outside of pos shields they are vulnerable if you bring a prober and can get your fleet off the gate to go find them but thats just incentive to bring more pilots gang links are indeed vulnerable if your fleet is larger that the fleet you are jumping into and you are able to evade them long enough to find the gang link ship and threaten it  but if you can do all that you were probably going to win anyway i think this is what people normally call blob incentive
the whole thread is blob incentiveor did you think people would keep bringing tiny little fleets with their now on grid command ships
actually i do i fly in small gangs all the time if the fleet is too small to support a combat effective command ship on grid with us then we dont bring one and make do without the links if the fleet is of sufficient size then we bring a command ship sufficient falls somewhere around 8 to 10 dependent upon the fleet composition thats what eve is all about taking risks and either losing in a blaze of glory or reaping the rewards the risk now for offgrid gang links is so minimal compared to the benefits that it is unbalancing if somebody can do it practically afk or on a third instance of eve it shouldnt have that much influence over a fight
bump
on one hand i think serves you right for being an idiot and choosing a ridiculas name trial period or not but of course we all have our moments the penalty for such a moment should be monetary like himlar states a one time name change should be allowed with a permanent aka of the old name linked with searches etc and no to any additional name changes with a character transfersale it would be a selling feature if u hadnt utilized the name change yetend of line
like the essentials and most of the debated points except for those above as long as you can search for the prev character and bring up the new one some of these points are redundant but that would need to be an essential feature secstandingsp hit  dont see any need provided people pay this is an administrative task for ccp so i think its unreasonable to expect this for free character transfers are 2 plex i think id be happy with 24 plex for this moderately extortionate to reduce time wasters there should imo be a fee and it should either be eye poppingly high or limited to once per year we char tfrs  as long as they are searchable why shouldnt the new owner be able to change the name real need afaik is already addressed by ccp ie spelling errors but if people want to change one idiotic name to another idiotic one who cares its their choice and hopefully their money they are spending so pfft not our call to make one time only is unfair on subsequent players same letter mmm mebe but we dont know what will happen in future with fleet mechanisms so a massive shift from ac names to xz names might bite ppl later on if theres a large enough fee in place and ccp actually put a warning if youre doing this because of fleet mechanics bear in mind we may change things later muhahah really people cant winge i could see the flipside of this being implemented that fcs reverse target calling anyway and go za which would be pretty amusing sec rating nah not all sec ppl have been out griefing theres some sort of moral judgement tied into that which shouldnt be relevant in thisgood luck with this proposal i hope it passes in some form
all my eve mail for my alt account goes to my spam address ive had it for four years and ive never checked itif youve paid money youve expressed your interest end of story
1 from me as well delete all inactive trial accounts over a year old
i agree on a rolling basis every trial account over 1 year old and never converted should be wiped out totallyit would just take some time and careful scripting to do but ccp is capable as long as no one named themselves bootinialways  never  forget to check your references peace out zulu hope you land well
while i would say that most people moaning about names being already taken usually try to choose some inane moniker like xxxgankerxxx or trying to have a ripoff from some movie book or whereever id support the idea of cleaning up the account database trial accounts onlythough i think that would never happen as that would drastically reduce the number of accounts eve online can claim to have
moved from features and ideas
give him the moneycontract with a mercenary groupif there is a security status limitation you already have this problem what if the corp thief scammer or pos killer doesnt have a negative security status just because you dont like the pilot doesnt mean concord has anything against the pilot
perhaps but you can merccontract anyway for any reason merc contract is very different from bountying as proposed here1 hiring mercs is outside the economic purview of an average person in most cases contributing something to a bounty escrow is not2 hiring mercs is usually timelimited though this can vary with the contract but wardecs cost money even if the target is logged off or staying in a station a bounty stays until things explode3 hiring mercs can be a scam in itself possible but harder to scam an npc escrow4 hiring mercs is more effective as a measure against a corporation not a single pilot4 a bounty is a kick me sign that everyone can see not just a deccing merc corporationas far as security status yes the bounty system isnt a universal i dont like you system however there are many circumstances where limiting the isk placed into a bounty is well limiting if a flashy blows up my shuttle and im mad enough to drop 1b into an escrow i think thats okay even if its probably stupid for me to do so if a few flashies catch some cheap ospreys and as a result a pos doesnt get repaired and goes down i dont see why the corp should be prevented from placing an apparently ridiculous bounty on the guys who unknowingly intercepted their logistics hell if a rich person places giant bounties on every 50 and lower in lowsec and starts a feeding frenzy thats perfectly legitimate as well and may get people into lowsec for once all are legitimate pursuits i thinkbut this is derailing a bit small steps
i agree that this is a problem but there are a few fundamental decisions you have to make about your kickme signhow do you want to restrict application of the kickme signi think in general you want to restrict the kickme sign to players that have done a bad thing but you have to define bad thing if you define bad thing in terms of actions that cant be measured by the software then you cant restrict with the software anymore at this point the only bad thing we can detect with software is exploding someones spaceship you can see that this is how bounties are restricted now to people with negative security status but the set of people who do bad things arent restricted to that setdo you want to restrict the size of the kickme sign and the stickiness of the tape that binds it and if so how do you want to do iti posit that you do want to restrict the durationsize because we are making the kickme sign have actual meaning this has got to be tied to the sizeduration of the bad thing because the only bad thing we can detect is exploding someones spaceship logically its the only thing we can measure since the kickme sign is supposed to be incentive to take away the spaceship of the person that did a bad thing i dont see a reason not to link them directly the current system is so restrictive that if a positive security status player pods you out of your highgrade snakes you wouldnt be able to place a bounty on himi think this is especially true if its going to impose any other kind of penalty aside from the kickme sign such as reducing or removing insurance payoutswhich is worse allowing a bounty for any reason but only on a negative security status player or allowing a bounty only for known criminal actions regardless of security statusi like the way taurean eltanin discusses this issue by making a distinction between bounty hunters in star wars who are generally bad people working for other bad people versus bounty hunters who are good guys he uses judge dredd as an example but i know nothing of him the model for star wars is all about mercenaries  you hire somebody you know will take care of business for you and you pay them when you are satisfied theres no law involved and you dont find jobs by sitting down at your computer and scanning the galactic bounty hunter network at the end of the day im okay with a smallish change here  something that would make bounties worthwhile without the bells and whistles im suggesting  and your original proposal fits that bill but i think we should at least discuss the additional ideas rules and issues because in my optimistic world i believe ccp or their representative will take the kernel of this idea and make it their own by pulling in interesting bits rather than plugging in exactly what any of us said individually i think bounty hunting has the potential to be great even if its not exactly what i want it to bei write too much
1 whos going to pay for the bounty because if i want to put a bounty on xs head i cant do it depending on if hes going to fly a shuttle or a titan when he decides to get killedand obviously concord isnt going to pay it since are the players who decide who has a bounty on his head2 adding insurances to the bounty do you really think anyone is going to pay for an insurance that if they get destroyed they arent going to recive backfor me the only posibility is a randomized bounty mission system where you recive a target base on a similar sp range maybe region too and you can only reject a mission once per week you also cant be assigned targets within your own alliance that should solve it
bounties only apply up to the amount the vengeful player originally entered as soon as that is covered things continue as before the bounty was set bounty hunters will not get a higher bounty just because they destroyed stuff that was worth a lot more than the bountynobody is unless they want to get rid of the bounty sooner but thats part of the point isnt it
i can see how that makes sense for the case i specified but im not sure i like it there should be a way to place a bounty on anyone who crossed you maybe limit bounties to the net worth of the bountied is that even a word players assets or possibly to not reveal actual net worth that way to the average net worth of characters of the target toons age im sure the good doctor has a curve for just that lying about somewhere
as paritybit pointed out theres currently no heuristic for software to track many activities that  people off including scammingbeing a jerk in localcorp theft i think for the more abstract cases counterpissingoff or mercs are still viable as is just ignoring the person im not really looking at bounties as a catchall for all behavioral problems in the game i just want to propose a relatively simple mathematical solution to a longbroken systemregarding character ageassets i unsubbed for a long time twice and so i dont have the sp or iskassets you might expect based merely on toon age some other characters are disproportionately richpoor for whatever reason and you can always hide assets on a second account if you want
thats why i suggested that limit  its not perfect heck this toon is worth 5000isk plus a noobship at a few years of age   but it would restrict abuse of bounties to grief new players with a simple mechanic i believe 10 sec is just too limiting and would reduce a bounty hunters choice of targets significantly
agreed its a shiny thing there are other things they could be doingthat said it could be made policy that from here on out every new ship model gets a wreck model to go with it that way in the course of updating and replacing aging content this could become a reality without that extra load
its the same model with the old common texture plastered from all wrecks as is the case with current capital wrecks copy and paste nearly zero work for art department

supported excellent solution and a simple one at that
is there anyone who dislikes the idea and participate in the testing and bugreportingor is is just i do not want others to have possibility i would not use not because it would disbalance the game but solely on principle
hello everyone thank you for using time for me first of all please see the mail delivered to the player of a part of living in japanthis is the contents of the mail nexon is a company which has established reputation in account hacking in japan in a japanese player many persons of an idea negative to the fee collection in nexon exist probably many those who resign eve also exist a japanese community will receive a serious damage nexon is recording the member of the 26 million membership and nexon point which the member has will have big influence on the economy of eve moreover nexon is also an authority of item fee collection the living player in japan is forced into a new fee collection receptionist however i surmise that it is all the players that are affectedthat is it is that the fund of other games flows into the market of eve via nexonthis will give a serious damage to eve economy please consider this nexon point onceplease tell me your opinion ps it is writing by machine translation
sure sounds bad does this apply to all players loggin in from an ip range registered to japan or those whose credit cards show they are living in japan if it is the latter couldnt you circumvent this by using a payment method that obscures your country of residence like plex bought for you by someone elsehow will you understand our replies to your post machine translation will likely scramble our meaning thoroughly
customers in japan should have the option to use nexon or not if they so choosenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
if most of his post is true it presents a tough situation for eve players in japan i hope someone from ccp can vouch for the credibility of their new business partner a company with a hacking reputation would certainly make me feel uncomfortable as a subscriber best of luck to all eve players in japan
thank you for the opinioninformation is not released about the technology for specifying the player of living in japan he understands that it is better for there to be selection of the fee collection methods other than nexon
the uneasiness of a japanese player is big and much comment which expresses displeasure with a community can hear it this opinion has appeared in the player which experienced many online games since there is little safe material such as improvement in information control and improvement in security uneasiness only becomes large
domoi was going to ask about citing nexon hacking references but a google search immediately brought up a youtube video on hacking nexon accounts many reports of nexon vulnerabilities in other games etc i would never use themcan japanese players buy gtcs from ccp or an authorized reseller and not use nexon as a workaround
i for one am curious as to how nexon might be related to soe considering the apparent exclusivity arrangements both have fashioned with ccp or if thats just how ccp has been doing business lately
cotton there is a thread on this with further information and a short statement by ccp over in general discussion apparently monthly rates will be significantly below 3000 yen and you will still be able to work around nexon by paying by plex
this honestly should be asked of nexonnot ccpthis isnt all that different as opposed to using paypal or green dot visa cc monthly fee and all that stop the evemail spam
solo playerthank youthe argument had already started i would like to ask nexon and ccp and to collect informationi think that it is unfair as selection of fee collection that it becomes impossible to use a credit card and paypal
againthis is a nexon issueccp will not have an answer to thisalso keep in mind this is also international in terms of currency handlnig stop the evemail spam
under that same logic do you not think bob might possibly have had problems earlier if they had allowed director level access across the board to all of their corporate membersultimately directorship in all but the smallest of corporations should be a very trusted and privileged position if someone makes it to that level in a corporation and one day decides to cause some trouble then so be it the same goes for someone works their way up the corporate ladder with these specific intentions ultimately you shouldnUFFFDt have the same level of trust with a standard corp member as you would with a director or even vice versain all of this i am not for a minute suggesting that we try and eliminate the possibilities for theft scamming espionage sabotage and so on myself and many others just want simple tools to counter this side of the game in this particular case by allowing corporate members access to do relatively simple stuff without wildly unnecessary exposure to the corporations assets and intereststwice in the last few weeks i have had conversations with pilots regarding recruitment that touched on the industrial aspects of the game the first prospective recruit was interested in getting involved with the corporationsUFFFD industrial efforts as they had significant and underused science and industry skills the second prospective recruit was interested in using some of our bpos and research facilities i had to tell both pilots that it would probably be weeks if not months before we would grant them the roles to be able to do this the pilots both understood the absurdness of the situation with one eventually giving up on the idea of assisting with industry projects and joining a dedicated pvp corp and the other forming a corp with his industrial alt so that he could anchor a pos and just use his own research facilitiesi would consider both of these situations to be as absurd as each other and striking examples of how simple changes like this need to be implemented now rather than years down the road with a more comprehensive overhaul of the roles system
having recently had to deal with just this set of permissions i completely understand the issues long story short you should have a probation period get to know the personthen make a decision about trusting them if you dont why are they still in your corptbfh the current system mostly fails in the ui aspect of it if it was clear what various roles allowed then most issues would be avoidedfix the ui and stop letting people you dont trust in your corp if you have a good screening process you can get most of the people who arent pro theives and arent after you for personal reasonsrevenge seekers those 2 are gonna get access if they really want it because they know how to game people not the system
we already have a lot of this stuff in place short probationary periods as part of in game channels before we even accept new members into the corp probationary periods before we give out any basic hanger or roll access further probationary periods before we allow members to use our wormhole facilities UFFFD and so oni donUFFFDt think this is as simple as whether you trust someone or not i am sure you trust most of not all of your standard membership UFFFD but do you trust them enough to give them director level access itUFFFDs levels of trust and the risk of handing out roles to someone verses the rewards and benefits of a particular member getting the rewards right now the risks exposing the whole of the corporations si jobs verses the rewards for a member being able to copy a kestrel bpo do not stack up UFFFD especially so for larger corporations where you could be looking at access for 10UFFFDs of players to such rolesif you made this change you are still going to have to hand out hanger and lab access and you are still going to have to setup wallet access in turn the process is still going to involve levels of trust and there will still be oppertunities for pilots to break this trust  particularly with corporations who have not locked down bpos secured wallets and hangers and so forthin all of this we should also consider this from the prospective of your membersmember  hey you guys have frigate bpoUFFFDs great can i run off a few copies to try out inventiondirector  no come back in 3 months time when we have got to know you better and can trust you not to cancel 10 billion isk worth of industry jobs

posted in features  discussion but thought it would be better suited heredear ccpi know this has been mentioned in the past but thought it wouldnt hurt mentioning it againsince you have been ever so generous to us as of late may i request that you make it so that our buysell orders are highlighted in the market listit would make things for us market jews that bit quicker plus it probably is a simple change requiring minimal coding not that i know anything about codingthank you in advancekeen aresimarket jew extraordinaire
simple enough idea and should benefit all market users to some degree

arrgh stupid forum at my entire post edit twice nowanyways the tldrneed a negotiation platform for wars terms for surrender ransom provide terms of isk time of immunity from another war when the war gets dropped etc eliminate war evasion this way ccp needs to eliminate alliance hopping regardless periodboost mission ai with tougher more player like npcscountermissions for mission runners mix in competior npc corps that send players after same goals or attackdefend situations where competing players can engage each other only in mission spacecreate cat  mouse npc corps courrier contracts send player 1 to deliver goods a distant station while player 2 is given info to intercept and to either destroy or ransom the goods from player 1fix bounties create qualifications sec statusfaction standings to get bounty contracts to get the marked target anywhereyeah that was my tldr but would be great to see these changes
something newi really like this idea being a gladiator could be a career path have some sort of base payout for competing some small amount then the house awards the winner with some isk depending on a ladderrank system throw in some side betting however it would all have to be instanced with a queue i would want to log on and just jump into a match i do not want to deal with organizing a match or trying to find someone to fight maybe it could be some sort of virtual sport that people play while dockedsomething oldmissions i once had an idea about leveling each agent like they all start off at level 1 but by doing some storyline missions for them the agent will gain standing with their corp so then the corp will give the agent a harder storyline with all of those missions we do for an agent i would think that the agent is seeing some benefit also however i would still want the agent to be able to give out those random nonstoryline mission at what ever level they are at and each storyline has to be unique to each agent i would not want to see two agents with the same exact storyline mission
edited to reflect new insight gleaned from discussionissuerunning missions is so boring only bots would enjoy itat the moment missions in eve are static predictable imposed on the player and frankly rather less than exciting whats more the best missions are available at static mission hubs overcrowded by missioneers and worse botssolutionmuch is to be said and has been for systems that randomise vary or link missions in fresh ways to keep them entertaining my idea does not have much impact on that instead i suggest that ccp rethink their system of providing missions to the players this proposal details a way to offer the player a selection of missions at all times in a dynamic way by means of a mission board with a mission supply that reflects both player activity and local flavourdetailsintroduce a new station service called the mission board or the like  on it resident agents offer missions much like the current contract system offered missions may be limited to select missioneers dependent on standings security status positive or negative or militia membership missions would spawn according to system sec status system sovereignty system rats owner of station type of station type of celestial body it orbits maybe even local economy reacting to unmet market demand or oversupply or local random like disasters plagies or famines events more importantly spawn rate reward amount and types of missions all would depend on player population ratting frequency number of missions accomplishedfailed and other player activity dependent factors it would be possible to fill up all missions on a wellserved station thus mission hubs would not remain static missions on offer would expire after a preset amount of timeplayers could log onto the board when in station to see those available to them at any time they could check out the mission objectives rewards collateral and level rewards would not just depend on level and standing but also on the individual mission template travel length local missioneer activity etcwhen a player accepts a mission a short timer around half a minute is displayed during which a mission is tagged as under negotiation during that window other players can secretly enter an incrementally lower reward offer and accept the mission themselves the lowest offer when the timer runs out gets the mission and is immediately charged the collateral to reduce griefing this system avoids missions to be snatched up by the first to see them after spawning or disappearing while a player is still reading the descriptionmissions will have to be accomplished within a reasonable time frame less time than now and failure will have the price of the collateral and a standings penalty failed missions would instantly become available againan associated new skill missioneer would determine the amount of missions players could have active at any one time this further serves to reduce the likelihood of griefers just hogging all missions in a station but still allows dedicated missioneers to accept a number of compatible missions to fill up their cargo or save themselves multiple tripsthe conventional mission system would be retained albeit with reduced numbers of available agents and other modifications basically npc mission agents would offer tours of duty where players could sign up gaining an instant status increase to offer that corp their exclusive missioning service for a while players could only be signed up with one single npc corp at a time this obligation would be enforced for maybe a couple dozen successful missions before they are released players could however be dishonourably discharged at will or after a number of failed missions but at the cost of a massive loss of standingsthese missions would focus more on story so they would certainly include the current storyline missions as well as the factional epic missions pros players would be given choices and a chance to specialise in certain types of missions local mission supply would react to player activity missioneers would find an incentive to spread out and move from time to time there would be indirect player competition on at least two levels system security could easily be made to impact on mission rewards public missions events or even black marketillegal missions could easily be implemented bots would have a harder time missioning this would add incentive to visit low sec systems since initially heavily serviced high sec systems will dynamically lower rewards over time cons missioneers would be forced to continuously adapt and remain flexible for maximum profit current agent standings would lose importance so player investment would be lost would require careful balancing with conventional mission agent system some resources would need to be diverted to set this up and test it by ccp poor bots would have a harder timetldroffer missioneers a dynamic selection of missions to choose from instead of shoving them down their throats one by unwanted one also let player activity impact on mission running in various interesting ways offering some of the current missions on the mission board would unbalance this by them being unreasonably profitable due to rat drops this would could be avoided by modifying those mission rats to remain within the workriskreward ratio of other missions offered at that station at the players agent standingor it could be amended by implementing the dynamic missions concept previously picked up by the csm giving simple missions a small chance to even according to a players inmission choices escalate into something much bigger
everyone knows eve players dont shower
the main issue with ship spinning being removed was not that people only missed being able to spin their ships around the functionality that was missing was the ability to drag a ship out of the ships window into the hangar to activate that ship the ability to doubleclick in the hangar view to open the cargo bay and the ability to rightclick in the hangar view to open the drone bay corporate hangars etcthere was functionality there which was taken away in cq or the door views of the station interiorthe issue was not the removal of a solo play environment it was about the removal of functionality that players had enjoyed for years
mara most of the functionality that you speak of was never removed all those functions were still available by clicking on the ship icon in the ships menu as they remain today available by doing the same double clicking the ship icon replaced dragging it to the hangar to activate arguably easier by the waygo ahead and make yourself feel better by saying things that are completely baseless in facts known to every competent player of eve if blatant intellectual dishonesty works for you however this thread is about the fact that unintended solo play brings value to many eve paying subscribers and ccp had to recalibrate their usual heavy handed disregard for a solo pleasure they removed i am hopeful that ccp is a little better as an organization having learned a lesson that customer feedback can add value to their product i suspect if the complaints raised by most players had been as specious as the inaccurate after the fact rationalization you put forth a simple statement from ccp telling people all that functionality was still in the game  because we all had to use it until the hangar was restored would have been the only result and we would all still be looking at the door people missed ship spinning plain and simple that is not to say this was the only complaint voiced by eve subscribers but it was the one most frequently articulated by a significant margin in the chats i was a participant of in all of my several accounts the other gripe most frequently heard were i undocked in the wrong ship but i heard that nearly as often as i heard and still hear players saying they forgot their drones when warping out of a belt or forgot to load their cargo when going on a distribution mission i never undocked in the wrong ship because i pay attention an i do not resist change when it is presented just because i am used to doing things a certain way
tldri dont even get the point of this long winded wall of text much less what youre proposing to change ie why said lwwot is in the assembly hall
okay ill use smaller words and shorter sentences for your skill level  ccp listens to players good  ccp ignores players bad  solo players pay also ccp should be happy ccp make all paying players happy the end
is this one of those rants over nothing againbecause i fail to see what the hell hes talking aboutlet alone what hes aiming atsmall words my stop whiningif you got a major issue to get atthen get to the bloody point or please step off stop the evemail spam
you actually made your point less clear with thatlet me try using a sentence structure youll understandwtf are you whinging on about kthxbai
a mind is a terrible thing to waste  some people cant understand normal thinking
so because i did not cater to your short attention span i am the one whining lol
thats all you have to sayyour a terrible trollpleaseget to the pointor go awaybecasue this is a very poor whine thread stop the evemail spam
attention span aside i do believe what is being asked is just get to the point and quit rambling it muddles the point you are trying to makekind of like thispointis this what you are asking
i believe my name was uttered in this thread repeatedly1 out of principle
i endorse all forms of solo pleasure in the captains quarters and look forward to reading many stories about them
the functionality that was removed in point form for people reading with their eyes closed the ability to doubleclick the background of the station environment to open the ships cargo bay the ability to make a ship active by simply dragging it out into the background of the station environment the ability to access the ships special features by rightclicking on the background of the station environment no the functions were not available when they were removedheres an experiment for you fill your hangar with a hundred ships and three piles of ammo  one small one medium one large activate your frigate now head out and shoot stuff in your frigate head back to station and load your frigate with ammo if you are lucky your frigate will be at the beginning or the end of the list of ships in the hangar otherwise the easiest way to access the cargo bay of your frigate is to doubleclick on the backgroundheres another experiment for you get into combat and have your ship blown up you are excited you can simulate the level of excitement and its impact on your physiology by injecting a few ml of adrenaline and caffeine are your hands shaking now good youve been podded but you want to get those bastards who podded you so head into the hangar and try rightclicking the ship you want to fly and picking make active hrm having trouble did you accidentally hit repackage or trash item instead wouldnt it be much faster to simply drag that ship out onto the background yes in fact for people who dont have shaky hands its still faster rather than having to use fine motor skills youre only using coarse motor skills and on top of that you dont have to right click then click UFFFD just click and drag UFFFD so there is one less action to be performedyou could avail yourself of the trove of facts known to the competent players of eve before making statements about how baseless my arguments are your intellectual selfdeceit is only equalled by your onanistic argument
just for the sake of argument what forms of solo play are ccp removing from your repertoire
were the op drawn towards civilised discussion i believe he would answer that having pandered to the apparent demands of my ilk in one instance ship spinning being a opportunity to solo play it seems ccp should consequently reconsider their stated disregard for solo players and introduce further exclusive features for playing solo while i neither share to ops interpretation on ccps motivations nor his tone i certainly sympathise with the general direction of his demands
 need for more topography within null sec need for more content customization and progression within null sec need for more resources that can be attacked that will also generate conflict need for more pve and pvp diversity within null secproposal remove sovereignty bills and replace them with a new resource that powers all sovereignty upgrades and structures limit the total amount of the resource that is available within the universe in a manner that will balance the resourceUFFFDs scarcity so that while alliances will have to watch their stores they will not be losing their sovereignty every other dayback story certain stars shed inordinate amounts of their mass via ejection or solar wind these stars are rare and vary in their outputs structures were constructed on these stars that would harvest hydrogen from the solar wind these structures were akin to giant ram scoops once they have collected the hydrogen they then refine it to usable concentrations some of the hydrogen is used along with energy generated from the sun to generate large quantities of antimatter hydrogen and antimatter were then packaged together into removable charges that could be transported to other structures that needed power these giant factories are still in operation within high security and low security space however they have fallen into disrepair in null security spaceantimatter fuel cells these are the fuel cells created by the stations in low orbit around the sun they cannot be stored for longer than 2 hours in anything other than a sovereignty structure using them the production facilities in which they are created or an auxiliary storage unit they destroy themselves after two hours they are large enough that only a handful of them at maximum can be crammed into the largest industrials each one can power a sovereignty structure for a given unit of time they deplete faster as you install more upgradesservicesproduction facility online you must install and online a command and control unit to online the facility this unit might take the same amount of time to online as a small pos module the facility begins producing annihilation batteries as soon as this structure is online the command and control module is immune to attack as long as the ihub within the system is also immune it may be attacked when after the system has been conquered once the system is conquered the command and control module may be destroyed and replaced any fuel cells stored within the facility will be saved as long as a new command and control module is onlined within 24 hours of the destruction of the previous oneproduction facility upgrades fuel cell storage modules increase the number of fuel cells that you can store duh hypothetical numbers you could install a max of 5 modules that double your storage capacity heat dissipation modules increase the production facilityUFFFDs manufacturing rate so that you produce more fuel cells in a given 24 hour period hypothetical numbers 6 modules that represent 10 of total production each all of these modules may be attacked at any time their destruction would mean the immediate loss of storage capacity and destruction of fuel cells or the loss of production rate if they are destroyed then a repair order must be given from the command and control module in order to prepare for the installation of new modules this could possibly use other resources and should take at least 24 hours there is also the possibility of limiting the number of repair jobs that a command and control module can perform at any one time this would mean that 3 destroyed modules would require a cumulative 72 hours for all of them to be back online these modules are immune to all forms of electronic warfare they have a signature radius equivalent to a cruiser they orbit around the stations axis that is perpendicular to the sunUFFFDs surface this gives them a nonzero angular velocity they have a physical radius that precludes the use of fighters or fighter bombers upon them their ehp should be balanced so that a moderate sized gang would have the ability to destroy a small number of them within 10 to 20 minutes but that a larger gang would be necessary to destroy all of them within a reasonable amount of time attacking these modules would generate a warning mail to the owning alliance there could be a potential delay addedreinforcement the production facility could be given the ability to reinforce itself once every 24 hours for a maximum of 8 hours during this period all of the modules would be invulnerable to attack and the facility would burn strontium there would be a variance timer on the reinforcement mode of  36 hours the owning alliance would set the schedule for reinforcement mode
alternate sources of fuel cells these would most likely be necessary in order to allow new groups to begin their conquest of null sec wormholes anchor structures that produce very low amounts of fuel cells concord lp stores very limited amounts of cells from concord via lp and a sizeable isk portion theft from other alliances or npc structures in low security or null security space see belowother options and possibilities auxiliary storage unit that could be anchored at a moon but it would burn fuel cells to use these could be attacked and destroyed at any time resulting in a total loss of their contents we could also explore the possibility of being able to move these storage units from moon to moon or system to system with some sort of cool down player outposts could burn fuel cells the more services you have the more they burn jump bridges could burn fuel cells fuel cells could be stolen from storage units or the production facility i have not thought out a way to do this but it would be nice if it used hacking and was limited and controlled somehow it might be necessary to increase the amount of time fuel cells can be unplugged in order to foster their theft wormhole jam UFFFD could be a structure that you anchor at a wormhole it burns fuel cells it also keeps the wormhole open far beyond its mass and time limits

i enjoy flying stealth bomberssometimes i find myself forced to drop bombs even if i dont have a warp out and end up dead its ok but sometimes i just end up on grid because a fleet member got too close or i hit a can its awful when you loose a bomber like that i would pretty much like it if i were able to drop a bomb that simply acts like an instant jump beacon for my bomber on impact thus moving my bomber out of harms way say 40 km from the launch spot i believe 10 000 ms is an optimal speed for that bomb the bomb would be a t2 and require a t2 bomb launcer of course being able to switch bombs while cloaked would be a nice bonus new ever wanted to turn your stealth bomber into a bomb gents and gals i give you the suicide bomb you jump in the blob and you hurt it might be an expensive hit but youre not going down solo id like to see feedback from as many of you capsuleers with proposals for other helpful bombs and may the csm take this to the devsspin safe
huh why
your doing it wrong matenot supporting stop the evemail spam
dec shield says it can cost quite a bit but it doesnt matter whether it costs 2 isk or 2 billion the point remains i spent money on the ability to wage war for a set amount of time they are able to shrug it off before that time has expired you cant tell me thats working as intended it may be tolerated as functioning but thats all
tolerated as functioning from both sides of the equationhow do you find a system that works for people who dont want to pvp without simply making them immune to pvp just face the fact that if the target doesnt want to participate you have to resort to suicide ganking
u mad bro
thats fine i will accept that i cannot evade a wardec you paid for as long as my corporation or alliance can pay an equal amount of money to concord to end the wardec whenever we wantthere now were both paying the same amount of iskor are you going to tell me your isk is better than mine

i propose that damage inflicted by a smartbomb deactivate the cloaking devicesreasons why i think this behavior should existingame alerts currently say that cloaking devices become deactivated due to proximity to objects in space i would assume this is due to some kind of disruption of the light bending of the cloaking device due to gravimetric or electromagnetic disruption of the cloaking field around the ship i dont see why a pulse from a smartbomb wouldnt do something similiari also really like the parallel this would create to wwii destroyers performing submarine hunting activities you could have a heavy interdictor with its bubble up cruising around an area suspected of housing a cloaked ship pulsing smartbombs just like destroyers dropping depth chargesanyway i think cloaked ships have enough advantages in their favor and being able to take damage and remained cloaked seems broken to me
the odds of a smart bomb hitting a cloaked ship are just as astronomical as you ramming into oneyour better off using drones oribiting your ship tbqhwaste of time to make this request in all honestynot supportingnote damage doesnt decloak a shipbut an object within 2500m willthis alone is more than enough to decloak a ship smartbomb ranges are not taht spectacular as it is stop the evemail spam
i suggest you place a description aka catchy name for your proposal in the thread title  chances are hardly anyone will notice it otherwise
yet another cloak crybaby if you dont like people cloaking get out of nullsec and grow a pair
actually our interceptor pilots do quite well at catching even fastmoving covert ops ships on jumpin an extra 500m detection zone around the ship would probably increase our success rate a battleship gang spread out around the gate would probably have even better luck with double the normal decloak zonein any case im opposed to the idea
moreover mittani if you go back to your humble beginnings you will understand what is happening herewith a couple of slight changes i am a person that enjoys helping new pilots and intensifying null sec activityyou might want to review your busy bees they have been very very busy
check your own corps and you will have a glance
i am curious as to how you think this will work outi would like to give my views on what will happenif you manage to create a big enough alliance you get wardecced not by anyone in nullsec but by hisec greifers and hisec pirateswhat are your views on thisi would see a largely industry focused alliance as a hisec war deccers wet dream
ohhhh buuuurn
thats part of the idea however its a long journey and the strategy is quite complexwhat i do understand is that big griefing alliances will help to keep this feasiblethe mistakes and internal problems that i know from first hand will generate a crossroad dust514 will be crucialif u want to join contact me
id actually like to see this happen purely for the entertainment value that being said lo  null sec need a little shaking up putting a new big boy on the block im neither here nor thei in the fight but i like rooting for the underdog it makes for good reading nice job on the video

this isnt really that important in the grand scheme of things but its one of those little consistency issues that can be fixed easily  i think you pointed out the mythological background of the talos name in the shiptroduction and the rest of the names are mostly based on greek mythology as i posted in another forum erebus husband and brother of nyx parents of moros thanatos and the oneiroi among others eris the goddess of discord sometimes equated with the war goddess enyo described as a companion or possible sister to ares god of war etc  so why is the charon a caldari freighter because it looks sorta like a ferryrename the obelisk into the charon and give the caldari freighter some suitably birdinspired name  albatross i dunno  or at least rename the caldari one as i doubt they would want to mimic the gallente in any way  rename the rhea too while were at it although the anshar is at least based in mesopotamian mythology just one of those annoying little things back to your regularly scheduled important spaceships business
you know that our people the gallente and the caldari were once one people right
hmm he has a pointand ill point out that gallente arent just greek mythos theres also a decent bit of mesopotamian influence and some babylonian and roman too iirc the point still stands though i highly doubt itll end up getting changed since ccp isnt locked into any mythological trends they just tend to use them swapping the names of two ships would confuse a lot of people who know little to nothing about mythology and dont carenote while rhea is the name of a titaness in greek mythology it is also the name of a bird so there is less reason to change its name
based on this alonei dont think its really going to be that big of a deal stop the evemailUFFFDspam

what to do in eve online pay special attention to exploration you could look at joining red vs blue the war is perpetual and static it sounds to me to be an ideal situation for the casual gamer interested in pvpas far as incursions go you could be auto piloting to the new incursion constellation while you are busy doing other things eg showering or putting kids to bedimportantly dont grind for isk if you are timepoor consider buying isk with plex or look for activities that dont require a significant isk investment eg rvb in t1 frigates only

problems need for more content customization and progression within null sec need for more resources that can be attacked that will also generate conflict need for more pve and pvp diversity within null secsummarydominion features had initially included talk concerning the addition of agents to null security space through upgrades installed by player entities within territory that they controlled but this did not happen due to technical difficulties that would have been involved in implementation could we examine the feasibility of spawning mission agents in ships in space and utilizing the system for spawning anomalies and complexes to spawn mission sites for these agents this system would add to the topography of null security space it would create more interesting and varied pve content that could possibly draw players into null security space it would create flash points for short term conflicts ranging from small scale to large scale if possible the addition of another separate but viable lp store within the game would act as another isk sinkthese agents would be added as a secondary index to the military index is filled by completing missions for these agents the initial agent is allowed after reaching a specific point on the military index in addition to this the destruction of these agents by players would decrease your alliances index rating if the rating drops too low then agents that require that level or above in order to operate will cease operations within your territory alliance members will lose access to the missions and lp stores provided by the lost agents until the index is raised againthe nitty gritty i have attempted to outline some ideas of how these agents should function i have attempted to address the problems that i could foresee ie time zone warfare game balance gerrymanderingagent features creation of a secondary index for the military index that allows the alliance to import agents into their space index has 5 levels and allows access to more valuable agents as it increases tier 1 agents are allowed at the first level and tier 5 agents are allowed when the index is at level 5 agents are part of splinter corporations aligned with the various pirate and outlaw factions negative reputation with the agentUFFFDs parent faction will not block an allianceplayer from interacting with them performing story line missions will result in a small increase with the agentUFFFDs parent faction performing missions with the agent will cause the playersalliances reputation to shift relative to the other tier agents splinter corporations alliances are allowed a maximum of 5 tier 1 agents 4 tier 2 agents 3 tier 3 agents 2 tier 4 agents and 1 tier 5 agent within a region agents are distributed randomly within the region they are assigned to after downtime more than 1 agent may not be placed within a single system agents must have a minimum amount of space between them and another agent ie 0 jumps between tier 1 agents 1 jump between tier 2 agentsUFFFDUFFFD and 4 jumps between tier 5 agents alliances must control a minimum amount of space in order to gain access to the various tiers of agents ie 1 system for tier 1 agents 3 systems for tier 2 5 systems for tier 3UFFFD and 10 systems for tier 5 alliances may designate a time period in which the agents are active the minimum duration is 16 hours agents will enter space at their designated time  3 hours only 1 tier 5 agent is allowed per region and the alliance that has control over the most space  and has at least 20 of the region will be able to enlist its services only 4 tier 4 agents are allowed per region the alliance that controls the most space and has at least 20 of the region will be able to enlist the services of 2 of these tier 4 agents the remaining 2 tier 4 agents will be split between the next 2 sovereignty holding entities that control the 2nd and 3rd highest amount of space and at least 20 of the region agents may be attacked and killed if they are killed then the owning alliance loses a specified amount of rep from their index if the index drops below the necessary level for an agent then those agents will not spawn again until the index is raised back to the required level higher tier agents will be harder to kill but will result in a greater hit to the index ex tier 1 agent with support could be balanced for a 510 man pvp gang and a tier 5 agent could be balanced for 3040 man pvp gangs all agents should use enhanced aiUFFFDs agents should generate some sort of warning message when under attack agents will be blue to the alliance that sponsors them and possibly to the blues of that alliance all other players will be red and will be fired upon
mission features missions should be balanced for multiple participants and geared towards pvp fit ships if possible tier 1 missions could be balanced for 23 players tier 2 missions 35 players tier 3 missions 510 players tier 4 missions 1015 players and tier 5 missions 1520 players mission rats should utilize enhanced aiUFFFDs mission rewards should utilize a reward system with a built in diminishing returns system ie such as the one detailed for incursion that gives increasing rewards to players until they exceed the designed capacity of a given mission higher tier missions should require players to roam farther in order to complete them all missions will occur within the region they are assigned to and within the sovereignty of the alliance that has summoned them tier agents may periodically offer missions to players that require them to hunt and kill their competition that is working for other alliances hi security agents aligned with the empires ie republic fleet may offer missions to mission runners that require them to go an kill tier agents within null security spacemission rewards and lp store develop an lp store that is separate from current lp markets develop items that do not imbalance current pvp mechanics but that are desirable to players balance the isk rewards so that they are competitive with null security anomalies offset isk faucet of bounties with lp isk sink possible lp store items may include pirate faction drones possibly up to and including fighters and fighter bombers pirate faction combat drugs with increased side effects as well as buffs pirate faction implants side effects and increased or new buffs and pirate faction capital turrets faction drones and modules could increase certain stats at the expense of others in order to decrease the chance of upsetting the current balance present within the game tier agents would have access to limited amounts of items higher tier agents would have access to larger quantities of items each tier of agents would have a separate lp store list bigger and better items would be available from higher tier agents the loss of these agents would deprive alliance members the ability to purchase them until the agent is restored items are purchased at the agent in space they could either delivered in space in a cargo container or to the nearest station
burn your bra lol
too many other broken mechanics in eve prevent fixing thishow this for an easy solution each ganglinks blows up your sigrad 1 will turn a cruiser into a bc 2 will turn it into a bs 3 will turn it into a carrier etc6 links your a freaking titan as far as scanning downcombine that with blocking activation of ganklink mods inside pos shields and oops now bored scouts have something to do while the fight goes onyour scouts are fit with probe launchers right that is a pretty basic piece of gear for a scout to have along with a point and a cyno if you have hotdrop capabilitiesthis would also result in gank boosting being a bit more active because you have to balance your boosts against playing tag with the enemy scout and the scout gets tos to play tag with the traps even pulls extra people off grid in a large blob fight
not supported the only change needed is to make them not work from inside pos shields oh and make the t2 gang links exclusive to actual command ships instead of the jack of all trades t3 making a specialized ship class utterly redundant
i agree that the risks are minimal i agree that needs to changei dont agree with your solution putting them on grid is only going to add incentive to people in general to bring more ships to protect those assets increasing blob warfareganglinks already cannot be used while warping all that really needs to change is making them unusable from inside a pos shield  now if they are in use they are uncloaked stationary and vulnerablewhat else do you need aside from a change in tactics to deal with them
it takes way too much effort to kill offgrid gang booster compared to huge combat stat gain you get from gang boosters there would be much less problems if booster would have to be on same grid even though you could still use long distance spots to gain relative safetyjust putting booster outside pos forcefield has minimal effect on this it is obvious that previous poster only thinks 1001 man fleets where you can have dedicated probers bubblers tacklers and several gang boosters and there booster balance has very little meaning since everyone has them anyhow you cant just ask people to have max skill prober with 1 bil implants just to try killing gang booster thats assuming it sits still without changing ss while someone probes it out foreverproblems arise when you go roaming with small gang against bigger force of noobs like irc where they have gang booster sitting in every system or when some solopvp guy is owning people with gang link boat neutral rr ecm alt and pwnmobile also tech 3 gang boosters are too good compared to command ships which should be better at boosting anyway isk shouldnt make difference cos it has very little meaning in mmo tech 3 can have cov ops cloak and nullifier they alone are enough to make it better even if bonuses wouldnt be so good compared to command shipdurr
if it was it would then have more then current 15 mill skill points 
issuerespawning belts just donUFFFDt make sense from a rp or antibot perspective remove them from the game and spawn random small ice and ore gravimetric sites instead criteriait is critical that these mining sites in empire be accessible from the system scanner and not probes to ensure mining remains UFFFDnewplayerUFFFD friendly these sites should be small enough to last 30 minutes or so 40000 m3 in a hulk before running out of ore also a site despawn time of 3 to 4 hours should be set to ensure that fresh sites are always availablelow seclow sec should have full access to the high end ores and ice currently found only in null sec they should also offer increasing quantities of ore to facilitate large group mining ops everyone knows that no one bothers mining in low sec because the ore value is trivial low sec is every bit if not more dangerous than null sec the rewards should reflect thisnull seclow and null sec mining sites should require scan probes to find to reflect their difficulty and value without this mechanic low sec roams would consist of jumping into a system hitting scan and then warping in on a UFFFDhelplessUFFFD mining op with probes the miners can at least have a fighting chance with the directional scan and local
new players are given the astrometrics skill a probe launcher and a bunch of core scanner probes as part of the tutorials there is no reason to move belts to anomalies just go wholehog into grav sites moving to grav sites for asteroids and ice will also open the opportunity for new pilots to contribute to advanced mining fleets the new pilot scans down new grav sites scans the asteroids and reports to the fleet where the juicier sites are located no need to train up for months to fly a hulk with t2 mining equipment
i like the sound of that it would also slow down 00 rat botsi thinki like the sound of that too i have cced your ideas to a similar post on assembly hall
what exactly is the value of a nullsec mining site if lowsec sites contain the same ores and ice
i agree that all belts should be gravimetric sites but the lowest quality of these sites should be anomalies this is for new players so that they can mine in a single ship without the need for a probe launcher these sites should only appear in hisec each system gains an oredensity statistic which governs the probability of sites forming a combination of security and governing nation for hisec should decide what is in the fields the size of field should be dependant solely on oredensity nullsec ores should be available in very limited quantity in lowsec however they will be displaced away from planets and require decent scanning skills to narrow down
why cant the new players probe down a site in their exploration ship then mine it out in their mining shipnullsec ores should be in null sec id like to see ores more restricted by security status such that pyroxeres and plagioclase were only available in 05 and 06 for example veldspar would be the only ore that is universally available simply due to the vast quantities of tritanium required for ship building and because veldspar is holyif ores are too widely available they become worthless
nice one opi like this idea of bounties being payed out by concord based on the value of the shipim not sure how well the bounty system itself would cope if this was introduced by this i mean quite a few bounties will be placed on hisec griefers so the only real way to collect is to sucide gank them or shudders try and war dec thembut i guess you could leave that problem for the future and concentrate on solving the current onetldra very good idea i want to see more discussion and debate
someone places a 625mil bounty on vile ratvile rat buys a hurricane from a buy order in verge vendor for 20milvile platinum insures that hurricane for 23mil at a cost of 7milvile has now spent 27milvile undocks and shoots himself with his alt the mittani the current jita index price used in determining bounty payout on a hurricane is 25milmittens recieves the 625mil for the bounty 25mil 25mittens recieves the insurance payout of 23mil vile placed on the shipmittens has now recieved 2925mil 2925mil270mil 225mil in profit for vile the problem with things that try and price ships and modules is that they rely on homogenized prices or are locationcentric as we all know there can be wild price differences region to region especially when you can buy things from evacing corpssuch a system also relys upon relative stagnation in prices you might be able to mitigate this to an extent on humdrum items but contract items like deadspace and faction if you bought a gistiib ssb 2 years ago it is now valued at 23x the amount you paid for it moving it in my case isnt worth the time trasporting it to a hub but if it meant i could collect a profit from a bounty by merely jump cloning you see where i am goingis the amount that can be gained significant probably not is there still profit yescan i haz 100m now
not sure what the insurance value of a hurricane is i dont have one handy but in this case the profit was realized when rat bought a 23m base value ship for 20m he effectively profited 3m on the purchasei believe insurance values are derived from the base value of the typeid not the market i also intended for bounties to be paid on this same value sorry that wasnt clear the bounty value on the ship in question is 23m25575mplat insurance costs 30 of the base value of the ship so the policy costs 69mat base price the profit loss for vile ratthe mittani is baseprice23minsurancepayout23mpolicycost69mbounty575m115m minus the opportunity costs of setting himself and his alt up to do it if he got the hurricane at a discount then he nets 185m on the scheme minus the additional opportunity cost of shipping the thing in from verge vendor but the profit is still predicated on someone selling below base value not the altkilling even then he might have just flippedrefined it right way and realized a greater profiti agree that insurance is really the big problem in the system however i still want trebors money
how about you let pend take the stance that a bounty increases their risk and thus have them reduce the base ship value the insurance payout is calculated from by the part of the shipss value the bounty hunter is to receive if we let pend handle bounties theyd be in a good position to do just thatalso im not sure the insurance should go to the bounty hunter too much impact on newish players that are frivolously bountied in relation to those that arent i still think insurance should take into account insured players sec status and ship loss history when calculating insurance premium and possibly refuse payout for concordinvolved kills
insurance is a whole other ball of fish guts previously i thought it would make sense to give ship insurance to the hunters but that does nothing to players killing themselves with alts in order to void the bounty so theres no reason to do that im not quite willing to jump into the horror of the insurance system yet but at 25 of ship value an altkill loses a little instead of losing a lot voiding all insurance on a wanted player unfairly penalizes poorer players applying insurance to the remaining bounty as i think was what vr had put forth takes more money out of the game but it trivializes the intent of the players who placed the bountyrather than try and fix two incredibly broken systems at once im in favor of using a 25 shipblowerupper value to mitigate insurance exploits and pray that someone looks at the insurance system as a whole if thats not sufficient then you can always lower the shipblowerupper percentage or even do away with it but id like to keep some sort of incentive to go after a ship even if the pod is likely to get awayas for concord they dont get a share of the bounty consider these situations1 a player jumps into jan and two bountied pilots jump him in battleships triggering the gate guns as expected the target is in a plated baitship and scrams the attackers instead of trying to slowboat out and his friends warp in and take down the wanted pilots they should get their share of the bounties even though the gate guns aggressed the attackers2 a hulk pilot with his drones out gets targeted by bountied gankers he loses his ship but his drones attack the gankships before concord destroys them he should get the bounties piddly as they might be i can imagine a bunch of frigs trolling around trying to slap on a sensor damp to leech some of the money leading to more hilarious escalationsif you mean that players get no insurance when concord is on their killmail i think that makes sense but its out of scope for this proposal a complex set of calculations to determine insurance rates ehh maybe it makes sense but it also discourages explosions which is one of the benefits of insurance personally id like to see all insurance pay out less for everyone no matter what but again out of scope
 moan  moan okay ive paid you off of course if something like this system does get implemented i will put a price on your head
if that dinosaur of a system ever gets improved ill gladly be bountiedot best wallet comment evar
ill start by saying im a big fan of the general idea but when i read the original post i was a little unhappy with assigning arbitrary value to implants and using them as part of the bounty then again i wasnt happy when dropped mods and implants appeared on killmails on second read im really uncomfortable with the whole assigning arbitrary value to player produced items especially things like faction modsand the insurance thing is just a  attempt to squeeze a controversial idea in on the back of a popular one
i did and i agree about the scope best get this implemented as suggested for now and fix insurance later to make it even better though it still grates badly that the bountied players will be able to get rid of the bounty at much lower cost than that of the guy who set up the bounty
players dont produce faction mods all the base values are indexed by typeid in the system based on mineral value for t1 stuff and probably for t2 stuff as badly as they insure im not sure about how the base value of implants is indexed i abstracted values based on isklp cost in corp lp storesdeleted the note about insurance in the original post since i missed it before which insurance idea do you hate i think insurance in general is crappy all around but its not within the scope of a bounty fix
yeah im a bit rusty on the exact mechanics but i know this im just very wary of anything which tries to apply a monetary value to a kill because it tends to result in people losing concern for any other value the kill might have see almost all killboards ever not to mention the cost of a ship is only tenuously related to its combat ability i guess id be happier with a system that paid out based on clone and hull baseprice only because we already have absolute values for those things in game alreadyas an afterthought if im paid out based on the market cost of the mods on my ship whats to stop me buying all of something rare but cheap say t2 micro smartbombs relisting at outrageous prices then having an alt kill me with a full rack on my shipmy language was probably a bit confrontational but my point was basically the same as yours bounties are a tiny part of the game and almost universally considered broken insurance spans almost all of it people in this forum have a habit of trying to shoehorn their pet terrible idea into an otherwise good one by invoking the spectre of the current bogeyman be it bots or goons or whatever and it makes me really irationally angry this idea stands on its own merit without needing to make extra concessions because a bunch of people have had their mining barges exploded recently
killboard whoring is definitely annoying btw killboards do have the ability to periodically poll evecentral to get market averages for their kills making a dead dramiels whoring value closer to what youd pay for it than the crappy basevalue afaik modules do have a basevalue and its usually way under market i want to include some factor of the destroyed modules since theyre usually worth more than the hull unless its a suicide boat or somesuchi dont want the market value to enter into it since that can be easily manipulated if you get exploded and a bunch of oxytopes go up with you the oxytope bounty contribution is base value not panicmarket price you would only profit if you bought a bunch of ships below cost as per zircons post i might check tutorial systems for this as i know i dumped a bunch of free ships just to get rid of them after fixing my standings i think most things in eve have a base value if they dont easy enough to fix or just ignore them in the calculationbounties are fairly tiny but imo they were set up sort of slapdash a copy of the uo bounty system and never fixed enough people seem to want to be bounty hunters that it makes sense to address it id like to see it be a reasonable pursuitinsurance is fundamentally broken though people dont seem to agree on what its there for 1 to help you get on your feet when you explode or 2 to encourage explosions by softening the loss for a cheap t1 gankboat the percentagebased payout is higher than a typical rifter and much higher than a t2fitted paper mackinaw so i can see a valid concern over the mechanics but as soon as someone says goonicethe mittaniih8ucsm the argument trails into trolololotalternately maybe a curved insurance value for ships can be introduced so that the value of it decreases as ship value increases newbies roaming pirate rifters and tacklers get the best value as theyre more likely to die a lot and need the isk more while bcs and bss get less since you should probably be better at risk management by the time you jump into one yeah dictors and t2 logiew die a lot too but they should be getting ship reimbursement and free exotic dancers from their corps for the roles they play in fleetthats probably a different thread thoughlong poasting no sreeping
gah double post
according to one of my alliance mates ccp gm has confirmed that it is a ban able offense to can flipbait in rookie systems now im not disagreeing with this rule but being this rule is not listed under the tos i didnt check the eula but id be very surprised if it was in there i think that is very problematic if you are going to ban someone for it then it should be clearly listed on the tos it is listed at
now im not saying this is a good habit to develop butthe average eve gamer is going to be either a caucasian or black male between the ages of 1435 and the average male of that age group is 4 minutesthe average tos or eula is about 390 pages long lolin summary i can guarantee less than 1 of all people who play eve have actvively gone in and read the tos and eula since at last haf of them probably didn read the contract for their new car before tey signed it and now have 400 years of debtthe wiki for everything is where people usually go to learn everything about that which they need to wiki
the tos is only about 15 pages long and is full of guess what things you can get banned for it only takes 12 sentences to say something about this and a link to either or both of those wiki documents im sure most players dont read the tos thats not my concern nor my reason for posting this however almost everytime someone wants to know if they can be banned for something they are going to go to the tos and possibly the eula but not the wiki i never said remove the info from the wiki but i am saying add a sentence to the tos
ive got a better idea if said players dont mess with extremely young players who they know dont know any better theyll have no issues at all ccp shouldnt have to warn people not to be an ass and grief noobs
its a valid point put it in the tos and all bases are covered properly there is no legal requirement to read the wiki however you are expected even if you do not to have read the tos
im not going to get many likes for this and probably a lot of flame but i need to get this outassembly hall as a subforum originally had a clear purpose a place to present both issues and proposals to the public have them garner support from our peers and thus bring them to the attention of the csm in the hopes of getting it on their list of things they will talk about at the next summitit is not the place to ask for feedback on a vague idea you just had we have the id subforum for thatit is not the place for rants neither is it the place to chat upslander your favourite cms member we have the jpc subforum for that it is not the place for general discussion on this aspect or that guess which subforum that should go intoit is also not the place to shove our intellectual superiority in anyones face that has a different opinion from ours we dont really have a subforum dedicated to that thoughyet i find the assembly hall to be hardly moderated proposals with no sensible title and just a short oneliner inside remain in the hall next to prolonged personal feuds this way i think the hall has become an intransparent mess that cannot properly serve its purpose anymore i believe action is required such as either strict moderation possibly by the csm themselves education on how to properly peruse the subforum or both of themis this just an issue to me
you forgot its not a place to discuss out of game issues such as payment optionsissues as csm has absolutely no control over thisthis is strictly eve online  ingamebut i agreesupported for stronger moderationps yes im sure ive been guilty of the above but im not the type to roll over and take it in the ass stop the evemail spam

hello i would like to support the case extra fees to nexon are not just annoying its ripoff of japanese community nexon does nothing to contribute to the game will not host it or anything but still demand extra fees for what translation and site dear ccp please withdraw or rethink your alliance with nexon if you wanted japanese translation i am 200 sure u could get one for free from community putting nexons history aside i as an international player dont want a another company to mess up with my game i am not japanese but ill fight for them because stupid policy like that can anytime land on my own region so i and i think all of us have to fight before its too late ccp and stellar council  vote for japan keep prices and support equal regarding of location and keep entire community together
there should be alternatives for playing from anywhere being forced to deal with third party is bad form
this entire proposal is complete and utter ignoranceyour throwing a damn fit over an another company who issues said fees and not ccpfor all you know ccp had no choice in the matter simply bsaed on japanese lawbut keep wailing away at your wailing thread you wont get anywhereyoull be screaming regardless of the outcomeagaintake it to nexondont waste your time with ccpi would have thought it would be obvious that if it was simple enough to make it available to any payment option eve online would already be there stop the evemail spam
by all means let nexon be an alternative way of keeping ones subscription active  but it should in no way be the only option we eurosyanksaussiesetc would be royally pissed if ccp suddenly partnered with steam eas origin crap or some other knowntobegreedy company that just happened to have advertising muscle and decreed that all payments must go through them  just so that ccp could get marketing campaign at a discount
in the world of eve it is very irrational that only the player of living in japan must charge nexon i think that the choice of fee collection should not be unified for those who are enjoying U304BU308F eve by the skill system to eve at some of play time to be sure the community of japan desires an increase in new players nexon point is not necessarily wanted in order that the member of nexon may sign eve a usingnexon point question is not felt i oppose to the fee collection method of making the existing player forcing into nexon point strongly nexon does not involve to the fee collection in plex i am not necessarily doing eve in order to obtain plex if it continues charging by plex i must be devoted only to the work which pushes down npc as a missions runner probably only those who need nexon should charge nexon i do not need nexon at all
point takenbut no one said you had to use itthis is no different then me choosing not to use paypal when they charge an arm and a leg for overdraft feesor a bankor any other bloody ccshall we scream at ccp for bank feesyeswe shouldnt force anyone to pay by 1 waybut thats due to the available options when it coms to transactionsnot because ccp is being a jerk stop the evemail spam
the contrary is not carried out to tying up with nexon as a means which increases a japanese player it is not allowed to provide nexon with a japanese player as a means to tie up with nexon it is a fact that many japanese players have distrust to nexon many japanese players trust ccp what kind of obstacle does paying directly ccp have if ccp provides nexon with a japanese player many excellent players will be resigned ccp should give the freedom of fee collection selection to a japanese player
thank you  people  which gave the opinion  the situation of the japanese player should just be transmitted well i hope the help of other players is obtained in order that a community of japan may enable it to acquire the freedom of fee collection selection please do not deprive japan of the existing fee collection method
will prevent the embarrassing i just beat my own buy order situation from cropping up again1
1 yes supported
war decks should last a week or two then end and have a cooldown of a week before any new ones can be started up again to prevent the constant wars you can bribe concord to look the other way for a while but not forever
also one more thing id like to see changed all these people who want ccp sanctioned arenasif you want a tournament set it up simple its not hard to secure a single nullsec system against small groups of griefers if you have a little organization and some isk to spend want ladders write up a website i am paying 4 bux a month for some pretty good hosting and its robust enough to run a killboard forum and flash arcade off ofdont ask ccp to make things for us that we can make for ourselves the fact that there are no arenas in eve is testament to the fact that no one really wants them because it would be cake to set them up yourself if people didif you think people do want them then organize a tournament
something high sec needs is something to fight over most of the war or suicide gank pvp in high sec tends to be of the big fish eating little fish variety for no other reason than because we can and for the lolz this sort of thing lacks contextual value its meaningless pvp violence for the sake of violence at times jokingly justified by profit motive people in high sec need a real reason to fight and the fights despite the gankbear whiners need to be perceived as faironce upon a time people in high sec would fight over npc trade goodsroutes there used to be fights over mining and who cleared the belts there used to be fights about who was going to live in this system or that there were fights because of can art believe it or notthe other aspect is fights need to seem fair no small corp is going to reasonably stand up to a corp twice its age and size with neutral repping alts it devolves into smack talk in local while one side or the other stays docked weeto the first issue stuff to fight over a few ideasmining rights  perhaps the npc corp who has sov over a system sells mining rights to each of the asteroid belts in an auction only the owning corp can mine there at full yield anyone else in that belt will mine at 25 yield a corp can war dec another corp with the goal of forcing a change of ownership make these leases something that can be sold via contracts and traded in the trade window it gives corps something to fight over and gives those npc corp mining bots a kick in the teethmaybe dust and planets can have an impact here too but will not speculate since ccp has hinted they may introduce player owned customs offices to high sec one daystation rights  perhaps allow a corp to buy a partnership with a station that one corp gets a 50 discount on all npc taxes and fees at that station only one corp may own this partnership at a time this thing can be traded on contracts let corps fight over itthe basic idea with these sort of thing is create some scarcity not on a macro scale but in the microscalefor the fair fight this is a difficult balancing act but perhaps some method of allowing a war dec to be declared as frig only or up to t1 cruisers only depending on some metric that is measured perhaps total spplayer ratio of a corp determines up to what types of ships can be used i know it sounds goofy and antisandbox in some ways but perhaps if small newish corps are not scared to death of war they might have some fun with itperhaps only corps that are in the same spplayerage ranges can war dec one anotheraggress in high secmy goal here is not protect carebears but to give them reasons to fight and give them a reasonable chance of being successful at itnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt

1i support rethinking the mission systemi support choice inof missionsdonUFFFDt support the idea that a new mission system should attempt to make things harder on bots iUFFFDm not a botter just donUFFFDt want to see them be the central focu
generally a good idea however i would suggest that the whole undercutting people for the rewards is not a good ideai would prefer a system where say each mission is available for acceptance for a short period of time 1020mins anyone who accepts it in that time gets it after that period the available mission is replaced by a new one therefore the missions could remain dynamic to the systems but the possibility of losing out to 001 mission iskers is removed
thanks for your supportlet me elaborate on why i chose to come up with the undercutting option though there will be players lurking in stations waiting for rare desirable missions to spawn and jump on them as soon as they appear they might even use bots to make sure they get the mission first undercutting would give more players a chance to get those missions bids would be placed secretly and the winner only be revealed at the end of the short time frame for undercutting a 001 bidding war seems to be impossible that way only bidders that can cover the collateral would be considered collateral and limit on maximum amount of accepted missions as well as pentalty for failedaborted missions would make griefing unlikely a simple layer of player vs player competition would be introduced to missioneeringmaybe this aspect makes more sense now im willing to reconsider though if this part of the proposal remains consistently unsupported
well i see your points specially the one with that using the current keys would be faster but this would make it possible to integrate voice with the current keys so while you are targeting you could say activate shields would make the process of issuing commands faster and another feature that would be cool is that while in a fleet if you were a squad commander with a squad and got engaged by a hostile fleet while the rest of your own fleet and the fc was in a different system and you could then issue the command establish video link to fleet commander while engaged in fightingor eaven keep issuing orders and watching the battle after you got podded through camera drones or something

hey guys apple did a thing
its entirely possible in fact there are programs which will translate your voice into keystrokes if you really want it that badly google around and bind yourself saying shields up to alt1  alt2 or whatever your shield hardener keys areit is a nice gimmick but as others have said until we have computers capable of advanced speech processing an understanding plot the fastest route to jita avoid lowsec using a keyboard and mouse for simple commands will be many times faster and more convenient
hmm no love for the rorqual
solo play is available in many forms as examples exploration mining mission running bpo research copying invention solo pvp well solo roaming the possibilities are limited only by your imaginationif you want solo play a la bejewelled blitz theres always facebook or steam
guys guys guys
except for exploration and solo pvp which im not entirely sure is something you can make a career of which of those offers you know excitement you did forget trading though which i have found quite interestingarent they always i can just sit in station and imagine all the things id like to do i suggest you try the multiplayer version of that seeing that you have intimnate knowledge of both fbook and these gamessorry
currently you can only have one character training a skill at any one timei propose that the concurrent training of characters be enabled such that of the three characters on each accountif 0 or 1 character has an active skill queue game time is consumed at 1x real timeif 2 characters have an active skill queue game time is consumed at 2x real timeif 3 characters have an active skill queue game time is consumed at 3x real timeeach account has a certain amount of game time remaining a plex and equivalent subscriptions currently add 30 days of game time however if a player was to run all queues on their characters this would reduce to 10 daysthe main point of this is to allow players to invest small amounts on top of their subscription costs into the addition of new characters without having to run multiple accounts this would not allow players to log into multiple characters from one account at one time as it is intended for temporary measures eg investing one months worth of subscription into training a tradingminingmissioning alt
so this is what the 6th or 7th iteration of the lemme train multiple toons on the same acct at the same time thread in as many days no
so for those of us who pay for our accountswe get charged 2 to 3 times moreuhhell nogo back into your cave please trollshoo stop the evemail spam
an idea i woudl support is to have one skill queue per account so that i could queue up training on my alts without having to switch to the currently training character and pause their training as an alternative having each character training at 1n speed 12 if two characters are training 13 for all three might be a workable option consuming game time faster is not an optionif you want to train other characters at the same time simply use another account it only costs 2 plex to shift the characters between accounts
agreed stop the evemail spam
but the ops arguement that you all arent understanding is that that solution rwequires work and effort which would be totally unfair to force op to do in a agme all about work and reward based on aforementioned workat op wanna train 2 characters at once get 2 accounts if not deal with it not everyone is a pretty little princess that get whatever they want regardless of what your daddy told you
ok either you dont understand the words you read or you are browsing the board just to insult people the post clearly states that a current subscription adds 30 days of game time so if you only train one character like you can at the moment it costs exactly the same as what it does now if you want to train multiple characters it costs the same as running concurrent accounts with these characters the benefit of this system is not requiring a transfer fee for completed alts and not requiring a startup fee for the new accountsas you are concerned of the costs lets run this by youatm the most efficient method of training an alt is create new account using a buddy invite from your main21days training subscribe for 1 month equiv cost 1 plex 30 days on second account  30 days primary account transfer character to main account equiv cost 2 plexso youve shelled out the equivalent of 3 plex and got 81 days of training rather than the 90 its worthhowever under my suggestion to get the same amount of training you would 3 plex 90 days of trainingmy suggestion also has the benefiting of catering from fact that if a plan doesnt round exactly to a month you dont lose any training time you have paid foralso to the last obnoxious poster i am posting from my trading alt which is represented by a female character because some people presume the person controlling it is female and give better deals  weird but it works and believe it or not i pay my own way in this game like many of the more reasonable people here

cant we just ban the name ccp on kugu for being such a terrible game company
turn ccp into an overused joke and ill treat it the same way i treat u mad
u ccp 
i actually requested this when the new forums went up the answer i got was that ccp was afraid that kugucom would be hosting some sort of browser exploits to hack into peoples computers seriously i think it is stupid and petty of ccp but i will ask againcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
ccp
ccp is literally 
i cant even figure out how to change the reputation pips and the original k is too busy banging his russian supermodel girlfriend to bother programming for the site
given the warning message i still get when clicking on an external link in these forums that seems a tiny bit hypocriticalanyway the horse has already bolted  tens of thousands of their customers visit the site anyway
free kugu etc i dont read devblogs until they make it to kugu funny how that works
lolwut well i know ccp is dumb but this dumb kugu save us
probably has something to do with mula redirecting visitors to a malicious swf file back in june you can even find the old post on his forum he was like oh hai i was just testing for the lulz guys btw i removed because otherwise google was going to flag my site as malwarelulz
1 to the free kugu campaign
thanks for your effort i appreciate it
kugu brings a lot of customers to ccps side free his name
literally not what happenedurl
this is  stupid of themfyi i support this proposal
so remote cyno
sounds more like a wow mage player missing blink
came in here expecting a proposal for a suicide bomb that detonates as soon as you launch it left disappointed
the game is set in the future we should be able to see outside the station on our screen in captains quarters
oh yes better even while sitting in the cantina but you heard hilmar  they wont be investing much into wis anytime soon and i dont think what you suggest can be implemented quick and easy like using assets they have lying around still 1
rotating images of outside station yeslive feed  no can you imagine how bad the lag with jita 44 would bei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
its been brought up beforeat best perhaps an overview but looking out side likely wont happen until wis comes outim neutral on this topic stop the evemail spam
supported
supported only if points can keep you from docking
when you are in space you are on server a when you are docked you are on server b in both cases your chat works over server c making you see outside the station technically means a dramatic increase in communication complexity between servers especially fun for systems like jitathis is not some easy to implement thing this has massive ramifications and requires a tremendous amount of work for a relatively minor feature yeah i get it your ship got esploded when you undocked into a bubble right
i disagree a window on the outside of the station would only require an amount of information on par with that sent to a single game client to be sent from server a to server b all docked players on server b would then have access to this very stream of information broadcast by server b again no more than what a single client in space requires this would hardly impact on server as workload and given some smart programming shouldnt hurt the rather less challenged instation server bof course there are no server a and server b but i believe there are nodes that work in a comparable way
so ccp is reissuing a formerly unique ship poor pods could afford and giving them out as part of the power of 2 promotion kinda screws anyone who got one should there be policy on it whats the difference between reissuing the apotheosis and say the freki or the utu or any other unique ship
while i understand your principle upset here does it really matter i suspect ccp devs were chatting and decided to pick a ship that mainly sits in hangers and isnt of strategic importance would you be upset if they put an issuing limit on it to only include those from biomassed accounts again i understand why in principle you are upset but does it really matter here if it were state raven id get italways  never  forget to check your references peace out zulu hope you land well
theres a massive difference between a reskinned shuttle that was given out to everyone that was subbed at some point and a tournament prize assault frig of which there were only 50 ever in existence theres a reason the frekiutu sell for more than 1000x what an apotheosis does stop and think before you say something else stupid
im not saying theres not a big difference in what the ships are capable of or the methods of which they were originally acquired but in principal they are the same in that they were unique ships ultimately the value or a frekiutu has no bearing on how they were acquired or their performance capability dose it you said yourself in your argument that they are worth over 1000x closer to 3000x what an apotheosis is whcih suggests your belief that price is valid criteria on which to judge this if thats the case than i am correct the reason a freki costs more than a wolf is because it is unique nothing more scarcity gives it intrinsic value otherwise its just another t2 frigate the reason an apotheosis was selling for 20 mil last week and less than 10 this week is because of its perceived scarcity and the loss of that perception due to the reissue otherwise its simply a shuttle maybe you should substantiate your arguments mxzf otherwise someone might thing you are stupid i know i do
the principle that you are arguing on is ccp is making a unique ship that was issued free to every single account that was active more common than it already is think about what you are saying here there are at least 200k apotheosis shuttles or zephyrs in existence less losses the market for them is small because those people collecting unique ships already have themthe only way that apotheosis or zeyphyrs are going to increase in value is if a large proportion of the people who already have them manage to lose them somehowthese token ships are not in the same category as utus and frekis one set of ships are nigh ubiquitous the other are very rare
well that really to me seems to be a relative argument my only contention would be that the shuttles value is based on market availability and as that has declined their prices have risen ill even concede that there could be more than twice the number of them than you said there youre saying that one is kinda rare and the other is really rare thats not a principled counterargument
its a shutle that no one ever undocks in everyone who would ever buy one from anyone already has one and besides looking pretty ahs no practical use what so everand it is to my knowledge the freki and utu were prizes for a tournamentyour arguing 2 different things herethe shuttle is like a limited edition collectors buttons they will be made and made again so long as the mold isnt brokenwhereas there will only ever be as many 1987 or whatever year was important baseball world series trophies as were originally made because the 1987 world series only happens once the 1988 series may have a trophy but it wont say 1987 on it which is what determines the valueits not the always the rarity of it but the significance of it if it is a reward for a particluar event that only a few were able to receive it will be infinitely more valuable then anything else because it cant eb rereleased because the event it was issued for has already happened and wont happen again
your obviously a nooblet me break it downfreki  hudnreds of billions of isksome jovian shuttle  a few millionexaggeration on purposeget it got it goodnow go back to your cave  o peven thenits not worth that much in the first place stop the evemail spam
yes the freki is more significant and of higher value its unique in that it says vii on the hull i happen to have one the apotheosis has for you children on your fifth birthday in its description which apparently should be amended to say and our random future promotions someone should probably edit the eve wikis statement as far as is known the apotheosis is a limitededition ship in that it doesnt get replaced if destroyed and there are no blueprints for manufacturing more of them as well i guess its always ccps 5th birthday i guess im too dumb to follow you here1 clearly2 last one sold for 20 billion got mine for 22 bil just fyi3 20mil last week 8mil today also fyi
whamarket musta bottomed outdayum maybe i should start saving my iskiesthanks for the correction stop the evemail spam
i was refering to small gang tacticsbut even thenits alot of space to scan throughbut yesi do understand your getting at stop the evemail spam
i actually use cloaked ships very often if you cant offer something constructive to the conversation please dont bother posting to it
im not saying this is a particularly effecient way at decloaking ships but the rationale that a blast hits your ship and doesnt decloak it seems unlogical to me
its usually because cloaky ships are paper thin so rather than decloaked you get destroyed
then what if the skins or graphic modifications can be applied to every ship of that class for example you might be able to have a raven with a modified look then lose it and buy a new raven with the exact same look but still with the ability to switch between original and modified look at willjust my cents
asking real money for basic customisation in a subscription based mmo would be an extremely greedy move on ccps partoh wait anyway while id really love to have paint jobs i wrote more than one proposal to that effect on the old forums id never spend a single cent in rl money for that much as i refuse to pay for incarna customisation while i wouldnt have a problem if ccp decided to rise sub rates i refuse to pay extra for anything that is absolutely standard mmo fare
this thread has too much talk about buying mods and ammo and there is absolutely not supportedno matter how much i wanted to put scootaloo on my scimitar
allow me to buy paintgun for aurum say i can can create animage  same way like corp logo colors symbols etc then i buy some paint bullets for aurum and then i fly around shooting other peoples shipsposesstations with this gunsort of like graffity but space style and make it unremovable at least from ships
if i cant paint giant dongs on my enemies outposts permanently eve isnt worth playing anymore make it anything player builtowned is permanently painted and we have a deal
works fine for memust be your brain not working
not coolnot cool at all buy a new account spend some time in training and get uber rifter of doom you wouldnt even need t2 guns to be better than any other rifter this here looks like gold ammo to me
the cerebral accelerator only works on pilots under 35 days old i havent got a new account to test with so i dont know if the 35 or 30 days relates to the age of the character or the accountsure well see folks with frigates or destroyers doing 20 more damage than monthold characters should be able to now have a look at your gunnery skills and check out how long it takes to train surgical strike 5 as long as ccp keep this offer as an irregular pot sweetener we dont have to worry too much about nasty people creating superpowered disposable suicide ganking alts
they put this in the commissioned officer edition and thats been out for a long time nowit lasts 35 days or until your first podding hardly worth the price of a new account if it goes away on podding surely
while id agree on the not cool part why is this thread in the assembly hall general discussion or jita park would seem more suitable
special offer for rich high sec gankers
1 for option 1
i do like wis and hope more comes out soonbut for a multiplayer game being stuck in a prison cell does seem rather counterproductiveif they are going to have wis they should have at least added some small semblance of multiplayer to it ie allowed us to invite a limited number of people to said prison cells to suffer with usbouncing howeveralways a bonus however not something id deem as requiredat least not yet
i just think the two ships thing is awkward for new players some more suitable alternatives to this could be allowing the mining frigates to mount probe launchers alongside the 2 lasers with a negative effect on probe capacity to prevent these ships becoming exploration vessels or just make veld sites anomalies however i suppose making them all sigs would cut down on bottingpoint taken
personally dont see the need to change things from what they aredoing this would just mean people would need more characters or ships involved in mining operationsi know im not the only person that gets bored with probing things down with mining boring enough as is this would just kill it
a possible viable option may be1 leave 08 thru 10 as they are gives the newer players something to mine and those belts are fairly small anyway2 move all ore and ice belts 07 down to lowest null to grav sites
how about system wide belts you have to go to the star and there you run the onboard scanner everyone has that and dont need skills to use itthis way we get dynamic belts we get system wide ring belts that people have wanted for years and we pull people to a common location where they can shoot each othernecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
supported if the mining ships could get a spare high for a probe launcher
three points1 in the event of a pod kill the reward should include the cost of lost clothing etc ie anything lost in the pod kill i for one would pay a lot more for a pod kill that included a monocle also id love to have a collection of monocle clad corpses2 the actual cost of the clone involved in the pod kill should be used to calculate the reward since the isk was spent already there is no way to game it and players regularly over clone3 podding yourself via self destruct for instance to escape wh space should not result in any reward payment
for ships kills why not just the ship values and not worry about all the ins and outs of the modules and cargo the values are calculated quarterly already for insurance purposes modules  meh does it really matter the killer is going to scoop them and the victim will loose themfor pods base it off the cost of the clones sp retention level that value is known too why make t any more complex than thatnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
i dont think monocles etc are actually destroyed unless its in your cargo although i do think a monocled corpse would be awesome clone cost could be derived from the actual clone used but thats an extra bit of data to keep track of and if for some reason someone did not buy a med clone it would result in no isk to the killer i could only see this happening in the case of player stupidity or as an alternative to biomassing a grief alt for instance i didnt think about selfpodding to travel but thats an interesting considerationwell i was going on the base value of destroyed modulescargo only dropped stuff is scoopable and wouldnt count to make it worth blowing up someone in a rifter as the base values would result in almost nothing for the killers reducing the incentive to huntpods as stated i would just base on the retention threshold of the minimum clone used to cover sp the implant value is in there as incentive to kill people with a head full of snakesif destroyed moduleimplantcargo value is removed from the equation then the payouts become relatively tiny disincentivizing bounty hunting to the point of not making it worthwhile and keeping a 1b bounty on the character forever its a balance between overpaying thus resulting in profit for an altsuicide and giving a bounty hunter the equivalent of a waiters gratuity for his trouble
good pointsnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
so you are taking away our ccp given right to be asses and grief people i propose all noob ships be indestructible for the first 20 days of a new account try grief them noobs now smart asses
we have volunteer moderators coming soonill sign up but if they let me in ill be viciously stripping the crap out of this forumare you posting an idea for allowing multiple characters to train on the same account in assembly hall banned for three years without warning muhahahawhat you think thats too severe sigh
i wont flame you i agree this is a mess i dont know why people cant get their forum topic in the right spot but i let it slide for now because i am not a moderator in any formvolunteers you say
quoted for truth assembly hall should be more than i was ganked and i didnt want to be ccp make fix
yeah i agree the forums are messed up but its not just the assembly hall most channels in each sub forum is messed up either it has hardly no moderation at all or is heavily moderatedas for your statement  i believe action is required such as either strict moderation possibly by the csm themselves education on how to properly peruse the subforum or both of themno i disagee to having the csm do any moderation at all that would be placing control in the hands of biased players who have their own agenda its bad enough they get to decide which issues to bring up for discussion with ccp dont need them having the power to lock threads or remove posted replysvolunteers maybe if chosen with a vote done by the general member population who usually frequents that specific sub forum
bump with csm agreeing
you are still not getting it  it will not be optional but mandatory the few loopholes that may exist can only be used by english literates like gtcs from 3rd party vendor and are as such not even on the table  that is unless you can provide a link to a vendor that offers verification in japanese come spring the only way that a japanese can play without having to deal with nexon is to buy plexes within game for isk and applying to account or learn englishas far as i know the japanese player are not hard core like the oft mentioned korean and chinese but rather more casual so having to grind isk for subscription to avoid having to deal with an untrusted company will probably be a deal breakerkeep in mind the cultural differences here being forced to deal with what is considered an evil company to get some good product will be flat out refused by the majority  contrary to what we are accustomed to in the west where we will happily pester the devil to make a deal for more stuffzUFFFDby what i can gather nexon only exists because there is no alternatives and they excel at catering to the baser aspects of human nature read lowest denominator 
hello cottoni have paid 180 day  7170 to the game is the price about 5500 yen in case of the japanese yen if an amount of money higher than this must be paid to nexon i will stop a game
i always used a cc from a friend in the us an then payed them back for it or just use a jcbvisa
i am waiting for information however ccp does not give information the mail about the fee collection of nexon is delivered only to some japanese playersit is said that mexon is restricted to a game magazine of japan and fee collection is restricted to nexon pointi want you to refer to it
i am trusting that vrat isnt trolling us so here goessome of my thoughts mostsome have already been expressed but heres my take on a few1 ganking working as intended concord response times fine and the use of alts to pull concord away is a legit tactic as long as the gankers dont mind us using an alt to draw concord to the belt we hisec folk need to be vigilant while miningmissioning if not  well  enjoy the pod ride home 2 oreice belts move all the oreice belts in 07 and below to grav sites new players can still get their feet wet in 08 and above a side note to this is my response to many who think that all hisec miners are semiafk a large number of us who mine in hisec enjoy the social aspect and are actively chatting in our own channel or on voice3 rr alts cheesey move that needs to be addressed we were wardecd by a 1 man corp who would only undock with between 3 to 5 rr alts cycling thru repping him and docking for the next one to take over4 carreer paths i dont have much to add here as i jump between mining mission running exploration inventionbuilding and a little wh as the mood takes mewhen i get board with one i just move on to the next5 rp races there is no value in what race you chose to be i spent a great deal of time reading all the race descriptions etc before making my choice and it means exactly zero perhaps a racial bonus of some flavor when you fly your races ships or engage in an activity that your race is supposed to be predisposed to6 pve incursions are fine like they are i would like more diversitycontent in mission running after rescuing that fricken damsel the 3rd time i get board and dont run missions for a few weeksenjoy since moving back to hisec i do enjoy the ability to change what i do based on mood at the time considering my limited play time available i enjoy what i can accomplish in the 23 hours i get pisses me off realistically the only this that truely irritates me in hisec is some of the unrestricted chattingsmack in local as i have grandchildren who like watching me play it can get a bit problematic when the grandson asks me grandpa whats a fckstick

mara i am so sorry all that fine motor skill clicking is difficult for you  i understand everyone is not gifted with good hand eye coordination thank you for reminding me to be more considerate of those who are not as lucky as i am i do not get shaky jittery hands in a game lol tbh i did not consider that fact hats off to you for playing despite this serious handicap and to ccp for making the game more playable for the nervous types amongst us after all your type pay your subscription just like the rest of us so having a crowd of other players to make you feel safer ingame works quite well with the lemming err cooperative scenarios ccp dictates no individuality unless ccp has sanctioned it is your motto i presume ps dont be so afraid its a game
what forms of solo play have ccp removed from your repertoireare you suggesting that the other options are only boring when done solo
your second attempt at creating a straw man to bash will not work mara i never said ccp removed any forms of solo play from my repertoire i just clearly stated that your arguments as written in this thread were incorrect in saying ccp had removed functionality when the ship icons replaced the hangar you can have your own opinion but we all must share the same facts
how about you tell us what the hell it is your after before you start pushing strawman counter arguments at peoplebecause its quite obvious your just ranting to be ranting hereand no one has any idea what your getting atand i do mean quite literally no one stop the evemail spam
drake if you do not understand what i am talking about i can make two suggestions  1 reread the original post slowly and get your dictionary so you can learn the definitions of any words you dont know  being ignorant is nothing to be ashamed of  however it is a demerit to your publicly perceived intellectual capacity to berate someone because you lack the capacity to grasp a statement above your station  2 ask an adult in your home to read it an explain it to you
oh good griefthe simple fact is functionality that people were used to was removed whether or not there were alternate methods does not matter functionality was removedand there are a good number of players who have trouble with the right click menus but play anyway dont downplay their difficulties
i would not dream of arguing with someone so honest as to be a member of spazz corp your self identification trumps any witty reply i could think of you win
what does the corp have a history i dont know ofi mean sure my ceo is a little odd but that makes those boring days waiting for someone to die outside jita entertaining
now onto your original postmy view on the whole thing was a lot of people identified with their ship more than their person so when the ship was removed it was like they lost their characteranother issue for some was the fail immersion leaving the ship just to load ammo ccp claimed a long time ago in this galaxy eve to be a persistent universe and that universe falls apart when things like that happen for some playersas for completely abandoning incarna temporarily maybe i didnt ask for that some did others asked for a reprioritizing well ccp reprioritized and we got to where we areif this is in any relation to your op good if not bummer
corina your statement has everything to do with my original post ccp completely missed that so many people identified more with their ship then their character seemingly as long as we could still undock and get shot at by other ships ccp thought everything was good but players liked ship spinning players liked viewing their ships from every angle an it had nothing at all to do with group play so ccp did not consider the impact because they discount solo play seemingly i just want them to consider that solo pleasures are good in eve not bad some seem to think i should be podded for saying that  let em try
fine motor skills straw men people identifying with ships wtf maybe im too tired or something but reading page 2 of this thread several times i simply have no idea what youre on about are you sure you doi can comment on this howeverin one word yesboredom is a constant companion for a solo player in eve and while i cope rather well with that many others dont or didnt oh sure there is excitement too from time to time but its a trickle not exactly a torrent im in it mostly for the sheer promise that eve holds and have been since 2004 paying for my account updating my trade orders and training queue hanging out in the noob corp channel offering advice trying out a new scheme to profit on the markets taking out a ship for a rideit is mostly boring  dont try to tell me otherwise 
highsec should be a pvp free zone make ships unable to target each other in highsec then if people want to pvp they can go to low or null also boost the rewards so l4s pay out more
lol
yes please
so what your saynig isspend plex to train fasterokmaybe my response wasnt clear enoughh e l l n oclear enough for youtake it as you wantyou can paint it upmake it look prettydress it upbut this is just a very poor trollthe day someone can spend money to acellerate their accounts in an unfair advantage is the day i flat quitstop hiding it and come out with ityour lazyand your tired of working for your hard earned spsbuck upor get out stop the evemail spam
errrr yeah because like we dont have enough amarr and caldari ships as it is
yeahnoi mean boats with lasers and missilesmost of the current ones are better at tank than gank
hmph splitweaponsystem ships tend to be suck not sure why youd want more of them
agreed about the sucking but the sucking is caused by the people who code them not by the people who use themthere is no principle that says one shouldnt mix weapons that have relatively equal rangeoptimal range because then there is a true sweet spot two weapons systems with relatively same ranges and optimal ranges shouldnt suck so much in concert in the eve universeits not like i am asking for missiles that fire 5x scorch laser shots each at close range a la david weberhonor harrington although that could be coolor missile pods from the same serieshmmmay be time for a new thread
like to see more of this meself
actually no the main issue is that you end up having to fit both types of damage mods bcus and heat sinks in this case which means that neither one is as strong as it could be while youre asking for this you might want to suggest fitting ships with dualtanks too its about as effective as dualweapon systems
actually yes since ccp codes all this stuff and makes the decisionsi do understand what you mean thoughwhich leads to the obvious question why have multiple hard point types on a vessel in the first place if they wont be reasonably supported by vessel design just add the right bonusesas far as the dual tank thing goes well all ships have shields and armor but i agree that having two halfassed tanks is not better than one good tankagain its still just a matter of the bonuses not any inherent characteristic of the shipsthis is a game remember humans write and code it

then i expect you will list and describe those violationssince you have chosen to describe our site as one which promotes eula violating activities or engages in the distribution of malware you can explain how we have done so and how you came by that informationif you wish to treat our site as a dangerous one you can remedy this by warning the large number of eve players who visit our siteyou can also warn the csm members who visit our site that they are as you describe it in some form of dangerbecause making spurious comments about our site and the safety of those who visit it is unacceptablemaking these comments and then failing to act on your information or allowing us to defend ourselves and challenge your claims are also unacceptableyou are either failing to properly protect your subscribers or you are maintaining a vendetta against our site
not a single comment was spurious and nothing is going to change from a filtering perspective im sorry you disagree
please link evidence to the distribution of malware along with anything elsethis is simply ccp trying to hide a piece of its past that they dont like
has ccp contacted law enforcement regarding this distribution of malware if not why notwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
instances of malware have been admitted to within this very thread this thread is over as far as im concerned and ive already told you that the site will remain filtered in perpetuity thats not changing based on my own observations
so ill go with my previous point thenthanks for clearing that up
look ma i use big words
oh really
you guys are aware that any site that has google ads on it and is related to eve is probably going to end up with ads for eula violating activities are you not guess this means that they have to filter 50 of the internet
anyone who posts on kugu should have thier account flagged for investigation to check they arent involved in any nefarious activities such as account sharing botting hate crimes and people smuggling if you guys want to discuss politics news or anything else to do with eve there is a great site i highly recommend called evenews24com it is pretty unbiased and you can even write up your own stories which riverini will publish also the site is completely free from malware and password arent saved in plain text format
am i late to the party free kuguand can i have foreplay please
ahahahahahahseriously as far as i know kugu is the only site that is filtered here its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
uh whati dont get it can you just warp like everyone else or die if you get too close to your own bomb
the bomb would only jump your stealth bomber sir
never played wow im games workshop warhammer  but its just as you put it thank you only the duration of the blink is determined by the bombs flight timespeed
its not a warp its a jump that lands you 40kish away from the fight  or gets you closerkills ya bomb doesnt deal dmg but when it goes off it instantly jumps your stealth bomber in that spot
thx
if you are getting caught in the blast radius of your own bomb you definitely dont know how to properly employ them considering you can launch from around 30km and put your target right in the center of the blast and considering how slow bombs travel you have more than enough time to pull up and maneuver away from the blastyou are definitely doing something wrongi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
so your proposing a blink function im thinking starcraft2 now lol for the stealthbomber hmm would be interesting not sure if want
this is why i stick to wardeccing corporations and not going for alliances simply put they cant escapewhich means more ransoms for me but to be honest i like how things are now no need to change anything really
1we should be able to board the station just as if it were a ship we can use our overview look around etc we cant do anything cant fit any modules would seem the simplest thing to codenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freed
in order for you to see outside in any useful manner ie showing what you will undock to would require the internal of the station to be on the same node as the external that means that for every person docked a cq would be loaded onto the server along with the external station environment so imagine the lag of a few hundred cqs running all at onceplease think of the hamsters
sorry i hate hamsters
this supported but reduce lag by making it an optin option rather then an optout one if everyone instation is looking out of the station while in it that is more lagworthy then if they had an option to virtually undock as the station that latter would basically be identical to undocking normally in terms of server utilization with the exception that the player would neither actually undock nor have any ability to do anything outside the stationthat said once a look outside feature is implemented on the station its only a short hop to turn that into a man station defenses option to let people shoot at pesky invaders i extra support adding extra destructible defenses to nullsec outposts which can be manned by people who are docked at the outpost
support of the idea  the board the station option that engages the overview seems the best seems inconsistent that i can see a planet view and control my pi without creating massive lag while in jita but seeing an overview from inside the station is not possible this is a good functional feature for the cq
the resources to see what is really outside the station would be far too much to make it worthwhilethat being said a static variant with things flying outside would be good ie a fake view of outside so what you see from inside is not what is really out there
whats with this automatic assumption of lagnow i can see there being automatic lag if there was for instance a window in the cq that did nothing but give you a realtime image of what you could see outside the station from whatever vantage point but if it was instead a function that worked like boarding the station it would produce no more lag then having another ship in system less really since youre not actually adding another ship to the system youre just looking at the immediate area around the station as if you were a ship insystem since that would only apply when people choose to look around outside the station the impact on server performance would be minimal and would in any event be less then the lag caused by someone undocking in a shuttle or whatever to do nothing but peek around outside the station before redocking which is currently the action that this functionality would replace
the effects of adding even a simple static view of the undock and transitioning the data to the docked station environment from the system environment and then down the pipe to the client to be rendered would have astronomical effects on latency and thats not even thinking about how clientside performance would be effected by having to render the station environment or cq plus the exterior environment plus ship models and turret models assuming drone models are disabled and effects are turned down to a bare minimum
this would be worst in jita  perhaps the station charges a fee 10000 isk per minutenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
1 for nowlets fix fis first
so why have a cloaking skill at all super special jita runs not supported again and again and again
smartbombs dont decloakgood to know
bubbles dont decloak ships so why should smartbombs when you consider a bubble is nothing more than a massive gravity well drones orbitting several ships do a better job of decloaking a ship especially when utilized in tandem with fast ships such as interceptorsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
revisit the megathron model alot of us like the old one better for one it had nicer looking windowsnow that hybrids are getting a fix would be nice to get to fly the classic megathron like literallyit still amazes me that megathrons are not really an option if you want to compete with other roaming fleets and actually get a winvote hell yes
the old model had awesome lights on it indeed also it looked sleeker and seems to be missing the thingy on the left far side of the ship
bumptrebor vile you posted your support for this  how are you planning to proceedthing is not much discussion is forthcoming since interested parties are mostly in agreement that this would be a good thing and no discussion means the issue will be lost in oblivion page 2 of the hall soon
ive already pointed people to the thread if it gets a few more pages of discussion ill push harderone issue is that its a game design proposal ie a specific change proposal as opposed to fix bounties certain people inside ccp hate such direct do this dumbasses proposals
its infeasible to detail every rule in the tos
it is listed in the tos item 16quotejust because you dont know every rule doesnt mean every possible thing needs to be listed it is your responsibility to find out and there are multiple ways which take just a couple of minutestry explaining to a judge irl that you didnt know what you did was wrong they will just laugh and watch you rot in a small cell
a noob just starting the game is clueless about agro mechanics so neither would they steal ore to bait people nor would they even have much skills to do itthey might assume it is imposable to steal other players loot in space what other major mmo after all has free lootinga player who flips cans deliberately and is in gank ship knows how to play game and is not starting out they may try it on noobs or experienced players but if they do it on noobs in obvious starter system they face punishmentno problems here
1 can flipping is a part of the game so it wouldnt fall under that rule to begin with2 irl if the law doesnt specifically deny you the ability to do something then you have the right to do it the tos is the legal agreement not the wiki so in front of a judge i would be just fineread what i said for once and you would understand i am not against having it a rule i am against the fact it isnt listed in the obvious place for bannable offenses to be listedactually that is exactly why eulas and toss are created
exactly what i was on about if we put it to a vote we already know how those tend to turn out  we might as well just hand moderation to the csmin fact letting them moderate would force them to openly show their colours either they make a good job of it or they will likely face outrage and then intervention by ccp no
part of the problem is that ah is treated as an unmoderated area to promote free discussion on topics regarding the eve universe without the fear the ccp willwould ever lock a thread simply because they disagreed with a proposal or if someone was vehemently flamed and counterflamed in the process of a proposalhowever in its current state ah is a cacophony of uselessness people rarely are using the forum search functions on chribbas site or the new much better one on these new forums to research if an idea has been presented or not they also think this is a free forum to whine and gripe about issues that arewellstupidim very supportive of bringing the hammer down on ah and turning it into a proper discussion forum for creative wellthoughtout ideas for the eve universe let ideas survive the horrors of the fi subforum or be wellcrafted rather than the other garbage that tends to make it here start locking and removing threads that shouldnt be in ah or are just blatant trolls
so it seems ccp has decided to hand over their japanese player base to a shady 3rd party collector it would be interesting to see if you could actually use 3rd party gtc sellers instead of nexon however from what i saw the only exemption is in game plex ccps motto if it isnt broken break it if it is broken ignore it improving npeUFFFD dynamic new eden
1 it would take a bit more trouble but how about also highlighting orders from corp or alliance mates as well then you could see if you are competing with a mate and make some sort of agreement
null sec sucks plain and simplei dont like being meatshield 1572314 i dont like all the good spawned belts and sites being reserved for ceos and friendsi dont like having to haul all of my stuff out there myself one ship at a timei dont like seeing all the manufacturing slots reserved for privileged alliance membersi dont like seeing non pvp operations halted indefinitely by an afk pilot in local i dont care but apparently everyone else is too spookedi dont like being told to sod off because im not flying the correct ship into battle with the correct fittings who the f turns away the only available dictor pilot for a roving op seriouslyon the flipside i dont like getting scolded for not participating enough in battlesi dont like being tossed aside and considered useless when supercaps enter the field and they always doi dont like going on 8 hour roving gangs only to catch a single pilot flying a t1 cruiser at a gatei dont like having to go ten to fifteen jumps away from our 00 home just to rat as all nearby belts are saturated with fellow alliance matesi dont like being told that pi in our 00 home is reserved for privileged individuals onlya lot of drastic changes would be necessary to get me back out in 00 its just not worth itsummary of eves last four expansions
im going to draw first a parallel so please be patient  a while ago i used to play a game called carrionfields a text based medieval mmo very player killer oriented one of the classes in there was the thief it had the ability to hide from most characters and be in the same room with them remain undetected was weak in actual direct combat but had one exceptionally powerful but very limited ability the ability to backstab which gave the thief one strike with huge damage potential about 50 times more powerful than normal attackswhich for a thief were anemic it could only be performed if the thief or its target was not currently fighting meaning engaged in direct combat behing the target of other attacks the damage level depended greatly on the skill of the thief the weapon used and the status of the target sleeping sitting standing the backstab could also not be used if used if the target had been in a fight less than 2 minutes before or was below 70 health this ability gave the thief a fighting chance at winning a fight against a superior opponent if properly prepared on rare occasions random on very high level highly skilled thieves perfect backstab skill the backstab was so powerful that it rendered the target immobile making it unable to flee for 20 secondsan idea came to me and i was thinking maybe we could have something similar in eve for recons providing for classgame balance issues of courseive been playing eve for 3 years now and what i see are the same abilities being more or less swapped between different ships with a few exceptions im going to focus only on recons now imho i do not think that their abilities short of being able to cloak refect their covertblack ops role all of them get across the board bonuses 80 of which are valid for 15 other ships i think that gunships like rapier and arazu need a specific ability available to nobody else which reflects their covert ability atm recons do not really have abilities which are inherent to the stealth class and that nobody else can have t3 included most current abilities are not representative of their covert sneaky backstabbing surprise attacking class even if they get the drop on someone they are extremely fragile in combat with anyone except the uber short range gallente ships and those have drones so here is what im suggesting 1 create a skill called first strike which would be valid for only recons and black ops a highly skill intensive ship class role specific powerful yet difficult to use well and potentially very taxing for recons 2 skill injection requirements would be recons v surgical strike iv t2 guns sharpshooter v gunnery v3 skill description  the ability of a recon ship to deliver critical strike a very powerful extremely precise first volley against its target when it first uncloaks this strike either hits or misses so make sure you are at optimal with your guns does not apply to missiles when perfect this skill becomes exceptionally powerful4recons would have this particular button on their hud when pressed it tries to perform the strike using its main gun group trying to shoot non grouped guns will only count the first fired weapon in the damage5 skill specifics UFFFD does not work on other recons covert ops unless their speed is below 50 of max i guess indicating a certain level of relaxation rp wise on the part of the pilot pUFFFD 50 damage per skill level for shot fired when uncloaking must use gun group for perfect unison and max damage training this to 5 would be exceedingly important for actual damageUFFFD initially drains 25 of your capacitor total capacitor when it fires then 5 reduction in critical strike cap use per levelUFFFD 20 chance of doing 20 damage to your guns and the whole high rack both chances decrease 5 per level of skill UFFFD random chance to cause 70 damage to a single non passive module on another of your racks this chance decreases by 5 per skill levelUFFFD uses 15 liquid ozone consumption per attemptUFFFD only valid for guns not missilesUFFFD cooldown 5 minutesUFFFD minimum capacitor required 85UFFFD level 5 skill can very low random chance result in potentially crippling damage to the enemy ship 50 damage to all the modules of a random rack on ships of equal or smaller size 25 chance of damage on some random number of modules of bc bs size ships excluding cap ships this means that the target will be in trouble if he needs to overheat his those modules too longa pilot in order to take advantage of this ability would have to fit his ship to be able to do this most effectively not doing so will probably not result in much success conditions of use part of description1 cannot target cannot be in combat and be shot at directly or by drones its ok if its in combat and does not having anyone shooting at it if you attempt crit strike you will get a msg which says that a critical strike cannot be performed as the target is already in combat and wary of impeding attacks2 cannot be performed if target is at lower than 50 of its total hp trying to hit it while its hurt you get critical strike cannot be performed as the target has recently been in combat and is wary3 cannot be done if the target locks and attacks you first this would have to be a valid attack not a frigate shooting its blasters at you when you are 30k awayand getting the missing msgbasically this cannot be used as an alpha strike for fleet battles more of a surgical procedure a ship that can do this well needs to be fitted for this purpose needs to lock very very fast and pick the right moment frigates your most favored and vulnerable targets can lock and attack you first 90 of the time unless they are distracted anywaythoughts
kinda long in getting your point across but ill bitei like the general idea of it but how would you go about balancing this after all this is an ability nobody can really do anything about its potential for ganking would seem to be enormous thered have to be more of a countermeasure against this
yeah sorry had to make a detailed descriptiona significant detriment to the attack is the targeting as he will most likely need to use a passive targeting module to prevent autotargeting from ruining his surprise this may compromise his ability engage in lasting combat a rapier with max skills and rigs can lock a target in something like 7 seconds from uncloaking thats plenty of time for a cruiser hack or frig to lock it first and shoot if its paying attention if not well he should die as the target the first thing would be to watch the range and try to either1 get enough transversal so they cant track you if it uncloaks at long range long range uncloak means artillery strike or rails2 most of the time you should be able to lock it before it locks you due to decloak delay  locking time a close range decloak would most likely mean autocannons or blasters at this range most frigates can lock and shoot before the recon can unless a passive targeting system is used so have to watch for that3 if you are a recon cov ops black ops keep your speed up if you think you may get hit4 pay attention to overview5 there should be no skill or ability which will saveprotect you by default it should require some action on your part such as adjusting speed direction paying attention not relying on autotargeting etc you actually doing something6 keep moving dont camp if there is a rapier or arazu aroundthis is what i can think off the top of my head it would not be hard to protect against it just have to pay attentionsort of like uber neut dominix nothing you can do except keep away from it
where to start with a guy who is scared to post on his main accountrofl refer to my post in the test thread please i cannot be bothered to repeat myselfwho has more isk lol the vast majority of the wealthiest players on eve reside in nullsec how do you figure highsec carebears have more iskpirating easy piracy is fun but definitely not benefitial enough for my taste sunshine unlss you can find me people to gank and ransom that will pay me 10b overall unfortunately for me my tastes involve cute little ships such as command ships black ops ships supercarriers etc so no pirating isnt profitable enough for me i do it from time to time cause its funokay i personally own 75b which resides in high sec why cause i collect stuff what does my isk do where is the majority of my isk for everyday playing spent you probably guessed wrong so i will tell you in nullsec who would have thought that huh ship supplying and mod supplying in our nullsec not possible understand the concept that the vast majority of the isk in the economy comes from mission spammers who run missions allllll day long and make maybe 100m for 16 hours of mission running guess what i can make by running two sites you guessed it 100m a site that takes a total of 25 minutes really where before you say america please look at the crime rate and murder rate in the us the us gets attacked from inside so  your idea of a utopiacut mission rewards to 15 of what they are and remove anothing above the 1st stage sansha incursion systems while cutting the rewards for that down to 18th of what they are remove 80 of astroid belts and remove ice belts from high sec restrict poss to one per corporation in high sec then you can have your perfect utopia with a utopia comes very limited restrictionswith a perfect world being ran by drone military to keep horrible things from happening comes massive reprocussions in real life look at chinaits not you have to properly fit your ship for what you are doingwhy you mad broblah blah blahi work on helicopters for the us government i train people to work on them while working on them ive saved and taken lives what have you done besides helping your mother from having overpressurized milk dispensers
id say sick burn but i think you are sillyposting on an alt in evesounds like good business to meno one cares if you cant be bothered repeat yourselfyou arent that important sunshineso what if nullsec does have more isk i didnt guess anything i only went from what a lot of folks whine aboutif nullsec has more money that supports the idea of leaving highsec aloneyour 75b wow gee thats great really not relevant but cool okay not really sunshinein america and other countries people are incarcerated fined and executed for doing what eve players do all the timeits not about utopia its about not allowing people to run amok wherever they feel like it whenever they feel like it sunshineso you dont want to run the missions or make use of highsec resources i get that sunshineits sad that you equate not allowing people too run amok wherever and whenever they want as utopianlook at chinai am happy for you that you work on helicopters for the government  while i obviously cant deny it in my experience as a veteran most folks talk little about action they have seen much less try to impress a stranger with it especially when it is irrelevant to a conversation in my experience that usually happens because they are trying to bolster their confidence in themselves and selfimportance and more often than not it isnt even truetrue or not it is irrelevant and in any case i apologize for not being impressed sunshinenever said i was mad sunshine you did when you spent most of the post talking about yourself instead of what i postedthanks for sharing thoughjust saying leave highsec alone
i bottle fed you a troll and yet this is all that is provided for a troll bah ill have to go feed the goons to make up for this waste of time
op obvious troll is obviousi would endorse some changes though not a drastic overhauleve is fundamentally a pvp oriented game yes its tough its nasty its down right cruel at times but stick at it persevere and youll feel a sense of achievementbecause of this orientation there should be an incentive to go into the lawless depths of space on some lucrative venture with all the risk that comes with it however with current mechanics there are no incentives to do sohigher level missions pay too much i was talking about this with a corp mate and the idea of a different branch of frigcruiserbattleship missions with higher payouts in lownull could be an ideaincursions pay way too much too i would also suggest further changes to incursions but that would be for another threadstations and undocking radius to be honest this needs addressed across board not just your utopian hisecagression mechanics again across boardyup your perfect world is fine i can only find a few things id tweak its not as if i would turn the entirety of eve into 00 space though i think thatd be pretty damn fun for a while just lol thats certainly bio worthy material
yes yes we noticed you run along now
totally disagree with this proposalmake hi sec your boring version of utopia and you watch the subscriptions plummet why make isk just for the sake of it this is not bankers and accountants in space you know
i tries making one already p no one replied then again no one trolled me i think on these forums thats the equivalent of a resounding applause
so yeahsome people want to be peaceful industrialists or not so peaceful hello bdaddy warbucks governments and militaries like this wars cost money that could be used to buy more toys better to allow folks to do business in relative peace they pay more taxes and protest lessplenty of countries used to pay good prize money for ships and equipment back in the day btw theres a lot of just make it a little less profitable going around which means its not really a serious problem is itthe make it a lot less profitable is just plain silly theres a reason most companies try not to have their main operations centers in war zones and various illicit enterprises launder their money through companies with operations in safer places why do people keep bringing up economics when they have access to the same resources theres lots of money in eve what you are asking for is ludicroushowever you seek to accomplish it getting everyone to move out of manhattan to bedstuy would eventually result in bedstuy being the next manhattancomplete with npc military and police while the peaceful industrialists make moneyyou just dont like peaceful industrialists having npc protection and you want to make it easier to mug them yeah hooray for the px ranger
so they can rmt it obviously
because we cant buy plex with real money and sell it for in game cash amirite
oh look yet another perfect worldutopia parrotbraaawklike the real world we live in is such a perfect worldutopia my asssovereign nations dont allow people to just run amok amongst them its bad for their powerbase why do you keep asking for it there is a reason life is safer in the us and in europe rather than most parts of africaeve culture is based on multiplanetary nations with regular militaries and police forces in these sorts of cultures there will be very safe places and there will be banks and accountants and industrialists and business people in space some of your fellow players are doing it right nowcheck your skills list the business skills are there really true storywho says everyone sits on their money but if they want to who are you to tell them otherwise mind your own damn business you like spending ships like crack thats your problemgo to a clinic or a nullsecanon meeting and get some helpyou volunteered to go live in 00 quit cryingwhat you really want is to make all of space like the back alleys of a william gibson novel except that those back alleys are often very tightly controlled by very nasty people you cant always run amok in there eitherhumans wont put up with that crap if they dont have to so its silly to expect eve culture to be different than that especially given their size and even more silly to expect you should be able to do the equivalent of dogfighting over the dcmdva area of the us with live ammo just because you feel like it or because people are making money instead of spending it on ships like addicts spend it on crackyou already have nullsec to do exactly what you wantwhy be so greedyif the grass really is greener in highsec then why dont you operate in highsecbecause we cant easily be ganker pirates in highsecbraaawkthats the point of highsechello mcflyare subscriptions plummeting now not last i checked but why blame highsec if they were according to many folks pvp players are the driving force in eve and have the most influence on the subscription base if so then the nullseccers can clearly communicate to those new players where to go for a good fight in 00 yes if there is not that much control over the subscriber base perhaps its because not everyone wants to play in the wild wild west of nullsecshocking to even consider i know this my nullsec friends but perhaps it is soif the hardcore pvp 00 players really are the core of this game and highsec is as irrelevant and noninfluential as so many of them saythen why keep trying to change it leave it alone and go play in 00 plenty of space for everyoneotherwise this smacks of naughty selfish children trying to steal another childs candybar just because that child saved money to buy that candy bar rather than steal itwait a secthat is what is happeningmaking highsec like nullsec just gives you more nullsecand you clearly arent satisfied with nullsec so why are you trying to create more of itgo ahead and get yourself a wet navy and sail up to any major sovereign nation in the world and open fire and see what happens to you what you really seem to want is to say hey there russiaukus um yeah we think you guys have too much money and resources so we um want to assault your citizens and um destroy some of their stuff and um steal some of their stuffis that okay and get yeah sure no problem as an answerif i smoked i would definitely want some of what a bunch of 00 seem to be smoking its apparently outrageously good t
look at how silly you are
heres a cookiethx for the bump
my experience with eve has been that the things that are boring when solo also tend to be boring when in groups its the groups that make the game interesting mixing with other people in an mmo is what the game is all about after all
that may be true for you i tend to enjoy this mmo for other reasons one is for the permanence of it what happens in eve happens for real in a way  nobody can just reload the game undo or unsay their mistakes there is no other new eden cluster to move to if i screw up in this one for a game that is refreshingly meaningfulthe other reason is i enjoy the life other people bring to this game just as i can enjoy the goingson in a crowded park downtown even though none of the people are my friends now im not drawn to seek them out and get to know them  i have friends already no way im going to do that on the net some acquaintances maybe but i wouldnt want to feel obliged to them and id feel bad if they counted on me in any wayim rather happy about how the latter turns out for me  lots of drama here not so content about the first  much of what id like to do there is terribly boring
i am a regular poster on the website that should not be named and the recent comments by ccp concern me can you tell me what the odds are of my account being hacked hard drive being destroyed identity being stolen etcit seems illogical that ccp would be aware of illegal activities and cyber threats to their clients and take no action beyond not talking about ittldr tell us what the threat is or stop being little bitches about a guy whos actions led to the csm being created and other aspects of eve we enjoy today
agree my concern is that double standards are being practiced when it comes to censorship which is directly alienating a certain community group you would think that if the security issues where already known by ccp and are apparent enough to warrant continual censorship that some form of warning would be given to the player base i mean it is one of the largest eve based community forums after allccps motto if it isnt broken break it if it is broken ignore it improving npe  dynamic new eden
kcom is simply a place where people can discuss eve politics it is a place away from eveo and allows some people to hide their identity and post under an alias as far as ive seen there is no eula violations or threads promoting it i see people posting about posters and such however there are 2 forum sections dedicated to keep those two aparteve online uncensoredwhere people can troll and do whatever without ridicule within reasonserious discussionwhere those who like to talk serious and discuss a certain topic without trolls and slanderous postingkcom is very mispresented in the general eve population and i believe a lot of it comes purely from ccps view on itwhether or not it has anything about the t20 incident or not ask yourself if the site was named anything else could you honestly say it would still be censored
off topic part removed ccp phantomedit because if such allegations are true well gg no re for me good sirs
its actually really upsetting that i can so easily type kugutsumenevery other piece of forum software fixed this kind of thing like ten years agoat this point i am more concerned about my security when posting here than i am at kugutsumen
haha reallykugu is blocked for eula violations but evebot slips by and of course evenews was really public about their botting reports even asking ccp for comments on it on kugu most of the threads with botting references have 2 kinds of posts those who dislike botting with a passion and those who are ambivelant and see it as something for ccp to deal with as they will
just freaking uncensor the name and get it over with
so does a fansite have to be regestered to be a fansitei assume all nonofficial fansites and eve related forum the eve section on reddit and any website that is not an official fansite is automatically blocked by the great and benevolent filter on this forums also all fansites on that list were blocked before they made it on the listbtw google shows botting  isk adsblock googlealso botting  isk ads show up on most  all websites using google ads at some point despite the owners requesting them to not show such ads such as on chribbas sites at some pointsisk ad shown once block block blockalso malware really why is the site still up ohwai ccp is full of also what the  ccp how is evenews24 not blocked yet they just posted a  guide on how to botand yet somehow kugutsumen is still blocked because it encourages eula violations point to the location in the  eulatldr ccp is full of editbolded the unprofessional lazy part where you did not delete the spammers posts and quite reasonably provide a temporary ban to the spammer and killed a thread that actually had some discussion going on because the developer in question responding to the communitys questions was providing poor answers and nothing to back them upsmooth
or remove concordonked insurance buff concord and up the hp on indys and miners
that would at least deal with the neutral rr problem 
some people should just never be allowed to post
worst attempt so far today must try harder
sorry for the delay in my reply the main goal was to remove the mechanic where null sec empires are forced to pay concordhigh sec empires for the right to hold space and replace it with a mechanic that would also add strategic topography to null sec i was really worried about over taxing players that are responsible for refueling everything as well i imagined the batteries having enough power to drive a structure for at least 24 hours and each structure would hold many days worth of batteries this should decrease the amount of logistics i would hope thanks for the questions and comments
allow same account characters to be defined as henchwomen a publicly know assistant to characterhenchmen would have their own training queue and pickup a percentage of the training points a character trainsthe henchmen can only train a skill already known to the main and only to a level below the main
 think someones bored of scaps in space and is looking for a forum ban
mhmm
split weapons systems gank the ships and skilling for them ask the matarammar got it right in one weapon system for each ship almost allways lasers though could have a few more missile boats mixed in one at every ship size class
again this is designerdeveloper choice not a reality of physical limitationsi am asking ccp to make different choices
then it should be remarkably easy for you to point them outyou wouldnt look so bad if the argument you were using didnt boil down to were still mad at them but wont officially say so because that would somehow make us look worse than we already do on this subject i would think better of ccp if kugutsu men was no longer censored
oh god thats the worst reasoning lie everlets test with a site that is one of the first in a search for eve hacks
its not an argument or really even a subject thats up for discussion im informing you why its staying this way how you feel i look is irrelevant
thanks for pointing that out buddy ill have it added forthwith edit the reason its not is likely that most people know better than to try to link it something that doesnt appear to be the case with the site in question
if this site was new to you then youre bad at your job
because people dont normally go to kcom with im going to find amazing new ways to violate the eve eula in mind its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
im genuinely not trolling when i ask this but how broad is ccps definition of promoting eula violationyou see i couldnt care less about whether or not kcom is censored here  i visit once in a while to get the inside scoop on certain things but considering another site i visit mostly for laughs  eve news 24 doesnt appear to be censored at all but in articles like rise of the machines tells eve players in effect  heres how to bot heres the best software to use and heres how not to get caught ccp sreegs read this and please tell me if it constitutes promotion
censorship of any kind is the death of free speech
i eagerly await the censorship of en24 for promoting eula violations as well
the reason kugutsu men is verboten is because censored censored the censored and censored
theres no free speech on a privately operated forum the argument is that censoring the name of a popular thirdparty eve site is petty and it hardly has anything to do with eula violations its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
free fhc
i understand the argument but i dont understand why anything is censored on here what one finds offensive others find perfectly acceptableif individuals are linking malicious sites they should be dealt with but besides that i dont understand by we should ever see s all over the place i know what they meant and if anything it draws focus to the fact that it was profane instead of my eyes rolling right over an otherwise harmless wordinstead of pushing for one specific thing to be uncensored there should be a push for complete uncensorship or at the very least an option on our end to disable it

manny with the most compelling argument ittsreegs youre really a butte i wouldnt have thought you of all people would come out with that argument youre beyond mentally handicapped
at fanfest sreegs was one of the devs on my pub crawlhe drank half the bottle of brennevin himself that was supposed to be for the players and then threw it all up as soon as we got off the bus but before we even got to the first pubreading his arguments for why kugu is banned kind of reminds me of that time i watched him vomit in the bushes
 the establishment
m for manfreddai travel to kcom to read about the happenings in the eve universe from what ive read as a regular denizen on the subject of eula is when people accuse others like pl of hacks when its really legitimate spaceship business really kcom is an eve comedy sitefree kcomfree fhc
that was probably a worse devpost than zulu trying to tell us 70 monocles were okay because of super designer jeansand you were doing so well ccp dont backslide now
im just going to go ahead and declare the last two pages a cultural victory

sreegs is on the wrong side of history
sellout scrub deepthroating that viking itt
sreegs must have realized making blanket statements and not being able to back them up is a bad idea
sreegs the noise i make after looking at lemonparty
i thought this violated the new corporate model of openness and understanding
he didnt get the memo i guess
hey sreegs im pretty sure i can dig up some old kugu posts that you made probably having to do with eula violations toothatd be pretty awkward huh
the viking lotion spray washes all sins away
its ccps game and ccps forums so ccp can ban whoever and whatever it wants from these forums for any reason or for no reason at all if you dont like it there are plenty of other everelated forums out there they gave us an explanation for why kcom is filtered and told us that this will not change so whining about it and trying to demand that the filter be changed is rather silly unless all youre looking for is attention and to all the trolls i dont think that preventing people from linking to kcom is good but thats not up to me to decide and if a customer wants to throw a hissy fit and quit a game because he cant make links to one particular site on that games forums than he probably doesnt want to play that game anyway right
you sir are an idiot
i wish badposting would get you banned your head would be the first on the chopping block its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
heres the thing it goes against everything in hilmars letter not to mention the real reason its filtered is because ccp wants to try to hide and reduce the credibility of the guy who outed t20 and caused one of the largest scandles ccp has suffered so now to find a way to throw the scent away they send in resident new  sreegs to tell us its for breaking the eula when clearly half a dozen other major eve related sites that are not in fact filtered promote botting produce what is in all practicality a guide to botting or use adds for sites that sell isk none of these are things our website does yet this is what they choose to throw as a reason sounds fishy to me
this makes absolutely no sense to meif all of these people are and have been mad about censorship of a fan site for this game why would these people not want to play this game is that like saying if you dont like the rules of this country you can move to mexico
you must have been outside smoking when the playerbase revolted and forced ccp to make many promises regarding fixing stuff and winter the game and all that is related to it belong to us now ccp lives or dies at the whim of the playerbaseso perhaps they should have renounced their bizarre antagonistic pronouncements perhaps just maybe they should humble themselves a little perhaps even condescend to share their reasoning
because its the forum eve deserves but not the one permitted by pr shame so well censor him because he can take it because hes not our hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark k

hey manny remember that time you pissed off the russians and then jumped ship to pl and then you posted a bunch of one letter replies and ccp deleted them tomorrow
remember that time when a pubbie like me didnt have to threadnaught ccp because goons would already do it
nope im a regd11ps free kugu you used to be cool sreegspps i assume
lets assume for the sake of argument that this is absolutely 100 true at least regarding intent its patently not true that websites which promote eulaviolating activities are censored when sites like eve news 24 even still get featured bearing in mind that im an intermittent reader of kcom and ive never seen anyone promoting eulaviolating activities ive seen someone complain about having been banned from the game for botting and that person received a general reaction from other posters of haha serves you rightat this particular juncture of the evolution of eve and ccp that shouldnt matterccp is currently struggling to regain goodwill and a respectable public image after a spectacular pr clusterfubar  one that has for various reasons reminded a lot of people of the t20 scandalthe t20 scandal was actually the first time i ever heard of eve online i didnt know anyone who played it and yet because my friends are gamers we were talking about how there turns out to be some kind of spaceships mmo where the gms cheat in favour of particular groups of players and how terrible they must be and how much we didnt ever want to play that game because clearly it was a pile of suck from the top downi didnt start playing until 2010 and the only reason i did was that the mittani mentioned in his column at ten ton hammer that ccp had improved that was enough to get me to try the game at least and i found i liked itbut here we are four years later and k the man is still banned and kcom is censored on the forumsthis gives an awfully strong impression that ccp are still angry that they got caught still resenting that its harder for them to cheatwe players arent supposed to cheat i personally do not and never have and never would i fully support ccps efforts to stop players cheatingbut i struggle to have faith that ccp are anywhere near as dedicated to keeping themselves from cheating which sucks because i want to have that faith theres a number of gms and devs who post on the forums who i totally fangirl i want to squeal and put posters of guard and shadow on my wall i dont want them or anyone they work with to be dishonest in evebut as far as i can tell it is and remains ccps collective position that anyone who exposes cheating amongst the gms andor developers of eve will be persona non grata forever that it is the exposure not the cheating that made ccp angrythat right there is a problem and the only way to fix it is to let the censorship pass
the path of the righteous poaster is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil devs plus repped is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the inept through the valley of terrible forums for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost pubbies and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my k ugutsumen and you will know my name is manny when i lay my baddrunkpoasting upon thee
make overly vague and general accusations that could be used against 12 of the kugu internetact high and mighty against a genuine olive branchbe screegstalk about pr disaster eve community website gets the kugu off from ccp
you are aware he runs his site as a business and correct me if im wrong but isnt making baseless accusations which can harm a business some form of actionable offensei mean im not a lawyer but im pretty sure you cant make claims against someones livelyhood like that without proof and not get your ass sued off in courtwho knows i could be wrong
so why wasnt sreegs part of the 20
the only terrible things on kugs are posters like you should stick to your blog tbh
free kugu
i was not really interested in this whole discussion but the dev label on it peeked my interestway to pr sreegs your posts in this thread gotta be the most jackass ccp posting i ever readand after reading through the whole discussion censoring a fairly active community website with accusations that you seem to have trouble backing up really get over yourself and just unban it
ccp if it werent for kcom and the participants of that message board i would have quit eve long ago after 18 months fearless and a myriad of other missteps by ccp there was nothing in eve to hold my attention kcom offers a extension to the interaction of ingame activities these forums and the previous version have been so heavily censored for years this leaves little room for actual discussion and the fun banter rabble rabble and downright cultivation of drama that drives players to want to login kcom is a asset to ccp whether you will admit it or not ccp ceo has openly stated the council of stellar mangement has been a positive thing for eve without the efforts and whistle blowing of kcoms creator the csm would have never came to light furthermore that same player body has served in positive capacity to assist you in catering to your clients and aattractingretaining subs which is the very life blood of your organization in reality you owe mulla nasrudin aka kugutsumen a thank you for he has done so much to impact ccp in a positive manner your repeated denial and censorship of kcom is a metaphore in itself for the dark days of ccp one that your ceo so avidly and publicly stated you have learned from and will not repeat
ive never heard of this forumwebsitecommunity before and always wondered if there was a different forum that people went to to post things for eve after reading all of this thread i agree that removing the censorship would be a good thing it happened 4 years ago and like someone said earlier the owner makes his lively hood of the website and removing traffic is like taking away his paycheck it looks like a good forum anyway free kugu
post of the year hands down
ccp should carry on with the censorship just to continue the sheer amount of tears that are being generated
qft
this thread is a gold mine for them
one more for the good fight againt ccp
here comes the threadnaught i wont bother reminding you of eves most recent pr incident
wow so few people care about this it takes one guy spamming single character posts to try and turn it into a threadnaught
i was going to jump in and defend ccp since there are without doubt plenty of posts on kcom that encourage botting and client modification but after reading this thread and the above list in particular id say just uncensor them applying censorship selectively is worse than having none at allalso the video of sreegs snorting lines of some kind of cheese sauce is seriously wtfi expect ill spend more time browsing those forums if theres more gems like that
i wanted to reiterate what i said in light of ccps response
the site in question is not a registered fansite all registered and approved fansites can be found hereplease note that the assembly hall is not a venue for threads to be spammed just to get attention and this one will be locked

this has probably been brought up before and if it was recently feel free to troll harder then you already will this is eve we are talking about but could we get a dislike columnpros can see how many dislikes there are of something people new to the forum will no longer glance and assume reply count  like count  dislike count one person cant post over and over to skew the numbers even bitter vets have to parse though pages and pages to figure out how much of the non liked replies are no votes or if there is just a lot of discussion on the topic with the ability for people to like without replying now it means that the closest thing you have to go in is the amount of views the thread has since those are not unique views this is an assumption the amount of dislike for a proposal is also not really parseable from there either cons will take up real estate invariably meaning one of the other columns will have to shrink pixel wisei know that you can actually have more likes then replies now but that doesnt seem to happen too much

supported usual caveat of old trial accounts only nontrial accounts obviously have worthwhile stuff and have paid for the privilege of keeping their account info active in the system
 srsly fix bounties gets more attention than a specific mathematical systemso much for the module value database query i was tossing together
great idea i like it seems to be easy in both working in game and designing it for the game i too would prefer something that factors in killrights and probably skills to make a true profession out of it but with regard to simplicity i very much accept this proposal
i can see locator agents becoming more and more popular already
im not saying that at all i was just saying that people shouldnt deliberately do it to noobs who dont know whats going on to begin with if you want to try something like that with me a player whos been around for a few years and knows how aggression works thats fine but doing the same kind of thing to a noob who still hasnt gotten around to leaving the system they started in and possibly doesnt even know how is a different matter
so you want a tos that looks like thisi think notbtw that is the vehicle code for the state i live in just because a person doesnt know every word in it does not mean you wont get screwed over if you break the rulesignorance is no excuse
not that they can read anyway
actually the eula already does look like that guess what isnt thereyou got it can flipping people in rookie systems
probably because theres no reason for anyone to be in a rookie system after the first few days so apparently ccp didnt think it was necessary to write this in the eulatosbut going by the strict word of the tos doucheswarm would be banned they gank people in highsec which prevents the ganked people from enjoying the game which is forbidden by the eulatos
actually there are plenty of reasons to be in a rookie system they have belts just like every other system they have stations just like every other system they have agents just like every other system in fact a rookie system is exactly like every other 10 system with only 1 exceptionpeople start there maybe you should actually read the rules yourself before commenting because as the game rules state ganking in highsec is allowed quit being a troll
ccp annoy me with crap like this if they dont like something then bloody change it stop people being able to do it then ffsbasically dont allow cargo to cargo exchanges then its not hard
seconded if only so that i can create an army of indestructible noob ships
that right there is enough to tell me that if ccp states a rule on any website then it is a rule to be followed common sense says the eve wiki counts that was 6 numbers 25 and 26 state the following break the rules and get bustedyou would lose in court since can flipping is against the rules set forth by ccp if you failed to read the rules then how is that the fault of ccp
there is a bit in the eula or tos cant remember about ccp being able to cancel your account for any reasonthis is covered under that
what bothers me about it is the blanket protection given to new players in that they can ignore the warnings given for opening cans and its somehow the fault of others if they take a bait can no i dont can bait noobs if ccp wants to protect new players they should institute aggro immunity and prevent can flipping for new players inside of rookie systems limit it to 57 days and add in a tutorial that explains what those things are and that they go on outside the rookie systems and youll have protected noobs without the gms having to warn people who dont know its against the hidden rules if its not in the tos or eula as a rule its hidden

you are welcome to manly like me for now
the idea of using the like button to determine whether a threadidea is good or bad is not a good design choicei get it you want the forums to be more like facebook thats fine however for the sake of actually being able to tally up the total number of supports vs dissents there really should be a support and opposed button available for usand no not just a support button because that doesnt give a complete picture either both
i support for both buttons for a more usable and informative assembly hall

most of you would probably agree that it isnt very important but when i started playing eve i noticed these problems immediately and now that ccp has decided to make what they have better instead of making new things i think this the warp effect the cyno effect and many more things need to be reworked and modernizedyes it is just a shiny but without the shiny wed just have a spreadsheet and without the spreadsheet wed have a movielets mix the two together to recreate eve online the way it should be no more cutting corners
bump again
ummmm how can i say this nicely hell noooo
bump im still not sexy
i mean cmon people this is like the future and stuff this is space a guy should be able to wear a dress there is nothing wrong with this
amarr men already have dresses
also possibly assless chaps and a cowboy hat
with a face like that being pretty is the least of your problemssummary of eves last four expansions
assless chaps would probably sell better than the monocle even at 20k aur 1
is there any other kind of chaps
to be frank i dont know i am neither gay nor a cowboy and have never seen brokeback mountain
so you like chaps in chapssummary of eves last four expansions

supported that would indeed be quite convenient
i think the biggest problem is war decs mechanicswars are not slug fests like they used to be all it really is is station camping with a ton neutral rr i have not seen one wardec corp operate wo neutral rrother than that there is nothing really wrong with high sec maybe a few tweeksincursions  they are going good the pilots provide the bpcs and meta capital modules to 00 counterparts who refuse to do incursions maybe a small isk reward roll backstandings  some pilots made mistakes years ago while missioning and need a better way to raise standings with enemy factionsmore epic arcs neededremoval of insurance for people who high sec gankmissioning  would like to see a tougher ai in level 4soh and also there is nothing wrong with mining in high sec goons have proven already what happens if you cut off the ice flow in high sec if it really needs to be changed change the refine amounts not the belts
just bumping this as it needs to be seenlow sec does in fact need lovei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
looks good
i feel obligated to help keep this idea toward the top as it needs the exposure and attentionespecially since it would add new facets to the game that would help motivate new players to try their hand at low sec and maybe keep some of them out there and maybe just maybe itd help bring in new players or some of the old players that had left for some timei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i really like this idea1
i have no support for this proposal cool idea but it has to many things that could go wrong during game play besides i rather ccp do something about lag and improve the features that we already have in the game plus i hate to see ccp commit people to this program and it fail people could get laid off from ccp for a failed project the last thing i want to see is ccp fail on their game because they focused on a unimportant issue in the game with their time and resources i love the game to much
otherkin use dragon speaking what do normals do
i think this is a cool idea i have a couple of suggestionsno offense but knife in the dark sounds like something youd find in wow not eve perhaps something more simple ccps preferred style it seems and call it surpriseadditionally i think that this should be mandatory that the recon ship firing the shot have all weapons grouped to ensure optimal linking of all sensors finally the recon ship should have to be completely stationary this means that youre generally going against targets as you said who are distracted and arent doing much you would have to pick a target who is just sitting there it makes sense that to make a perfect shot you would want no movement in your ship i think that there should be a first strike computer that is loaded onto the ship taking up a high slot this module when activated links all of your guns it gives you a 50 reduction in targeting time it requires that you are not moving when activated nor can you move while it is activated additionally it prevents you from cloaking for 5 minutes after use of the module with this being reduced 10 for each level of the surprise skill this would add a unique skillset and tactic in this game which i agree is needed
two things first this is eve not dd i dont think that we really need the theifs backstab in eve i dont think itll really add anything worthwhile to do thissecond if youre looking for a line up for the perfect shot uncloak and fire run away screaming before you get killed youre thinking of stealth bombers which already do that quite nicely
no just nofrom now on when you have a horrible idea write it down on paper crumple it up and throw it away and spare us the blatant stupidityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
we also need some more healing spells guardians should be able to cast divine intervention and heal the entire fleet
please take your thieves and elves and backstabbing with actual weapons and never post about them againin all fairness what youve described sounds so unlike a spaceship game that i can definitely say it will never happen
flavour is off name is definitely off concept needs work but isnt entirely bad i could see a highslot module that uses an ambush tactics skill or some such to add a short damagerelated buff immediately after decloaking for balance reasons it shouldnt be the kind of massive alpha gank you seem to be advocating but it could work idea not supported in its current form but its not intrinsically horrible
i dont really see any valid objections ballance concept related as to how this would be overpowered or indefensible or what have you basically the odd troll no just nohorrible ideahealing spells i take you dont like anything short of theblobi dont know if you guys know this but with tanks in ww2 surprise ambush was actually widely praticed and it still is today in ww2 against the tiger 2 tank had to take it by surprise hit it from the top or from behind would be very hard to kill once it saw you and was positioning itself and spinning its main gun to absorb max damage with its front or lateral armor once it was aware of the danger knowing its own vulnerable points it would protect them it would be facing you making you shoot its front plating or spin the body around to position itself with buildings or obstacles at its rearit still is true for pretty much any military operation or army surprise is the first thing you look for in war in eve it doesnt exist because the fittings and shields and armor are what they are and no matter who shoots you or when its still the same from any direction and in any conditionsimho thats messed up but i guess thats too much to grasp for someanywaykeep trolling thanks
im not looking for a perfect shot before anyone can hurt me plenty would get plenty of time to kill the recon just have to pay attention
um you are not making much sense actual weapons what actual weapons ever hear about a sniper bullet hitting you through the windshield before you even hear the shot or have the chance to duck sooo aaaanyway
i would like this more a ship property than a module inherent to a certain ship class or ship i have not run the numbers much the 50 is just there to be there the bonus would have to be significant enough to warrant all the possible damage and risk to the shooter
not suporte4d inaf already with  loud off tiefs so with its hard to catch in corps wie dont need eny ader un til first not fixed
against it being a ship property since nothing in eve works that way covert ops ships cant become invisible on their own they fit a cloaking device dreadnoughts dont have some kind of a siege ability they fit a siege module the rorqual despite being designed especially for the unique action of ore compression does not have that as a special ability it fits an industrial coreparticularly since recon ships already exist itd be bad to simply add a ship property that just happens youd want an ambush targeting system or some such which would be an actual module you plug into a ship and which when active cycles only after decloaking to give a buff to turret damage that way you might fit it to any coverttype ship or indeed any ship capable of fitting a cloaking device as tastes differ but specific ships would have a specific bonus to using that specific module and thats fine thats how the game works
you want more damage its called overloading a weapon systemtrain thermodynamics get damage hardwires and use boostersi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
isnt this just s stealth bomber
not the same thing obviously
no its not
i disagree some ships get 90 web speed bonus others get 60 web range those are not modules they are ship properties
what webs arent modules nowa bonus to web range is an ability that only affects an active web module on your ship a bonus to turret rate of fire is the same thing a toggleable shortduration ambush bonus associated not with the active use of a cloaking device but with the deactivation of one nothing remotely similari could see there being some kind of hislot targeting system that could only work if you toggle it on while cloaked and which would cycle once on decloaking but trying to implement or represent such a bonus in a nonmodule sense would offer no clear way to indicate when the bonus was and was not active and would be radically different from every other bonus in the game
the ability is the bonus or whatever and the module is the web in my suggestion the module is the weapon the bonus is the critical strikewhy would something have to be indicated as active or not its not clear whether you will hit every shot or not its random given certain parameters my suggestion would work only given certain conditions are met there are many things in that you dont know will work without any clear indication of success or failure until its done such as invention hitting your target is another you dont know if you will hit until you actually fire in this however you can may succeed or fail if he locks you first or shoots your target first it wont work its pretty simple people are making it far more complicated than it needs to be
okay thats a very unusual sort of nonstandard bonus with no correlation to any of the usual sorts of bonuses no way of tracking it and no real reason to exist in the way it does theres no reason to add lots of extra work to the development like that for no reasonnot supported under those mechanics
yes it is unusual for what eve currently has its up to the dev team to decide if they wish to go this route or not eve currently has about 2030 different bonusesproperties which are spread across all the ships all the ships revolve around the same bonusesgun damage gun rof gun cap use rep bonus resistance bonus etc i figured it was maybe a good idea to think out of the box a bit it would have a correlation to the class of ship it doesnt need to have a correlation to any other bonuses what do you mean tracking itwhat reason is there for any bonus to exist they exist to differentiate between ships in some way or other the current system does this well but it does not really transcend a basic level of differentiation it does not push the envelope so to speak you know pretty much what each ship is capable of doing and 90 of the time i can guess the fit on every single ship i fight it is rare that a ship surprises me these days thats kind of bleh
uh what there are lots of weird bonuses out there that are dissimilar to everything else the rorquals industrial core can crunch ore down to smaller size cyno modules create warp points for cap ships gang links are only usable on a handful of ships smartbombs are entirely different from any other weapon system and so on in every case note that theyre represented by a module and the bonus is not a bonus to the ship but a bonus to the module when fitted to the shipmore interesting bonuses would be nice yes but like all bonuses in eve theyd be represented by modules
so is this one by guns this is basically a gun bonus modified by the ships class
i dont want to give myself a cookie
as far as im concerned if you sign up for war then its at your own risk and you understand the consequences of doing that people are talking about more highsec pvp well remove the militia boundary restrictions and open up high secnpcs such as navies and corporations that have a military arm should also still shoot the enemy too but be killable like normal npcs providing even more content for playersthis is effectively signing up for consensual combat which personally i think would be great
not supported would ruin the gamelike my comment if you feel the same way
not supported but at least give an an explanation to your post again if you are joining militia then your joining a war whats the point of just having it in low sec thats one big issue with fw you join to pvp you want to carebear then dont join a militia
this makes total sense from a game and rp point of view there is no reasonwhy fw is restricted to lowsec its war it should not be restricted to any location in game people can stil carebear its just at a risk same as any other wardecnpcs such as navies and corporations that have a military arm shoudl also still shoot the enemy too but be killable providing even more content for players
i would go with this proposal edited
it was my understanding from a purely rpg perspective that the empires are not actually at war per say the fw aspect of the game is more of a border dispute than a full on war thus the restricted ranges of engagement in other moreempireish systemsi think it would be cool to have fw spread into hisec but that could create a lot of problems in terms of balancing empires for example in other mmos that ive played you could take over control of certain areas but eventually one team will win or gather an insurmountable lead on territory in war that would happen and be great but in the game your then eliminating people from playing certain races and such i think i would rather have fw kept in losec than see ccp have to step in to reset empire boundaries from time to time
your right highsec should be involved but not int he way your speaking the npcs should stay the same in enemy highsecbut your militia should be able to capture enemy highsec switching npc movement yall remember cost of hubris mission how the npcs fight but they just self destruct why not make them actually fight or is that to much codinghow about when your attacking enemy highsec to capture npcs actually fight say a simulated capital fight meh idk ideasbut i totaly disagree that you can freely roam highsec would spread out militia to much and ruin fw
i think this is true but dare i say that it would stand to reason that faction npc military becomes nigh impregnable at say a 08 sec system and higher thus entering highsec endangering fw corp pos and would give more cause to fight in the militia perhaps include dust514 in this fighting for a greater cause helping to establish control of systems would defintely give more depth without absolutely crushing a faction it would be something to start losing up to half of highsec control for those involved in fw perhaps even for non fw in regards to market tarrifs to the encroaching faction that might finally give industrials something to fight over or at least invest to protect their bottom line just a few thoughts to incorporate into this idea
you  up the broadcast window half a year ago presumably to meet a deadline to switch to a new ui framework the new interface lacks features and readability of the old one and it looks like it was scrapped up by an insomniac programmer in two nights to meet minimal functionality which it probably wasthen you left it that way for six monthsany other software firm would be terribly embarrassed by such fail but somehow you guys dont have that problem and it pisses the  out of me that im paying money for that kind of complete disregard for quality and continuous pissing on the older player baserollback the old broadcast window or finish the new one ffsrumpps im writing this post second time because clicking preview apparently deletes it gg ccp
while i dont agree with the tone the message has a valid point the broadcast window needs an overhaul
lol i was just about to post pretty much the same thing it could definitely be better but theres no need for ranting and foul language
i have much love for the rorq just dont know what should be done with the ship i support you on this because i believe ccp might want to revisit on this ship should actually be useful to miners in 00 like myself so far its just a pos module that burns up fuel lol
get rid of offgrid boosting and i think some people will bring their rorquals to the belts
i dont think people would bring the rorq to the belts too easy to gank and suddenly your out 2 billit is good for compressing the ore  and a tiny mining boost  but thats about it
agreed the rorquals mining bonus isnt big enough to warrant it being sieged inbelt not as it currently stands if you were to go the radical route of changing the fleet system so as to block offgrid boosting then youd also need to buff the rorqual to make it a reasonable combatant otherwise thered be no point to it having even the mining boosts at all which would be a fairly severe change of role from its current state
it is a very large expensive target which is a bit rubbish for a ship which is ment to fly around i like the drone idea but only in the same belt so then your rorq has a reason to be there
if its a industrial ship then make it do something industrial in addtion to compressing ores refining them turning them into products a efficent mobile factory
that would be kind of awesome but actually refining ores onsite would entirely eliminate the reason for compressing them ore compression is cool on its own and probably shouldnt be superseded by a boring and economically dubious local refinery

im pretty sure that your beloved and respected colleague manny is taking a welldeserved break from the forums for a few days such is the peril of those who speak truth to power especially when said truth is spamming one word over and over and over again that works for buddhists meditating facing the wall or for the terrible posters on terrible fan sites with names that must not be mentionedwhat works for eve online forums is posters who talk about the game and their interactions with other players in a civil manner what works on your other forum is certainly not civil your good posts are the equivalent of a drunk teenager mooning passing traffic on the highway in the middle of the night that is to say of no value other than the vulgar entertainment of the people constituting the in crowdleaving the site that must not be named as a forbidden secret of the eve universe has worked better for that sites popularity than any other spruiking
hes not worth any moreand its not just cause a word is censored this is a matter of principle the fact that we have to dip and dodge around a filter to lo link to an eve fansite that despite some faggotry in eve online uncensored is completely harmless not to mention is home to the biggest supporters of eve and source of ingame news and politics kugu has done all this without breaking the eula nor supporting the breaking of the eula nothing rule breaking has gone on there except some harsh language even if they keep it censored what the fans of kugu want is answers give us a good enough reason why it should remain censored and most if not all will accept it but if theirs no reasonable reason for it to remain censored then stopccp can do one of three things1 continue to make lame excuses close threads and push us aside but we will continue until we are satisfied2 give us a proper reasoning behind the censorship 3 stop censoring kugui await to see their decision
the only part i dont understand in all of this is the ignorance surrounding kugu granted the legends and fables of evildoings and general faggotry surrounding the website are kind of interesting but the fact that people actually buy into said ideas is well sort of funnywhen i was a spacenoob okay when i was a bigger spacenoob than i am now i also experienced the shroud of mystery surrounding the kugu community but the reality is were pretty much just another site to shoot the  about eve and whatever else we feel like blabbing aboutthe censor doesnt really make sense to have anymore and if they were to lift it i feel it would show just how much ccp really has changed

eve news 24 is incredibly bias rivereni has a bad choice of words most things if not all things are exagerated by himkugutsumen is a place where we can display our own sides of each engagement the site does have its in crowd but as it stands anyone can sign up for kugu but not anyone can be a good poster neither will change
free fhc
the funny part is that its the most populated eve fansite which runs since 2007 and we never actually had any complaints related to the accusations we are receiving or in reality the excuses for keeping this useless filter with its population even increasing every year isnt it obvious that if any of this was really true it would have been reported over the years at least by a few people and instead of having its memberbase increasing it would eventually become a deadzone like shitheap but for totally different reasons if ccp really grew up and did take the honest road its about time to drop the egoistical nonsense that comes from the fact that the creator of the site did catch them once with their pants down and do what is only obvious remove this damn filter
why would ccp need to explain why you put your computer eve account and identity at risk by frequenting a site managed by internet terrorists who hack into other peoples forums to generate content for their site so they can make money off advertising and foreplay subs mula is begging for money on his forums his dreams would come true if he could get noobs coming from eo site unaware that he saves password in plain text format and then he can steal their eve accounts sell for rl isk so he can afford to bang more russian supermodels
if you use the same username and password for random forums as you do with your eve online account you deserve to get hacked irregardless its funny how false accusations seem to spread curious wouldnt in the long run that actually be bad for his site if he did that i mean word would obviously get out and people would stop going to the site so all revenue would stop from ads and foreplay kind of silly to take that risk in the slim hope some  uses same userpassnice try though also the users of the forum generate the content thats kind of the appeal of running a forumccps motto if it isnt broken break it if it is broken ignore it improving npe  dynamic new eden

great post
moon goo in hisec is an interesting idea actuallyit wouldnt at all be fair to implement at present of course given that the wardec mechanics have been totally nerfed by decshield type dodges but itd be kind of cool if there were limited amounts of valuable moongoo available to hisec corporations theyd need good standings with the relevant empire and the usual lpbased starbase charters possibly including more expensive lpbased mining permits as well and then provided a goobearing moon was available in their part of hisec theyd be able to mine it most likely theyd fill up fast and the good moons would be constantly under wardec thus introducing hisec corporations into the basic idea of sov warfare but with training wheels on given a revamp of the wardec system formalization of mercenary contracts would be an absolute minimum here then wed see some decent wars in hisec which can only be a plus and once people are starting to get used to the idea of fighting to attackdefend valuable moongoo poss its only a short leap to heading out into lowsec to grab even more valuable pos spaces or even into nullsec outrightid go on but this is really an idea which deserves its own thread
the expiration timer mechanism seems terrible the kind of thing to make a hauler pilot kill himself for sure there doesnt really seem to be any good reason for it either if youre going to have a big solar array up close to the sun or whatever that produces valuable but bulky fuel then the limitation to the stuff is already these things take up 10km3 apiece and youre done small enough that an appropriately configured industrial can haul them for biweekly supply runs but big enough that you might want to just take care of the months work with a freighter and be done with it do ensure that these things are in all respects normal items that you could sell on the market and let eves economy do the rest no need to overcomplicate things
id like to harvest some sunshine pak it up and keep it for  winter days plox
the idea behind the expiration timer was to create a very limited supply so that the batteries are a critical resource to holding sovereignty without the expiration timer you would be able to stock pile as many of them as you like and the act of someone attacking your production facilities would not generate the immediate desire to defend them these facilities should act as an alternate means of assaulting sovereignty
okay i see where youre coming from but items that expire seems a wrong way of going about itif structure that you can beat up to impose logistical costs on sov holders is the desired goal then why not just have solar power arrays anchored near the sun whose purpose is to reduce sov costs on a persystem basis but which stop working if theyve got any damage beyond their shields that way there are fields to burn that the alliances will actually care about but which are relative small fries that roaming gangs could hit as targets of opportunity
why does it always come back to mining why whythis game is about shooting cant we just shoot the sun or something its always 1 poor bastard that has to do all the work in these proposals
no this game is about shooting mining exploring politics economy wars pirates ancient secrets the vastness of space lore science and whatever you want to do in it so it isnt just a shooting game you wont even have guns or ships if it wasnt because of mining and all the other things i would also like to be able to take stars winds and use them for something i support that
it took me about 72 hours to get the eve client its just too longalso people who want to try out the game dont because theyve been trying to download the game for 48 hoursif the download time is reduced more people will play eve which means more money to ccp which will hopefully result in more eve development
try downloading it on something other than a 56k modem it took me an hour
not wanting to be rude but some people have better internet connections then others last time i needed to redownload the client from scratch it only took me 3 hours and i dont have exceptionally fast internet either if its taking you a full 72 hours to download eve its not ccp its youthat said ccp is actually working on this issue not so much making the client smaller because that pretty much cant happen with a game of this sort not at least without cutting features or reducing quality or any number of other gamedestroying things but making the installer work more smoothly and be more tolerant of interruptions and network slownesslike most modern mmos your game experience will suffer if you lack proper broadband internet if you happen to live in one of the sadly impoverished parts of the world that lacks full broadband access not saying anything about country this includes even lesspopulous parts of the us for example then it means longer download times more lag on your end and an allround worse experience this sucks but the fact of the matter is theres really not much ccp can do about itsorry for the inconvenience
my internet is fast enough am in denmark and have a 6 mb downloading speed which is about 13 mb effective downloading speed the problem though is that when i download eve not other files then the game gets downloaded with a speed og 160 kbs or something it takes roughly 24 hours to get down but people have to repeat their downloading attempts like 25 times eaven the offline installer have a friend he has okey fast internet he tried and tried to download the game had a problem with it more problems than petitioned it got a repair link tried it and more problemsthe way it is now people dont play eve because they just give up trying to download the game
and about them working on it well they should put more people on it so people can play the game
takes me around 40 minutes
hench thats so gay lol i have 3 accounts and do just fine no to this proposal
