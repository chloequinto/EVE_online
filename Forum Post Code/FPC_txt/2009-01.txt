i dont see how its possibly a problem when it comes to anything but bs vs bs dont expect to use ragefury against anything of the same size class by the wayif youre going to hit some in a bs get someone in to tackle if youre in a bs without support youre either missioningrattingplexing and you were gonna die if you got jumped or youre attempting to solo in a caldari ship of all things and you deserve to die anyway 1v1 bs combat doesnt happen mmkayif you want to use torps you want that target to be double webbed and painted which would happen in a gang if you want to use cruise you at least want someone else tackling since you should be far off lobbing missiles
um im not refusing to put any cards anywhere my cards are on the table entirely youre just refusing to look at them and believe what the hand was its certainly your prerogative to decide im doing some sneaky backdoor thing and given that all of this is public before and after the fact at the end of the day either ill have presented exactly what im saying i am or youll be right and im a sheister and you can crow about it on the forumsultimately my proposal is purposely open ended to give the devs room to be devs and you can believe what you will about it as youll know in the end how it turned outmy plans only got two points and if you somehow think that trying to bring more people to 00 wont provoke fights then cool if you prefer a system of 70 moon systems where theres a month of buildup before a single fight then fine if you want to go all or nothing with whatevers in your head then sorry thats just not whats on the table here removing posses entirely may very well be the desired end result but what im proposing is a transition as nobody and i do mean nobody has a workable mechanic for the end game at this point
i dont think youre a bad at all i think youre doing what most people do you want your plan to work and youre trying to put it out there in its best light i just feel its not being examined for its merit and people are just bandwagoning on change because they hope itll work i want people to go out there and examine the changes and be sure theyll work before implementing them because weve all seen how long its taken to even get this far god help us if we have to start againyoure own people are hurting the cause by stating on the forums that theyre supporting this bc theyre told to wo examining it and sadly im betting thats true for most of emif were gonna make this work its gotta be a full out revamp of the existing system because we all know rewrites are less likely to go through with the devs than revamps areim not against your changes for the most part im just saying their not enough and the idiots out their blindly showing support for something they know nothing about are hurting every measure of thisif me being a loudmouth is what it takes for the system to get a fair look at then so be it ill play that role well im just not gonna be satisfied with the this might work approachi do think youre completely wrong about 00 value though and the devs have had a record of reducing empire value in the past per your previous arguement so i dont think its beyond reason to ask for more devaluation of empire and stagnant value in 00 coupled with that the rewards of 00 need to be countered by 0 insurance or at the very least basic insurance limitations risk v reward i risk more cost of ships and space my reward is the fruits of 00
i have absolutely no clue what youre saying or trying to say though if pos were designed for small scale goals then that is a laugh they will be offlined more and faster this makes it easier for an enemy to attack because mostly do not care about you repping it up when they are not there but not using it when they are what stopped station ping pong yea that was terriblestarted big nap fests ah ha ha ha it didnt start them or even propagate themwhen has ccp reduced the value of empirealso it is a pretty unreasonable thing since its likely to lose them subscribers you arent saying that at all youre going back and forth between saying work work as advertised and saying its not enough youve no clue what youre talking about in either instanceedit oh i forgot youre the its the economy person no wonder
nobody would believe us if any one of us claimed otherwise so we dont bother and poke fun at it this subject is being discussed in considerable length on our own forum even by those that simply posted because they were told togranted the posts are generally cynical because it all hinges upon ccp doing something but thats the nature of the beastanyway im supporting the general idea of a 00 revamp which is the rather open op calls for and another another 00 round table perhaps one held in game or irc with moderated discussion until the next fanfest
i like these ideassigned
as for empire nerfs agent movement mission rat devaluation and removal of ice belts and standard asteriod belts just to name a few of the big ones
a lot of that had to do with spreading people out though to relieve some congestion in a few systems except they just moved the problem to other systems
those were not nerfs agent missions ice and asteroids moved to relieve congestion there was no loss of value all that happened was the people spread out to cause less of a drag on the serverand if you consider lag as a cost that people have to pay when they partake in an activitya reasonable conjecture then those spreading out of resources would have actually increased and not decreased the value of empire spaceas for the oveur quote yes moving guns outside of pos shields did indeed lower the barrier to entry to attacking a pos but you made no mention of the rev 2 changes in your statement you referred to pos in general
agents have been consistently moved to lower sec areas as a risk v reward issue its been a gradual move over time but most high quality agents have moved to low sec or border areas and im willing to bet the remaining few will over the course of time find their way there as well devs have consistently stated that it is as much about traffic as it is a risk v reward thingasteroid belts have been tweaked in several ways only one of them was the removal from 10s to relieve traffic same with ice mining spawn timers changes in rocks found in sec status areas etc have all been tweaked in less profound natures over the course of time to withdraw wealth from high sec mission rat devaluation was the biggest and most notable as it came with very harsh cries of im quitting when it happened mission rats were devalued on a level of upwards of 70 of their original values which were on par with 00 rats or better the loyalty point system was a setback to this even though it was designed as a feature not a counter to that huge nerf it has unfortunately re shifted more weight back towards the profitability of the remaining empire locations for agents as much as it has benefited all agentsanother thing theyve done with agents is a revamp of where their missions send you there are quite a few missions out there that attempt to send you into lowsec regions missioners found a way around this by buiding up their status enough to allow refusal of most missions like thisthe point is developers are not against throwing the hammer at empire rather than increasing the value of 00 just because the balance isnt there yet for the average player i mean really what makes more sense from a logic standpoint devaluing empire on current game mechanics because its out of whack or creating new game mechanics with new potential bugs and exploits so that 00 can be just that much better id rather they spend less time fixing empire so that that extra time can be spent elsewhere

ccp is looking into putting a skill trainer in a mobile app
ill be starting basic training in the army befor long and im sad to say i will miss out on a lot of sp even though i have been playing and paying for 3 12 years just because this feature has not been added
to me this feels like the highsec caps being kicked out a while back one of the last little bits of not gamechanging charm being sucked out of eve put it back
hear me out im not suggesting we remove them only that expand the baseas it stands right now we have basics 1 and advanced 3 so how about we step up to elite 5 skills
ugh no thanks id like more new skills that get me cool new stuff to play with
do you have any better suggestions on how people advance their training speeds then or perhaps a way that the skill set can be removed and yet the training for a stat remainthe way things are now 45k produces the 1 45m produces the 3 and requires level 4 of the 1 im just following the trail and estimate the 5 would be 450m and require level 4 of the 3 and while not for all would be logical to existthe other end of the spectrum is to remove the books and skill set and produce a nonrelated attirube building system you start at base can increase the base by 5 for 45k to 10 for 45m to 15 for 450m to 20 for 45b etceither direction is a suggestion im just giving a suggestion and requesting more input on how to implement such a suggestion if you dont wish to discuss plausable means then dont reply you can vote that we do not require such a suggestion or reply with better option in your view
or since learning is fine as it is we can just leave it alone
for starters all this is is an excuse to speed up training as your too impatient to play the gameand honestly adding to it or taking away from it is not a good ideano on both countsworks as intended
learning skills are a ty game mechanic and ccp has admitted that it was a mistake adding them they arent going to expand them
 this adding more learning skills is not a good moveas for quicker training times no
so you want to turn weeks of newbie block into months
ccp has already stated that learning skills were a mistake so it is rather counterintuitve to put in more learning skillsthumbs down
crap thisgame is turning into star wars galaxies nerf nightmare 2009 lol i am totally against nano nerf the answer is always the ssaammee in mmo games rather than being a profeessional world class paltform what ccp seems to brag about aalll the time they are just taking the lame weak i cant do way out shortcut and creating a huge nerf and creating massive lag in game performance with a useless nerf which does not solve problem anyways it just creates bigger problems to mask their inability to create a talanted creative solution ccp you claim to be a world classs inovative team of professionals isntead you just like the rest of the has beens out there just a thought from a loyal customer 
as jason guomindong and even banana torres about your economy thread have pointed out you are trying to balance all the game around rich 00 organizations and members of those organizations without any thought about the effects on the rest of the playerspretty stupid way to balance something try to think about the aftereffects of your suggestion instead of thinking only how you can have more fun for 10 minutes and after that start crying because the changes you have suggested have breached important parts of the game and the consequences are not of your liking
how does this benefit the rich and powerfulit gives smaller organizations a chance to do damage fast and disrupt larger organizations id say thats everything to do with anti rich schemes so please tell me how its pro wealth
added message as we are there your lp and isk were given to two random characters across eve sure constantly saving a damsel in distress is repetitive but that is a common problem in missions the point is that she is the mission target and you need to deliver her to complete the mission that allow all the for of griefing that can be done with a mission target item and the chance of losing it to accidents loss of ship and so on making this mission a targetless mission will change it a lot and not in a positive way
the idea is simple funny and makes sense removing the damsel is not a problem since the info about the damsels location has to be delivered to the player as clearly shown by this image just bring that thing back to the agent for further questioning and you have your mission item you could easily even make an epic mission arc that involves you traveling through space trying to rescue the damsel by raiding pleasure hubs and drug labs you quest would end with a final boss fight with bowser and you would get a kiss from the damsel and tons of coins as a reward
you would need to add the destruction of zors spawn as a requirement for completion otherwise a runner will warp in nuke pleasure dome and warp out immediatelyit does seem better to have that damsel remain lost however anyone promiscuous and daft enough to get captured by the same gang repeatedly is not someone you want roaming the streets
change supported but the drop item required for completition is a must because ninja must be able to ruin your did is some way
not supported op lacks brain power instead of hypel2fitl2play
just hashing this problem out with a corpie and our thoughts turned to changing the bonuses since the current ones just dont work  active tanking is too good in pve and too bad in pvp to be modified and the damage bonus just makes it feel like a wannabe megathron the alternative we considered is a bit outlandish but what if you took off one of its current bonuses and gave it the kronospaladin web strength bonus 90 webs in these days of 60 max would make it actually feel like a blaster boat and itd give it something it was actually better at than a mega while justifying its five mids this is fi stuff not assembly hall but its the answer that comes to mind and yeah i agree something needs to change somewhere ive got a hype kicking around rigged and all and it just feels like a waste of time even considering flying it its just inferior at everythingedit after reading the posts from gou below im pulling my thumb its not good at things id personally use mine for but the numbers do work and its no worse than a score of other ships im fine with i still think the web change is amusing but its not a serious proposaland never really was
no please in my opinion the hyperion is the only gun based gallente bs usable for missions i really hate the kronos it has no real advantage on the hyper and feel bad when used in missions changing the gun bonus to a web bonus would make it totally unsuitable for missions rails at web range ugh  with little use in pvp too unbonused blasters probably at that point ac or pulse lasers would be better
like i said its a halffinished idea at best also i lean more to stripping the tank bonus for it not the gun bonus  if were going to have a blaster ship it ought to blast well that said whats your mission fit i havent found one that feels any good also the kronos advantage is mostly in the fact that its a hyperion that salvages as it flies though the tracking bonus is nice too if someone can come up with a decent role for the hyperion as it exists now ill let this drop and probably go fit one up i just dont know what itd be

hii would like to direct the attention of the council to the ship fitting forum in the past 2 weeks read 2 years there have been posted incredible amounts of the imbalance of the minnie capitals they are simply put too weakread the many threads in the ship fitting forum and you will quick see what the issue isi actually voted on you guys i was at fanfest and your sale pitch was good now use your position to nudge ccp on this matterit is appaling to fly ships worth billion you just know will die first koz everyone laugh at its weak tanking abilities and no i dont want to fly other racese
go hereif the csm doesnt push for an answer to this old topic in iceland this time they really ought to be put aside for more useful programmes like hunting for exploitsand before some smart ass says that there has been a reply via it will be in the capital ships review they should know that im perfectly aware of what dodging the question means
first a single plexer can not render a system vulnerable due to the amount of plexes neededsecond defensive plexing also does not need to kill any npcs for fit any modules at all to the ship involved in capturing thus making it even easier to counter offensive plexing the caldari pervs corp gets basically all their vp through leeching defensive plexes they wouldnt exist if ashenshugar01 and me wouldnt be running offensive plexinglast why would anyone want to organize to flip the systems anyway without any rewardsfw would come to a stand still if there were no solo plexers as 90 of the people do defensive plexing because its easierbecause if im the 1 plexer by january 9th then ccp will have to take me very serious when i say that the plexing mechanics well suck and bring some computer models with me to prove it

sorry for the crosspost but its needed tbqfh
obvious thumb up is obvious
having read the very confusing thread linked to try to get an idea of what its all about i dont know what the problem iswould you mind expanding a little on what it is you see as a problemthe description just says the mission disappeared which could be a result of the runner declining mission no mention of whether the wrecks remainedeven if it was reset from a petition the amount of resources that would be required for ccp to verify if a given mission is bugged prior to helping the player would be detrimental to the overall game experience
therefor one can just ask for a mission reset even if the mission is wai
currently synth boosters are worthless if they were removed from the game tomorrow i dont know that anyone would even notice essentially it takes the same amount of work to make a quality booster as it does a synth but the synth doesnt give nearly the same returns for obvious reasons a 3 bonus for 30min is only something a fool would take seriously at 1115 million per unit i really can understand the point though i can understand the price i assume the existance of synths mean that ccp would like to see boosters in high sec to some degree yet 3 isnt really grabbing anyones attentionat least not at 30min after all you can hardwire from lp and do better this is what i propose1 change the effect entirely to either a 12 attribute bonus limited to 30min or increase the current from 3 to say 6102 an extenstion of the effect im thinking 2472hrs this could be done by research on the part of the manufacuring corp or just attached to the biology skill when applied to synths and only synths though i would perfer it be based on the corp and not the player 3 increase the prodution runs possible in order to drive down the price4 move synth production out of low sec take away the risk of synths and thereby lower the price of synthsthe point is there should be somekind of real advantage to synths or they shouldnt even be in the game what you give up in product potenecy you should game somewhere else you either have to make the product more useful or bring down the costrisk of production especially the latter since this is suppose to be a legal drug if is so legal why can it only be made in low sec not to mention the raw materials can be moved anywerei believe that forces high sec corps looking to get into the maket into low sec to produce and sell a legal product back in high sec which doesnt make sense to me especially when were taking about a 3 bonus
i will support point 1 2 and 3 but in no way 4i do the whole synth boosters production chain solo and while it is hardly a major rewarding occupation i feel good doing my accomplishment and being just about the only supplier of synth boosters in the eve universei am mostly in favor of point 4 if i read it correctly meaning as an increase of production run output on a single run ex 10 instead of the currently 1 a decrease in materials for production run input and reducing production time would have a similar effectright now the amount of final products seems a bit tiny compared to the massive amount of time invested in producing them
csmccp meeting linkage0020 public pos arrays  according to ccp making pos arrays public is technically impossible because the jobs require a local hanger and this would interfere with station ownership of the structures themselves shayne csm serenity steele asked for different ways to address the lack of public slots first off i have a problem with the catchphrase technically impossible technically difficult or better yet a technical challenge would be more acurate if ccp was capable of developing the game from scratch then they must be capable of changeing how it worksa system could possibly be established to give the pos owner the ability to establish bays within the corperate hanger array something simillar to corp hangers in npc stations with different divisions these bays could then be rented out to other players or corperationsthis could also open up the possibility of refining arrays assembly arrays and ship maintenance arrays being made publicly available at a fee of coursean alternative would be the development of the smaller personal hangar array and personal storage silo with the pos owner having the ability to provide anchoring rights and service within the shield of his pos if the renter defaults on payment then the personal hangar array becomes offlined and after 2 weeks unanchors

the csm was a pr move nothing more nothing lesswhile minor changes may come from it no major code will be changed based on its recommendationlikewise no corporation is going to open themselves up to a truly transparent review by customers elected in what essentially is a popularity contest with no real look at any qualifications for the job
im sure that the person who came up with the idea years ago disagrees with you who are you to say that its a pr move when the idea spawned long before everybody heard of it lets see now you are starting to messure the effectivity of the csm by how much code we can touch i think thats a really bad metric we can touch the whole damn codebase but if the situation of eveonline doesnt change then it doesnt matteri can think of several things that the csm has affected weaponstacking thats a fairly complex thing obviously theres much complex things but hey we have only been here for a little over UFFFD year you cant rewrite the whole pos system in UFFFD year when you need design documents and things like that first ccp also have a queue for which things programmers dowho said they should are you another one of these omfg the csm is an auditing body which became because of the t20 incident
so when i need 100 of 2 types of datacores whats that work out too about 250 hours of exploration

n1 idea
well you seem to understand the essential nature of the problem so now if you can explain also why in the world you would choose caldari and spend 54 mil sp to train its skills i can feel better and find a reason to continue to play ps 5 years ago when i started to play caldari was a decent race to train but so much changes for years fcked it up obviously
signed dont make caldari more pathetic wasted my training time also now they got me for another 6 months to train turrets sniff sniff i smell something the bs ccp is putting out hey they r only wanting to make money and im sure they have a master fckup plan for turrets too lol
no they have not they have not moved from high sec to low sec moving down in sec rating but not crossing the barrier into space that is not protected by concord actually increases the rewards without increasing the riskno they were not the rat devaluations were coupled by salvage and lp it was entirely offsetand purposefully and saying that an entirely offset change is a nerf is disingenuous 1 you do not need to make new game mechanics in order to increase the value of other space 2 you are just as likely to add new exploits when changing code to reduce the value of empire space as adding new code for new mechanics3 devaluing empire is not necessary to fix the problem of whether its out of whack out of whack is a relative term that can be fixed as easily by increasing the value of the other space which is not valuable enough4 if you believe that 00 is dense enough in its individual production capability then you really must not have spent much time there even if you dont want to increase the value of individual production you need to increase the production density because systems only supporting a handful of people is one of the larger causes of sprawl in eves 00
would love to see the sov system get changed it is a bit of a pain currently
yep good idea
excellent ideas to eliminate the stalemate and boredom involved with pos support and sovereignty 9 thumbs up
i support this
i operate almost exclusively in 00 without alliance membershipsupport our small corp manages to make a good living this way we dont see other groups like ours though and you have hit on some of the reasons not easy out here i support ideas like these that will encourage more small independent groups to move out into deep space
00 is highly profitable people just dont know how to exploit its riches for the most parttheres a small 20 man group in fountain that has dealt with every hostile and its brother they manage to pull in about 7 bil a day between them wo any moon mining their cost for doing this about 30 mil a monthpeople want the 1 hit wonders to wealth they dont like working for it there is a value to risk in this game already that people just dont understand my apologies if rkk has an economy on the same scale as all of goonswarm but maybe we really are just better than you
black ops are highly specialised ships and should remain so however they are currently too limited to be of practical usegiven their very high cost fragility and limited practical application i would like to propose the following changes1 fuel bay seperate from cargohold2 use of covert ops cloaking devices3 a slightly longer jump range perhaps 12 light years more4 enable use of covert cyno in cynojammed systemsgiven that these ships have very limited gridcpu and often require faction fittings to get a workable setup it can cost more to lose one than a carrier or dread they are exceptionally fragile and not being able to utlise a covert ops cloaking device means most stay in hangars collecting dust that combined with the chore of a very limited cargobay for fuel means that black ops in their current form need a major buff this will not make them overpowered but will hopefully get people to start using them as more than a curious and expensive novelty item
i do like that ccp introduced them prenerfed but its about time they got something extra1 fuel bay not really needed anymore since you can bring a transport ship with you still its a viable argument though2 many ships traveling with black ops combat recons stealth bombers transports cant use covert ops cloaks and i would never want to make black ops a solo ship however as advanced as they are maybe its worth giving it to them3 it should never be longer than capital jump range that just doesnt make sense less or equal but not greater4 this is good cynojammers are really only to prevent capitals not all jumpbased traveltheyre main role should still remain subcapital jump logistics and shouldnt really be awesome solo ships their usefulness and survivability should still come from the gang that they supportill wait for more discussion to throw my support out there
possibly change the covert ops cloak to a black ops cloak 0 scan res 0 speed penalty only able to be fit on black ops no warping cloaked and possibly the ability to bridgejump cloaked would also like to see a lil more hp like 5 these things are technological epochs then the t1 variants and possibly some increased resists like the 2nd poster said the fuel bay is somewhat a moot point at the moment due to the transport change i have never used my widow for jump bridging into anything other then a gank i did not even get on the km due to the scan reso and forgetting my scan script and then back out so i can not comment on the cyno jammed systems also as a transport for lute i would like to see the bops possibly be able to pull anything smaller then a cruiser hull through the portal rather then just covert ops and recons limited numbers 20 tops per ship thoughts
to address your concern about them becoming solo ships if they had a covert cloakthis simply would not happen unless the pilot was exceptionally wealthy and stupidblack ops bs are weak battleships they have limited grid and cpu and as a result limited dpstank that combined with their prohibitive cost makes them exceptionally poor solo ships the lock time is also dreadful 20 seconds to lock a battleship if you fit a faction cloakif youre going to solo you would use a pilgrim or such and find its much better for it allowing them to use a covert cloak makes sense given how fragile they are
ban em to heck with the economy they cheated and thats that it is after all a game it will survive

cant take a hint
if you train learning v basic learning skills  v and advanced learning skills to 4 it takes over a year for you to catch up to someone who didnt train any learning skills you want even more advanced skills that means even more insane times to wait until you get actual payoff if you actually knew how learning skills worked you would know this alreadyyou suggestion is idiotic and you didnt put any thought into it what you want is a trap to waste players training time skills have a basic and advanced version nothing really gets a third tier you get cruiser to v and then each t2 cruiser goes to v you get a gunmissile to v then the specialization to v it doesnt continue forever and ever it endsskills that do not give you any benefit ingame are the worst they make players quit the game and dont give people reason to log on and play if you get mining barge v you log on and cant wait to play again if you get learning whatever to v you switch the skill and go play something elsei troll stupid ideas this is a stupid idea
thisjust give everyone 10 to each attribute and take this godawful mechanic out altogetherneed a button to actively disagree with this terrible post
jesus no
im against the nano nerfgive webs and disruptors alternative bonuses and all be ok
oh yes lets add to the pile of petitions for mission running harassmentthe same petitions you claim that are broken which is hypocritical in itself
changing the repair bonus to a web bonus would again kill the hyper as a mission ship but maybe could make it a better pvp ship my fit it is a pve fit based around the ship repair capability with gallente bs at 5 and marauders at 4 the hyper still has a edge there increased by the larger number of rig slots and higher base armor hpthe kronos with the lower base hp and limited difference in resistances has problems fitting a similar set up as it will have a lower hp buffer so less time for the repper to do his work so5 350 mm rails 3 425 mm currently they are a mix of prototypes and dread guristas guns i prefer the slightly longer range and less cap use against the gallenteserp version the dread guristas are equivalent to caldari navy and cost less 2 tracking computer ii cap recharer ii heavy cap booster frx pwnt target painterlar ii and depending on mission 2 or 3 hardeners and 3 or 2 mag field iirigs auxiliary nano pump nanobot accelerator the one i gave aways as a gift had 2 auxiliary nano pumps and the nanobot but so far i havent felt the need to add the third rigthe ship use a lot of cap but a ammo load and a load of 800 boosters will keep up for a whole mission normally barring ae that will require to reload before the last room the ship kill easily bc and up and decently cruisers the drones kill from frigates to cruisers the salvage on the fly thing sure i have seen that using a golem and it is wonderful done with the kronos it dont work so efficiently hard to finger why maybe because you are spending more attention managing the guns and ammunitions for the different ranges and keeping an eye on caprepper cycles and so on so checking tractor beams and salvager is more of a bother than in a golem naturally for a lot of missions the domi is still the best gallente ship but it is nice to have the alternative of using a gun ship so to cap it up i prefer the hyper to stay how it is today
do not touch the hypes bonus one of the few ships that gives active tanking a chance in this game in pvp vs static tank gheyness if you go after the dmg bonus it becomes even worseyou have an extra midslot over the mega for a second web or eccm no ship is going to be able to perform every role in eve to 100 the hype is a fine pvp ship and even missioning leave it alone
thats more or less what i was thinking wow your mission philosophy is totally different from mine ewar magstabs injectordependant and 1 lar yeah i wont be adapting that any time soon  i fit 2 lar and natural cap stability on a kronos never mind a hyperion if it works for you great but it just looks weird to me also who cares about hp theres not a battleship in the game that doesnt have enough hp buffer to do a mission tank and not care keeping an eye on cycles i think thats the different mission fits cropping up again  i turn on my tank when i jump into system and then spend the whole mission shooting and salvaging works quite nicely imo its a fair position i mostly threw my idea out for discussion  i didnt claim it was necessarily good itd make the ship better at pvp and worse at pve which i figure might raise its overall utility but clearly you disagree thats fine i cant exactly claim youre wrong just curious about what people would think plus i enjoy theorycrafting
i cannot help but wonder how in the world this got produced the hyperion is a pretty good ship and the only thing that could really work to make it better in a reasonable fashion would be for an entire shift in the tanking bonuses across all the racesamarrcaldari would go to ehp gallmin would go to resists1 the hyperion can easily active tank and fit a full rack of guns8x ionmwd injector web web scramlar 1600rt eanm eanm dc mfsrep amt rep amt rep cycle2215 warriorsstd exile1000 dps 663 dps tanked 86k ehp 2 webs 1250ms overloaded its more efficient than a megathrons passive tank until about 2400 incoming dps an abaddon at about 1400 incoming dps if you take one of the webs and make it best named you can run 2 mfsdrop the plate where your tank is better than the megathrons until about 16001700 incoming dps and you will actually do more raw dps4 dps less in the hyp if you dont have spare lights and are assuming di 5  your reps will overload for 3 and a half minutes and they should be running like that pretty much any time youre taking damage in excess of 550 raw uniform dpsif youre going for full on crazy tank 2 lars is a massive tank and can fit with 8 electrons an mwd and two heavy injectors though i do not recommend this2 there is nothing wrong with active tanking in fact with rigs overheating drugs tier 3 bsie high base hp bs with bonuses to either active tanking has increase in strength relative to passive tanking the break points for where passive tanking are better have gotten higher since the hp boosts which contrary to popular belief were neutral with regards to the balance between ehp and active tankingespecially if youre seeing an increase in smaller ships due to the web nerf which will typically lower incoming dps active tanks get much stronger compared to ehp tanksfor some of the math behind this and the actual break points see herelinknote this is using a tier 1 bs in its comparisons which has a predisposition to plates due to a low base hit point values and the ship has no bonus to tanking3 the extra med slot on the hyperion is crucial in differentiating it from the megathron utility med slots are more important than ever nownot that it ever changed and the ability to fit more webs a sensor booster or supplementary ewar cannot be understated 4 you should be missioning in a dominix anyway gallente do not need a mission battleshipyoure just plain wrong the hyperion is a pretty damned good blaster ship ironically if you take a standard plated hyperion vs plated megathron you end up with these numbersmega 115436 ehp 1085 dps 822 ms 4 ogres 2 mfs neutrons 2 plates eanm anpcant fit eanm due to cpu dc heavy injectorgoing to medium does not allow 2nd eanmhyperion 113795 ehp 1160 dps 852ms221 2 mfs neutrons 2 plates eanm dc medium injector keeps everything running for 3 minutes and if youre running your mwd that long youve got problems hyperion gets an extra webmed slot with which to play around the extra web will make its effective tracking better than the megathrons though it may have a relative disadvantage the mega would not depending on the target shipif you run 5 ogres on the mega and 4 on the hyp your dps numbers are 1204 for the hyp and 1148 for the mega megathron gains 14 ehp and the hyperion gains 69 dpswith full drones its 48  this makes the hyperion a strictly better passive dps boat than the megathron before you consider speed utility meds and overloading potential even if you add a ctype anp to bring the megas ehp up to 12006055 over the hyp the hyperion is still more efficient though only slightly all hail the tier 3 bs hp bonusto reiterate im sorry youre wrong

the problem is that api only works where your corpalliance has the killing blowif the api could be used to draw down all kills you are involved in id agree entirely
the api thingie have already solved thisit is the killboard admin own fault if he accept unverified killmails from unreliable sources this goes 2 ways  do not give your api to an unreliable kb admin if no one will trust you with their api  try to sync with the killboards that got the apis
i still fail to see the value of any kind of kill mailits almost as if it wasnt really the original intent of the gameits nothing more than a ego trip if you where going to track kills it should be simplifiedbut thats me
because if you kill someone with the help of another group and a member of that group gets the finishing blow they get the km meaning they can edit you off it meaning you cant prove your killpersonally the only change id like to see to killmails is for everyone on the km to get a copy even though this would probably mean we have to wait till downtime for the km to arrive
i have never understood the obession with kill mails
fyi this rumour is rife within eve i have not started it or would never have dreamed about saying such rumours myself i am voicing what many players within eve have heard isnt this what this topic board is all about what i object to so strongly  is that the topic was blocked  censored so quickly would this not in its self add suspicion and fuel to the flames of rumour
well i did heard that rumours to be honest bob always had new tec items from no where apparently i do believe there is some people provide them your last topic been closed so i asked myself what is the point of worry about a little topic why should ccp administration close it in such panic
you werent censored the topic was closed censoring you would be removing your posting priveleges for putting up an idiotic topic in an inappropriate place since you were able to post a second idiotic topic in an inappropriate place you havent been censored
with foresight yes this topic would be idiotic but i am just voicing what is circulating within eve if the moderators wish to remove these topics then so be it  shoot the messenger comes to mind 
not an idiotic topic at all but i dont see anybody else who have heard that rumourif it is true then it makes unfair game with the advantage for band of brothers of course
the mod answered your question
the only basis for fact in this is that a couple years ago bob got a few t2 bpos illegitimately which were later taken away other than that theres no truth in it the stats on what devs play in what corps are not public but the claim at the time was that there were more goon devs than bob devs the cheating was one idiot not any kind of sinister conspiracy let it die
what makes this an idiotic topic given current events and historic events coupled with monotonous rumors shared on teamspeakventriloskypeetal this is definately not an idiotic topic granted it is not the most comfortable to ccp but what the heck they can pretend it isnt like they do with so very much else
dons tinfoil hat
your question was answered and then closed if you have proof instead of rumorz you read on the internetz feel free to post themalso what are we supposed to vote on in this thread
what question was answredthere wasnt any question obviouzlyin 2005 bob did get some new tec 2 modules for a battle ship which were not released yet of course i do believe there is administration workers who supplie illegaly masive corps or alliences with future modificationsi am sure in ccp there is not only bob which got their worker there but others large corporations or alliences
this is a quality thread right here
to be honest i missed the early days of eve but im pretty sure that they were awesome since noone would play today if they werent unfortunately it is true that small scale pvp does not have any strategic purpose nowadays still it can be a lot of fun but the current soveregnity mechanics encourage players to create bigger powerblocks and more epic battles and of course even more lag im not saying that jump portals cynos capitals should be removed since theyve been part of this game quite some time now but their purpose could changei have a vision if we would define jump portals as corporationalliance ownedbuilt stargates that would be much more interesting everybody could seen them on the everview camp them they would work the same as stargates except their usage be standing based as jump bridges are and of course capitals couldnt use them for example to drop 4 titans defending a cynojammed system againts a fleet of subcapitals
this has already been pushed through during the first csm ccp said they didnt see anything wrong with the design but would look at them more in depth during an upcoming capital review
id like to see plexes turn into more precious elements to captureessentially many plexes are spawned in order to spread out forces so that we dont get the superblobs in 1 place i totally agree with thishowever if you make plexes challenging and more valuable to take there will be fleet commanders who will take up the challenge to capture themthe philosophy behind plexes shouldnt be well if we just make it easy so its easy for people to take so they get involved more easily and well just play to the lowest common denominator and expect pilots to be lazy if that is the reason then youre diluting your responsibility as game designers to make enjoyable challenging games if you make it they shall come make the plexes challenging and people will take up the challengeso its supposed to be a challenging involved and fun part of the game it has been said many times faction warfare is for new players to get used to low sec so that they can go out into 00 less afraid so ccp doesnt want people to get trapped into faction warfare except there are people who truly just want to enjoy faction warfare its what they want to do in eve some of these people may never want to go out into 00 for alliance sovereignty battles so there is an obligation to make it interesting and involved for those who want to stay who will train the new players who will become comfortable to go out into 00 and so on
can anyone enlighten me and other players within eve  wether or not this urban legend is true or false many rumours circulate that bob have modules and a certain advanced titan and various skill books that yet have not been released if true  this points to the fact that high level bob members are actually ccp employees  if true this gives a serious exploit of the game and unfair advantage to bob corpcomments input  and banter welcome 
let me quash this rumor now  the answer is nobob do not have advanced titans or unique skill books given by ccp devs if you have evidence to the contrary please alert internal affairs at internalaffairsccpgamescomthank you
maybe if he know that about 3 day in advance so stop whining on a false premise
nooope this whole thing is a waste of our timeseriously this is entirely based on the premise that some individual filed a supposed petitionof which you have no proof of other than said words
i thought they used heavy water for the covert portalstrange but yeah they need a lot of fixing anyway
im pretty sure they use some sort of fuel
nevermind the titan one uses fuel while the covert ops one doesnt
the black ops only uses capacitor to create an portal
ill agree that synth are to ow impact to really bother with atm a change would be nice
well since eve is a game wich hightech ships  im sure all comms like pointjam and soon should be visiblesupported

i understand the need to have made the change for pvp but it has disrupted mission running there has to be a happy medium somewhere
and how often do they play what is the barrier to entry and secondary costs of their operationhow dense is the productionbecause iirc exploration where we are is not nearly that productiveand its boring mind numbing requires large swaths of time concurrent and is very sparse in the amount of people it allows partake are there gas pockets out thereyes there is a value to risk in this game unfortunately that value is for the most part very negative youve shown yourself to have a good misunderstanding of value in the pastsee its the economy linked in yaays post above yaay  luckyduck complaining that inflation was occurring when it was simply an increase in wealth why are we to trust you now without evidence
changes are usefull by definition since people have to adapt learn and face new challengessigned
actually enjoi posted later exactly the same thing i said incase you dont remember he said that the deflation in the game was actually masking inflationary pressure and the roles should reverse in timeweve also come to learn recently that a big pos scam was contributing heavily to faulty t2 market prices which in turn aided deflation in the game without that scam more of an inflationary move would have been seen as a result the markets are now slowly catching up and within the next 6 months well likely see some heavy inflation in t2 markets that are more of a marker than the panic adjustment thats already occuredthose markers will still be negatively affected by unreasonable environmental factors like the faulty insurance systemso if what you mean was i was right there i must be right here ill take it thanks for playing next
so what youre saying is that you dont know what youre talking about and arent going to back up the 7bday claimgot it note the pos scam is not deflationary deflation and inflation are purely monetary phenomena the pos scam was a supply shift for a single good not inflation or deflation similarly t2 price level increases which would have been caused by it would have been a function of increased demand for a single good and not inflation or deflation whether or not there was going to be inflation would have been entirely determined but whether or not the money supply and velocity were increasing or decreasing not whether or not supply of a specific t2 good that doesnt increase t2 prices all that much hit a fairly inelastic section of the curveinflation is when the money supply gets higher without the amount of stuff being traded getting higher
oh this is good ok let me make some guesses since you for some reason dont want to tell us this invaluable piece of information that would actually make your argument not look weak as  and if it really wasnt  youd spurt it out since youre ing yaay for s sake and you cant shut up about anything since youre borderline ed unless its an argument made entirely out of  and youll be laughed out of the forum when you actually present it in its full form instead of hey guys this guy i know told me he made hella isk why u not making isk perhaps u nubi mean its not like youre related to this isk scheme since youre hella rich from being the big mercenary fc and  how did that go anyway i heard the last alliances that hired you promptly disbanded maybe youre just some secret alliance hitman no wait youre too ing incompetent to do something useful unless its a sheer ing accidentbut i digress my guesses youre not doing anything with farming missions or the cosmos since those are obviously unique to npc fountain so it doesnt apply anywhere else youre not doing mining since there wouldnt be a 30m a month cost for just running some macro hulks youre not doing ratting since the one system you have isnt big enough to keep 20 ratters and if youve managed to get 20 guys to click scan every 180 secs for any period of time long enough to be worth making an argument over then yeah youre totally better than meso with that out of the way what is it youre doing in fountain that makes 7bn a day and if all of bob is making 7bn a day not even counting the moon mining or taxes why arent you all in titans why arent you even able to pos spam a single backwater goonswarm systemand most importantly why are half the ing people in motsu bob or gbc if 00 is so profitable as my homie sun tzu said to ask that question is to answer it
acutally while its obvious that yaay doesnt know what the  hes talking about inflation is generally used to simply describe a rise in prices unless speaking specifically about monetary policy or some gay  of course the only prices that have risen enough to be worth talking about in jita are some raw material prices but others have gone down so overall the prices are statistically mostly the sameactually its more commonly used to distinguish ed gots posting on the internet about some  they dont even understand but used to try and add sophistication so they wont be called out on their ed 
actually you got me really interested here what exactly can be so profitable yet boring enough to be called work that its worth doing i mean 7bn in timecards thats not ing much unless you work at burger king or something then again you guys keep saying the 10 usd for sacom access is such an extortionate sum so perhaps you really are that poor interesting nonetheless
a general rise in prices not a rise in specific prices this is why inflation measuring techniques use a basket of goods and not a single good because the pricing of single goods are more subject to supply and demand disruptions which would otherwise throw that offedit i should note that yaay claimed that inflation was happening without the price increase and now is claiming that a single instance of a price that rose due to a supply disruption means that he was right about inflation
actually it was 20 guys ratting mining plexing and low end moon mining and reactions as for the entity it really doesnt matter who it washell ive spent 1 day ratting solo and made 450 mil 150 off bounties 150 off loot 150 off rigs approximately and that wast even a full day nor did it include 1 rare spawn at the end of that day i made an additional 70 mil off a hauler spawn
when t2 ships become more expensive theyll effect the rest of the economy bc other ships will become more viable heavier use of other ships means more increases in prices inflation is the devaluation of money there are about 20 different definitions on what inflation is its very hard to say exactly and most economist will tell you just that ultimately the markers of inflation are more money leading to higher prices what that means is that my money is devalued and im more willing to spend extra on goods since the cash means less to medeflation is the increase in value of money in the us right now theres a big concern that deflation is about to hit heavily because everyone is so concerned about spending cash ie this dollars more precious to me today because i might need it tomorrowyou are taking half of my equation and saying the answer doesnt make sense enjoi stated the whole equation just as i did and both of us were right and contradictive to you both of us said inflationary pressure being overshadowed either way if you want to argue this take it to the other thread or convo me one day in private
i like what i saw on the first page and i am sure if anything useful had been posted in the later 13 they would have been added pi prefer industrial pos stay on moons and sov pos get moved to planets only difference being that pos anchored to planets can add to sovereignty and industrial pos on moons can not leave they way pos are fueled fitted manned and gunned aloneas for planetary resources i do think having lightly protected defenses and destructible objects be anchored on them in areas around the planet is a good step its a new income stream and isk sink at the same timethey make good goals for roaming gangs but their should be some effort required to destroy these items tho something that a well fitted and select hac gang of 10 can do with some level difficulty but imposable to do with anything smaller then this their should be some logistics required in taking these assets like blockade runners needing to follow the gang to carry the lootmy fear is if its made too easy then small gangs could rip billions off alliances while they sleep doing it in small hard to catch gangs other ideasyields should not be hourly but maybe daily these new anchored structures should be player buildable making it easier to replace once destroyed new planetary silos should not be restricted to the warp in possibly set a range limit on them they should also be scanable this would require some searching for planetary silos by not making it a very easy warp to 0 search of planetsthings the planet could offer well i hate fling to empire to get ai offered parts to use so how about planets yielding ai offered pos partsenriched uranium  oxygen  mechanical parts  coolant  roboticsalso having a manufacturing force living on the planet that could build things only ai offer depending how you setup the planetstarbase structures  random ai items  probeswhy not small yields of moon materials since they would also be available on planets the mining technique being less invasive on the planet would thus be slower with lower yieldthese are all good fixes as for making 00 more profitable my hopes are pinned on artifacts unstable wormholes and tech 3

i flew a panther for a while but wasnt too impressed with it in its current form the cargo bay is definitely too small and theyre just too expensive for their capabilities1 adding the fuel bay is a great idea everyone that goes through a covert portal uses your fuel and often there just isnt enough to go around having to refuel from a blockade runner just isnt the same as having a decent fuel capacity2 ive put some thought into letting the blackops use the covert ops cloak i dont think this is overpowered as they cannot stand up to a conventional battleship and yes its crazy to try soloing with one expensive ship to lose that being said the force recons arent really major combat ships and covert ops frigates have practically no combat ability the idea behind the covert ops cloak is to have the ship scout ahead of a main fleet and cyno through the blackops if blackops had the warpwhilecloaked ability it really would change this dynamic a more through investigation of this change is warrented if it is allowed it should be harder to fit the ship with things like weapons and such 3 they really do need a longer jump range probably not too far maybe another lightyear or 24 using covert cynos in cynojammed systems seems logical but i havent done enough 00 operations to comment further on that bottom line they need more ability to justify that price tag
this isnt enough youre turning them from the worlds worst taxis to a very limited taxithey need something that will make people want to buy them other than wanting someone to move a few ships for them something a carrier does better for a similar price while still having huge offensive and logistic benefits and way better insurance i say give them cov ops cloaks and a base speed increase while cloaked then make their second bonus a range bonus making them easily engage to 200km
i would think that having to bring a hauler with you is a smart game mechanic that is more fun than just adding a fuel bay makes you bring more people with you yeah adding the covops cloak would change its role completely if you do this you really have to take the full step and make its primary goal covert jump logistics it wont break the ship but it will definitely change the ship no big problem with either of these changed my mind on the jump rangeslightly off topic but adding more gangsized objectives by decoupling industry pos and the sovereignty system would create a larger niche for this ship class maybe the ship doesnt need a boost but rather a boost to the scenarios the ship was designed for which at the moment are nearly nonexistent
me thumbs upblack ops not having covertops dosnet make sensethe whole point of black ops is to be heard but not seen is it nothell even if you removed the speed bonus still would be a sweet niche to have

learning skills are a novelty in themselves people attempt to use them as a means to a end but they fail to recognize that perhaps to some the learning skills are a end myself for example i have trained all my learning skills to level 5 and several of the science skills to level 5 not because i am using them to fly a titan but because itt is part of my character i am a academic by trade in real life and learning is the crux of my eve online character i would gobble up any science or learning skills that would help me become a better academic but aside from role playing it is not as if anyone is making you train the learning skills the current situation of learning skills as put by some of the more advanced or older players is that there is a tradeoff when deciding to train learning skills or other nonlearning skills if ccp were to implement the new learning skills then how would the situation change from where it currently is most people would still not learn to level 5 yet the option is there while i am in general not a fan of the skill system i see no impediment in offering higher rank learning skills to those that want to train them i would steer clear of discussing prerequisates however since it is sure to incure a fight
seriously someone post it in here plx  just give a skill credit of those points put into learnings and we can be done with them forever o

eve needs game type specific recruitment channels currently with over 6oo members actively looking to recruit or join corps very little can be easily read in the channel adding channels would for one help as a filter and second would reduce the total channel count by a factor with the number in channel reduced the amount of spams would be lower and would be easier to readtypes of channels may beindustrial  pve  pvp  empire  outlawwe should keep the original channel and only add three to five specific channels looking for other possibly channel names new allaround corps could continue to recruit in the recruitment channel to appeal to players of all game types maybe changing the current recruitment channel to general

so let me get this straight a plate hyperion is better than a plate mega i would hope were going to compare a tier 3 bs to other tier 3 bss else i just say that the abaddon is good since it can melt an apoc in a ing contest unless its at rangeso we have a 5 bonus to hybrid damage to make up for not being able to fit a full rack of guns the ship should have been designed for these arent rails these are blasters and the ship doesnt have enough grid to really use eitherfor gang shyt the mega outperforms by miles in falloff a mega can hit things that are just mindblowing this quickly becomes a the hyperion has an extra midslot to make up for not having a hardwired tracking comp argument im not going to pay 30m extra for a bs that requires me to use up the extra slot i gained to make up for the lack of utility of its tier 2 counterparti dont recommend it either those breakpoints are nothing when five or six bss are involved hyp quickly becomes useless except as a solo ship where its inability to catch anything meaningful becomes more the fatal flawif those bss are using rrs they either have another bonus that is helping them or get a bonus to the effects of incoming rr hype in an rr gang is some kind of sick joke where you dont do anything better as compensation for your useless selfdirected repper bonusmy argument is very very simple making the hype use one of its bonuses in a way meaningful relative to other bss requires it to gimp its ability to utilize its other bonus its almost as bright as the the typhoon layout except the phoon gets lots of niches in damageneut rolesyou can fit rails but no active tank under any circumstances you can fit a full rack of neutrons but only by giving up tankspeed you can tank maybe better than a passive drake for a time but only by giving up almost all your damagehyperion does not have the tools it needs to actually make itself noteworthy for anything and certainly not the things its bonused for
wait youre saying that tier matters when discussing roleit does not what matters is whats the best and the hyperion is better its even better when repping but that does not mean that it cannot perform as a plated gank shipi have no clue what in the world youre trying to get across you can fit a full rack of guns the ship was designed for you cannot fit a full rack of neutrons and a rep so what you can fit a full rack of neutrons and plates you can fit a full rack of ions and a rep and a plate and a heavy injectoryes its not surprising that the gang ships are better when you have a good sized gang amazing that that does not mean there is something wrong with the ship it means that the ship does not do what you want it to but it still has a perfectly viable and useful roleif you want to fly in gangs train railgunsfly a dominix its the best rr ship in the gamelast time i checked 663 uniform dps tanked 86k uniform ehp and 950 dps was not giving up almost all of your damage and tanking only as well as a passive drakefor gang stuff yes but only with rails the extra med slot fit with anything else is much more useful than the tracking bonus which is really not all that great as ranges increase eccm sensor booster tracking disruptoralso the hyp does not cost 30m moreand my argument is even more simple and backed up by mounds of datait does use its bonuses in a meaningful way
me too
the difference is that what i am saying is true
unfortunately its the primary method alliances use to audit their members to ensure they are participating in necessary opsi would love to see killmails include not only the victim and those who inflicted direct damage on him but alsoanybody who performed logistics help ie remote repping on both damage dealers and victimanybody who used ecm webifiers and warp disruptors on the victimanybody who used any other kind of targeted beneficial action on both damage dealers and victimanybody who used any kind of nontargeted beneficial action ie gang bonuses on both damage dealers and victimthis way the alliance leadership gets a better idea of who was helping out on the kill without everyone having to scramble to attempt to fire at the victim before it pops especially those who are fit specifically for logistics or electronic warfare its very difficult to get on a killmail despite having helpedback to the op i somewhat agree with the poster who mentioned the api helping out a lot with the problem of unverified killmails however i would also like a way for others perhaps even just ceos and alliance leadership to verify the kill mail via a link ingame our outofgamerelated to that issue perhaps ceosalliance leadership could have an option to view kill and loss mails in the context menu when rightclicking on their members
it already does this fyi
well at least that makes sensebut these days kms only get waved around like a bunch of stupid epeens
any form of aggression gets you on a kill mail only thing is remote repair modules dont cause aggression you will never know if your target was remote repedit would be nice that players and corps could receive mails on kills they were involved with as for accuracy easiest thing you could do is require ceos or directors give api keys this way all mails for each corp are properly posted this removes manual entries from the process all together no manual entries no forging mails no hiding mails as wellmost alliances dont do this tho it ends up making the kill board a intel board for hostile alliances
introductioncurrent wardeccing methods are onesided as the agressor basically pays off concord to look the other way for a week several fixes were suggested but i believe only one way will make highsec wardeccing balanced basic proposali suggest the corporationalliance being decced being able to stay the war by meeting the same isk required to start the war if the payment is done within the first 24 hours of the wardec no hostilities may be started between the two sides otherwise there will be the usual 24 hour cooldownexamplealliance a pays 100 mil to start the war with alliance b alliance b now can pay the 100 mil to stop the war at anytimesidenotesthis will be another way for players to interact with each other by fighting with their isk and not their ships a determined attacker can still attack but no longer gets a cheap war against a defender thats willing to pay the cashofcourse there could be other variants of this which might work better such as a bidding war where the deccing corp can respond by paying additional cash to concord and the defending corp can again bid could make an interesting isk sink
so all youd need to be completely safe in empire is gtcs
your proposal has good intentions but you run into a tugowar with concord fees being bribed back and forth until one goes bankrupt or loses interestvictory conditions are still the best route but just saying it isnt enough the solution to balancing wardecs requires a lot more than thatand even then most noobcorps dont make that kind of money to start off with
ummm nosuch a change would not really change anything newer corps composed of new players would not be able to buy their way out of a war and thus would still be targetedbig power block alliances however would have enough resources to buy their way outthrowing isk at a problem is never a good game mechanic as it favors gtc sellers and wealthy players terrible idea not supported
successful troll is successful the mod answered the question the thread is still there this board isnt for rumors or myths its for actual suggestions on ways to make the game better edit  heres the link to the original troll thread
in before thread lock
let me say this much some ccp devs are part of bob some are also part of goon and the other alliances heck there might even be a dev in a small corpthe devs play this game and thats how they can monitor such events as the pos exploit i dont know who is in what alliance or even if there are members in a certain alliance but ccp has said before that they play the same game we dopersonally i think this sets ccp apart from the blizzardclones they love this game that they built and want it to continue thats why when the t2o scandal came out it crushed the people at ccp gamesso in answer to your question some members of ccp probably are part of bob this is not a bad thing but rather a good thingmy 02 isk
you are a huge idiot if you believe all of those wacky bob rumors yeah they have magic clients with zero lag and secret tech 55 items that let them win every battle right i believe that with zero proof some guy on the internet told me oh wait now another guy told me confirmationwhat a gullible moron instead you should be wondering why your friends are telling you lies and who the real bad guys are
confirming that the two posters above me are bobdev spy altsyou saw it here right here on this internet screen you are looking at this very momentit must be true

if you believe there is a problem with the gms youre should send a mail to internalaffairsccpgamescom theyll take care of it
i sent a regular old email to the internal affairs team which is just as reputable as the rest of ccp these days hopefully the cheater will be stopped
you realise aswell that it is still a time of year when a lot of people are out of the office due to holidays rightmight there maybe a bit of a skeleton crew onboard atm
i thought that the gms were player volunteers who helped out in any case i would put cheating at the top of the list to be fixed this has been over a week and was reported by more than just me
how would you know they are macro miningso far all everyone ever mentions is they dont respond to communicationswhich says nothing than they dont talki may be mining on my client but i could be glancing to my second screen watching a dvd checking the web coding a website and not even realize im being messagedyou might want to think about that a bit before fingering a gmif it was that easy to track they would have started nailing there asses to the wall long agopeople tend to forget these little details ps speaking for those semiafk miners

i completely support bringing more light to this topic i have many good memories of scouting for freighter runs to and from my 00 home systems into empire space i have many good memories of running fights of small ship groups that would span many systems another significant change from those times to now is the proliferation of bubble technology in those days you had to anchor a bubble and mean it all these interdictor bubbles werent popping up all over the place
keyword envisionenvision and reality are rarely the same
this the article written by randomwriter86 about the possible role of the csm in the future is a much less reliable source than the current guidelines of the entity their role is not that of detectives they are simply a link between idea people concerned players complainers good and bad and of course the developersseriously ccp isnt gonna jeopardize their reputation by taking the exploits lightly ive got no problem trusting they have things under control
oversight takes real big money and real power an elected council of paid employees that answered to the players whom hold real power over all other ccp employeesthat will never happen ceos dont ever willfully give away power and authority over their own especially when it means spending more monie
shows how much you know
killmails and these killmails arent real shall we say that alliance is the initiative i believe this should never happen in new eden and move to strike
rabble rabble rabble
i second that rabble and move for a mistrial 
look mom im in a goon thread
i invoke the chewbacca defenseladies and gentlemen this is chewbacca chewbacca is a wookiee from the planet kashyyyk but chewbacca lives on the planet endor now think about it that does not make sensewhy would a wookiee an eightfoot tall wookiee want to live on endor with a bunch of twofoot tall ewoks that does not make sense but more important you have to ask yourself what does this have to do with this case nothing ladies and gentlemen it has nothing to do with this case it does not make sense ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury it does not make sense if chewbacca lives on endor you must acquit the defense rests
unfortunately its the primary method alliances use to audit their members to ensure they are participating in necessary opsi would love to see killmails include not only the victim and those who inflicted direct damage on him but alsoanybody who performed logistics help ie remote repping on both damage dealers and victimanybody who used ecm webifiers and warp disruptors on the victimanybody who used any other kind of targeted beneficial action on both damage dealers and victimanybody who used any kind of nontargeted beneficial action ie gang bonuses on both damage dealers and victimthis way the alliance leadership gets a better idea of who was helping out on the kill without everyone having to scramble to attempt to fire at the victim before it pops especially those who are fit specifically for logistics or electronic warfare its very difficult to get on a killmail despite having helpedback to the op i somewhat agree with the poster who mentioned the api helping out a lot with the problem of unverified killmails however i would also like a way for others perhaps even just ceos and alliance leadership to verify the kill mail via a link ingame our outofgamerelated to that issue perhaps ceosalliance leadership could have an option to view kill and loss mails in the context menu when rightclicking on their members
it already does this fyi
well at least that makes sensebut these days kms only get waved around like a bunch of stupid epeens
any form of aggression gets you on a kill mail only thing is remote repair modules dont cause aggression you will never know if your target was remote repedit would be nice that players and corps could receive mails on kills they were involved with as for accuracy easiest thing you could do is require ceos or directors give api keys this way all mails for each corp are properly posted this removes manual entries from the process all together no manual entries no forging mails no hiding mails as wellmost alliances dont do this tho it ends up making the kill board a intel board for hostile alliances
so long as it comes with the caveats mentioned i dont see why not

yes it matters who the entity was youre gaining benefit from protection in many different waysdefine 1 day because if youre claiming an 8 hour day then youre saying you make 56m iskhour ratting which is really impressive and doesnt mesh with my experience or that of anyone else i know and of course 20 people doing it would require at least 10 systemsand if you mean 24 hours then you make 1875m iskhour ratting which is below empire level 4 ratesof course these numbers assumed you never took a break or were interrupted for any reason and so are a bit lower than the actual iskhour you would have to achieve in order to make that kind of money
supporting to make my life more fun
about 56 hours of actual game time hard to pin down time bc it was over christmas spread out between family events
so youre saying that ratting in 00 is 75m iskhourseriouslyedit assuming your 150150150 numbers were correct then youkilled looted and salvaged a 1m isk battleship that dropped 1m isk in loot and 1m isk in salvage every 24 minutes for 6 hours of gametimecolor me skeptical
speaking from personal experience 20 mil an hour is what you get ratting in 00id imagine that the paranoid 100km above belt point ravens make half of thatthats not counting faction spawnstheres no need to buff 00 spawnscreate a game mechanic that allows small gangs to steal whatever moon pos produces not all at once but like a slow process almost like mining the pos owners should get alert evemail that someones stealing their stuff so they can come defend itif you have that you get more roaming gangs more pvp and a chance for nonmega alliance people to make some decent money theres no reason why the mega alliances should safely pocket all the moon stuff to themselves without ever putting their jump bridge using jump freighters at riskif they want to own all those 100s of moons they better be ready to actively defend them and not the way it works now where they leave and forget without worry

one lvl4 agent can supply at least 300 pilots with 25m iskh without any problems with 1 account t1 bs and without faction fitting  maybe 40m with faction fit maraudernow put that 300 guys into an average 00 systemtry to imagine that  roflif you dont want to play eve in singleplayermode you can run missions in small gangs but more than 1 ship shooting on the same beltratspawn is a waste of timei know you can do exploration  did it myself buf if you factor in all the time time for gangingup scanning hauling loot and not only the time you spent in good plexes iskh  funh is not so shiny supported
i agree something needs to be changed and like some of the ideaswhat about just making the sun the sov claiming point you have to have a special pos which  can be a nice isk sink could interfere with dds when in close proximity to the sun onlyyou would still need pos at moons for logisticsminingeven so i like the two main points darius posted from the meetings and think they are steps in the right direction
exactly what im saying
after reading some of this thread i was going to suggest this simply borrow the bunker mechanisms from faction warfare make it as a new playeranchorable structure works like a pos but with much more defensive capabilities the rest fits perfectly in this perspectivethat should be the first step to take in my opinion
so very signed

already happening afaiktoo overpowered not to mention not as useful if ur ship cant kill anythingcould help but not that importantalso supposed to be happeningsorry but those options really dont fix the ship
doesnt 00 take care of thisof course i may be wrong since i am new
pvp happens everywhere in eve
against itwhy because war deccing carebears is super carebearishwe have more regions in this game where you can fight everyone even without a war dec and a sec hit than we have empire regions so dont be such carebears and move your butts to the real action
noobz r not our targetz of choice there are other targetz in hi sec than noobz anyways thanks for the bump
if you are at war with 3 corps and have spare capacity you should be decing more worthwile targets not more targets

sounds like a reasonable first step to getting nonlaggy fw workingi presume that ccps present send us an email notification of fleet wars system is going to be made dynamic for allocation of servers in fact giving systems with large fleets in them a server automatically would seem reasonable to me
why not offer textmode eve then theres no point in going into a fight if you cant see anything who is giving you how much damage i generally prefer simple damage notifications whos drones are on you what are your drones attacking drone ai sighi support this cause
i would like to see the time required for learning skills cut significantly if it really was a mistake and too late to remove them the least ccp could do is greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to raise those learning skills all other skills are fine as is
currently you take a mission you decline it because its a stupid missionmining misappropriation you then get the next mission enemies abound which you dont do you just go mission focked if you decline that mission you take faction hit corp hit and agent hitonly option is to move to the next agent how far away is that next agent is really importantdodixie 2 agents in the same system motsu recently got messed up but is 3 jumps from mosthow about we fix that make it so u dont need to be in dodixie or motsu for missions to be done consistentlyfirst an agent can offer you say 10 missions these show up in your journal you do the missions you want in that batch you still can only decline 1 every 4 hours so instead of declining 1 and getting stuck on the next bad one you can decline 1 do a few even if theres another bad one there it doesnt get you stuckthe 10 missions dont allow you to cherry pick because its the same 10 missions that you get anyway you still decline 1 every 4 hours so either you get stuck in the long run or do the missions slowly1 casual players dont get to cherry pick neither they have to go through the same 10 missions regardless 2 you only get new missions once all 10 are done3 the  10 isnt a real  lol it can be 5 or whateverwhat this fixes is the need to move agents and getting stuckit also fixes the bug and necessity of making petitions over declining a mission and getting the same missionyou can get 310 of the missions being enemies abound decline one and the next isnt stopping youthusly this ends the necessity of bother gms with petitions
amazing ideaif we could get this and view contract details on right click of items i would be sooooo happpy
pro
balance around is not equal to benefit with this idea you try to introduce something damaging for large organizations but you forget that the effect will be even worse for small organizationsie your meter for balancing is what it will do to bob goonswarm and so on but you forget to consider what it will do to a 2030 man corporation without an alliance
ok lets consider what will happen to 2030 man corporations with no alliancethey will get steamrolled same as they do now do you see any 2030 man corporation with no alliance on the sov map on tranquility no you dont they dont exist they put up a pos and the big bad alliance drops 30 dreads on it and one cycles it ill tell you this a 2030 man corp has a much better chance vs a 200 man alliance then they do vs a 2000 man alliance or a 20000 man coalitionas for wah wah my poor high sec pos you get at least 24 hrs warning in the form of a war dec poss are meant as alliance assets if you 20 man corp can only manage one guy to log on for 2 hours a week then poss are not meant for you so sorry high sec pos alone should never be in the game in my opinion so arguing for them is a moot point really a faction large pos in high sec is virtually invulnerable and nothing in eve should be invulnerableas for the original ideas they are good nerfing cynojammers and jump bridges in the same system is a sound plan that i believe we will see in the next pos update
im going to go with supporting this discussion but not the proposed changes because i think the problem with pos warfare is the same as its always been it has too many effects on too many aspects of the game from a caldari industrial pos standpoint to the minnie deathstarsi would be very interested in a redesign that would allow small alliances the capability to make grabs for territory ie the large powerblocs consolidating themselves due to defensive needs or etc right now there are many organizations within eve new and veteran alike that strive toward the 00 endgame but tbqh what can a small to medium alliance due with a handful of caps and a decent support fleet when placing the first tower gets a 4 titan 237 lockdowni agree that the large powerblocs should be able to competently defend their space based on participation from their memberbase but at the same time small and medium sized alliances have to have headroom people can say go to lowsec but to be honest lowsec has been worthless and impossible to secure since warp to zero was introducedlowsec industry is not really viable minerals arent much better than highsec risk is much higher the lack of bubbles dictors and hics prevents any kind of regular industrial back bone while the rules around gcc aggression timers and sec status force securitypvp pilots from being able to secure the systemnow as a counter point yes it is possible with scouts good fleet coordination intel channels and other assets to complete a successful mining op in lowsec the difference in nullsec the lawless space of eve is that it is much easier to shut down a system for a major profit while lowsec is more difficult to complete a successful op while being worth only marginally more than the same op in a highsec constellation without securitypvp pilots and also if in highsec and you had the same participation levels you could have the pvpsecurity pilots hauling or running lvl 4 missions increase total operation profitobviously there are ways to pull off lowsec ops and lowsec life however not long ago lowsec was the breeding ground for alliances to build themselves up and prepare for npc 00 and later to make a grab for claimable 00pos warfare lowsecs lack of profitability and daily operation warp to zero the rise of the multi titan powerblocs and increasing profitability of highsec have turned small alliances into empire alliance and renter alliancean increase to the vulnerability of poses and sovereignty defence would hopefully pull the powerblocs in closer to themselves allowing for more groups to populate 00 in between them and hold their own but with the current mechanics in place its either rent or empire for most non affiliated alliancessome people may see this as a whine post its not im just pointing out things ive noticed when i hear some 2 week old character pipe up in alliance chat asking why dont we go carve out our own 00 or something to that effect and in response with the present state of things theres no point theres no endgame in watching your medium fleet attempt to defend your 1 system worth of towers while being titan blobbed and outnumbered 31 in localalso as a disclaimer this has not happened to my alliance im not whining about some big alliance ruining my day over the years ive been in a lot of different alliances and fought with many different accounts in some of the major wars eve has seen the instant reaction to a small unrecognizable name in nullsec is blob blob blob some more and then theyll go awayshould small alliances be able to attack the heart of delve and pull it off no of course not but a small active alliance of say 100 pilots not characters should be able to hold a system or small sub constellation without the 75 dread pos bashing fleet and 56 titan blob coming piling through at any momentgrammar editjust my thoughts fly safe allmcfly
i can overheat almost every other active mod i have it would be amazing if i could overheat a damage control especially for those that love those close fights that end with someone dead and someone at like 10 structure this could make or break in pvpi dont think it would be tooo overbalanced its not a racial mod those least likely to use it are shield tankers and even then a majority of them still use itas far as what the overheated stats would be that can still be up for debate but this is just a forum to bring an idea to ccp and let them work from there really anything but lesser cap usage would be win p
supporting my own topic
after ccp atropos trolling in this thread ive decided to post here and hopefully bring a longstanding problem with the game to lightthe problem is thisif you dc any drones you have out are dead as npcs will happily shoot them in your absence if its in pvp this isnt much of an issue as there are more serious problems but in pve this can become a huge isk sink especially to those with less then spectacular internet connectionsthe simplest fix i can think of is make it so that drones cannot take rat aggro if the owned is offline so that pilots can at least go and pick up their drones rather then having to buy a whole new setit would be a change that hurts no one and benefits everyone as everyone dcs now and then and every ship bigger then a cruiser fields a set of drones
id support a disconnect automatically issuing a return to bay command so that if they get back before you align and warp theyre okay id also like to see a solution to the problem of coming back in 50 km from your drones  either the ability to reassume control or a system where they at least fly back to any beacons around if you failed to pick them up i just hate watching them die once im back in the mission zone because i have to slowboat my way to scooping range its not a huge issue  ive lost my share of drones but i dont mind too much that said these are easy fixes and they seem reasonableedit one thing i forgot to say  why are you referring to atropos posts as trolling that generally implies bad faith which doesnt seem to be in evidence here
id also like to support thisor at least the timer idea for 30 minutes if you log back in your drones return to your control with no scooping needed coupled with the fact that the scooping process is bugged sometimes drones dont get your skills applied to them if you scoop them from space i think this is a really needed change
full support
this is how it would work   as you make a ship active you are given a randomly generated licence like  cmv89xu for instance and thereby registered and added to a database with your name attached to shiptype  this licence is how your ship would be visible on scanner  shiptype and licence instead of current shiptype and shipnameagents could be persuaded for a reasonable sum to give up the name of the pilot when provided with a licence if you have the nessecery standings and the agent in question is in the same region as your target querycustom shipnames can still be used however they would not be for public viewingto prevent exploits  licence to a ship would only be given once per pilot upon ship activation that is  you do not get a different licence every time you activate will add more later
me notices no text in postget the telepaths out
supported ofcourse
i dont get this idea one bit now that you editted it in what does it even change
whatwhy
clarification  if you have ever used a scanner you would notice shiptypes in range  direction and their names  these would be replaced with a static licence plate the result of this change would effectivly remove the choice for individual pilots to remain identified  anonymous while visible on long range scanners
have you considered the effects on the databaseand what would happen if you repackage a ship
if you repackage a previously activated  registered ship your licence would then be suspended  still attached but not active the same way as with the ship  activation of said ship on another client would then reregister it with a new licencedatabase will ofcourse need to reserve some of its resources to this shouldnt be alot
personal attack removed navigator
are you aware of how many changes that need to be done to support thiswhen items get repackaged they lose all their unique instance attributes and thats how they become stackable thats why you cant repackage a damaged modshipdrone for example stackable items inherit their attributes from base classes in the database so that simply means that the current db architecture is not adequate to handle such a taski could elaborate further on this concept but it would take pages to describe it properlyconclusion impossible to do it that wayeven disregarding the above another issue would arise unique id generation lets say i assemble my ship the server has to make it a brand new license id programatically this is done by picking a random id checking it versus a list of all ids already present on the server if a match is found generate a new id and repeat the process until a valid id is generateda valid alternative would be prefetching a separate computer generates a huge list of valid unique ids very lengthy process then they are integrated into the current database during downtime etc in a new table that includes two fields or maybe threefour one would be the id itself the other one is a boolean field that determines if it is already taken and the optional third not too optional if the agents idea is implemented would be a reference to the character using that ship in the character table and then another field would be needed to reference the ship itself or to hold a reference to its classnamein the case of running out of valid id the server has to revert to the first method of picking ids just the image of players assembling their new ships at jita all day and night long scares the crap out of any db designer nonetheless with this mechanism introduced in placein both cases the ship records will also get a new property id lets count how many ships roam eve every daynext case ships blows up ship is repackaged and sold ship is transferred through contracttradeetc to another character the server has to amend all of those records with a new id and delete the old one or if optimizations are in place at least alter the records on the fly to change them to their new values how many ships blow up per hour in the eve universe and how many new ships get assembled every minutegood luck with your suggestions although due to technical limitations and all the db overhead i mentioned above i dont think its likely to be implemented any time soon
this is a valid point however  it does not have to be a database nightmare  licences could be registered in a continuous nummerical translation  that is  player activates ship  licence number 124566 is assigned  translated into a set of numbers and letters representing total count of activated ships  so you always get the last number and therefore the database would never need to recheck with existing licencestracking individual player activated ships is already taking place so im assuming it would not be a difficult task to translate existing protocols into a system that lets players identify for instance a wartarget on scannerin addition  locator agents are currently only providing location of a named character  it shouldnt be alot of hassle to add ship designation to that system as well
the problem is with your mechanism ids are not reusable ids that were used then discarded are not going to be ever used again unless the server does a full iteration of all entries and reindexes them and that brings us to a condition where what you describe here will inevitably cause an overflowregardless it is all a problem to the person who integrates this into the current system there are always workarounds what i was merely explaining is how this affects the current system and what consequences it has if ever implemented from a technical point of viewand from a technical view the effort greatly exceeds the expected gains from this cpu cycles and db space could be put to many a better useedit actually a more straightforward solution to the matter at hand would be removing the ship name from the scan window altogethera smart player would change it to something like cargo container anyways

by empire implants i mean the learning implants the 1s to 5s1 00 has the disadvantage to high sec that carebears will be able to train faster because they dont get podded2 allow pirate implants to continue existingremoving these learning implants means being in 00 doesnt mean the carebears are training faster and eventually will have more sp then you do just because they are safe in high sec also by leaving pirate implants ingame it creates a giant demand for them which in turn boosts 00 even more
i run 4s all the time 00 or otherwisei do not support your whiny envious proposal
learning implants are fine you would be supprised at how many 00 dwellers have 2 or 3 implants in their combat clone not supported

now that the blockade runners can come along and a proposed fuel bay which idealy the blockade runners can be droping fuel into plus the ability to jump into jammed systems using cov cyno this essentially balances the ability to move ships around and such but it doesnt change the ships ability to pvp which they are horriblenow with the new ability to jump into jammed systems these ships could be used in conjunction with steath bombersthe ability to drop a high alpha dmg with reasonable dpsidea being uncloak fire recloaknow pos are pretty slow at locking ships if you do it correctly you should be able to strike and cloak before the pos locks onto youtake singallente blackop you could adjust the ship to allow xl hybrids with a respectible dmg bonus also it gives the ship pretty good dps and capability with proper balancing it would make it quite good
this is a great idea except for the fact that black ops were never designed to be damage dealers if you want that fly a marauder and they can even fit cloaks tooa black ops is a logistics assistantutility vehicle while it could stand to take some more damage it was never designed to deal it unsigned
yeah this is exactly what i was going for its just a matter of allowing skillpause permissions across the same account
while were at it how about autopausing skills when clone jumping if sp calculations getting messed up is supposedly a problem can people trying to pop my escape pod please get a dialog explaining that they are unable to pod me due to difficulty with updating the sp values when i lose my implants

every mmo that i have played has had a serious problem with ingame currency here sellers and while nowhere near as bad as some eve still does have themi have thought about a soloution for a while and looking through the common features of this highly irritating spam 90100 of them always have a link to a website and is done by botsmy proposal to fix this is simple a block list for just the urls of the isk selling websites so whenever the url in complete form or with minor modifications ie spaces in between the letters or any punctuation aswell is contained in a chat message the message simply will not allow itself to be posted in the chat channel with an error coming up explaining which word is censoredto clarify only urls of isk selling sites should be censored nothing else this should please everyone and maintain eves sandbox feel while cutting down on annoying lag and spam from a service that is a breach of the eulato stop this being a lag generating feature this list should possibly be in the client not the server and updated in patchesfor ease of use possibly another section of the petition function designed for the input of urls to be censored where the devs can go through the suggestions and add the urls to the censoring list
how about a rightclick option to both report spammer and blockwow has that and its a good feature took them years to get around to doing it but still a good feature
it could work but most spammers are just on trial accounts so reporting wont do much all they would do is just come back with another trial accountmaybe make it so trial accounts cant send messages quite as often it shouldnt affect most people all that much but it will hurt the spammers possibly restrict the amount of times trial accounts can repost the same message in a chatroom theres lots of ways you can go around slowing down the spammers but id like to see them gone completely
this not perfect but certainly helpful also ops proposal wont work theyll just switch to tinyurl try censoring those also lowering speech rates for trials seems like a good way to make newbies nonfunctional at asking for help its not like spammers send three messages a second youd have to limit them to like one every few minutes to make their spamming even somewhat less functional that seems like a terrible thing to do to trial accounts
problem with filtering links is they evade the filters ie wow had a problem with peons4hirecom for a while they blocked the url so they started using 3line spams with peons 4hire and com at the startthrottling chat in rookie help based on character count not line count would be a good start since they tend to shovel the whole sales pitch into one linealso disable external website links in rookie help
what longterm solution do you propose as for the idea itself reasonable enough its not a perfect solution but it doesnt hurt anything and itll clean things up somewhat
fit one 1 rcu or pds and you can fit whatever you want
00 are the barbarian wildlands full of crazy people warlords pirates pioneers explorers gangs and pocket empires00 is not meant to be self contained
in theory you trade with the other 250 players doing exploration in that area giving out your unwanted datacores and decryptors and getting what they dont use in practice most 00 has little market trading and those datacore stay unused in some player hangar if ccp will implement the possibility to get some agent in 00 player owned stations as some people suggest it may change if that is not done the only other source is exploration do you want a i have the skill i will produce them without the need of agent or exploring mechanic building them out of tritanium

i cant believe a total mining revamp has such a low profile considering how much people cry about mining profitability as a wholeoh well
you raise some good points you got my support
any kind of change to t1 industry and mining gets my vote
i heard you can make more than 30mill an hour mining abc in a hulk in 00 sounds fine to me tbh 8 hours one day of work and you can buy a new ship as for empire veldspar is more valuable than ever and newbies and assorted carebears love it i dont think profitability is a problem however i do fondly remember times of 20032004 when youd go to 04 mine jaspet for higher profit or even ninja mine crokite in 00
a very well presented and thought through solution to a crucial problem 1up
isnt new asteroid exploration coming in march i know ccp has talked for a long time about moving asteroids to an exploration system i am not sure if that will be coming in march or if they will be changing any of the mechanics beyond flying to beltx i sure hope they do
the positive aspects of the missile changes  as noted flycatchers vs intys etc  are all well and good but overall these missile changes simply dont workas drake pilot yes i fly it in pvp im used to having to choose either dps and a sucky tank or a good tank and possibly a scram with crappy dps fine but now literally any other battlecruiser can speed tank my heavy launchers without even needing to use an afterburnersome of the missile boats simply do not work period and before you all launch into cry more noob bring a target painter and web name me any other battlecruiser that cant put out effective dps against another bc sized ship going at stock velocity without having to use up 2 tanking slots on capburning modulesyou cantif missiles were overpowered or unfair in some situations there are plenty of other imaginative solutions they could have used hell defenders are still useless because of their childish design and implementation how about working on those
nope doesnt get my vote adaptand so on
or simply a warning that you have like 7 days left on your account like with trial accounts not a big issue for me but it would be a logical and nice improvement 
in that case delves truesec status is even more wacky than i previously thought because 75mhour is not even close to representative of what the rest of 00 pays out try ratting in tenerifis or esoteria even in good truesec youre looking at 20mhour on a very good day once youve spent time clearing out the crap spawns
we want to do our job
why ghost training should be reenabled training times long long long training times theres nothing quite like the training times in eve anywhere else
lol you werent playing the game anyways who cares what you want

im all for this
i support this idea skill queue is long overdue and needs to be revisited for 2009
skiiiiiil q 
signedskill training queues please
gib le skillq
1 fuel bay seperate from cargohold  supported2 use of covert ops cloaking devices  maybe3 a slightly longer jump range perhaps 12 light years more  supported4 enable use of covert cyno in cynojammed systems  maybe5  higher t2 resistances
in addition to the ops suggestions 13and 4 item 2 seems imbalanced i would like to see improved t2 resistances and better sensor resolution the locking times on these things is atrocious
ok  1 i really think the csm business is a pille of rubbish2 etho was one of the players first screaming for transparency and i am enjoying seeing alts of people that flammed him now asking for the same he did despite not knowing you good one etho3 funny thing here i would like to see is how much did ccp lost in rl money because i would like to extrapolate from those figures the aproximate amount these guys didnt pay to play while i had to4 also knowing the peoples names but more important what is ccp doing5 i said it once and i say it again the csm is a pille of rubbish time to prove the non believers that we are wrong if you can wich i seriously doubtoh and click
any more updates yet or is it its quieted down sweep it under the rug time
i feel like reporting your post tbhnot because there is anything wrong with it  just because that way if lots of people did it it would be a sign to ccp that we demand they take notice of the content and provide an update on this fiascoyet again ccp continues to amaze me how their pr can be so appalling they seem to have no clue when it comes to customer service and in this economic climate they need it more than ever
this rig salvage tackle is obviously missplaced since it has nothing to do with armor and belongs in electronics rigs  the current result of it being in the wrong place is a higher demand for armor rig components and therefore a higher price of armor rigs compared to shield rigsthis apperant misstake should be rectified  the sooner the better  easiest way would be to simply remove all salvage tackle rigs currently attatched place them in ship cargo bay  hangar changed into electronic rig
supporting this issue to be adressed
an interesting suggestion worthy at least of consideration
caveats 1 blackops were released prenerfed true this was intended to prevent them from completely overshadowing their t1 hulls in terms of game balance cost is a minor concern and must be ignored a statistically equivalentsuperior t2 geddon with a jump drive simply obsoletes a t1 geddon thus the statistics and fittings of the blackops battleships were scaled back below their t1 parent hulls2 the hulls chosen for blackops ships vs marauders seems an arbitrary decision which consider which ships would be better at pvp vs pve so ive corrected them dominix  mega for missions mega  domi for blackops so make the domi the marauder and megathron the blackops etc3 blackops lack the ability to fit a covert ops cloaking device this was an intentional design decision which follows the well established rules concerning the raw dps available on cocd usable ships this is completely unrelated to the aforementioned prenerfing of the ships stats4 a covert ops cloak is quite literally useless on a battleship sized hull especially on a battleship hull which has its own jump drive and ability to lock on to covert cyno fields while this is the most requested improvement from the masses all of which admit they do not actually fly the ships in pvp due to the lack of a cloak thus they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about its also the most ridiculous request for an improvement which players with zero experience piloting blackops ships would readily trade class destroying nerfs in order to balance the addition of said covert ops cloak this suggestion is laughable and should never even be entertainedall blackops 40 base scan resolution to counteract fitting a cloak60 cpu cost to fit a t2 cloak50 native sensor strength opposite of marauderst2 resists racial flavor as appropriate on t2 shipsjump range increased to 3ly base 675ly with jdc 5 6ly with jdc 45002000m3 fuel bay added whatever developers feel is balancedcovert cynos changed to be usable in cynojammed systemsall cpupg listed before skills includes 60 cpu from abovesinhull  megathron developer  duvolle 7h5m7l 5 turrets 610 cpu 13500 gridgallente bs 5 large turret dmglvl 75 large turret trackinglvl5 agility per level of blackops bonus highly useful preqr worthless now becomes a third turret bonus perhaps optimal 2nd damage or falloffpantherhull  tempest developer  boundless creation 7h5m7l 5 turrets 660 cpu 13500 grid5 speed per level of blackops bonus highly useful preqr for an entirely different reason worthless now removed the panther is thukker like the vagabond this doesnt work for battleships the panther needs to become boundless creation and given a 3rd projectile bonus such as falloffredeemerhull  geddon develop  viziam 8h4m7l 6 turrets 565 cpu 17000 grid the only change is 60 cpuwith the above changes that all blackops need the redeemer is finewidow most people do not realize this but the widow is already hull  raven developer  kaalakiota 7h8m4l 5 missiles 820 cpu 8800 grid the only change is 60 cpuboth caldari bs bonuses come from the raven however the fitting  bo bonus comes from the scorp unfortunately players seem enthralled by the ecm bonus no idea why so you kinda have to leave it exactly as is other than 60 cpucurrentlythe redeemer geddon and panther phoon are 1 low 1 mid the sin dominix is 1 low 1 mid 1 high the widow raven is 1 low 2 mid 1 high if you compare the widow to the scorpion the widow is simply 1 highmissile hardpointchangesredeemer geddon 1 low 1 mid  marauder  apoc no changepanther tempest 1 high 1 low  marauder  typhoon with torp bonusessin megathron 1 high 1 mid  marauder  dominixwidow raven 1 low 1 high 2 mids  marauder  raven no change 500m800m t2 scorpion useless
this is probably the most intelligent thing youve ever said
switching around the hulls seems like a major task but i cant disagree with the reasoning behind the move as for the overall improvements to the class i agree 100 counter the penalties of the cloak give better resists slightly better jump range and bypass cyno jamming and youve balanced the class
take away 1 lowslot on the widow are you seriousi like the ideas but if anything give the widow 1 more lowslot
he doesnt like ecm
i edited the op to clarify that my proposal changes nothing about the widow other than giving it 60 cpu i was merely saying the widow is a raven with 1 low slot 2 mids 1 highslot the slot layout on the widow follows the same pattern as the other blackops lows midswith my proposal the blackops balance out as follows note im using the redeemer as the baseline ship for balancing purposesredeemer  4 mids 7 lows 8 highs 6 turrets 1 less than geddonwidow  8 mids 4 lows 7 highs 5 missiles 1 less than ravenpanther  5 mids 7 lows 7 highs 5 turrets 1 less than tempestsin  5 mids 7 lows 7 highs 5 turrets 2 less than megathronthis balances out their slot layouts technically i should give the sin 6 turrets and 8 high slots to match the megathron however this would mean the sin loses either a low or a mid slot neither of which it can really afford to give up i could give it the same layout as the redeemer but then it would be overpowered compared to the redeemer if it were given 2 damage bonuses which i feel both the sin and panther need not fitting a 6th gun frees up alot of grid for use in lows or their extra utility midslotmy feeling is with 5 utility mids 3 turret bonuses and 5 turrets the panther and sin should balance out with the redeemer who also has 3 turret bonuses but of course being amarr one of his bonuses is 50 cap use on lasers bleh basically the comparison ispanther 5x 800mm iis with 5 rof bonus 5 damage bonus and 5 falloff bonussin 5x neutron blaster cannon iis with 5 damage bonus 75 tracking bonus and either another 5 damage bonus maybe 10 falloff bonus10 optimal bonus if thats too much damageredeemer 6x megapulse iis with 10 capacitor bonus 5 rof bonus 75 tracking bonuswidow 5x siege launcher iis with 5 rof bonus 10 missile velocity 20 ecm strengththe difference in torps vs guns has the widow matchingslightly outpacing the redeemer but only if using a target painter otherwise they are pretty close the panthersin get 1 less turret but both get double damage bonuses vs the redeemer so they should balance out as well this way all of the blackops can actually have a sane slot layout in order to fit tankdamage modsetc
um no how many people can fly a geddon compared to the black op version months of training difference secondly cost is a huge concern tech 2 isnt insurable while tech 1 iswhich would make sense but it breaks it domi as marauder would be epic this obviously wont change nowsame reason stealth bombers dont have covop would be overpoweredi dont have a clue what ur talking about tbh covop cloak wouldnt even be that much of an improvement it would be overpowered but also a doubleedged swordpretty fair but you really dont have to fit onehonestly not an issue for me all my fits have no issue with fittingnice but not necessary as it isnt the problem with black opsalready going to happenin conclusion tbh i think the redeemerpanther mostly needs the logistical boost perhaps an optimalfalloff bonus on their weapons but they are goodwidow is kind of crappy but i guess it does what it doessin is the real sad one who really needs a massive boost i cant get the thing to actually work until you use tuvans modified lars  t2 rigs which is ridiculousin my opinion they need to fix targeting range such that it is  plain domi or build into the ship one ccc that alone will mitigate the fix
the hull changes are bizarre the slot layout and bonuses can be changed but all of the black ops need to use the tier 1 bs hull that is how all tech 2 ship lines work and there is no need to change it nowscan res bonus fuel bay and usable in cynojammed systems are desperately neededjump range bonus would be nice but i dont think well get itt2 resist sensor strength and cpu would be nice but i could live without them
well its been just short of half a year now since we last heard anything whats the status guys we gonna get a skill queue in the foreseeable future or not

considering the eve wiki is in the process of being created and fleshed out i see no reason for someone not to start up a known exploit page on there if ccp doesnt like it they always have veto power on it and can remove it personally i dont think its necessary for the csm to look at this considering that avenue is available but if it came down to it id probably support the idea of listing known exploits and the link to the relevant eula section
it would get removed from the wiki on grounds that discussingmentioning exploits is not allowed
bring it up just to make sure we have ccps permission to make the list
hey ignit i think the biggest problem with this is that youd either have an insanely overpowered mod due to its cycle time beaten only by jump portal generators cynos and ice miners or youd have to make it so that heat damage would wipe out nearly every single low slot within 12 cycles thereby making this a shield tankers dream and an armor tankers nightmare
say if it added 20 of the current bonus to shield n armor so an overheating dc ii would be 125 x 2  125 for shield  15 remember these resists are unstacked15 x 2  15 for armor  18 armor60 x 2  60 for structure  72 hullso 72 hull is alot of omni resists but then again this almost brings hull tanking back as a viable option also remember overheating is only as effective as skills train for as well if a mod burns out you have to be in a station to fix and if a mod is partially damaged you have to turn it off to repair with nanite pasteninja edit also cycle time doesnt coicide with active time as long as the mod is active its overheating and the heat can be turned on and off while the mod is still active so cycle time really doesnt bother me as gamebreakingi really cant see that being all that game breaking granted almost all lowslots are genrally passive in nature allowing them to be natural heatsinks so what armor tankers dont have an omni tank mod that can be overheated and its not gamebreaking see invuln fieldbut yes as much as i would love to overheat it i do not want this idea to cause an imbalance
unless im somehow even more ed than i feel overheat is done on a per cycle basis hence why you cant overheat a mwd midway through very annoying when rushing back to a gate or speed breakout from a gatecamp on a side note let people overheat modules when jump cloaked or cloaked so first activation is overheat
i probably am wrong lul since i was going off the stupid cycle circle which is never the right timing anywayswell then fix the dc so the mod doesnt take the time that it does and reduce its cap usage so its the same per second usage but allowed for a much more manageable overheatinglike i said idea would like to hash it out p
i dont think overheating a damcon would be particularly unbalanced tbh considering how much damage itd put off in that 30 second cycle youd probably burn out your entire low rack
considering that dc is pretty much mandatory on many ships it doesnt need another boost imo
more resistance on hull oh i see what you did therereal men hull tank
seem a good solutionthat would require to resolve several issues with drones that are at least partially resolved in one patch and return the next for example the drones not using mdw to return to your ship failing to dock even if ordered and so on then there is the effect of increase in the length of firing cycle for drones done some patch ago one of the need for speed initiatives before the drones start to move toward your ship they could wait up to 4 seconds while completing the firing cycle that make it improbable getting them in before the emergency warp from a dc and then dont resolve the problem for a sentry drone
again this is an ispnetwork problem of the person self if you would try to go this way then also by default replace ships of people who dropped connection and many more things like thisand again its a problem on your sideand yes other races lose drones as well on connection loss ow and switch to gunnery as primairy might be better for youow and did i allready mention fix ur internet
i support this only if they auto scoop to drone bay due to ship leaving grid due to emergency warp cant be a warp you initiatethis would prevent it being exploited in pvp because if your ship is pointed or bubbled prior to losing connection it wont emergency warp
support just to have the drones automatically return to the drone bay when you get back into the grid would be nice
your village called they want there self proclaimed expert backahemyep im in favor of this theres nothing like having a full set of heavies out there and finding out you foolishly forgot to watch your cap and you warp the heck out leaving behind several large bits of your ship and you realize you forgot to recall your drones dohyou come back and they are 100kms off cause you where kiting x o d try scooping them in a malestrom with no ab even then its torturesigned
i like the hyperion it is big and shiny however it lacks pretty heavily in comparison with its main competitor the megathronnot only is the hyperion a good 55 million isk more expensive than the megathron but the drone ability of the ship is actually weaker than its tier 2 counterpart while 100 baybandwidth certainly compares well with the other thirdtier battleships the hyperion remains a gallente bs unable to field a full set of heavy drones the description of the hyperion promotes both its lethality and versatility however due to the dual bonuses and extra heavy drone of the megathron the hyperion is almost certainly less lethal than the much cheaper ship and certainly less versatilemy proposal is this increase the hyperions bandwidth to 125 and its drone bay to 200 this would put the hyperion on a more comparable level to the megathron increase its versatility and ultimately give it the drone power it should have as the topoftheline gallente battleship and indeed the most expensive battleship in the game
supported why not its probably unbalanced but its not like blaster ships are uber at the momentthe 200m3 drone bay might be a bit much though
125 would be bareminimum acceptable for a set of heavies and parity with the megathron 200 was suggested because itd give the hyperion a good boost in versatility allowing it to field several different drone types effectively
i think 125m3 would be a lot more suitable dronespace so it can either field a few waves of lightmediums or go for a full rack of sentries or heavies the dominix is the droneboat not the hyperion just because its a tier3 battleship doesnt mean it should be the best although that doesnt mean i dont like the idea i agree it could do with a dronebay boost but only to 125m3 or 150m3 imo any higher would be a bit too much
lets look at rokh and raven then shall we rokh is more expensive has less drones then raven and is probably less lethal then torp raven even with blastersno reason to boost hyperion then if situation is same with other races ships
its not the rokh is an effective fleet sniper which is its intended role not a close range blasterboat the problem the op is pointing out is that the mega does the hyperions job close range blasterboat nearly equal or better than the hyperion i think thats what he is trying to sayi dont think his fix is going to change it all that much though
i had a hyperion up near my thanatos literally its as big as the thanatos on length and width except its larger odd for such a large ship to be so crappyanyway so yesturday i was checking out how to fit a hype tbh hadnt ever fit one for anything other than miningi found out its really designed for blasters u cant fit 8x 425mm rails  lar thats pretty sad tbhthen you have a crappy slot layout you lose on dmg mods if you were fitting 350s thats all around fail and then crappy drone bay what it does do well is fleet operations and such sure but jeese why limit the ship when clearly it could have good potential actually it kind of does more training and higher cost  better or the ship is broke reference black ops150 is fine gives you 6 heavies 1 replacementone is missiles and one isnt stop comparing apples to oranges rokh fails entirely on the fact that caldari rarely use hybrids if youre caldari you train missiles thats all there is to it
without a constructive point of argument your no only shows ignorance  and therefore has no value
you really didnt put a lot of thought into this did youno for the op being ignorant and stupid about database structure and game mechanicsobviously biased towards easier scanning down of ships which is already very easy with probinglearn to play the game or grow a brain either way forgetaboutit o p
this would not add strain to a well designed database at all you are adding a field to the shipif you were worried about strain you would ask ccp to disallow naming of ships because that causes the exact same amount of strain as this license system actually it would cause more than the license system if ccp uses the suggestion below instead of the one in the op if you want to do this you could simply use a reversable encryption algorithm to create a unique license from the itemid field all flown ships are unpackaged and thus would have a unique itemid remove the repackage nonsense though if i wanted to clear the license there would still be a go around repackage  contract to friend  friend contract back i oppose this because it doesnt add anything significantly meaningful to the game there are features more worthy of the devs attention
and what do you realy know about database issues what is obvious is that most of the requests in assembly hall are baised toward some form of game improvement or addition that benefit primarily the poster  the effects of ship licence plates being helpfull in scanning was not the reason for this proposal the main objective of this change would be to properly track ships on killmails and perhaps later add an ingame kb about putting enough thought into this which is another reason for posting  any constructive arguments would further the idea itself and make it more structured  and this is where you fail to contribute  your reply is nothing but feeble trolling attempt  which represents you as a whiny  crying for attention
apparently i know more than you do about database structurefirst off what your talking about is adding an entirely new series of database tablescolumns that involve tracking individual shipstaking into account the obscene number of ships and the number of ships tied to each individual user which frequently change hands on a daily bases topped off with fittings starts to reach exponential numbersand you want to tag a unique id on each and every frakking shipso yes i say you are stupid and brain dead and not to mention a jackass for presuming out of sheer ignorance and aragonace that you know nothing about database structuresnothing is ever that simple if it was as easy as tacking on a new table or set of tables we would have a far easier time dealing with any number of problems that plague the it worldthey are not uberdbs deal with joining tables inner joins outer joins keeping them normalized and stable not to mention properly keyed and indexedthis whole proposal is adding fluff which do nothing but stroke the epeens of someones kill mail according to what you just said its pointless and does nothing to further the growth or improvement of the gamehowever teaching you the insight of database mechanics is like talking to a child and hence is a total waste of my timeif the database was young brand new a few months perhaps but a well engravedrooted db would require a ton of debugging and possibly rebuilding the whole damn systemmove along move along
failing other 00 incentive proposals id like to see that rather than banning implants from highsec they are creatable in 00 or only 4s and 5s can only be gained from 00 thus increasing the incentive to run pirate missions albeit at a lower lp cost than whats currently available
because a bunch of thugs are so much better at learning than those living in an organized society that respects property rights and is able to set up infrastructure like universities
a logic has never ever stopped any single argument from being implemented in eves history dont let it start now i see your property rights and raise you extensive illegal testing is required to make implants above a certain grade with mortality rates in excess of what the empires are willing to tolerateb in terms of game balance it would not effect new players in the slightest as a fair bit of training is required for 4 implants but it would increase the demand upon 4 implants making the incentive to go and farm them that much higher a correlating means to improve pirate faction standing outside of missions would be required besides failing storylines so as not to disadvantage long time npcers but it would increase the populations of many of the npc regions which are sorely lacking in much besides very niche game play station game syndicate blob warfare curse very desolate venal c provides a strong incentive for players to move to 00 especially if agents in outposts is implemented
i would suggest that you a dont get podded and b read up about jump clones

you are by far the worst poster and clueless noob in the eve universeyou want xl hybrids on a sin you do know that xl guns do about the same dps as large hybrids without siege mode yes you also cannot hit anything except a pos with xl guns right turning black ops into a really weak pos attack ship is by far the worst idea ever
yeah capital guns on a battleship isnt a good idea theyre terrible i do support the idea of increasing their survivability though wouldnt say no to increased resistances
how the heck did you become a csm delegate with such blatantly misguided responses like this no wonder virtually no one has any faith in this council or process

solitude is actually quite a popular place for fledgling corps and alliances to try and build up in the only reason it is empty and lifeless is due to us keeping a vigil over the lowsec parts of the region terrorizing any group who tries to move in and destroying any ship which enters it weve kept solitude clear of carebear infestations for over 2 years now however ill note that last year we moved to curse for about 3 months as soon as we left syndicate the population of the region exploded with life and activity in the three months we were absent easily 5k players had come to inhabit low sec solitude and the bordering ta constellation in syndicate my god there was even macrominers operating in low sec 2 jumps from 00 it took us a week or two to eradicate them all but we restored the natural order of things in solitude and carefully maintain itthere are a few pockets of lowsec tucked behind a few highsec systems such as stralointoustain the aeter triangle aeterharnersarline etc these are wonderful because they give the carebears a false sense of security which enables us to do things like thissolitude is perfect the way it is
please support this proposal
i support thistheirs already a million ways for people to scam this wont make much of a difference i like the idea of having a name tab like the one for employment plus limit it to 2 times this would give tons of people a second chance who didnt put much thought into their characters name without starting over
no you chose your name live with itbought your account toughshould of had the patience to create your own character
obviously people already live with it just because you dont want to change your name doesnt mean someone else wouldnt like to just because you dont care about your characters name doesnt mean that everyone else doesnt care about their characters namesonce again ill say that we should leave the limit to name changes up to ccp or their balancing team why limit it if they charge money for it that would limit some people depending on implementation ccpgms could view names that were changed to prevent people one upping one anotherpretty common request to create a name tab or some other method of tracking the character name once again i am only requesting the ability to change my character name not spell out exactly how it is implemented the fee or anything of that sort all of those tasks should fall on ccp to determine what is fair and balancedhere is another example of where it would be nicein your corporation you have a rank structure or faction warfare when your character was created you created a lt bob but as far as your corp is concerned youre a colonel it would be nice to make your name match right or you just want to add that to your character name general evilphoenix anyone
not supported that the work of players like that ruin who do not stay in the game because of rl
there are already mechanics in place to remove said poss from the game why not use them you dumb ass
supported  hack or destroy and salvage
and when he come back to play from holyday he lost the personal property when you stealth because you dont like working
a big thumbs up for this idea hacking an offline tower or demolishing it with rigged charges brilliant
then take down your tower or have someone else keep it fueled if a tower isnt fed it should become vulnerable to be taken over or the mods stolen or something
i do not support this idea unless the long time is over three monthsi currently have a pos that someone wanted to randsom iti took everything off and now the pos sits waiting for me to unanchor when they get tired of watching that can take a long time
not supported because the eve not just 00
no they cant you dont have the faintest idea what youre talking about

not to mention that thats only 1 person making that amount whether its 75m or 20m per system thats not really all that useful or interesting given the number of people you actually need to hold space or even maintain a presence in 00 killing pirates in belts does not scale
not supported because the eve not just 00
what since eve is not just 00 we should not make 00 better
empire players equal with 00 playernot less or not more this is an another thread where the csm want to give more economic and another advantageprefer to smallest group of eve 9 population of eve live in 00enough from the favouritism somebody anyone else plays too with the game so wrong if discounts when provided to one of the sides only any of the reasonable requests of the other side are rejected
yes not supported too
why do you think only 9 of the population lives in 00i would say its because the average individual can make more money running lvl 4 missions in empire most 00 dwellers have empire alts as well just do do business in empire without trouble even mission so be careful with your statistic just because 9 of the characters are out in 00 does not mean that only 9 of the people who play eve play in 00 and also would that be an indicator to you that 00 is actually not balanced with empire if 00 was balanced wouldnt you expect to see half of the eve population out there or maybe at least 13rd 9 to me is a problem you might as well argue for the removal of 00 hunwhat people in this thread want is increased rewards for their increased risk not favoritism for 00 players right now under the current system the average 00 dweller makes less iskh than your lvl 4 missioner with the added risks and obligation of 00 living yes you might be able to make 20m and hour or 75m an hour but then you spend 6 hours an an alliance op to defend your space losing 2 battleships in this fight or that one costing you 40mil after insurance or 22b hi molle and every hour you spend fighting to defend your space someone in empire is still doing a lvl 4 mission maybe to be annoyed once or twice a year by a suicide ganker
ive ratted in fountain curse stain and other areas doing the same oh and it was a 17 belt system with multiple ratters in systemof the 4 fountain was by far the worst hitting only about 56 milhr but in fairness it was a 12 belt system
yaayi would like to see documented proof which includes the  of accounts you were using to achieve this amount in addition subtract profits gained from manufacturing rigs the only value that should be included is rat bounties and market value of the loot and slavage recieved for your time quotient you have to include the time it takes you to get to a station with it also you must include the time in percentage form to which you were not ratting on average due to hostiles a snapshot of your wallet with 1 hour of ratting would help as well if you are going to keep repeating this you might as well back it up with a bit more than our trust in what you say on a forum
ok i am going to suggest something that i think a lot of people are going to hate some will like but i have not seen on the forums so far but maybe it has make soverenty linked to kill mails  this way you take soverenty away from poses and force pvp kills would count towards your alliance and your corps hold on the system like capturing a flag in other games let the surrounding systems give bonuses to holding your current system so say you have your one system and it is connected to 4 others those 4 give bonus to the current system to keep it from falling this way you are not constantly fight with an empire that is dying from the inside out but the bigger you get the harder it is for you to maintain the bordershave influence based on what you are flying the size of the gang and what you kill you get more influence for killing things while in smaller gangs ships ect and less for the other way around like accumulating points an a kill board the intended purpose would be to stop pos spam get people back into smaller ships and gangs making pvp cheaper for everyone hopefully poses will be used more as staging grounds ocassional safe spots and more for industry instead of what it is nowi am hopefull that the proposed minning changes of moving belts to the dungeon system will help to fix some of the profitability issues but i also think that for the long run yields are going to have to be increased in oresrefinable materials so that as eve grows the supplies can keep up with demand perhaps these higher yield ores need to be restricted to just lownull seccoming from someone who has 1 acct and has yet to fly one i beleive capitals are a royal pain for there use and are to vulnerable by themselves i beleive 00 will benefit if they were allowed to be more versitile and were more self sufficient weather that by changing how they move around or how much they can carry or a change in there fundamental purposes but for some reason i dont think it is right that i should need alts multiple accounts and a corp support system so that i can afford the fuel needed to hide until i am in a fleet to fight just does not seem right to me and it excludes so many players because they do not have the time to spend all day on a game i do not have to have multiple accounts for other games to enjoy everything they have to offer why should i for this one sorry for the sidetrackback to soverenty my info is a little hazy here wheather they currently do or not but have capitals help towards soverenty on top of the fights but only while in space and visible and the larger the capital the more it counts so titans would be the most the moms and then the carriers and dreads this way they could be used to stengthen one area or hold onother that is about to falljust my suggestionsobservationrant
i could see this working given that its access is limited and has some sort of security mail the directors of executing corp when something moves you could limit access to ceos  or ceos plus one chosen memberalso i think the logistics dont need to be complicated limit to 3 tabs could even be prenamed fuel ships other might be limiting for some but limiting the use will also limit the work involved in making the feature from the get go
there is a function in pos corp hangers that allow corp hanger access to alliance its kinda broken at the moment thoif it could be set to allow read only for one way use like depositing ore or ice from a alliance level operation that would be nice or give and take for alliance level logisticsbut still access still comes down to the corp level hanger access other rolesto prevent thieves pos managers can password shields and give passwords out to those that need to have access
only a neutrality concept would work here for example you contract caldari navy to protect you in caldari highsec means no war dec is valid unless you leave caldari highsec but you have to work for it missions mining ship building for that corp without rewards in iskgood idea also the victory condition idea has merit i would not like to see the possibility of terrorism or hit and run attacks disappear but its gotta be harder i dont get why a corp is held punishable by default because of the crimes of the individual imo if the bounty hunting system is worked on if could replace the war dec system individual grievances could be solved individually unless of course the war is agreeable then let the corporations fight on happily
how about a simplier approach   for instance a corp declares war on another  they set original surrender cost much like a ransom demand  which should increase by the amount that the war costs this should be 2mil a day at least tbh  retracting a declared war should be possible only by meeting the same cost  condition of surrender payment of surrender condition cost would be transfered to the agressor and retracting a war viceversa  trafered to the agressed mutual war would cost equally for both parties until victory conditions are met when surrender conditions are met there could be a cooldown period implementd with the effect of rendering the agressed immune to being declared a war by the agressor corp for a limited amount of time a month  the same principal should be applied to the retracteesp or agressori do aggree with the op that wardec mechanichs need to be readressed  changededit  added details

i support anything that makes the salvage profession more viable 1 to having salvage drones

current situationthe cyclone is an active shield boosting ship with three utility slots in the highs this was a perfect combination prior to the nos nerf you burned a lot of capacitor fueling the shield booster but you were able to recover that loss by nosing your opponents capneutralizers are not a valid replacement on the cyclone like they are on many other ships because the cyclone has the smallest base capacitor of all the tier one battle cruisers to begin with it needs every fraction of that capacitor to power the shield boosters so fitting three neutralizers is not an option unless you gimp your tank even further by fitting two cap injectorsswitching the extra utility slots from nos to missile launchers is also not an option the cyclone was a close fit with three medium nos that only take 20 cpu each and simply impossible to fit with three heavy missile launchers which take 55 cpu eachwhen ccp raised the cpu of invulnerability fields to 44 each this ship became a nightmare to squeeze anything on it if you want a halfway decent tank you can only maybe manage 180 acs and light missiles or maybe assault missile launchers of course you might as well be flying a rupture at that point at least the signature radius will be a lot lowerwhat i propose1 remove a high slot utility2 give it an extra mid slot3 increase the base cpu from 425 to 500
or you could try some other ship  i had cyclone once didnt like it but i really dont see how its so much worse than most of other ships in a way
the eve community is funny if i trained for fotm ships everyone would  at me for flying fotm but if i stick to the race i love which i do then they tell me to fly fotmcant win for losing
since they added another turret slot to the ferox the cyclone is the worst bc it gets crap dps hard to fit and the active tank wont stand up to another bcs punishment well maybe the passive drake but about anything can tank those
those utility slots are suppoused to be used for gangmods however fitting med noss should still be viable for sustaining cap coupled with a med capbooster or assault missiles to shoot drones  frigs perhaps
the cyclone needs some attention at the very least more cpu tbh
posting to supporti realize that this game has moved on from using normal ships and is now fully in the throes of being capital ships online but a few thumbs ups could bring about some necessary changes for the 2 of us that still prefer to fly noncaps

1 fuel bay seperate from cargohold  yes they really need that2 use of covert ops cloaking devices  no theyre not force recons or cov ops nearest thing to black ops are combat recons and stealth bombers3 a slightly longer jump range perhaps 12 light years more  not really necessary if jump fuel bay is added4 enable use of covert cyno in cynojammed systems  this would be improvement but it isnt really that much of help in general and would imho take blackops out of their intended use as in not for blobbing stuffseparate fuel bay would help traveling but also high price and crippled scan resolution are problem for blackops too in my opinion blackops are most fun while flying solo or in small gangs and those things would need boosting jump portals and stuff like that are not even so useful for this kind of stuff in small gang you dont really have enough people for cynoing ships around etc and high price is really last nail in the coffin its just too muchyes for generally making blackops real pvp ships no for making them big force recons

missionrunners should be quite familiar with this particular mission available at all levels afaikthe demands of the mission are quite simple and always the same for a certain level fetch a certain amount of a basic ore type for the agent veld for l1 scor for l2 omber for l3 kernite for l4in return you get some token bonus cash and a random x attribute implant where x is the level of the storyline missionthe problem with the mission lies in the fact that the requirements are way too easy to fulfill and you know them well in advancethe typical scenario is player gets his industrial goes to pick up the needed ore from the market goes to the agent with ore in tow if he didnt already have a big chunk of it at the agent takes the mission and turns it in almost instantly afteras a result this mission has an abysmal average completion time with the bonus timer so small no other mission can possibly match itthe troubling thing however is that a small average completion time means a very small standings increase reward and a quite high likelyhood of people getting that specific mission from their storyline agentsome of you might consider it a minor annoyance but for most others myself included its borderline nervewreckingpersonally it is my belief that something must be done about this particular missionnow exactly what is a matter of debatepossible solutions1 removing or at least temporarily disabling the mission at least the l3 and l4 versionsits the most drastic yet very low cost codingwise effective solution i daresay almost no cost at allthere are plenty of other interesting storyline missions and basically all lp shops sport learning implants so any negative sideeffects from its removal would be minimal2 bottomcapping storyline mission rewards at least for this one to a much higher value than normalthis would mean that even if the mission remains unchanged it will no longer suffer from the current issueits a bandaid solution but has no significant noticeable to me right now anyway drawbacks and should also be relatively lowcost in its implementationits certainly a more desirable alternative to the missions removal but might still have some unintended consequences i didnt think of however i am quite sure any possible drawbacks will be far outweighed by the overall benefits of this change3 randomizing the mission and hiding the objective before taking the missionby randomizing i mean not asking for raw ore instead asking for t1 modules empirespecific  the mission could even provide you with bpcs for the needed quantities so you can build them in case you cant find them on the market peronally i believe this makes more sense given the title and description of the mission anywayand by hiding the objective i mean you being unable to just fetch the items beforehand you would need to accept the mission firstthe problem with this however is that it would need some probably large coding work in the way missions are handled not a bad thing per se but this means it might take a while to finish and the problem is way past due for a solutionthis last version is the most desirable one in my opinion but also carries the highest cost in terms of ccp workloadnew 4 change it into a mining missionwe already have several alternate missiononly ores for the mining missions this mission was supposed to be somewhat a mining mission from the start so simply changing it from a trade mission with common ore into a mining mission with missiononly ore would kill two birds with one stone so to speak and be reasonably easy to codewell feedback  opinions  suggestions 
remove it fetch missions are the most boring in eve storyline missions are supposed to be cool plugging in a bpo or grabbing a hauler is not really cool i believe they are planning epic story arcs to replace storyline missions so i think this is moot
it makes little sense to have a storyline mission that spans over 16 missions itself that would kind of be counterproductive if a new storyline would be triggered by the previous storylines first arc before it even finishes so i think the epic arcs are supposed to be regular missions not storyline missionsbut i might be wrong doubt it though and some of them are planned for storylines too no idea how they would plan to handle the infinite storylines loop that could form thenps added support for op
how dare you attempt to ruin my ore reselling businessend emo nerd rageyeah i got to agree that these missions are just too easy to do not very imaginitve and just plain sucki will miss the easy isk though of selling to people to lazy to fetch their own ore thougheditapparently my thumb broke the first time through
option4 substitute the normal ore with a mission ore like in the other mining missions change the agent text so i say that he want the mineral for testing purposes and development of new alloys et voilUFFFD you have a mission that require you to spend the time mining after you get it your option 3 is interesting but it is a idea for a new mission
and then what i assume youll still have to get that ore by some method like for instance mining im a miner myself np but getting 8k kernite for instance for someone without any decent mining skills its a faction mission shouldnt be dependant on skills other than missionrunning type skillsbetter disable it for now and change it to retrieving some minerals something like the the quafe retrivial mission cargo delivery but nastier
just disable it tbh its way to easy loloh its this mission  market  buy  accept  finished  leave station
just disable it last year i ran lvl 4 missions for a few days to buffer up my wallet and this posnot player owned structure mission was the only storyline i got the station that gives the mission is full of people selling of the required ore so its just one extra implant at reduced price and then back to grinding the same missions storyline missions whould be something more interesting anyway
disable this abomination or set a fixed reward and rig the timer
this mission isnt wrong by any extent even in normal mission running you have your petty missions alluring emanations duo of death et al this is kind of the booby prize storyline mission as it doesnt improve your standing much at allif you remove this mission which mind you im not saying that it would be a bad thing you should also remove the other childishly easy missions surprise surprise cargo delivery for people who know the blitz etc if you make the mission harder you should also improve the rewards both isk and standing wisewhile im kinda riding the fence on this one i see no real reason to remove the mission but it could stand some improvement
as akita said the biggest problem is thatthe troubling thing however is that a small average completion time means a very small standings increase reward and a quite high likelyhood of people getting that specific mission from their storyline agentif the completion timer didnt effect things i wouldnt have much reason to complain since i do trades on the dirt cheap implants these missions provide i do understand your point though
why we have mining missions so why not have mining storylinesstorylines you dont want or couldnt do arent so uncommoni have several alts with standing for level 4 mission for rd and they are happy to get the material for war or the courier storylines but when they get a combat storyline they are screwed ad the whole combat skillset is racial frigates iii to get the industrial and some small gun if that will not damage my main standing i will use him to do the mission and then deliver it with the alt similarly a non miner getting a mining storyline mission can use an alt to complete it and then deliver with the character getting it or even ask a corpmate to do it for a compensation
trivial storyline at best everytime i was given this mission the ore was available instation the hard part of the mission was actually getting to the agents system on autopilot in a shuttle yeah its that hardremember when you started doing missions for standings like for research agents and youre grinding the little lvl1 missions then you get a storyline w00t open journal materials for war preperations okay whats the reward 1 charismafacepalmeither make it harder like the modulesbased mission mentionned above with better compensation remove charisma implants

support options 1 or 2
not supported if you just want to pvp move to lowsec or 00 that is why it is there
the current limit isnt too bad i think although it would be great if they raised it to 5 or something like that
we really need no limit to war dec number and the fees removed
this issue is in dire need of csm  ccp attention  add your support  disaproval  trolling  whatever
its an interesting idea you have there but lets look at what happens if we go through with your idea will the players who built this item as an armor rig suddenly lose money as the components are cheaper to make the new formula that would not be good for the manufacturers or the market as theyd have to take a loss to competewhile i agree that it is an electronics rig it doesnt seem to be that hard to sell for salvage vessels destroyers marauders exequors etc this is an issue where you have to look back say oops and continue going
that is the thing  it goes way way beyond oops  if it isnt fixed now  further on this will do more damage and as for leaving it as is  not an option  devs should realize this and hopefully this issue is still nagging at them to be changed
its an odd place for it and a fix might be justified should probably be looked at but i doubt a change is correct tentative thumb
yes but salvaging is a mechanic skill which is with the armor tanking skills also salvaging is basically just breaking up clumps or metal or armor which fits in with armor skills and armor rigs it is not a perfect fit i admit but makes some senseare you new to eve or did someone sell a csm account to the stupidest troll ever i mean ccp changes things that changes the prices of player manufactured goods all the freaking time you never get compensation i am always stunned at how little you know about eve bunyip you are truly a noob in every sense of the word
same crud allover again tonight please for the love of godaddon we do optimize our clients with mos tof the stuff you said up there some like me do all of it its making no darn difference
god dammit another ed ass lag fest this time in abune this bull has got to be fixed
well if you pc cant handle it why blame ccp and call it server side lag assigning a blade to your system isnt going to help lag if its fps based and not server based i dont see how complaining to ccp about your fps problem will help when they have given you tools to manage the problem do you want that server to do some your gpu processing for you over the interwebnow if anyone that has responded to this thread about lag and has 100 of the new fps saving features ticked and still have the problems raise there hand
this lag makes the game unplayableif ccp didnt intend for massive fights they wouldnt have put everyone on the same serverfix this soon  im sick of paying 15 bucks a month to watch twenty seconds of slideshow then waking up in station
i believe this to be the best idea yet regarding server lag during large scale faction engagements oh and raising hand
signed i hope something can be done about it im playing the game for these big engagements if i want small isolated fights ill go play wow
could a csm please explain what ccp is doing about macros and why there has been no visible response to petitions filed about macro miners im not interested in players opinions on macros or player solutions i want my representatives to ccp to get an answer why macro miners ratters and mission runners continue to exist in this gamei would like to know what happens when someone files a petition turning in a macro miner and why that macro continues to mine week after week regardless of petitions filed in short why are petitions not acted upon
ive never filed one of these but i wonderdo you get an autoreply asking you to clear your cache when you file one of these thatd be awesome
i have noticed trit in eve has gone from 15 to near 4 isk a unit now if that is not through the removal of macro miners then i dont know what could cause it
you know those little pics on the bottom righthand corner of your buddylist members logging in or off amongst others person logs on you go oh crap needed to talk to himher rightclick send msg or start convo oh crap i still have that expletive person on my list rightclick removei know a lot of people who have so many people on their list they simply dont maintain it this would give them a way to solve that problem it ultimately reduces db size also reduces lag for these same people who try to open up their ppamiright 
ofc approve own idea
personally i would like to see lvl 5 make it a simply 12 hour turnaround
simple  corps who declare war on another can set a surrender amount if amount is paid war stops if no compensation is paid war goes on as usual
awesome how exact same ideas appear to be mirrored in the minds of multiple individuals at the exact same time check last post  page 3this could only mean one thing  proposed system  mechanics change could actualy work
assuming i was aiming for extortion this would just simplify the process and would probably result in more payments i winif i decced the corp for being smacktards or for some other reason when i declared the war id just be sure to set a suitably unreasonable surrender fee that empire tools couldnt acquire i wini like this idea
you can already do this just contact the corp and say ill pay you to stop
yeah but if they had a button in front of them all day while they watch their assets quickly evaporate it would make the whole decision a littleeasier for them
whyand if so why not just send an evemail to their corp officers explaining the ransom or have a chat with their diplomatit seems like an awful waste of developer time to code in something that you can already very easily do
nothis would turn in a giant fluckflest of people war deccing everyone they lay their eyes on just to set ransoms
good we need more pvp
read here 
this already exists a lot of wars are for extortion and they have explicit terms on them asis set by the warstarters most of the rest wouldnt use this option theres no need to code it in
novictory conditions are needed to prevent abuse of this systemits bad enough someone could demand a ransom of astronomical proportions jailing them without a backdoor other than praying the decing corp is rational enough to be reasonable is not what i call a good ideaps this does not count as a victory condition you need more than this like number of kills time lengthetcetc
wait you petition this how in the name of god is it petitionable if you dont want to do the mission either wait four hours take the standing hit or be less of a pansy and just do it thats not petitionable and it doesnt need a fix its lame sometimes but its hardly oppressive
nothe can of worms this one would open has too many worms to even count plus i dont even see where the point is to make a mini poshy thingy when most if not all of what you wrote as the purposes of this structure can already be done using a small pos as wellalso from your words i figure you think cruisers  battleships should be used for the base of these structures what exactly is the point in bringing a bs down to somewhere in nomansland deploying it as a pos wannabe and staying there in your pod looking at it in awe yes i did it now i just have to figure out what i can do in this shuttle around here you will require a transport to get a ship there as no ship of any use will fit the cargo hold of your battleship or cruiser so if you already have to use logistics to get a ship there why not get your ship there on foot escorting the logistics that brings the components for a posand finally the biggest joke of all cloaking do you think that reducing scanning chance to 20 or even 1 for that matter will stop people from locating something they know is there when that something is anchored in place it can not log to prevent you from probing it it will just stay there and with the godlike patience people have it will be probed within an hour or two of being detected once that happens your nice investment will go poof sooner than you could say ouchno no and even in caps no the idea just does not make sense
while im not sure about the particular mechanics of this idea  i like the concept and i think its worth more discussion smaller more mobile bases of some sort could encourage more small groups to venture deeper into 00 power to the independents
why not make ships in your ship hangar array able to carry ammo and fuel by fuel i mean anything used to power a pos tower topes lo hw along with enriched u oxygen etc etc
yup
i think were going to be talking to the gms when we get to iceland so ill slip it into the conversation after i have plied them with alcohol
petition body considering the modern mechanics of fight of fleet there is an artificial inequality of pilots of class battleship pilots dreadnought and others to a lesser degree one die at once as soon as fight is started others can shoot many hours and receive the fan and a difference between them only in the first letter of a name of the character i will explain in the fight beginning battleships the opponent are attacked on nickname in alphabetic order a similar situation and with dreadnoughts which possibilities to recede from fight at all have no as a result players with nicknames begins a b c always die the first is frequent in enter grid lag as the game mechanics does not allow to change nicknamethe essence of my petition that has bothered me to die the first that my nickname begins on a thus that there is a simple solution of this problem to clean names of unfriendly pilots from overview or to remove a column nickname from overview at all that there was no possibility to sort people by nickname it is logical to present that the size a class and a ship name is a maximum that can learn about the opponent sensors of you ship but noway a name of the pilot it is important to keep possibility of identification in fleet that does not contradict logic of friendorenemy system there is a problem to game lose interest for many people it is interesting to anybody to fly through half of a galaxy to guaranteed die first minutes of fight UFFFD to nobody hotkey target broadcasting  shiftclick compensate voice nickname target calling unfocusing fire shipclasstarget broadcasting only by squad leader  inscree squad size to 15 peoples
lol my first character was called ahlaia this was one of the main reasons i sent her to the biomass with 45mill sp
why not fly support ships that would leave out of the battleship filter all together or only fly battleships in groups where remote rep is usedbut hey thats just meif you emo quit can i have your stuff
no this will have negative effects on target calling in small gangs as you cannot differentiate between two enemies of the same ship typesomeone has to die first you should try to increase your play so you dont always die or wear it like a badge of honor instead of whining oh noes my kd ratio backbonethe problem with hotkey target calling is that these situations you are talking about are filled with lag so most of the people will not receive the broadcast or will get it too late etc etc so this just wont work the other problem is with gathering intel if two dominix jump into a system are they friendly same corp are they fighting you wont really know because you cant see the pilots name so you dont know what is going onhate the blob dont hate the game
awesome ideaedit i would forget my thumb if it wasnt attached to my
to the top
i was paged to this thread support it 100 too
supported
absolutely support either a t2 salvager or a t2 ship with bonuses for salvaging
i support your followup idea but only if they also provide a t2 frigate hull with salvage bonuses as well mission runners arent the only ones who get my precious bonuses
the type of range and cycle that it would likely give would be of little help normal t2 modules only give 515 boosts over t1 parts depending on the bonus more interesting would be a new ship class dedicated to salvaging with good storage and tractor beam bonus range oh wait that have that dont they its called an orca d
i like the idea of certificates and i think that it leads to a good feeling as to where ones skills lie however i think that it would be nice to have it so that there are more options to who sees your certificates as of now it is only public and private but i would like to see other options like corp only or corp and alliance only this will allow leaders and mentors in your corp to view your advantages and disadvantages therefore making recommendations and putting you in the right position when it comes to skirmishes mining opts etc  
the mega and hype do have very similar jobs close up dps output the difference is you can put a decent local tank on the hype where the mega really wants to be plated the hype is fine it does what it needs to do
thisit isnt that the hyperion needs to be a droneboat being the only dronedeficient gallente bs is just another knock against it in the long list for the pricetag and i must stress again it is competitive if not outright winner for most expensive bs in the game it needs to be impressive at something not merely runnerup dps to the megathron with the ability to fit a tank
good god just because it is tier 3 that does not mean it has to have more drones than tier 1 and tier 2 versatility is fine with 5 mids and more cpu than the mega lethality comes from its high gun dps compared to other gallente blaster boats if you want drone versatility go for the domi if you want a fast in your face blaster boat that can actually tank grab a hype i dont see a problem with a ship just because you want like more drones

corporatioin office pricing is insane i can understand how having an office in jita for example is very expensive or even in kakakela due to the traffic agents and proximity to jita but onnamon in blackrise school of war station is charging 100m for an office there nothing there but a laboratory and the only other station there charges 30m and thats all fw agentsso my poor corp has to work out of piak in lonetrek for 10k rental of an office piak has more agents more stations more traffic i just dont understand how the price gets computedbut with poss being so common now uping the rental price because of manufacturing or laboratories dosnt make sense please fix this asapand just a fyi the average player dosnt care about the starbase exploit
maybe because ccp thinks the faction war office space is more valuable and limited why should they go at 10k a office
office pricing is fine onnamon is a hot spot because it is a high sec  low sec jump off and a lot of corpsalliances use that to jump stuff into 00 also it is a high sec  low sec for factional warfareif you cant handle the price then move or war dec the corps who have offices in onnamon and take their spacebut whining on the forums for 30mmonth your whole corp cannot raise 30m a bleeding month please gtfo gtfo gtfo
an outpost arena that can be built very similar to that of outposts perhaps even using the same skillsthe arena will be allowed to be built in high sec given appropriate corp standingsthe arena will play host to anyone willing to pvp 1v1 2vs1 2vs2 etc without concord interference or any other interference perhaps due to a war this system also will spring up the ability to host even the big alliance tournaments to compete you bring your ships and modules to such an arena you then challenge someone once everyone agrees the combat beginsto the victor goes the spoilsalso for the owners of such stations they serve 2 functions 1 they are high sec stations these only are built in systems with no stations already so there is that factor2 you can set an arena rental cost and max match time say i set it to 1mil per use for 30mins max they can be very quick uses or up to 2mil per hour whatever you set the values such that you earn the most isk possibleofcoarse there would need to be multiple arenas per station

im halfway in between the op and the posts i think this needs to be looked at  allow motherships to do it period  as mentionned above its not like a mothership will be deployed everytime a dread goes into siege allow triaged carriers to do it wanna save that dread  it might cost ya  risk vs rewardfor larger fleet fights  not sure there currently is a game mechanic for dealing with 10 spidertanking triaged moms if there is it involves doing a lot of damage but of course the moms dont deal much damage on their ownjust throwing ideas out there
posting with your alt to get more support on the thread youre a classy guy
as it stands if you want to research a bpo it is likely to take a very long time in a queue before your job is even started unless you trust someone with your bpo a system whereby research slots could be made public and displayed in the normal science and industry window would be good this could possibly be implemented by the owner of a pos making the research slots public and setting a price for the various slot types once this is done the bpo owner must have scientific networking trained to the normal relevant level and if he has the bpo it can stay in his hanger and he can make use of the slots without giving the bpo to the pos owner or being part of his corpalliance if he takes a pos slot and has the relevant skill trained the isk is then transferred to the pos owner does anyone else think this would be a good idea
there are already game mechanics for this there are research alliances that you can put an alts one man corp in that gives you access to me and pe research the only thing that is missing is the ability to make bpcs they end up still in the pos instead of back in station i dont know if invention works from the corp hangar or not
the current game mechanics require you to trust either the pos owner or the player you are letting join your corp to give access to the pos in either case one or the other could rip the other off royally you can do invention etc from the corp hanger using the skill i mentioned scientific networking what i am proposing is to make them like any other research slot if the owner allows it and the user has the skill trained
yes this should be fixed somehow unfortunately the fix you propose has already been nixed by ccp some sort of workaround would be good but this particular proposal is not an option
because not every station has a medical facilitythat and the character sheet already gives you your clone grade
ofc approve own idea
from the last two posts  it is apperant that eve database most sertainly already uses an id for each item in the game including ofcourse ships  and there is a registration with the same database upon client ship activation  so connecting these two elements into a licenceplate is not going to swamp  lag  fail the much needed server resourcesi do agree this change would not add anything of significantly valueable or nessecery to the gameplay however it is most surly a step into the right direction  a cleaner virtual world reflection licence plates visible on scanner instead of personal interchangable shipnames simply makes much more sense
from this point you know little about eves item database structureits all spelled out in the features and ideas discussion forum under the make bpobpc distinguishable topic there is already a unique id for each and every ship that is flying around the item database is heavily nomalized already the suggestion in the op would either go into the metadata non normalized data joined to the normalized table which it already is in order to get the ships name or just used the itemid field normalized data i find it quite funny that you see fit to lecture about a database structure you obviously know nothing about

what the  does this have to do with assembly hall and the csmgo to the appropriate forum
nice job tusko gonna have to steal that datestamp idea
sounds like a very good meeting i like also timestamping the minutes is a great idea that said could you guys post the agenda in advance in future people may want to comment when an issue is set to be raised
someone can change their characters pic for a fee why not be able to change the name for a fee course i dont ever see this happening
i know the topic was brought up but the answer was very unsatisfactory we would like ccp to know we would really like this its too hard seemed a bit of a cop out when why was never even mentioned we see all the stuff they have and are doing and know this should have been done along time ago we respectfully disagree and feel that this should be done even if it is a bit hard
how we got the point that pretty much every player in eve knows the nag does poor dps has the worst tank costs the same amount of money and requires more training than any other dreadnought without a fix ill never know i guess it just sneaks up on you probably discussed before but i think its also important to mention that dreadnought is a natural progression for a lot of pilots that are serious about flying a good well skilled well fitted battleship needing awu 5 for a lot of fits bs 5 and the opposing gunnery missile skills to be a very good battleship pilot means youre already some of the way there i would hate to see people seeing turning away from high end minmatar battleship skills because they feel they are wasted skill time in regards to longterm progression full support for a buff
csm members stop slacking we have a job for you
i was in the ff 00 panels about this and after with darius i think these ideas are key but also adding in a few other things missing detail in the opsov improvements simple upgrades add modules to the sovholding poses that improve the value of the space with sovlevel prerequisited maybe deep space scanners that improve the quality or number of belts or increase the number andor respawn of explorables and encounters maybe convoy beacons that attract more pirate activity to the area lowing the systems truesechaving these as modules for the sovholding poses means that if you lose the sovposes then the improvements go boom this is important because it encourages people to hold the sov for longer maybe even have 10 levels and really want to defend it make these upgrades very expensive as well meaning alliances will likely focus on developing their core areas and all their peripheral space become less important potentially opening more areas for other alliances to move ina lot of these assumptions would need to be proven out with metrics that probably only ccp has based on gameplay patters and so forth but improvable space means less of a need for vast reaches of space usually empty unoccupied and sitting idle thumbs up darius for posting the op
linking sov to killmails will lead to abuse people will be killing their own alts in noob ships by the dozens
well yes i suppose people would the only idea i can think of is to keep people of the same alliance gaining points towards soverenty through kill mails giving even more importance to capitals in soverentybut that still leaves alts out of the alliance and all i can say to that is that make it unprofitable to do so i mean if its truely an alt all the isk comes from the same personhmmm but i can see both causing problems with corps leaving alliances and newer players because i think the only way to keep it unprofitable would be to alter insurance why outfit the noob ship you are going to killhow about scaling it so that the smaller the 1vs1s are the less you get while still getting more for be smaller than the other guy say like frig vs cruser  bc vs bc that way abuse is undoable while still incouragingsp smaller ships and fights
forget it the whole idea is rather shaky and wont be considered seriously im not in favor of itsystem sov should definitely be about anchored structures there are many different paths to take in that direction
would add more opportunities to an alliance
i like the idea of having a primary training skill and a secondary training skill so that if both are going at the same time it trains them at half pace but once one finishes it switches the other to full sp usage or even a 1 skill queue i would takeother then that im not so into the skill queue thing
yesterday i had to relog in the middle of a fleet op because i was sitting at 3 minutes till my skill ended and my character sheet wasnt displaying anything a common buga skill queue would of meant that i could of stayed in fleet

agreed
correction pulse lasers have the worst tracking of all short range turrets beams do have the best long range tracking otherwise yes falloff should scale amongst a host of other needed improvements to projectile turrets
this is a good idea along with anything else that would give minmatar heavy ships a boost in game rather than their current on paper parity
like missiles weapons should have a scaling zone of engagement as wellsmallest gun  designed for lesser size classes bs v cruiser cruiser v frig et almiddle gun  designed for equal size classlargest gun  designed for larger size classes cruiser v bs ecttracking should scale commensurately but falloff should remain relatively static to give the larger ship an improved engagement envelope versus a smaller and shorter range ship ostensibly

the question is how come ship navigation system is to stupid and only warp at 15 km and a pilot without any skills is so good and always warp to 0ccp should make this distance a random value imo this have more logic or this distance be changes by some basic navigation skill without prerequisites so any player can train this skill btw if you look in any scifi movie you never see a ship that comes out of warp exactly on dock position push this frontward if you want your station pew pew back
nogo back 2 years and get 10k bmsi had 40k entire gate to gate map  extras so u can point warpbasicly u want to create the problem that ccp got rid of whit warp to 0
if the distance is random the bms are useless
orlydo u know that the actual jump range of a gate is around 7km and at a usual station its around 3040 kmmeaning if i get a bm 2km behind the gate centernot actualy the distance from the gate but from its center in line to the other gate and warp to 0 u need a margen of 09km and will still be able to instajumpit is the same as the old bms this wont solve anything as u already warp in a 25km range from the actual spot remeber that u warp to 0 from the gate not the center of iti still say no and i explained whypeople will just return the bms and get a hell lot of stress on the client and server
so ccp should spend coding time and server time to randomize the warp to 0 command so you dont actually warp to 0you dont warp to 0 now its a random 02500 meters as it is unless your hoping you can set warp to 0 to some how be 020k off the gate then thats just in hopes to gank more people all that will do is cause even more people to avoid entering low sec at a time ccp is trying to get more people to move in
warping to anything will always randomly land you within a 2km sphere of the objectplayeretc you warped to the only reason you land in dockjump range is because of how large stationsgates are
say the farmer
we got the code only need a small change then
you mean the autopilot warping to 15km that is to add some risk to the useage of the autopilot else you could afk jump everywhere without worries if you are in a reasonably agile ship and dont meet any warp bubbles
strongly against itfleet movements would take longerhauls nm if in high sec or in 00 would take longerprices in low sec or lets say the general availability of items in low sec would change prices higher and item count lower because of the higher riskwe have a huge majority of players who never leave high sec and this would make the number even higherevery noob without a clue about fleet tactics would be able to get his shot
no reason to have bookmarks back with the removal of wtz make the maximum accuracy 10km doesnt have to be random and simply not allow any bookmark within 110km of a gatestation problem solved if you want an accurate 0km warp in have a gang mate fly to the gate and then warp to him at 0km oh look scouts in frigs are useful again
instead of removing wtz a compromise could be making so that you can lockshoot ships that are enteringexiting warp
you obviously have no idea of what goes on when you warp to zerowarping to zero is never really zero its relative so to speak its always close enough to trigger whatever even you want to do jumping docking etcas for the randomization thats so completely stupid its not even worth attackingand the scifi movies always use a metaphorical navigational method for any number of modes of transportation ones that dont are usually crappy moviesexit points need to be closely calculated or you could end up a smear on the perveribal wall eve online may not be precise as you dont really collide but the idea is quite obviousi suggest you do a little research before you make off the wall ideasthumbs down
this game mechanic would give more power to the blobs against smaller gangs it would make people less willing to travel it will reduce amount of pvp as people take less chancesanything that reduces amount of pvp is bad idea in my opinion
dev blog on music and soundsnevertheless supported
completely and utterly worthless topic but nonetheless i support the reintroduction of cis facelessness
ive filed dozens over the yearsdozensand only a handful of those disappearedthe only way we have to combat macro miners is through techniques like the jihadswarm or by putting severe limits on the ships that can be used in newb corps and npc corps so that they can be declared onand maintaining war flagging per character so that jumping corp is not a free escape clause
this is one of the issues were going to be discussing in reykjavik but for now i dont know whats going on when we discuss it you have my vow that im going to do everything i can to eliminate macrominers as that is one of the banes on the mining industryi feel your pain as ive personally reported over 100 macrominers using a 5step process to confirm i want this resolved as the prices may spike temporarily but the playerbase might mine a bit more bringing the prices back down to a reasonable levelim hoping an overhaul of mining is in the works for the next expansion but thats unknown as well well have to see how things progress but ill do my part as your representative to get all the information i can legally release and let you guys know how things are going
oh i know this will start a flame war but i just feel like i need to tell u sometingi saw u sad someting theremacro mission runerswell lets seehaw exacly can u identify a macro mission runer  remeber that the macro are client basedso the server sees exacly as a person would do the actionsand dont start telling me that u convo and stuffas i for the last 3 weeks have been runing missionsyeah vacation  low fps makes u do that and i didnt used chatsalso 90 of the time in a mission i was afkyeah domi whit drones rocksthey do all the workhaw would u expect for ccp to diferenciate from mesimply good skilledfited and a macrodont get me wrong i hate macros alsobut try to get solutions and dont even start whit the it is ccp jobbecause yes there isbut realisticly anything they do will afect players like u and meccp bans the end of the chainmeaning the isk sellersbecause that can be whit out douth provenanyway that is just my 2 centsflame on
agreed there is a danger that what appears to be a macro might be a semiafkasleep player mining certainly puts me to sleephowever if the player name is asdgthjjk then ccp should terminate with extreme prejudice t
if youve ever dealt with macros you would know its obvious when there is one no one is arguing ccp should ban people without proof but is is their job i pay money i follow the eula i expect everyone else to and i expect ccp to enforce their own rulesif you want to see a macro mission runner head to ingunn where the pirates destroy hundreds of autopilot couriers a day every single day there are litteraly hundreds of shuttles or industrials streaming into and out of the stations in the system 237 even after being blown up they all are in npc corps random names never respond to chats or player action you explode them they dock get into a new ship and resume course usually their pod finishes the script first which is funny to watchbut again my main concern here is why ccp isnt dealing with petitions
that there is a prof there human controled and not scripts m8 i understand ure frustation beleave me ive been thereand had to deal whit macro miners alotbut im teling u from expierience in servers and macroserver admin on a web based game the server simply can not tell the diference in actionsthey moveact exacly like a person wouldonly diference is they do stupid stuff like try to haul whit there podbut that alown can not prove of a macroso ccp can not ban someone just for thateven if u report itbasicly and realisticly speeking macro miners can not be bannedbecause there is know way for the server to know if someone is using a macro or notbut furder up the chain when isk are involved it is a nother matterand that is why those guys get bannedthat is what i was tring to explainccp cant ban miners even if they want toeven if u petition themfor lack of proofbut petitions will help them get a new chain on investigationand ban the end linksso even if u dont see the actual persons that u petitioned beeing bannedthere will be someone furder up the isk chain being bannedand i know that because as any company ccp wants to make and making  meens making happy playersbut i do agree some changes in there companyclient relations need to improveonly way to actualy detect of a macro is to implement a safe in the client itselfthat would delogreport to server if a keyboardmouse moveraka macro is detectedbut then u can get in a hole new range of problems because of all the diferent programs used and also because of privacy policy
i didnt mean its that simple the bot has to be started by a human at some point and has to be supervised at some point but if you sit there and watch you can tell its mechanical precision not human ccp has so much more data to tell whats going on also and all we are asking is that they prove to us that they are listening to our concerns and explain why they are not acting upon them
okay heres what ccp needs to doonce per month there should be a report showinga number of petitions issued by field on bannable offensesb number of accounts banned by field on such offensesno naming and shaming just a reportexpetition  macro use 3000banned accounts by petition 2
it would be nice if they stayed a little longer on the screen then for that other than that since the pictures remind me of instant messenger interfaces where you can click login announcements to initiate a conversation so it would make sense they were made interactable
even after two years of playing i still go over to the green logged in icon to try to chat with people msn has trained me a little too well thing is if everyone is using an interface a certain way the interface ought to support that
supported simple yet elegant
finding out where a corp you have standings with is mindnumbingly complicated for nothing when clicking on an npc corp through pp standings in your character sheet or otherwise give a rightclick option in the likes of set destination to nearest station when doing a show info on a corp and looking at settled systems give a set destination option in a rightclick menuthese are not complicated options to add and would result in less time wasted on looking for information and more time in actually playing could also result in having a smaller number of newer players entering low sec
thumbs up soldier
oh yeah they aretry to autopilot to all dest and get the shortest one then export it to u p it is not as simple as it looksanyway i do suport that for new guysbut u will get a hang of it in time
sounds like one of a handful of nonspecific autopilots that should be added we ought to be able to set destination to a region as well its possible that itd make the database cry but its certainly worth asking
vedy good idea sahsigned
except for the sin the parent hull changes part can be ignored im not really concerned about the ship model themselves they could be left the same it just looks weird when theyre missing turret points when it comes to offensive ship design the widow is already a kaalakiota developed raven hull the panther is already a boundless creation developed tempest hull and of course the redeemer is already a viziam developed armageddon this is apparent from the bonuses given from the racial battleship skill as well as the number of weapon hard points each of them except for the sin has 1 less weapon hardpoint than its true parent hull and dual weapon bonuseshowever when it came to fittings the developers suddenly remembered that they had to be based on the tier 1 battleship and thats when things got mucked up they applied the same 1 low 1 mid formula to each tier 1 battleship additionally they removed an extra highslot from the widow in favor of another mid the sin was given an extra high slot to give it the same number of slots as the rest but for some reason it cost them a turret hardpoint sin should be 5 turrets based on the domis 6 this doesnt matter that much since its fittings come from the dominix hull so it lacks the grid to fit a 5th turret anywaythe blackops skill bonuses are just weird the widow was given an ecm bonus as a throwback to it allegedly being based on the scorpion the sin and panther got agilityspeed bonuses and the redeemer lucked out since it atleast got a 3rd turret bonus although tracking is completely out of left field typically the 3rd bonus for viziam is 5 damage or 10 optimal per level but understandably that would have been too powerfulthe changes i suggested were to correct the ships since half of their design is based on the hull i suggested anyway they just need a more reasonable slot layout and fittings to actually take advantage of it so with the sin being the exception you can just move the slots around change the first blackops bonus agilityspeed would love to change the ecm bonus but people would scream nerf and boost their fittings and still call them t2 phoons or t2 scorps all you like though everyone should know that they actually arenthowever even if you made those changes the sin will still lag behind the rest the problem with the sin is that drones do not work for the style of play that blackops are designed for drones take time to deploy to be given orders not to mention the time it takes to actually travel into range and begin attacking most of this is just ui lag but it results in 510 seconds before the drones respond the only instant damage available from drones comes from sentries which a still lag due to the previous sentence and b do not travel which severely limits the sins options or results in leaving drones behindthe dominix is a drone ship and its 3rd bonus would most likely be another drone bonus in line with the creodron line of ships which again doesnt actually help if needs to be a megathron instead
the black op is a t2 support ship not a tier 2 pvp battleship its subpar pvp fitting and skills should reflect this why must you all try and make every new ship class into the new wtfpwnmobilethats what tier three ships are for d
youre about 180 degrees off if youd like to learn just how ridiculous your post was take it to ships and modules please and keep it out of assembly hall
c
while i agree that bo need a major looking at particularly the ability to use covcynos in jammed systems i do not agree that the hulls should be changed to tier 2black ops were intended to use the smaller generally more nimble and sneaky hulls they were never intended to be the brawny slugish damage dealers that marauders areagreed give them the ability to fit t2 improved cloaks and give them a further velocity bonus while under cloak to balance the kickinthegonads stealth nerf to bs speeds balance the sensor hit while using such cloaks but do not under any circumstance allow them to use cov ops cloaks unless their damage output was reduced to what cov ops frigs can do now which is effectively nilfurther they should allow covert cynos be usable in jammed system with only one change its no longer covert activating it in a cyno jammed system makes it show up like a regular cyno

mini outpost sounds cool even it would add many new possibilitys for further game development
massively supported muppetheads just want something for their mob to lynch
it would be a lovely feature to add the bookmarks to the overview and see them as brackets
the fact that 4 out of 9 csms actually supported such an atrocious idea is ridiculous the entire premise of this suggestion fails on every single levelin fact one of the 5 csms with the sense enough to vote against this horror of a post should vote to immediately dissolve the csm in its entirety

i heard back in the day ccp had all missiles do splash damage ie area effect damage to multiple targets for what ever reason after time ccp took the splash damage outshort explanation of the problem the problem i think that is plaguing missiles is ccp left this explosion velocity in the equation and they still do area of effect damage but to only 1 target this is not very effective way of dealing damage and not very realistic at all it has plagued ccp own attempts to balance them with other weapon types as wellfixmissiles need to enter the new century err go back to the 21st most of the standard missile in the world today have shaped charges this directs damage and decreases the area of effect all damage is dealt in a cone shaped area upon impact no splash damage at all is given this should help missiles behave more realistic it will also make tweaking the missile speed and damage for ccp in the future much less of a problem and more straight forward if the missile can catch the target it should do its damage regardless of the size or speed similar to turrets if the turret can track the target to a degree it will do good damage even critical hit damage typesbalanceif these changes means missile damage range and most of all speed needs to be tweaked then so be it i totally give them the green light to do any balancing they think is necessary to keep missiles inline with other damage typesother problems possibly fixedif ccp nerfed splash damage then it should revert to the other obvious missile format that does not take explosion velocity into account the shaped charge this will remove several odd and unfair effects we have now that have plagued balancingtarget painting  is suppose to make it easier for turrets to tract a target this has very weird effect of physically making the target bigger so they fill more of the explosion radius and thus takes more damagedamage vrs class  when ever there is a miss match turrets always do better damage a cruise missile will never hit a cruiser most common hull size for pvp for full damage even if it is stopped where large turret ships when firing on the same stopped ship will get bonus critical damage hits when the smae target is moving the missile damage is reduced a huge amount compared to turrets turrets still tend to do damage good damage beyond a point that missiles are hitting for single digitsplease post support and constructive responses people who want to rant or troll can go else where
i can see this bringing defender missiles back into playalso i can see the speed range damage and hp will need to be tweakedheavylong range missiles would need to slow down but increase fight time and hp boost to prevent them being used on smaller ships or just being smart bombed awaysome medium class missiles might need a damage reduction as you cant slow them down or they wont hit the correct class ships that have speed mods fittedhit points of most of the smaller missiles might need a reduction or a reduction of their rate of fire to make defenders more useful against themjust like in large turret ships that receive critical hit levels of damage against webbed targets when the target is webbed and larger missiles can hit the target they should melt under the damage not just be totally nerfed because the ship is small
nice idea
yeah go for it but at the same time we should lose optimal range for gunsthis is vacuum were talking after all so bullets shouldnt slow down once they get out of the gunso as long as you can lock and track your target you should be able to hit itsarcasm off
i am sure the optimal range has nothing to do with the projectiles ability to reach the target it has more to do with targeting computers accuracy to a set point your ammo doesnt have built in tracking computers does it its kinda the benefit to missiles missiles self track after they leave the tube so as long as it has enough propellant and speed to reach the target they always will like i said i would be willing to see balancing done to the missiles that doesnt turn every missile boat into a wtfbbq machine

fake items on contract they show up as fakes but when youre cargo scanned they show up just like the real thingyou dump these cardboard duplicates in your cargohold and then go slowboating around empire to put the pain on everyones favorite gank squadsin wwii the allies used inflatable targets to dupe the germans into thinking that their assets were of superior numbers or in different locations
you forgot your support thumband yes when going 1vs1 sadly more and more of this is gettting phased out by nerfs nothing says thank god i finished that skill to 5 instead of lvl 4 like winning a fight at sub 10 hull left on my shipreal men do structure tank those that fit a dcu newayz p
although everyone fits a damage control overheating is only a bonusedge for those who train for it
i would go along with that idea if overheating it effected only shield and armor resists but did not effect hull resist
hull tanking should be brought back as a viable method of tanking after all gallente were originally designed to be hull tankersprimarily reduce the cycle time of hull reppers to bring them into accord with armor  shield systems they take a mid slot remember forcing some thought to be put into outfityou can overheat invulns  armor harders so why not overheat your dc 15 effect not total but effect wont be terribly much but it might swing the tide of your living or dying
the reason thats bad hull tanking boost is cause it benefits battleships and cap ships much more than anything elseeven a 15 increase to hull tank is 60  69 which means you reduce damage intake by nearly 25buffer tanking is already very strong in the game and doesnt need additional boosting too much buffer tank encourages blobbing as it requires more firepower to kill people efficiently
though if they run their overheated suitcase for too long it could burn out thus making it 0 hull
while mining does indeed need changes this is certainly not a solution not supported
there are npcseeded bpos for station warehouses but none for secure containers considering the enormous size of hugegiant containers and their low value theyre either very scarce or heavily marked up please let 00 players build our own containers
i did not know npc seed drops of ai sold items in bpo format wtb minmatar control tower bpo doh wait maybe there justification for that maybe because you cant possibly move station warehouses from empire to player created outposts but you can do that with secure containers on that basis i cant see them offering up the bposyou or your corp could always jump freighter them on mass from empire and sell them yourself heck any time the jump freighter is moving stuff he can boost his base cargo by using gcs and then shrinking warping them in courier contracts if he did that for every trip he made you would have an insane over quantity in a week or twomore then likely the cans were remarked by a marketing alt you should ask around for someone willing to sell cans locally
just because you can doesnt mean you should have to
yes there is no reason for a basic commodity item to be available only through npc salesand make the bpos fully researchable as well id like to be able to invent t2 gigantic secure containers with 15000m3 capacity
ofg yes seed bpos for all containersno bpos for towers tho plz lets keep those as fixed commodities
currently there is a major flaw with certain exploration signatures most notably gravimetricpeople who locate one of these generally in empire but not uncommonly in lowsec they have discovered that if they leave one or two rocks they can completely screw with another explorers entire day because the gravimetric flag remains for the full 72 hoursthis needs to be eliminatedfixonce discovered the flag shown by multispectral probes should be removed on shortduration sites such as radarmag the site itself should remain in place until the despawn trigger is metwith gravimetric ores and ladar gas the flag should be removed only once 5080 of the material in the beltcloud has been removed this will put an end to the anchored gravimetric flag exploit but leave enough behind that while the flag is still active that someone seeking them out can recoup at least a little of the prodigious time they typically put in to find it
exploit hardlyleaving a grav or gas cloud with only a few bits left is a vaild tactic for slowing down the competition no different than pushing down market prices on goods for traders and manufacturers or stripping the asteroid or belt that someone else is mining remember eve is a pvp game not all of it involves shooting others not supported
an exploit by definition is defeating the game mechanismsif a player chooses to leave behind a bit of something in the depths of space kinda hard to label that an exploitthumbs down
it is stupidity as it block the site from respawning so damaging the people that leave them behind too but not an exploit
oh yes itd be nice to have more advanced tractoring  salvaging modules and commensurate ships to take advantage of them rather than bastardizing fighting ships for the jobt2 exploration vessels actually capable of taking on what you find would also be a boon t2 tier2 battlecruisers would fill the slot perfectly same scanning bonuses enjoyed by covert ops frigates no weapon bonuses no cyno generation bonuses replace with hackingarch bonuses or somesuchthey would have to loose the ability to warp cloaked however to prevent them becoming oversized covertrecons
the key here is everybody wants to have a salvager for mission runners when there is the ninja salvager component to remember as well so thus im all for your little tractorsalvagercargo bonuses but i want them on a nice fast frigate andor interceptor class as well
ah so we see the real reason for the request you want uber mods to ninja salvage plike i said t2 isnt going to get the kinda bonus your looking for t2 only give mild increases with a increase in fitting cost
yes please
noit will make ninja salvagers work more easyaldow i would like to see itits already to easy whit all gain and no risk at all
im an honest businessman i never lietrue however since we have no alternatives isnt it at least better to have a choicehmm i actually wasnt looking to harvest tears in this thread but ill take them obviously this guy has no clue what my request was about anyway or how it was balanced to assist anyone using a salvager
wellim not the one wining u are p but anyway why u need a t2 salvagerif we are on this part why not get t2 tractor beemst2 caps and t2 titansanswer is still no for the ovious thingsu can fit as many salvagers as u want on a ship to speed up the salvage procesthere are no staking penalty or any drawback to fit a distroyer whit 8 salvagers and mwdalso the fiting recuierments are extreamly lowso its a waste of coding timejust fit more on your shipor train up some skillswhit lvl4 i salvage a wreck in max 2 turns whit 1 salvagerso stop winingalso if u cant stand people not agreeing whit u then simply gime all ure stuff and go back to wow
this
read my op and tell me where im whiningother missing t2 items are not the point of the threadi do that thankshmm you dont comprehend much do you a destroyer is not the proper salvage vessel for the aspiring ninja salvager a frigate or an interceptor areok when they release salvaging vi ill get right on that with my salvaging v specialized salvaging implants and rigs im still looking for that added improvement in speed salvager ii modules are an obvious improvementgood for you although i dont buy ityoure the one speaking at a fourth grade level so either man up or gtfo of my thread
i find this claim highly dubiousi find it incredibly funny that this statement was directed at tchell of all people

1 last final bump
actually yes
support the desire for an change of the system by by disconection normaly a ship warps out maybee the drones could return bevor warping out the details at that system are not even easy but a change would be nice
i like this idea 2but loved the recotrol thing that was presented a while ago
owner offline  drones become invulnerable to damage and stop whatever they were doing everyone can scoop them i am not sure if drones remember their last owner but if they do would be nice to have them reconnect to the last owner on login again

i calls shenanigans
i can think of lots of reasons why they wouldnt want to do it increase in 3rd party programs that hack  keylog support burdon for ccp based on things not working because of 3rd party mods huge risk of botting and macro use removal of level playing field esp for new players or those not used to using or writing mods lots of free coders does not mean lots of good coders with the same common goal i personally would not be a fan of a mod that would let me visit battleclinic get a fitting and wack it straight into game with a few clicks like you can eft perhaps the mod could even buy the items in game and fly my ship around to pick them up tongue firmly in cheek wheres the skill in that the api or scope for modifications would have to be carefully controlled to prevent problemshaving said all of this customising the ui would be a great plus from my point of view its a great suggestion
i think youre confusing open gui with macrosopen gui means gui customization or taking the same functionality that eve has right now and making it better not automaticautomatic would be a macro scriptafaik a lot of mmogs have xml based layouts data access and limited supported scriptsgiving full access to gui layout and customization is harmless in itself giving full access to the data that is by default already available to the player is in itself harmlesswhat you are worried about is automation and that is not in any way a valid assumption when talking about open gui you shouldnt assume ccp would provide such access like automatically buyingsellingminingratting that would be the job of a macro program which is not what an open gui is
open gui or not i dont care how its done but something needs to be done because jeesus there are so many stupid things with the gui as it is
in a case where the gui customisation is limited to window size colour position etc then your point is entirely valid i also accept your example of an xml layout file to control the user interface being a fairly low risk as there will probably be no active code in therei get the feeling however that users wanting to mod the gui would perhaps be after a little more than simple lookandfeel tweaking lets suppose that ccp were to provide some kind of simple readonly access customisation access to the market area or even the chat window of the game perhaps to allow users to write a mod that would allow them to write click on a player in chat or an item in the market and add a custom option like add to my wish list or search for player info online something like thatexample exploit a mod could conceivably be written that reads and monitors the user list in the local chat and compares this against pirate kill boards or battleclinic if a high risk player or pirate enters local then the user is instantly notified this would provide an unfair advantage ok its not a macro in the conventional definition but an exploiti appricate that i am picking a rich example here but i think that my point is valid that providing access for customisation presents a potential risk of exploit
in that case you could simply not provide read access to local chat while still allowing access to it if that makes any senseallowing a string to be assigned a value doesnt necessarily allow interpretationyou could create a protected string datatype that could accept a value you give it but can only be accessed by friend functionso say a character enters local you can take that anonymous character and do stuff with his image and name and alliance info and all of that without ever being allowed to analyze the data
that sounds fancy  lets hope the gui has vb interface so you can write to it like that psounds like you got it covered although if you has their name then you could do what my example said but it was just an exameple so lets not get into that without going any further into this i dont think we need to i hope that they can produce a gui customiser while keeping things safe 
best meeting minutes yet has the csm 2 got around to prioritising the issues for submission ccp explicitly requested a prioritization including prioritization of already submitted issues from csm 1prioritization will help both sides of the table a lot if its done before going to reykjavik next week
yes its all set with priorities and all
covered alot of ground but im very disappointed with the small ship warp acceleration issue
up up up to the top again we need more support and csm needs to reconsider this and bring it back to ccp
frankly i have no idea what exactly they plan to have since theyre not saying much but this version like i already said has been presented over a year and a half ago youd think they could have at least started with the first few parts already

eve is a game that goes through many balancing changes for many different reasons recently there was a large change in the mechanics of speed in order to balance out this change the agility of ships across the entire spectrum was increased significantly this change has had some unintended consequences not since the original implementation of signature radius and scan resolution has there been a such a shakeup in the ability of ships to target and force another ship into combat the nature of the shakeup is that it is now much more difficult to force targets into combat because they enter warp much faster than they did previously especially if they are smaller than your shipthis ability is at the heart of what makes eve a pvp game without it lowsec and empire presence is unable to seriously hamper enemy movements empire and lowsec gate camps lose their strategic and tactical purpose and belt production becomes even easier than it was beforethis can be shown by some numbers produced by james lyrus relating to the new warp times against current lock timesthe supporters of this issue are not asking for a massive change or revert of any particular change but simply that one thing happens that the ability to lock a target before it leaves the grid be restored to its previous valuesas i see it this can happen in one of two ways without impacting the recent speed or agility changes either lock times can be reduced to correspond to the agility changes or the speed at which a ship is required to be traveling before entering warp can be increased such that general in space maneuverability is unchanged but the time it takes to warp out is increased to previous levels changing lock times is imperfect because were already hitting a ceiling in terms of agility on smaller ships where locking a target can become entirely dependent on latency changing warp speed requirements is imperfect because some ships did not have their agility increased however whatever is chosen something ought to be donethank you for taking the time to consider this as important enough to raise to the developersedit reason spelling

pre qr you would be able to catch a cruiser in a cruiser a bc in a bc and a bs in a bs with the new qr agility changes ships have been given almost 2 free inertial stabilizer modules now tanked ships can escape from ships of equal sizewhat does this mean this means i must being a hicinty or both to just be able to tackle a ship in addition to the web and regional gate changes i must bring tackle for the other side of the gate as well to properly camp a gate i am looking at almost 5 people just to catch someone i am forced to blob under qr mechanicsold days didnt have tons of solo gate camps and tons of solo fights but they were at least possible one of the most boring parts is the onoff mechanics of eve in qrs eve a gate camp is onoff in either you will get completely destroyed or lol warp off

nice try bringing up caldari ships which align the fastest and lock the slowest 
awesome idea smaller craft need a particularly large boost say 2530 even with max skills and a sensor booster its hard to most frigscruisers
you should not be able to point frigsdestroyers before they can warp away or cruisers if they are fitted for align but you are not fitted with sensor boosterscurrent stats work fine

this needs to get fixed
well said
supporting the reintroduction of risk in eveonline
this topic needs to be confirmed or there needs to be a statement from the devs explaining the reasoning for changing tackle mechanics
being a carebear i have no choice but to support this i want to have valid excuses not to venture into low sec you see 
im convinced that this is an unintended consequence it should be looked into or commented by ccp
wow someone with working braincells that is not crying for easy kills things have not changed before speed changes you could be fast and run with sub warp speeds now you can run with align time everything stays the same except you can hit those with fast align times if they choose to fight thus the patch did what it was supposed to do everything works fine if you wanna put something on the scales you need something on both sides to balance it out but if you wanna destroy the last option to travel around in small gangs or even alone and turn the game even more into mindless stupid blobbing and make low sec empty go ahead well atleast the game will match all your whiners brain capabilities then in short adapt or die
wow someone got a valid point oh wait there is none like in the rest of this thread
exactly if someone comes with a bsbc you should be able to point him before he can warp away because he should have scouted first so what ships are for scoutingyeah you can say that recons and covert ops but thats a lot of skill for a new player so give them ability to scout and skip gate camps with frigs and destroyers he wont be able to do anything other than warp off anyway or you could just point and kill him easilyjust imagine a new player who would like to visit lowsec  with your idea he couldnt do much other than die to your boring blob gate camps until he cant fly a covert ops ship because most of the gates would be camped 237 and that would realy help moving players into low sec as it is already empty except some systems and faction war territories

yes yes ffs yesthere is very little reason right now for fitting higher tiers of projectile turrets you get maybe 5 dps but less tracking so your real dps doesnt change much at allalso note that boosting falloff will not unbalance anything because falloff sucks opt  falloff  50 chance to hit

nice idea but with my exampleexample180mm ac ii  6000m220mm ac ii  7000m425mm ac ii  8000m
you think projectile weapons need to have their effectiveness reducedin any case this is a good idea  currently there is very very little reason why anyone would bother fitting 200mms425mms800mms i only ever do it to conserve a little ammo when i know i wont be fighting too many smaller targets i also get to polish my eft dps epeen a little but theres little to no actual effect from that the other turrets get a damage increase and a range increase in return for worse tracking and fitting this only gives the same to acs

do you mean that nanobots collect salvagable components in case of armor repairers  nanobots would simply not have the time to do anything other than fill in the space where armor has been damaged like reversed metal corrosioni belive salvaging is done by a probe  drone that takes snapshots of working components and then the ship ai teleports them into the cargo bay  nanobots would not be of much use in salvage probing because of their miniature size and the fact that salvaging would be too specific and too dependant on situation

well i think i saw this very same post somewhere else  either game development or features and ideas anyway i fall into the category that does not fly blackops but i am training for the sin to accomplish one of my own goalsi do agree about the covert ops cloak  its not needed i also do agree with the fuel bay and cpusensor changeshowever if they realy switch the bo domi hull and the marauder mega hull ill personaly pod you because i wasted months of training for the wrong ship class 
i do support idea of removing t2 bpos from game as i fully agree that system thru what they were introduced was so bad that damage done is impossible to negate in any meaningful way removal of t2 bpos would be step in right direction tho
there are better ways to introduce t2 bpos into the market
scarcity and limited supply creates a much more interesting and realistic market environment than simply giving everyone what they want your myopic goal to make t2 fair creates a million more problems than any it would solve i would argue that there isnt anything to be solved in this instancethe side effects of making highend moon mining worthless would be massive completely unsupported as this is a stupid terrible idea

yknow i really put quite a bit of work into my proposed colonial structures and i am genuinely wondering if my structures would be a good way to go about colonizing a planet i would really like it if someone would pick apart the numbers prices and quantities and give me some feedback in regards to these structures with possible revisions like i said in the first post making the planetary warehouse raidable is not a bad idea although there should be 2 areas of the planetary warehouse shipping and recieving recieving is where supplies are dropped off from offplanet and shipping is where the products created by the colony are stored shipping should be raidable recieving not this allows raiders to steal export supplies and not allow the mass starvation of a planet due to a few raiders stealing if you want access to both pony up the marines and take over the place
another idea a rl friend brought up would be the addition of slaves for a colony there would be a few differences in how they work however1 they do not have a monetary daily wage unlike colonists they are slaves after all2 they only produce half of what a colonist does3 they require twice the police presense to keep loyalthis should make slaves a viable option for a planetary colony however you would still want regular colonists in the more vital industries such as essential services power production and medical slaves would be useful in pos fuel plants and mining operations this would be especially true if you want to cut labor costs at the expense of a lower production ratesince slaves are contraband in certain empire regions there may be an added risk in transporting them to your colony howeveranother idea was to add military facilities to a colony these would be stockable with colonial marines the marines would produce nothing for the colony not even loyalty and they would cost as much as a colonial police unit as far as wages go however in case of planetary invasion each marine will destroy 2 invading marines before being expended with no collateral loss of colonistsslaves making them an outstanding defensive force another possible use of the military facility could be a bonus to defending against a planetary raid giving the colony a 10 chance per facility max 50 to resist a raid attempt provided that any raiders must wait one day before attempting another raid this makes a planetary raid an unsure thing if the owners decide to spend the isk to make their colonies resistant to theft
i do not see any problems in transition from vocal target calling to target brodcastingthe correct target calling is just to what the ccp aspires and it is not necessary to refer to a lag problem if it is a question of small gangs absolutely clearly that target broadcasting will not add the lagshas not understood polemic about two ships if they are friendly names are displayed in an overview also i did not write that it is necessary to clean names at a clique on the ship only from an overview
already saw this idea a few times most as a solution to break fleet focus fire it has a huge negative effect because of 2 things1 an alternate method of target calling in eve is quite clumsy target tagging etc2 character names are also significant because of their reputation  a good fc shoots enemy leaders or known good pilots first if available so he can reduce the effectivnes of the enemy fleet by as much as possible with the least effort
obviously not an alt of the op
1the correct and comfortable target broadcasting gets absolute fleet focus firealso it is necessary to solve a instapop problemi wrote earlier shipclasstarget broadcasting only by squad leader  inscree squad size2it is right when the enemy fleet receives the major tactical information about ommand of your fleet by default without any investigation
i agree possible to adapt but it is not correct
and maybe then wed get an align to button supported either way

idea makes good sense this also if we could align to missions thatd be nice too
i support this as long as they can be filtered on and off like all other overview items
sounds like a good idea to me will put it on agenda on one of the meetings together with the align to one
im sure if you thought about it for a bit you could figure out all kinds of drawbacks that would be fair
the balance issues are mainly with these two rigs signal disruption amplifier and egress port maximizer that are both race specific ew rigs and belong in the category  electronic superiority rigsmissplacement of rigs is not exclusive to those two  this thread shows another obvious missplacementsupporting the issue of placement of sertain rigs to be readressed
so you created a repeating system that actuayl does not improve anything anyway i have to say i did not quite get the mechanics detail in what way will the meta level scale down example we start with a t3 print then it is researched to a t4 print and gets new bonuses then the limit is reached and this t4 print is scaled down again to t3 will it lose the additional bonuses it had as a t4  will the item produced from it stay t4 or also shift down to t3 if thats what you want to implement then you implemented technological regres and not progres or better said you imposed a maintenance cost on the top of technology line
yes that is basically what happens when the quota for top tech items has been produced the next one that is produced bumps all tech items above tech 2 down one tech level so tech 3 blueprints would become tech 2 blueprintsthere absolutely is a maintenance cost on the top of the technology line but a maintenance cost is no more special than any other cost when youre in more or less constant production it really comes down to a very basic concept that is absent in evein eve pretty much all commonly used goods have high variation in who controls supply the manner in which production happens means that no entity can achieve a production advantage against their enemies when tech 2 was first introduced an entity could corner a market on tech 2 items and then that advantage could be passed on to its membersthat is what i want to recreate here but without the downsides the downsides in the original t2 implementation was that any time someone accumulated that advantage it would never go away there was nothing your enemy could do to knock that advantage out of your hands it created mega empires which had entrenched advantages that no one could shakewith this regression system you can have your cake and eat it too you can have a situation where a production base researching can give you or your organization unique advantages over an enemy but you also have a situation where keeping that advantage is going to be very difficult as everyone fights for the top spotand more fighting for the top spot in any specific area is going to open up more profitable areas in other modules as it reduces the maintenance costs of doing that research by extending the time between when the bpos are knocked down a pegie its a way to simulate research advantage without all the problems that a real research advantage would create for eve in terms of database use or player dynamicsif youre worried about a maintenance cost then you can always have a buy back for the tech 2 bpos implemented since t2 bpos are going to be an end product and are likely to be created without hindering your ability to continue research you could have npc buy orders which would recoup some of the maintenance costs of researching new items
the basic concept absent from eve is material atrition  the items do not lose quality unless destroyed completely you can repair anything no matter how damaged to 100also speaking about player alliance production the largest issue is the nonlocalised production systemif you want to hit the enemy on his production lines there is actualy only one option  kill his miners however that still has a minor impact as 90 of 00 equipment is either empire or lowsec importwhat you want to do is to put an export regulation on empire produced goods some ship classesmodules once built in empire are not allowed to leave empire borders or at least not in packaged form this would force some localised production in 00 which creates targets of war or the supply lines from empire would get very inefficient and thus slow the import violation of the export regulation would set you to 45 standing towards the empire navyi would suggest you word your proposal more accurately and not disguise it as some form of technological progres as it is actualy very far from thati cannot support this idea in the current form
wait you cant support it because of some wording what wording specificallyi mean hell i mention regression pretty explicitlythis is not true at all an export regulation is ridiculous and does not have the desired effect the idea is to have advantages via production and not simply add vulnerabilities into production even if you made it so no empire produced items could leave it would not affect any ability of one entity to have a production advantage over another all it would do is aside from flatly end the ability of new players to enter 00 give players the ability to physically attack infrastructurethat is not anything to do with the proposal which is a big picture goal to make production advantages real and exploitableit has nothing to do with 00 production being unassailable i dont know how in the world you read anything like that into it
you said something about mega empires that could not be moved  maybe i misunderstood anyway  there are 3 things in your proposal that are wrong1 there is no actual technological progress2 the system is more based on regression your best bet to best your enemy is to actualy regress the top most line by overbuildingoverresearching3 item degradation introduced that the actual owner has no impact onthis means you actualy do not improve the situation but only add significant resource overheadthe practical impacts of the above points areyou have a short term advantage but once the next regression round happens it is gone for good unreliable item value once the next regression round happens your items devaluate significantly while the input materials do not if you do not introduce item regression one can simply build for a large supply which invalidates the proposal a bit with item regression actual value of above t2 items is highly volatile not to speak about usability as your ship stats may change from one moment to the next i guess your proposal has no practical value based on the above
1 you cant make actual technological progress there is no system which will not either break the game or break the servers 2 actually there are a number of waysa expend effort to control the means of research production to reduce the ability of the enemy to continue researchingb over researchingboth of these will not be easy the first because controlling the inputs to production when the inputs are spread out is difficult the second because overresearching reduces the amount of research inputs are available to research the rest of the stuff gaining and holding a specific instance and locking your enemies out might be reasonable but youre going to extend the time that anyone else has to research other goods3 three is quite funny combined with 1 since they complain about mutually inclusive things yes your items might get worse if that method is decided upon no that will not be a problem since its just another way of gaining an advantage over someone else its like complaining that you got blobbed and that it was unfair the other guy had better battleships everyones items will go down in value except the people who made the breakthrough to get the advantageyes short term advantages are the entire idea and once the regression round happens its not gone for good its just simply not as strong until you research and start your production againif you do not implement item regression then you can indeed stockpile items but if the usage of the items is properly balancedie produced at such a rate that sink and faucet are about even or faucet is smaller than sink against supply you will not gain any benefit from doing so and if the usage of the items is not properly balanced holding onto them stockpiling will reduce your profitsitem value is not that volatile it will be very easy to track for those people who know what to look for for when regression is bound to happen and minimum regression times will be present in the systemie after the last no regression can occur until a set amount of time due to how fast research occurs
you cannot do a unless you buy out all the lab slots in empire similarly you can do b to a limited extend need to specialise on a given type of items so b is the better optionitem value will be very volatile since you cannot rely on the item being the same and performing the same would you buy a t2 gun over the best named version if you knew that after some time your investment will have lower functionality and thus lower value 
you can do a without buying out lab slots as per the op research requires an input item control the input itemor enough of it and you can control the research the distribution method of the input item is up in the airitem value will not be volatile volatile means it changes a lot unpredictably but if you know whenor close enough to when and how its going to devalue then there is very little change in its valueeg would you buy a car if you knew that once it rolled off the lot it was worth half as much of course you would people do it all the time would you buy a t2 item if you knew it was going to become a best named item within 2 weeks but at least not for a week certainly you would especially if you planned on using it for a weekand of course there is the end issue that there is a stipulation that the differences between the items be made smalleg overloading bonuses for secondary attributes
this is probably crazy but the thought just occurred to me dont do this with tech 15 do this with meta 04 the modules already exist the idea of having an arbalest blueprint isnt that crazy and the balancing is easy it also lets us remove minerals sourced from missions cleanly this would have a huge economic impact of course and itd have to be evaluated in that context but its an alternative you might want to consideras for the proposal itself fascinating but it feels like a bad idea to me t2 is wellestablished and messing with it yet again especially by providing a nearunlimited number of bpos seems like a bad plan in many ways
you can do it with meta 14 but i used t2 because there are some ulterior goals here revolving around the skill requirements of pilots i think we have gotten away from the old balance where there was only a little advantage that could be gleaned from specialization to a point where specialization is required to be effective in a field rather than say you have to spend tonnes of money and still not be very effective until you have finished training the full t2 mod set fitting advantages would go back to being money and supply issuesin the end with meta 14 there just isnt enough need of new supply except maybe in a very very few instances you couldnt make any money out of this type of system on meta 14 modules standard invention prices have t2 as cheaper and betteror just as good for nearly all modules in the game as well meta 4 items confer no current special advantage for a group to exploit so that side of the game research for combat advantage simply doesnt work
who has ever tried to contract a ship and it needed to be repaired first should be easy to implement

its pretty tough to see at a glance how things in empire politics are so how about a list ingame to tell us what wars are currently activeif not for pure usefullness it will at least imporve immersioncheers
i couldnt care less who is at war with who in empire  no support
supported but its a really low priority thats a really dumb rationale
would be amusingbut very very low priority as far as need
is it my votes will always be in favor of things i would prefer that developer time be spent on this proposal has no interest to me a developer working on this could be working on something of more value
as far as i can remember there was already a time when there was a big list containing every single war throughout the galaxy it was pretty useless as it was awfully long but i cannot find it any more you want that old list back
photon scattering field ii bpo  100 runs at a timeinvented bpc  10 runs at a timethose numbers right there should tell you something is wrongalso why the  chance to invent a item just wastes lab time
the difference is bpos are worth some hundreds of times as much as bpcs they ought to be better id imagine costing 2070 more materials and requiring an invention process is not unreasonable also you fail to note that you can run 10 bpcs at once but only one bpo  theres a reason invention was brought in and that was because its a much highercapacity production system than bpos an inventor can actually make more money on many items than a bpo owner unless said bpo owner has invested several billion  sometimes several tens of billions if the items are especially good  in owning a large number of bpos the system is fine
meh ive got nothing against griefing but implementing new items and presumably a lot of them for the sole purpose of griefing is a bit much there are better ways of doing this  decoy ships for example would have real tactical utility
i believe she was making a jokeive lost count of the number of times ive been scanned and shot at while flying through empire even when im warping to zero luckily none of those attempted suicides has proved successful i fit a tank not for max cargo and have always survivedid be more than willing to carry around a bunch of space hogging cardboard fakes just for the lol factor of watching the attackers waste their effort on nothing but a bunch of pulpwood though i currently lol when they go pop and i dont
as i said earlier this would be no problem if it only effected shield and armor resists
great idea and the resists should apply to hull shields and armor  simply because it would be tempting to use it until it burns out  leaving the defender basically naked
the 30second cycle time makes it impossible to add sensible overheating numbers so they should probably not be added if this is really that much of a problem just make it a passive module
wowsers this is awesomealmost everyone voted for it toohi5 lol
why did ankhesentapemkah and vuk lau vote no on thiswhat is their reasons
i was wondering that myselfank vuk care to fill us in
sorry op that idea is laughablewhen im mining i do so on anywhere from 3 to 4 clients all of them quite active no way in heck do i want to have to micromanage each of those lasersmicromanagement is the key to all failure someone wrote that on our briefingroom whiteboardwhat needs to be done is to use a method that macros cant manipulate sort of like those little graphic text blocks you need to use sometimes that comes up randomly on some determanistic method depending on activity and activity timers or somesuch how to do that without overloading the user however is a balanced thing
sorry but jesus op where are you getting this funky ideas fromplease do what this man said
thats why i included this sentence which mustve been missedthis would be an optional way to enhance the yield of lasers your afk mining ops could continue on without harm this idea would only give people a reason to be at the keyboard if they wished to be and make the activity more interesting as well
while i appreciate the sentiment behind the idea the idea itself is utterly horrible no no and no if ever there will be micromanagement during mining it better be in a sensible nonannoying way this is not it
i agree mining needs a overhaul but dont see that this would be the right way to do it thanks for the thought maybe after some more work on this i would reconsider it maybe you can think of some thing even better
im not so sure this is goodcontainers tends to be cheap as it is if we start manufacturing them like crazy prices could skyrocketim gonna sit back and watch this one for a bit

i want all mmos grinding to dissapear let we all start at maxed skillslvls and oh almost forgot lets make mmos offline games
well i think the learning skill are the suxxorz as they are now too much of a grind specially for new players however were they to be completely removed i would demand my sp compensated yeah and i dont see ccp doing that anytime soon p
stats in eve  no added value
the problem is that the amount of veldtrit in nulsec is insufficient for heavy industry unless you mine out every system in a large radius importation is a must for modern alliances to maintain their capital and battleship fleets increasing the potencyavailability of lowends in nulsec would not only add value to the currently crap areas where you currently dont get any better then hedhemo but would also make it economically feasible to mine locally without requiring trit to spike to 6 iskunittrit is already way out of balance with the other mineralsits not a simple market issue its a nulseclowsecempire value issue coupled with a volume problem

i would very much like to see item tabs in the item window in stationswe have this functionality in the corporate hangar bays why not in our own personal item tabsthis would be a great sorting mechanic sure you can sort your entire list of items in a given station by the name the slot the group etc but what about separating your ore from your rat loot to your salvage all in nice neat tabs that you can name whatever you want to represent whatever sorting you want what about taking your bpos and your bpcs and separating them with tabsi currently have over 800 items sitting in a station and instead of spending tons of time sorting and really managing my stuff i want to hop out into space this system would allow for much more streamlined experience while in the station and make managing items all the simpler
i support this to 100or at least make it so you can looksearch in your containersstation vault in the assets menu
i concurr this would be very usefull and would make life a lot easier for traders especially if you could also see the quantities
this has been brought up before lets get it on the agenda yesi cant see whats wrong with having individual wallet and corp divisions for everyonethere are people who create a corp just so they can sort their stuff out
id prefer making station containers not suck to making explicit tabs but yes better sorting mechanisms of some kind would be good
yes yes yes the current pos system is a joke
unanchoring abandoned offline posses issue was raised by me and discussed on csm2 meeting 5 last saturday it passed was escalated it is on our agenda for the ccpcsm meeting middle january related meeting minutes
my eyes glazed over reading the post you linkedseriously that guy makes me look laconic but from your summary this looks like one of the best general mining overhauls ive seen to date this isnt 2003 interregion mineral movement is really easy and thus theres no reason to keep regional mineral types all mineral types everywhere at varying concentrations and mining crystals let you pick and choose what to mine more of you dont even really need varying grades you just need varying concentrations  if a highsec roid only has 1 arkonor youre not going to get all that much out of it no matter how much its worth on paper and it makes mining scanners useful which is also a plus in sum i like
supportedmaybe a handy modificationmake the ores occupy different levels of the asteroid ie arkonor cannot be accessed by a regular miner untill the asteroid is mined down to 20 or so similar scale for other ores

looking back at the issue with pos reactors ccp could fix that and untold other bugs we dont yet know about by using this idea
a better concept doesnt help buggy code it just introduces more bugsas for this issue im against it we already talked to ccp about it and the answer was clear if we raise it again we will look like spoiled children who wont accept a nowhile the concept is nice and all i dont think we should risk the good relation between csm and ccp by not respecting their answer
why would we be spoiled children if we tell them this is something we want even thou it will be hard also i read the minutes it went basically funny pos thing too hard ok clarify its too hard what why if you arent going to give us an answer that satisfies the customer then the customer has the right to ask for clarification or the customer can say i know it will be hard but do it anyways neither of these things make you children a child accepts the answer because i said so an adult doesntwhat you are saying is if ccp says no we should roll over and never question it what kind of adult relationship is that grow a backbone and do what the csm was set up to do represent the player base
i agree with last post completely this is just too hard should not be in ccps vocabulary also for a csm there should be no conflict of interest of trying to appeal to ccp you are supposed to appeal to us you represent us the players we are not spoiled children most of the eve player base anyway we pay for this game if that does not disqualify us for being spoiled i dont know what will
tbh they said no we all know that but it was called the funky pos thing first off which to me says it wasnt even really considered2nd you guys even said you didnt really talk about it at either meeting it somehow floped out of the first one and was never covered and the 2nd meeting it wasnt even brought up this to me says csm failed in there job the first round on representing this idea and it should be brought back to ccp they should be made to talk about it and if its no again then give a real reason not just a no its to hard just imo but i would have thought you la vista would have been interested in bringing this one back yourself it doesnt make someone childish to want something really looked at or checked if this is childish then man us over here in the us have a messed up political systemcheersps i support this idea 100signed
but your relationship with the people who carevoters dosent matter then eh 
eh dont bother people will read the op and reply with support long before they reach page 15 in fact we should keep bumping these old alreadyagreed threads as much as we can because in doing so ccp might actually adopt a policy of locking or ideally moving to another forum created for the purpose issue threads that have already gone up the chain not doing so is pretty silly because as evidenced by this and many other threads they distract voters and accomplish nothing it should have been like that from the beginning
heres an idea set standard goals for ratting that are common place in your corp that make sense get ships for ratting that well rat well get skills that allow you to well rat well get common sense learn about market functions learn about investments and payouts train hauling skills train more common sense ask your alliance to use common sense ask your alliance to actually invest in its 00 space for the right reasons and the right ways i did my money making this last time with a sacrelidge 5 heavy assault launchers 1 salvager quite honestly i could have done better if i felt like grabbing a t2 bs from empire but i like to pvp in my limited play time these days so ive not bothered really if you want documented proof get used to life sucking im not here to provide you with all the answers to life if you seriously cant figure out whats been done then well natural selection didnt favor you god help us that some people were destined to be successful for their efforts while others werent
haha way to resort to ad hominim attacks instead of actually backing up your evidence bravo you have outdone yourself caod is in a different forum im better than you continues to not be evidence so lets do math because i like math and it gives us a better ballpark the only figure im going to take in account is bounties you made 150 mil in 6 hours is your claim which is 25mh in bounties this is a bit highball for what i get in feythestoria but most of the regions you listed are npc 00 so they behave like 10 truesec the biggest question is if you used another account to haul the items around and clean belts as you ratted for this would save you a lot of time because you have ratted recently getting a screenshot of an hours worth of ratting wouldnt be hard would it although i can extrapolate from the approximations of how much you make per hour when we look at fountain ratting if you make 75mh in delvestaincurse and only 56milh in fountain if we divide by 3 we get 187mh off bounties which seems reasonable for a well setup systemlets put it a different way9 of eves characters are in 00 00 feels emptyhow does yaay encourage people to venture in 00 for more fightsfighting takes time time is isk how can 00 support the individual pilot over time i include pvp time better than empirei think the reward has to be worth it that empire corperations would be willing to fight or slip by gatecamps to get out into 00 for isk making operations not just to stay in 00 but to venture out in it from empire i dont think that venture is worth it in the games current state unless your corp has a presence in 00
nothing more to say then yes please
i know hardly any alliance or even if there is one that has died in the past year due to financial ruin and an inability to muster ships for fightsi make less in fountain because of the lack of nearby stations whether npc or alliance owned where i rat the salvage is also slightly less valuable because honestly the drone rigs are worthless for any 00 entity that issue is or should be a non issue 25 mil an hr for rat spawns is an average day for anybody with a clue properly chained systems reward upwards of 40 mil an hour per 1 person they can hold typically 810 belts sustain 1 person whos not totally emo selfish i ratted in a system with multiple people so those numbers declined down to what probably was around 25 an hrlooting in a sac requires all of 2 seconds since its a close range ship that maximizes its damage on npcs the closer it gets defenders have no effect inside of 5km ive also never claimed to loot everything when solo only those things of value although when i do run 2 accounts i tend to bounty farm even faster and make more from all the loot salvaging has the same luxury of being in range already with that ship t2 bs are just naturally ranged well and can salvagetractorloot better while dealing more damage hense that comment about their profitabilityper 1 salvage on the proper targets i typically make about 800k in stain its more like 12 mil in fountian its more like 4500k good salvaging skills speed up the process considerablyanother consideration of 00 is salvaging fight wrecks which tend to pay out enormously and which 99 of 00 people ignore in 1 fight against the monkeys i salvaged about 140 million and most of the wrecks were either lost to time or other people granted you have to actually win a fight to even get to that point god forbid where in empire can you do those sorts of things and in timely fashion a considerable collection of agent missions take more than a 15 minute window which 00 ratting allows empire lacks moons legit loot faction spawns commercial value renters and a considerable number of other valuse that 00 already holds 00 does not need a boost although empire does need a nerfthat said if the devs ever for any reason actually listen to the general consent on insurance failures ill be all for a more profitable 00 as the rewards will start to match the risk more appropriately

what about not having a queue but instead having a backup skill or secondary skill that you can assign that trains should the first finishesentially you can easily burn off those small skills albeit one at a time without worrying about getting up at 0300hrs to set a skill then again at 0328hrs you then only have to worry about having at least 89hrs skills laying about as it stands i sometimes have to remote desktop my pc from work to set small skills to burn off which can be a pain in the ass a little queue would go a long way
if you want to create a skill train tree till the end of time then never bother with skills again i dont see a problem as long as its only 1 character per account and it only trains while the account is active but it would require some sort of area on the website for you to import your skill listsome people have mentioned using the new certificates system as built in skill tree training but why not go as far as ship train trees some may be wanting to train to fly a raven it would automatically train all the recommended certifications for that ship
id say a 24 hour skill queue is more than enoughedit forgot to check support

while i dont trust the s presented i thought the boost to agility in qr was crazy didnt make sense you can no doubt find my post in gamedev on itthey should have decreased agility of battleships and such not increase such that they have harder time to get awayraven 50km from 0km warp in of belt the interceptor preqr would tackle in say 10 seconds post qr the interceptor would take say 1215 seconds thusly agility has to be adjusted to increase warp away 25 seconds or whatever s are right post 10 i made this very point months ago

while the ridiculously low standings increase of this storyline makes sense because it is so stupidly easy to complete i would rather see it go
it does seem to be pretty pointless when i see this flag up i open market buy some ore pick it up accept and completethen sell the implant for more than what i got from the missionit was great when i was just starting as it gave me access to implants id not be able to afford without selling a gtc but now its pointless
scrap the mission and replace with something better thought out 
scrap it completely the price on 4 implants might go up a bit if you did that which wouldnt be a bad thing at all imo
talking to a lot of friends in the industrial side of eve most of us think its kinda silly you can manage 100s of sales orders but can only handle 11 research or manufacturing jobs at a time how about a new level skill for bothexpert mass production  rank  adds  slots per levelexpert laboratory operation  rank  adds  slots per levelwont eliminate crap alt buildingresearching accounts but would ease the burden on folks in this worldwide financial crisis
i couldnt agree moremake them rank 10 or 12 and maybe let them add 35 buildresearch slots per skill level
im trying very hard to rationalize the concept of ccp disallowing bookmarks within a certain distance of a gate or station yet still allowing unlimited loitering within that same distance sometimes while under fire from gate or station defenses

terrible idea just wastes your time and mine haveing to wait three or four mins depending on ship each time you warp to a gate
what he saidyour just looking for ganks

oh god yes
sweet baby jesus i have wanted this since i started playing

apart ftom the price difference is there much point to the covetorit takes pretty much the same amount of time to train for a hulk so if they have the isk people will go strait for the hulk which as most people have a second toon then they probably willi think that the training time for a covetor should be reduced so that they are more of a stepping stone then just something for people with no iskeven just reducing the astro lv5 skill to a lv4 would be good enoughps i already have a hulk
the covetors skill requirement was set up when exhumers didnt exist and it was fine in the era when they cost half a billion nowadays its a bit of a joke either give the covetor an advantage over the hulkprobably a bad idea or drop the skill reqs a bit like you say astrogeology 4 is probably about right
okay finally had a good chance to look at statshulkastrogeology vexhumers iiiindustry vscience ivmining iv mining barge vspaceship command ivcovetorastrogeology vindustry v mining ivmining barge vscience ivretrieverastrogeology iiiindustry v mining ivmining barge iiiscience ivi would like to think we all agree normal progression is retriever covetor and then hulkastrogeology and mining barge iii to v for current retriever to covetor thats 2 ivs and 2 vs covetor to hulk entails adding exhumer iii super quick and spaceship command iv the only bit of time really is that level 4 in sc i would suggest the skill to pull from cov is mining barge v astrogeology is such a very important mining skill it should be as high as it can be  i respectfully request the differential skill being pulled back to level 4 be mining barge and not astrogeology for the covetor to hulk progression
this seems like a good idea
align to was designed specifically not to be for bookmarks because of the role play factor of aligning to is only for celestial bodiesor something like that honestly though who does it hurt by leaving it like this pvpers who benefits carebearsi do believe i would like to hear why they have to side with rpers rather then the greater good

supporting this
oh certainly
i find that when mining it is hard to maximise you yeild when mining ore the main problem is trying to remember which mining laser is on which rock the other is the mining run meter i will first say that it has been mentioned within the corp i am part of that other games and even military hardware give you the ability to see which weapon is focuseed on wich target to solve this i propose a numbering sytem that would also apply to the pvp weapons if you have two laser each on a different roid and each roid with different amounts in it eventually the lasers will switch positions several time from left to right or right to left if each slot had a number and each icon on the target had a corresponding number this problem could be solved my second suggestion is a trickle rate for ore coming into the hold if you had the ore coming in one unti at a time but the asteroid amounts remaining the same you would be able to mine more efficiently as well as ensuring that there is little afk mining the only change will be that you can see how much has been mined and turn off your lasers sooner or have a mining list where you would lock onto two or three asteroids set your lasers mining and then when the roid was empty they would move to the next for this it would only reqquire you to click the laser button just before the run had finished to confirm you are there and not afk mining if the button is not clicked then they will stopi would appreciate any comments and thoughts about this matter and accept all critisisms so long as they are politemany thankssilverswann
when im mining i use the survey scanner and check how many is left in the asteroid if it is less then i mine in a cycle i check where the cycle is currently at if i know which strip is mining which asteroid its not hard to decide when to stop the strips  so i dont think it is necessary to show the amount you mined but it would be really nice to see which strip is mining which asteroid
or you could just move the pointer to the top of the screen and turn off that particular laser on that particular asteroidsimple really
if you remember which strip is mining which asteroid yes thats the case the problem is when you mix up the strips  it would make it a bit easier thats all
if you highlight the asteroid that was low youll automatically select that one in space plus the view changes to the direction of the rock itself as wellive not had any problem with this issue and it doesnt really need numbers on the icons either
signedi think unlimited is a little overboard i think a 24 hour queue fits very well
and thats bad howoh yeah care bears something about high sec being completely safe yadda yaddanewsflash people dec and ransom people anyway  constantly having this feature would make it less painful for both parties and nothing is preventing victims from hiding in station and waiting out the week if they dont want to pay  something that wont change ever unless ambulation allows us to carry crowbars in stationmaybe i should clarify by war goes on as usual i meant under the current mechanics  as in one week length of war which must be renewed or it will expire
i think this is the start of a good idea as it is there is no gaurentee that the corp wont turn around and start a new war dec but if this fuction was used along with the meet up you could then introduce a cntract term of say two months or more in which they can not be war decced again by that corp or that ceo should he decide to disolve his corp create a new one and then try again
time ago acceleration gates were tweaked to make them bigger they are the same gates theyve got all the same but you dont have to reach the beacon to activate them they are easier to operate nowid want the same process for normal stargates this way ships will reach activation range without having to literally crash into the gate or get caught inside and make the screen and ship go nuts while jumpingno more bumping stargates i know freighters will lose their ability to reach 1kms during normal gameplay but i think its for the bestnow this by itself wouldnt be much of a problem to implement jumping manually to the gate will leave you at the same distance and autopilot jumps will behave the samebut this little change has tactical repercussions over the honest job of gate campingit will mean that an incoming vessel will have a chance to be more far away from the campers and increase the area that needs to be covered to defend the gateactual configurations of bubble deployment will have to be revised to adapt to the new sizesome people really works hard not to leave unscrammed space around gates
the reason they changed the radius of accel gates were that people were getting stuck you cant get stuck on a stargate  its not a warp its a jump meaning even if you are stuck in normal space you can still get out as such theres no need to change this
if you take into account the enormous effort ccp has made to date to make the graphics of the game i think that yes there is bumping into gates and getting stuck in them is not a nice sight at the current exchange rate of bumping stargates should already be out of their place long agoi understand what you say about jumping but what if im in a freighter stuck at a gate and i warped to it by mistake what 5 minutes of trying to get out 2 or 3 more to realign to the real destination
description some character spends hours just hanging cloaked somewhere in system with no visual actions seeding probes etc player leaves this char unattended every day for hours this happens in low sec system this was acceptable if there was something in action but this is just a harassment that can be considered as abusement the invisible char is invincible because of it that makes his opponents helpless and unable to make counteractions against that actorthere must be created some instrument for cloaked chars not being so comfortable for spending hours in hostile environment users should be given a chance to defend themselves let that instrument not be quick and smooth let it be hard to detect but give it a 1 of success it is better than 0 at all
why do you need to defend youself against someone who you say isnt doing anythinghow is someone who isnt doing anything to you harrassing youget a grip put your bigboy pants on and get over it if the invisible inactive person scares you that much  leave the system its a big galaxy and you can go to safe space if you are nervous no support
the same thing i told to gm but he insisted me to post that here as a good ideai dont like being blamed for carebear whining but gm is an authorityhis unprediction harasses noone knows what happens in the next sec he can probe you in any sec and throw a gang on your headand the invincibilty of cloaked harsses this is an exactly the abusement of the feature any action can have counteractions to be balanced only cloakers are ubers in that option nothing can be opposed themfor sure we all have bigboy pants and can easily give  on him but give us a chance find him after one hour two hours of scanning but there should be a chance to get cloaker
ingame harassment is legit in this game i agree a cloak change of some description is probably a good idea but the above poster had a pretty good suggestion for you
not really no the cloaking mechanics are still a very large problem in that they allow an individual to project power without being at his computer or incurring any cost or risk to himselfthe reason that they can do so is because everyone else cannot simply treat the cloaked individual as if they are not there they have no way of determining that they have no way of determining if they will come back or when they will come backbecause of that they must treat them as if they are actively hunting at all times or they are going to be taking inordinate amounts of riskthe big irony here is that the guy who want to sit in space with no assets at risk away from his computer for long periods of time in a position that requires every other person in space to assume they are active and modify their behavior accordingly is not the one being called a carebear and derided for not being man enough to deal with it
remove local and the problem is solved
agreed then everyone could stress out equally or not stress out equally  whichever they prefer
its called mind warfare get itworks as intendedremoving local while may be a good idea could actually make things rather difficult in the terms of intelligence youll throw a fit about cloaks even thencount on it
except people who were cloaked of course their stress level would be more or less unchangedremoving local is a monumentally stupid idea
that is the reason of the icon but there arent plenty of guys screaming for a removal of local at least they would be happy
i think system scanners should find cloaking ships yes these are sov modules that wont help those in low sec but this forces the cloaker to stay active and stay moving he cant just move in one direction afk because repeat scans would reveal the direction he is moving and players can just mwd gangs in that direction and decloak himas for low sec meh you dont control the space so no cool decloakie sov mod for you p maybe a limited au chance based probe could be created that would allow the hunting of cloaked shipsthis idea would only allow the capture of inactive cloakers who would be doing nothing but griefing locals witch i dont see a problem with it would be impossible to capture an active cloaker as he would see incoming ships or see launched probes and warp to a new position
i understand what youre saying there are a few small independant groups that wander 00 the cloak is the only technology that makes this possible i do not accept that by doing nothing possibly afk eating lunch that i would be griefing anyone im just flying and living free nerfing the cloak would further gridlock 00 even more than it is now we need more freedom of movement to revitalize 00  not less this proposal would equal less freedom of movement when so much has been lost over the last few years already keep space free  leave a fighting chance for the little guy to move through the lands of giants
afk then log grief by sitting in a ship with a cyno for hot drops as scout for hostile fleet or intel gather then you should be able to be huntedthe ideas i give would be easily counteractable just by simply changing the direction you fly every few minutes you can still hover over hostile outpost or jump bridge or gate everything should have a counter balance currently there none for a cloaked ship we propose a very limited counter that can at the least make staying in hostile 00 or low sec mean you need to stay at your keyboard
i cant accept that someones mere presence in the same system can be considered as equal to greifing sorry i just cant
you do realize how big space is right in the 23 hours between downtimes a ship moving 40 kmsecwhich i dont think is even possible anymore can cover 3312 million kilometres thats about 002 au you would need most of a year just to get out to onboard scanner range if you were flying a pimped claw 237 put differently if youd been doing that the entire time since eve has launched in 2003 youd have covered 44 au which is a midsized warp youd cross a big system by sometime in the 2020s mwds are a joke for this task
its things like the covops cloak and local that set eve apart from other mmos intelligence counter intelligence and using black ops ships to disrupt an enemies economy just add to the already impressive depth of the game and fyi there are ways to deal with those players just have to be creative
up
to be quite honest im not very bothered that my name starts with a but then again im not all that often in fleet pvp situations so i might not be the best judge of thathoweverremoving the ability to sort by the pilot name column would be enough you dont need to remove the pilot name column altogetherof course that would mean that the pilot name needs to go on a completely differentseparate column from everything else so far a column which would be empty for all object except piloted player shipsthis does have the advantage of minimal disruption while eliminating the main grievance

nocxiuma highly volatile mineral only formed during supernovas thus severely limiting the extent of its distribution vital ingredient in capsule production making it very covetedtech 2 pods1 will be a sleak stylish one one which will be really really good at getting around it has a very high speed extreme agility and high warp speed2 will be the ruff and tuff pod it will have an inherent warp stab built in so even if you get scrambled by that 1 ship you can get away
no
try a shuttle or interceptoran extra point of warp stability wont help if youre in a bubble if you die in an unbubbled pod consider uninstalling eve and taking up checkers
wow you goonswarm guys have some serious hax eh have your say battleships destroyed and you have a shuttle or interceptor waiting niceit happens all the time your ship dies you lag as you move into your pod interceptor picks you off or smartbombs go offwhich again i forgot to mention that part this pod can survive a nice beating
bump
i dont see why stealth bombers can not use a covert ops cloak i would think it would add to the list of useful functions for the stealth bomber able to warp in cloaked fire a salvo and warp out right now it seems like the stealth bomber is more of a sniper or gatecamper both roles are already filled by more effective ships
because if it could use a covops cloak it would be a better covops ship hence making the aforementioned ship class obsoletesbs need some lovin but giving ti a covops cloak it not the answer
short and simple suggestion add the ability to sort items by the volume they take up handy when looting to find out what is hogging all your cargo space and could be left behind in favor of looting a bunch of smaller items  items meaning modules charges drones ships corpses ect
supporting my own suggestion
support this would be a boon in trading especially i think
it doesnt serve a purpose any longer with all the nerfs that ruined it im primarily talking about the station redocking range increase the undock bookmark warp the stargate enlargements the statis webifier nerf but there are others too logoffempire is like a seperate safe pve shard already
posts like this are impressive in some ways pvpers claim to be the ones who suck it up and deal with it and yet they can be just as big of whiners as any carebear yes wars could use some changes zomg they ruined eve fix it1 is not a change
aside from gunswhich certainly do require serious specializing and shipswhich i dont think you meant to include in your proposal t2 skill requirements are pretty trivial  most can be gotten in under a day and i can think of exactly one offhand that takes more than a weekrcu ii also a desire for increased specialization is natural with the gradual aging of the player base and wealth accumulation in the economy  people can fly better and afford better so the expectation is that youll be better i dont see any real way to fight that the reason why i proposed meta items is that your proposal talks about giving out bpos you could make very good money on an arbalest heavy bpo for example  since the module has exactly the same mineral costs as meta 0 it would actually be very good money youd have to dramatically lower the number of bpos you allow since one can produce hundreds of modules a day when were talking t1 build times  maybe a cap of 10 of them in existence  but thats tweaking and youre right no special advantage just money that said last i checked people liked money besides its not like there will actually be exclusivity for anyone important in flying with t5 gear  you dont think every alliance going will have someone doing this stuffand just as your proposal was as much a way of tweaking t2 skill requirements as anything mine is as much a way of removing item drops in a sensible fashion as anything if they want to make meta items buildbased this would be how it ought to be done imo i dont think thats a goal thats practical at present but if its to be attempted this provides a good model of how i just dont like the idea of tech 5 items because i dont think that they can be made to work in any sensible fashion
value reflects functionality  thus a car loses value as it ages becasue there is a perceived loss of functionality or new and better gets introduced in your proposal all the manufactured items would continualy lose functionality without the owner being able to do anything about it ie good treatmentservicing in real world also the loss of functionality would be in steps all of a sudden and not a continuos degradation 
hersh ill get to you later today1 the real world is not ever a valid argument for balance2 since the devaluation is known pricing will move to reflect the changes in its usefulness before that change in usefulness occurs3 it doesnt matter if the degradation is continuous or notalso as a note devaluation is always continuous while degradation is almost always even in the real world discrete this does not change devaluation occurs continuously as it becomes more likely that the item will be degraded
im a bit ambivalent about it but ill give you this its at least a halfdecent ideanow the problem with this idea is how to make people stomach itand theres also the issue of research slots and research type that needs discussingpractically its a lot like your initial idea the only difference would be the presentationpersonally id do call it somewhat differently backstory wise you call it technology progress index technology inflation index or other somesuch pompous sounding nonsense that index would be a float number which rounded off would be the current bpo metalevel right after an adjustment but can vary afterwards before the next adjustmentthis index will very slowly increase whenever you do mepe research on the blueprint and a new type of general improvement research would be added into the game using inventionrelated skills and maybe even invention slots that would do nothing else but increase this tech progress index on the bpoinstead of introducing new techlevels or whatnot you simply work with existing metalevelst1 blueprints can oscillate from meta 0 to meta 4 t2 blueprints can either be meta 5 or meta 6 navy version only and thats itofficer and deadspace modules are not affected by anything at all everthe changes to blueprint metalevel would only occurr once a week at most say on the monday downtime in order to prevent too much volatility but the trend of the change next monday would be updated each downtime just not appliedthe changes would be made in such a way to maintain the average tech progress index across all blueprints of the same category existant in the game within a certain agreedupon intervalbasically you downgrade some of the items and blueprints one metalevel they are the exact same old items they ever were but that the entire measurement scale has shifted easy to picture in case of hitpoints addedrepaired less easy to picture in case of turret optimal ranges or reisists values and almost impossible to picture in case of rof changes but its well barely within suspension of disbelief levels they would keep their current mepe levels but lose one metalevel some items would remain the same stats backstorywise theyre actually better than before but the same compared to the technology inflation level with a very small mepe level drop they are better so they take longer to manufacture and cost more to produceat the same time very few items get upgraded to the next metalevel and they will lose a massive portion of their mepe research levelssounds complicated but it isnt
i know industry has to be changed but this proposal is ridiculousfirst youre saying that the items created by said highly researched blueprint original or copy should reduce to a lower level at a certain imaginary level and on top of that the blueprint should change as wellwhat half way through a production run when some one else ticks over the imaginary maximum number what do you get half and half or 100 of the old or newyouve put a lot of thought and effort in to this proposal but its just too damn annoying exessive and not to mention expensive eventually people will get fed up having to research the same things all the time and hope theyve still got time to produce items and yes and get them to market that well all end up using civilian guns and newby shipsits all very well having a dynamic market which is what we already have but introducing any mechanic that resembles this will make eve online die exageration possibly but people enjoy doing a repetitive task up to a point and that point is that they know when its all going to be over in terms of researching of course copies and products will have to be made and marketed but thats what industrialists and researchers doi hope this doesnt even make it on to the csm agenda unless its extremely rewritten without the massive nerfbat damageedit just read akita ts wall of text you explain it wonderfully and its still a bad bad very bad idea statistics shifting every week you dont know if youre going to be average below average or back to where you started from because a few fools researched the snot out of hmmm lets say 10mn afterburner is or even iis if the idea applies to t2 bpcs as well okay read my post and see if you can see the light at the end of the tunnel which in this case is a very heavy fast moving train on a very steep down gradient with no brakes
well for sanitys sake only the bpos would ever change metalevels bpcs and items would be frozen at their current metalevel and most of the time your bpos will remain at the current level just losing a couple mepe points and seldom drop a whole metalevel instead and youd get a pretty decent daily advanced warning as to how exactly the shift if any would occurr next monday
so for example on the sunday the producers will know certain bpos would lose a few mepe points or indeed gain them magicallythis is not what was originally intended by any means and even that idea doesnt work eitherpersonally i think production is fine the way it is if there could be some sort of branding or customer loyalty that might work and the market place will help with that at least people can pick a supplier regular or irregular as that may be
however i see a critical flaw at least with the bpos that start off as t1 bposon one hand you want to have the heavily researched blueprints to push down the rest and give everybody a reasonably fair chance of getting something other than metalevel 0 t1 bpos this means that the higher blueprints need to be a percentage of total blueprints otherwise you have the same old t2 bpo monopoly story with the only difference being that pumping more research into it shifts the ownership from one person to the other more or less equitably so its basically just a big dissapointment anyway since the needed effort would far outstrip usefulness and youd better just have the demand filled from dropped mission looton the other hand the supply of t1 bpos is infinite so whats stopping people from simply buying hundreds or thousands of t1 bpos and only researching a couple to maximum levels while using the rest as a global sink effectivelly granting everybody a perpetual arbalest manufacture machineeither way this doesnt end wellthe more i think about it the more i realize this whole approach is sadly doomed from before it started  too much effort for way too little resultsa much better effort instead would be to implement an economy of scale instead that would not only be much easier to code but easier for just about anybody to understand making 1 single car costs much more than 11000 of what it costs to make 1000 cars and so on and so forthsure you no longer compete researchwise but you do compete quite fiercely in the industry department
this is actually a better idea the more you can build the more minerals you save up to a point of course so it will now be a good idea to build max runs in one go rather than a handfull of course if you cant make max runs for whatever reason well that should be reflected in your market price as theyll have a higher margin of minerals to produceim sure theyve done it before but it got changed in the opposite direction
it does work just fine if you use a quota system and have a common input good that is scarceeg lets say you want to get a constant monopoly on a certain itemyou need to a be the first in line researching the top tech level then immediately after everything is downgraded you have to start researching on an entire quota of the itemthis will let you produce that item for the research time and cost you x times the research cost where x is the quotabut it will also use up some of these scarce necessary resourceseg lets say that you have only enough input materials to research 1 bp per item per week if the quota is 5 then by holding a perfect monopoly on that item all the other items must necessarily take longer to downgrade the key that makes it work is the limited input materialexcept that doesnt change anything it doesnt allow item quality production advantage all it does is make it so that big producers produce cheaperall you have to do to do it is increase the install cost of jobs longer jobs become much more profitable its really a separate and much simpler issuei find this similar but not quite the same your idea hinges on a fixed degradation doesnt have unique player produced items and doesnt really allow anyone to out tech someone else it has merit in a method to allow players to produce named items but beyond that it doesnt offer the competition present in the other optionin either the scarce resource or the valuable item metrics
as noted all jobs get kicked out and any unused materials refunded in fullresearch jobs get reset and all materials refunded in fullthere is no reason that anyone has to be punished for starting a production job or research job at the wrong timenot really no we have a market with a number of barriers to entry and we have production with costs measured in risk we do not have a market where anyone can secure an advantage against a competitorwe have no competition for who sells the best itemwhati can almost see how it could be considered annoying but there is no reason that you cannot just sit and continue to invent or continue to produce tech 2 items or run a research job once and then sit on a t2 bpo if you found it annoyingi do not see why you consider it excessive i really do not see why you consider it expensive when no measure of required costs is discussed and mitigating factorssuch as npc buy orders on t2 bpos can easily be built into the system to reduce costseventually people will get fed up having to reinvent t2 items and oh wait no people arent going to get fed up having to do research to stay ahead of the curve because they are doing that right now and arent quitting eve over it right now people have no problem completing two step production with a risk based initial system why would they get fed up at doing a two step production without a risk based initial system there is no reason anyone would end up using civilian guns since there would be no changes to tech 1 productionwhich goes on inventionwhich goes on and the end result of the new system is tech 2 bpos which makes tech 2 production even easier than it is now for the masses if people so choose
this suggestion is to expand one of the best features imo in eve dynamic pricing in the npc market i believe this was originally done to force players to spread out and add depth to something that is normal static and stale in mmosas you will know excess demand for offices in a station means the prices for offices rises and will continue to rise until demand falls low demand causes the price to fall until it too reaches an equilibrium with a min charge this also already occurs with some other npc product skill books leap to mind what i would like to see is this being expanded to all npc services where possible the most logical to me is also the most contentious the broker fee making the broker fee dynamic would encourage sellers to spread out over stations then systems and maybe ultimately constellations and regions from a flavour text point of view the brokers working in the busiest systems jita 44 for example would demand the highest prices as they would naturally be the best there isthe consequence of such an action would be deep and far reaching but in a good way as far as game world and market dynamics are concerned and would change the face of the eve markets forever
i dont see why everybody constantly wants to break up jita maybe it made sense when it was wrecking servers but thats more or less basically fixed now amazingly people dont just flood until the server breaks again  peak seems to have stabilized around 1000 jitas working fine and even with the electronics level of the modern rl world differential broker fees dont exist if anything its cheaper to trade on the nyse than joes stock exchange because theres more competition among brokers maybe it would have worked that way precomputers but nowadays volume of the market is not an issuei like dynamic pricing for goods where supply and demand is an issue but for services especially electronic services where locality is virtually irrelevant its a bad idea
remember back when ccp was nerfing bookmarks 3 ways to sundaysince the warp to 0 has come in i have not heard whether ccp has unnerfed bookmarksi am posting here to see if a csm will bring this up at the next meeting  does ccp have any intentions of unnerfing those bookmarks and allow us to move and copy hundreds of bookmarks at the same time  has this already been done either partially or fully
i remember a ccp employee talking about fixing some things on the evemail system but his changes were nothing like what i have suggested here who was that guy againwhat is this cosmos project does it include the changes i have suggested
i have only been playing eve for a couple of months now and like many of you could not imagine a life without it however i have experianced a few downsides to the game the main being its numerous bugs now i dont profess to have any knowledge of how this game is created or maintained but i do know that if i was build a wall i would try to ensure that all previous levels were flawless at the moment i cant help but worry that this game we have all called home for many years now is doomed to fall i have talked to sseveral players and dont ask me who as i have forgotten and would not say if i new and have found each in turn have subbmitted petions for varios bugs only to recieve a reply stating that they were unknown i also feel that for a game of such an age the interface should have a greater simplicity to it my main hangup is that there is not a single button you can click to collapse all the market dropdown menus with this in mind as well as others i am sure have been mentioned by others i would like to ask if there is the possibility for some action to be taken to improve these problems i must stress that i do not mean to offend and i do not haveany desire to get into a debate this posting is merely a means to be heard and if somehow a result come of it i will be very pleasedmany thanks silverswannps i would like to mention that i have heard other mmogs tend to reimburse you for time lost due to unnexpected downtime or errors i do not know if ccp do this but i would hope if not they will attempt to in the future after all we have payed for that time and it is their responsiilty to ensure we get it
nice small enhancement
remote repair and refine would both be very handy to have
can flipping is even easier then mining there is no risk other than the risk that the owner sends a drone at u or tries to jam u then u get to not only take their can but then u get to come back and blow them up ive done it many times and i used to mine they could at least make it somewhat challenging
i was hoping this thread would die but sadly here it is on the front page againthe whole premise of this proposal is under false pretenses jet cans were never meant to be used for mining as i have shown before gsc are in the game and ccp says if you must mine into a can use a gsc but gsc are not meant to be a way to jet can mine for the record gsc are used for freight while hauling or for deep space storage of valuable materials not an easier way to jet can minewhile the hacking idea sounds ok it requires a lot of skills to hack while almost nothing to anchor failed hacking attempts should not give you a flag since you did not take anything attempted stealing is not the same as stealing the penalties shouldnt be the same and it gives too much control to the jet can miner which shouldnt exist in the first placefurthermore miners do not want this is this wanted by the players no the players wanted the orca and while it was not the dream ship no ship ever is it certainly can be used as a giant can or hauler in mining ops and is fully intended to be such miners that do not have friends or an orca and encouraged to find friends or a corp to work togetherthis is clearly not needed and not demanded by the playerbase it puzzles me why you would want to add in a feature to eve jet can mining when the developers have been very clear that they never intended for jet can mining and do not support it or recommend anyone do it
if your rational is nobody cares thats fine you made it sound like you thought it was useless because you wouldnt use it i imagine that wed all prefer some decent search functions attachedfat chance i know but yeah thats what i took the proposal to mean
i remember this it was pretty coolno it wasnt search privateers wardecstbh i think we can bring it back now before it was abused to find weak targets
maybe yesif it could be sortable as to region size of participant corps then yes i would love it back would be a great addtion for mercernary corps for example as they have an easier time finding likely corps to hire them big ones more likely to pay well blah blah
are you aware that those number mean simply that you can put up a run of 100 consecutive construction operations from the bpo and only 10 from the bpc not that you produce 100 and 10 from each run just to point it out the difference in materials used between a unresearched photon scattering field ii bpo and a invented photon scattering field ii bpc with 4 me is1 unit of isogen 2 units of megacyte 2 units of morphite 104 units of pyerite and 14 units of tritanium about 24k isk make it 35k at perfect me each invention attempt 1 million 50 success rate ie 2 millions for 1 10 run bpc so inventing your cost are higher by 235k for each module but your investment is lower by several billions cry more
no changes are necessary just the creation of a highly highly expensive method of inventing a very very negative mepe t2 bpo that way those who are lucky to have won the lottery arent forever sitting on a golden egg just because they were lucky with no risk at allrisk vs rewardthey get multibillions in profit vs no risk at all
that was my first thought but i cant think of a serious use for these if thats their only purpose then its not a joke whether comedy was intended or not
i now have nearly all my learning skills to level 5any attempt to remove them will lead to me demanding my several months sp training time backno support
they should stop seeding the skill bookso eveyone who already use there time training it wont be lost
does anyone else find the eve forums the most childish place on the internethonestly i havent seen this kind of haha i dont like this so youre a dummy since i was in preschool and its in every single thread on these forumsfcking pathetic
i cannot accept the argument that there is not sufficient minerals available in 00 almost every 00 system is full of roids the size of moons because noone mines it if anything hisec should get the new ore as there is nothing left in the belts i wonder if its not the case that people prefer to sell gtc for isk to fund cap ships than get involved in the gathering of resources do any real industrial mining corps exist in 00 and low sec these days what ever happened to fighting for resources
is there enough veld out there to support a battleship program sure do you know how much trit goes into a single dread though you have to strip mine entire systems to support a capital construction program now add in battleship rats and roaming hac gangs lots of risk there youll need a decent sized gang to make sure you arent surprised and destroyed and have your hours wastedfor those exact same resources you can sit alone in 05 and mine afk in relative safety why on earth or new eden would you even consider moving heavy industry out to deep 00 see whats broken there the people who do choose to reach out and live in the end game areasostensibly the richest in the gamecant be self sufficient you can get megacyte and zydrine easy in some areas sure but you need hundreds of millions of units of tritanium on a very regular basis the only economical and practical way to gather this is to do so in empire space the riskreward on gathering the requisite amounts of veldspar is just too ludicrously tipped to the risk end not to mention the mindnumbing tedium im not saying to make it easy to collect lowends in nulsec im just saying to make it easier

lavista vista as much as i respect you for the work youve done for this community ill have to disagree with you here it is such an overwhelmingly supported idea by the community giving us a simple no we cannot do this is unacceptablewe need a good reason why not ccps nope cant do it and well look into it answers are getting very tiresome
the thing i do not understand is with the impending release of wis which bare in mind is probably 100x harder to design and develop then the proposed pos changes it actually worries me somewhat that wis wasnt even something that is widely wanted by the eve community nor does it actually add much to the game other then fluff yet currently is being developed and soon to be implemented but an idea thats been kept alive for almost 3 years is immediately shot down without reason other then to hardacrel
what really frustrates me is i do software development for a living and i know that if i told my boss i cant do something simply because its too hard id be without a job pretty soon its just an unacceptable excuse and shows a very bad quality for ccp laziness
i dont fly caldari because their ships look like ass but i feel sorry for you guys they were hella broken before and op but thanks to the adjust lightly with hammer approach they are hella broken the other way  of course so are a few core game mechanics but at least those screw everyone equally
missiles were overnerfed
fixing is good
1 you just claimed that your numbers represent the final culmination of a full days ratting in an already properly chained systemyou cannot then come in and claim that 00 ratting allows production in 15 minute windows it takes a lot of time to properly chain a system certainly more than 15 minutes if someone is chaining in front of you theyre doing work for you that you have to consider into your calculations of profitability 2 empire does not lack legit loot though i have no clue what it means3 faction spawns only in delve4 commercial value are you actually saying that there is more profit to be made in 00 selling than there is in empire seriously there is a reason that the markets are larger in empire5 renters are not personal income nor is it income that draws people into 00 its its actually a cost that they have to pay to the people who already own the space6 other values not defined because they dont exist7 saying that empire needs a nerf is the exact same thing as saying that 00 needs a buff after all that time bloviating about how its so easy to make money you turn around and say oh yea but you totally dont make enough more money than in empire and it doesnt support enough people which is what everyone else has been saying this entire damned timeso what youre actually saying is that your real production wasnt 56m iskhour or 75m iskhour as you previously claimed but it was actually one half to one third of those claimsaddendumi am going to guess that you dont consider hauling time into your profit calculations do you
i dont even spend serious time in 00 and want to see this improved perhaps because then i might supportedsome time ago i suggested one mechanic that might work for this it might be food for thought for someone

i believe i said bounty times and as for hauling you mean to that station in system where i sell things 00 markets ftw not everyone relies on jita for profits team work allows for system chains so yes 15 minutes of time logged in is feasible if your team is working that system all day again teamwork not i pwn selfishnesswhether the system is or is not properly chained does not negate the fact that you can log in for 15 minutes and do something where as most empire agents require more time00 markets have higher profit margins due to scarcity empire markets offer quicker turnarounds if youre not a price gouging git or even if you are 00 markets are nice klast i checked moon mining and renters often go to alliance programs such as capital replacements so while the income is not directly in your wallet the effects are certainly significant to the average 00 player not to mention that renting opens doors to smaller empire entities that could not practically hold space for themselves while reaping the rewards of 00other values include things like complexes 00 agents and pirate faction gearships hello phantasmnightmare rattlesnake etc and those in space cosmos areas that pay out quite well not to mention mining drugs and trade routes into 00 space that pay the most of any in game empire getting a nerf isnt the same as saying 00 needs a boost one forces more inflationary pressure not inflation you ed gits im sure will comment and outrageousness into the game the other does not this game cannot sustain its economy forever if the faucets do not get turned off rather than increased this is an age old problem in all mmos that has truely ruined them when everyone becomes wealthy it loses meaning there is a reason to have class warfare
rise
they died for many reasons money for the average player wasnt one
do you understand the concept of costbenefit do you you see if youre benefiting from your corp mates work then the guy who initially started the chain is paying for your increased profit not that he would do anything else but he is still paying for your increased profitgoods still need to be moved within 00 unless you only rat in station systemsyes the prospect of rending space will certainly endear the alliance subsisting of 00 production income to go and move into 00oh waitso other values is delveinflationary pressure is money supply increases that create inflation or stuff supply decreases that create inflation you git though nerfing empire would likely cause inflationary pressure through a reduction in production since more of empire based production is in items rather than isknow boosting 00 by increasing the amount of isk produced there might be an inflationary pressure but you dont have to increase the amount of isk produced you could instead increase the amount of stuff produced which would be deflationary pressurealso i do not believe that outrageousness is a quantitative measure of anything that can really be increasedyes it can the age old problem in mmos is not that people get wealthyif people get wealthy in eve they will simply pvp more which was good the last time i checked the age old problem in mmos is that they create a lot of currency faucets but there are no continual currency sinkseve doesnt have this problem because you can always trade isk directly for minerals via npc sell orders just as you can always trade minerals for isk via insurance fraudgame crippling hyperinflation simply cannot happen because if it starts people will turn all that isk into materials with the push of a button it also cannot happen because there is constant requirements for new stuff when people blow it up edit eve is not a loot grind mmo stop treating it like one because you havent the foggiest about how economies work
i really really dont give a  d
absolutely not this one of the most blatant cases of mmo cry babyism i have ever seen you have not payed for the skill train you char is not active he is lucky to be remembered for you mega thumbs down if it ever was advertised as a feature of eve i can understand why it is now referred to as a bug personally i see people getting irritated at having to address billing issues over and over again with people who complain over a few bucks ive been there but i am better now phew mutter grumble
shrug why not
i couldnt agree more ccp would be foolish not to implement this
aye
eve has drastically grown over the past two years battles with up to 1000 players are now taking place quite regularly over time ccp has taken steps to improve the cooperative aspect of this multiplayer game by improving on the gang system and turning it into the fleet system we know today however in these great battles of today allied forces are being held back by a very legacy aspect of the gamefleets are limited to 256 players any players who are not able to be inside this 256 player fleet are severely hindered by the lack of the ability to warp to another player for strategic position the csm must push for ccp to further develop the fleet system to accommodate more players the means to do this could be as simple as doubling the number of playersslots leadership skills affect or introduce command specialization skills that mimic the effects of warfare specialization skills perhaps the chain of command could be expanded so there can be a maximum of 5 squads per wing 5 wings per fleet and 5 fleets per whatever itd be calledit is absolutely horrible when a fight is going on and you cant get a warpin because the fleet thats there is fulledit changed title name to be more descriptiveedit 2 i have begun a new thread in the features and ideas section of this forum if you have an idea on how to improve the maximum number of players in a fleet please post there
yes this would be cool ccp released the sovereignty skill for large corporations and i imagine they could do something similar for large fleets
fidonet was limited to 250 nodes initially too but had over 35000 eventually
supported either change the bonus of the leadership skill to allow 3 or 4 people into a squad or change wing command and fleet command to allow for 2 more squads or wings respectively
maybe they should set the limit to 128 players that way fleets are more tactical and require strategic planning across multiple fleets
sounds sensible to me if you can actually get 300 or more people organized to fight on the same side you should be rewarded for it not screwed
hmm yes reduced capacity to handle large numbers of players is exactly what this game needs dufas
this is necessary absolutely necessary
yes agree  though the fix doesnt have to be increased fleet size letting people turn on warpto for themselves if in corpalliance similar to fleet invites or something would also be a way to fix this
make fleets bigger
i think the best option is to just up the number of players in a squad to 20 or 15
mucho gusto
next level needs to be called armada
dealing with two fleets at once is annoying as hell for the average pilot in the fleet much less the leadership supportin dis
support
yeah
i support this fine idea
dont support more skill less blob in 00
20 to a squad 10 squads to a wing 5 wings to a fleet thatll last a while
this makes a lot of sense
i approve of this message
yes

this
this is an excellent plan and will facilitate providing da bytez
skills should be requisites not barriers it should be a pain in the ass getting everyone skilled enough to use a 1000man fleet it should nonetheless be possible and i dont mean by ventrilo and prayer i dont much care what the fix is but it should be fixed
agreed fleets have been getting bigger and ccp needs to keep pace
signed
do dis
no brainerif the nodes can handle 600vs600 fights the fleets should be able to grow that largecome on think of the size of that gang warp
another goon who thinks more people need to be allowed in fleets posting here
this would help a lot
yesit made me laugh to hear ccp say something like please let us know first before engaging in a large fleet battle or else there will be consequences that should never ever happen in an mmo
dont see how this could be anything other than a good thing
granted i will likely never use such a function as i have a distaste for flying in fleets larger than 510 i can see the meritssupported

please please please
aye
i vote no to thismaking the formation of larger blob fleets easier will go completely against what the csm and ccp have stated they wantare looking at in trying to make 00 warfare more fluidfunmobileetcalso with the lag monster that is still out there making blobing easier and larger will only make the lag worse
begging for it
dude the situation already exists not putting in larger fleets wont somehow fix the stategic issues of large scale warfare those issues exist because of the objectives of the game not because of the infrastructure of fleets its not like were going to stop using fleets of 300  400 people just because its inconvenient when the alternative is losing the battle we just figure out awkward workaroundsin any case kudos to ccp for actually making fleet battles reasonably fun though they could still be better please add this
i support this it should happen
oh hell yes about timeif youre in a small corpally and think this doesnt apply to you  think again when several midsized alliances get together for important ops this is just as important
do it
this is one of those proposals that all sides can probably agree with
ya please ccp
this please
1change leadership skill bonus to increases maximum squadron size by 4 members per skill level up to a maximum of 20 members
supported
yeah this
yo smoke trees and support this
the best selling point of eve is the epic space battles the servers have been improved its time for the fleet system to follow
yeah
im calling you out over thiswhats up fidonet buddysupported trying to manage multiple fleets is a nightmare
i too support this idea we need a change and an upgrade
yes 256 is a barrier that is constantly broken even simply doubling this would be a huge help
some content
me want
yes please
i too support this
fantastic idea
gs member in supporting this shockerthis needs to be highlighted even if ccp dont want to or cant increase fleet sizes or add more command levels afraid of balance issues for bonuses for example just allowing characters to be alliance warp beacons would solve most of the actual problems caused by needing multiple fleets
i have created a thread in the features and ideas section of the website to augment this proposal details and a link can be found in the op
this would be okay but still ty for fleets with allies in it the ops suggestions is an overall more practical idea
agreed
i was in a giant fleet i had this problem it felt artificial and kludgy please fix thanks
supporting
yea this will never happen you have to remember that while most game companies take steps to improve their game over time ccp has actively been making eve worse therefore this good idea will never come to fruition because ccp hates its customersremember you cant spell incompetence without ccp
yes yes yes
support
supported i would also like to request that fleet have a general fleet window like it does today but also add a second fleet chat for only wing commandersboss
yase
not supportedrather we need limited sized fleets with some option of exchanging tactical intel so when you need a warpinpoint the fleet whos in the field of action should be able to broadcast location to fleets that are in the same groupthis should give rise to more interesting ops imo and put in place the tools needed for future efforts to split up blobs
yes
not supported unless the current fleet system was scrapped and redone firstfleet window causes horrible ui lag and that needs to be fixed before cramming more people into it
that really needs to get fixed
i take it you like posting without reading threads this complaint is bogus and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the issuesupported
supported this would be very helpful
against ita couple of activated sensor boosters  a properly set overview  a scram pre activated and blinking  instant lock
with respect thesonarnet i dont see why people should gimp their mid slots for a rack of sensor boosters even harder for amarr just to tackle somebody  though as olzi points out in some situations it doesnt matter what your scan resolution is they are in warp and safe before your client has registered they have decloaked because of inherent background lag were not asking for tackling to be made easier we just want it the same as it was before qr at no time did ccp state were going to make tackling much harder and make it much easier to travel around while youre at war or in low sec so it would seem the qr changes had these unintended consequences which is what we want looked atcaptain thunk
lock times didnt change and you can find align times by looking at an old version of eftfor the most part ships cruiser sized and above had significant decreases in their align timeseg align time for a raven was something like 153 seconds without an mwd pre qr now its 105 seconds158 with an mwd activatedfake edit i went and got an old copy of efteft 281 taken from gripens eve files index and these are the align times this is using top tier amarrslowest align usually and lowest tier caldarifastest align usually with the exception of interceptors where caldari and minmatar are used everything else is going to be in between the two numbers i can do entire sets of ships it just takes more time and isnt much worth itnone of the ships are set with plates agility modifiers or mass modifierspreqr only the numbers below are align times which means that its how long it takes the ship to get into warp from a dead stop75 of its velocity battleships qr preqr mwdqr mwdprescorpion 10 149 148 214abaddon 119 175 177 25 battlecruisers qr preqr mwdqr mwdpreferox 74 106 101 144harbinger 8 114 109 157 cruisers qr preqr mwdqr mwdprecaracal 37 53 51 72maller 47 67 68 94 frigates qr preqr mwdqr mwdprecondor 21 3 3 43punisher 3 42 44 57 interceptor qr preqr mwdqr mwdprecrow 21 3 31 45claw 23 34 34 48as you can see pretty much everything has received a massive increase in agility so far that some ships are more agile with an mwd on after the changes than they were without an mwd on beforepretty much everything is getting into warp 30 or more faster than they were beforeas was said earlier the actual agility of the ships doesnt need to change just how long it takes them to get into warplooking at those numbers it seems pretty clear to me that the solution is to increase the speed necessary to get into warp to compensate for the agility changes
supported  plz ccp deal with this it is ruining the gameoh and thanks to goumindong for doing the math
one can have an instalock but it does not help when overview update interval is 1 second and module lag 23 seconds
what i find disturbing is that i need 2 lock time scripted sensor boosters in order to catch a cruiser with my broadsword thats just too much before 1 was enough meaning you still sacrificed almost 150 dps tank now its just plain silly
supported hmm me supporting a goumindong thread is that hell freezing over that i hear o0
good points raised personally im leaning towards option 1 or 2 purely on the basis that theres some chance ccp might do it  3 has potential but much harder to get right which reduces the likelihood of implementation any time sooneither way a good thing to fix
storyline missions should feel important and raise the characters faction standings by a substantial amount this mission should be changed to be a mining mission at the very least  ie instead of kernite bought off the market you have to go mine the ore from a mission deadspace
i just had an insight lately as questions rises about scheduled logistic movements people in corp where asking when the next convoy starts and i figured out the there is nothing in eve where your corp can put in schedulded tasks visible for its members this has to be done outside eve what is at least for me a bit annoying so i suggest to implement a type of calendar what is accessible at different levels like alliance  maybe only ceos of the member corps as example corp andor directors only to show scheduled tasks to the corp members like mining ops convoys roams pos bashing etcand please forgive my bad english its not my natural language
all apologies accepted this would be really good for op planning as i know when you have people in 3 major timezones au uk and us things get confusing when setting dates and timesso a calender where you can plan things and have a time left display like skill training time remaining display would be extremely useful and shouldnt be to hard to implementgreat idea
the number of corp management tools that ought to be added to the game and havent been likely numbers in the thousands thats why i go for modding  ccp cant and wont code all of that but the players will that said if modding isnt going to happen a few of the basic ones should this is pretty basicedit whoops forgot that they mentioned this at fanfest no need for ccp to raise it thumb removed
inventing a useful marketable world timezone calendar is a disturbingly good idea it really should be part of my os 3d rotatable realtimewith attachable bookmarks that rotate with the earth and let you know say how many pilots are going to be available in two hoursas for in game it would be real handy to select display manufacture completion dates or research or whatever you care to measure great idea and a chance for eve to show off some great artwork and create immersion in that the player does not look at an rl calendar but their char does in game
supported
ive heard that this will come for sure ccp presented that on the fanfest
ccp had a nice presentation at the fanfest about some plans adding social networking features to eve accessible from both ingame and out of game i think the presentation even included a calendar app this op sounds pretty much like something they are already working on so i see no reason to raise this issue for now indicating the desire to have such a calenadar app in faceeve could be useful but i think this feature is so basic in any social networking site that i do not think that they forgot about iti like the idea tho
to those of you dogz of war who continue to support this topic many thankz please take the time to add a thumbz up to your post this makes it eazier for the csm to evaluate support again thankz to all thoze who have viewed this topic thoze who have posted in support and thoze who have voiced the oppozition view i dont agree with those oppozing but itz great to see pilotz taking this issue seriously
wait for me to catch up before you start tiering the newbies out of existence it has been a fun challenge pursuing my industry career and if you guys get more slots all us beginners are gonei like how even a brand new gleaming off the factory floor noob can make and sell in a reasonably competitive fashioni would rather see greater interactivity and complexity rather than and endless tiered rat race as in rodent running inside wheelas in wow how you have to allowforce yourself to accept that mysteriously that guy there is thousands of times stronger and can therefore handle a really heavy axe that is bigger than he is its stupid and it needs to stop in eve before if goes mad as in other games i for one would stop playing the only reason i do play is because i accept that technology can create a ship that is far more powerful with a single chipon the topic of cpus i think cpu upgrade should do morethere are thousands of people mad keen on upgrading their pcs and would love to do the same in eve well i unplugged the old cpu and popped in a better one but it was too hot so i have to attach liquid cooling and then i used salvaged junk to modify my power conduits that gave me a boost to laser strength i was kinda put out when my mechanic and engineer skills couldnt be traded i wanted to buy a ship attach parts and sell it but that doesnt work because pilots cannot use ships that they do not have the skills for which kills potential professionsbig no from me no no no please no leveling is bad actual player skill is good
im not entirely sure you grasped the exact proposal were not talking about making builder a able to build cheaper than you were talking about allowing a single character to build or research more items simultaneously instead of having to make an army of alt characters for the sole purpose of sticking a manufacturing job in a slot or a research job in a lab most builders both new and old utilize alt characters to be able to buildresearch more than 11 items at any one time this proposal would alleviate that need somewhat and perhaps allow those ppl to make a few more pvp or pve characters and actually experience the other facets of the game on a limited real world budgeti dont see how this skill addition would segregate players it just gives you a chance to play the game more fully on a limited budget and if anything would let newer players compete more in the market without having to shell out more real world money just to train a second third or fourth or more building alt on separate accounts at the same time maybe i am wrong here and ppl can show me why im up for discussing it at least and thanks for contributing to the thread in favor or against
yes please managing multiple manufacuringresearch alts is a painit is strange that i have one trade alt easily handling the output of my 4 productionresearch alts
i think this falls under the need to be able to speciallize more within industry
mr ceaon what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent thread were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this forum is now dumber for having read it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soulthumbsdown
what i want to see is possibly a different policy depending on what you are warping to if it is a gate i would love to see it drop you off in a cone shape around the entrance so that you sort of shoot through the gate also it would be a nice thing to see ships moving in orderly lines when in high traffic regions say you are in a frigate and are on auto pilot you get warped to the frigate lane which is moving fast and if you are a slow freighter you move to slow lane and if you warp to zero you appear at the 0 to 2000m radius as standard but out of the way of the lanes also if you warp to okm and appear inside an asteroid you should explode that way miners can hide in low sec fields and bookmarking barracuda must take a huge risk to warp into the field but they can reduce the risk by training precision warp skills and using clever bming could be looked atsupported
this is already in game it is called anchoring a mobile warp bubble or flying an interdictor or flying a heavy interdictor

i am currently between retriever and hulkand have to say that the cost and the skills present a problem for me but it only seems right that the skills differences are on par with the price differences even though i know nothing about the expense of manufacturing either vessel the astrogeology train is like a brick wall to me at the moment i have other more important skills training not everyone who uses a retriever is a hell bent miner it is a useful tool that comes almost as a bonus to the industrialisti thought the opinion of a player currently facing these questions would be useful to the discussion tbo the covetor does not factor into my thinking there is what i can use and there is the hulk also the astrogeology v train is far more interesting to me because of the deep core mining it allows which is useless to barges but interests me

the covetor skill req is wrong imo1
agreed currently the canon is to train for retriever then go straight to hulk since theres only a day or so training over flying a covetor
honestly the training times for a covetor should be shorter if you where to nudge that ship a little further back on the skill tree and widen the gap between hulk and covetor it would make more sensethe only reason im going to park myself on the covetor is due to cost and the fact that tech 2 ships usually are a little expensive to replace and most people dont bother insuring them
agreednice idea
yes please deditoh snap i meant to hit thumbs down jk d

thumbs up to thumbs down

thumbs up for thumbs down
i copy pastad the gist of this from another thread id made on those forums yeah i realize what a ship needs for it to be balanced with the rest of its class doesnt necessarily mean that theres any chance of that actually happening the problem with leaving it a domi other than drones not working well at all with how blackops are used is that it still lacks the grid to fit a 5th turret that it definitely needs so giving it a 5th turret slot that was denied to it because its a drone boat doesnt actually help all that much and if you were to give it a 5th turret and made the blackops skill bonus another turret bonus another 5 damage or 10 optimal maybe even 5 rof it would still need to have the 757 layout i proposed for the megathron version of the gallente blackops in pvp that is for pve the sin makes a great ninja exploration site runner in nonfriendly 00 space otherwise all those changes are a waste since you lack the slots to fit proper damage modsand if you give it double turret bonuses and the drone bonus now give it the 5th turret hard point along with the grid and slot layout to utilize it while leaving the domis drone bay on it remove the drone bay and drone bonus and grats its the megathron version i asked for then it becomes a very good ship in most encounters such as when the drones arent that viable yet insanely overpowered in other situations that arent really blackops related see the panther pre speed balancing if theres one things players are guranteed to do it is find those situations where its overpowered and specialize the ship specific for those circumstances to take advantage of it again panther this would give the sin and only the sin a new perspective and people would start flying them for those specific situations leading to a nerf resulting in pilots using the ship for its designed role who finally equal their peers to once again fall behindthe problem with making the 3rd bonus into another drone bonus as its design indicates it should have is that in all likelihood it would get a useless bonus to control or drone bay that does not help it whatsoever even if they gave it something crazy like 20 per level to drone mwd velocitydrone optimal to allow it to compensate for the sluggishness of heavy drones would help sentries as well leading to bouncer ii snipe fits etc the real problem is mostly due to the crappiness of the drone ai and lagresponse times dealing with the drone ui the sin already has decent dps in eft the problem is well over half of that dps is difficult to apply in combat and even when you do it takes too long to start kicking inso to balance the drone dps they need to be buffed enough to compensate for the difficulties with utilizing that dps it wont fix them but its the best the devs can do to mask the problems with them giving the sin a 2nd drone bonus it should be another bonus to 10 dmghp per blackops skill level at all level 5 skills without rigswhatever this would result in394 bouncer iis becomes 591386 berserker iis becomes 579475 ogre iis becomes 713450 garde iis becomes 6755th turret hardpoint needs to also be added unless it also gets a grid boost this really only allows a 5th electron blaster cannon with a tight fit nothing short of comedy tankmids leaves it enough grid to fit 5 ions or larger for those with rail fits electrons  dual 250s grid wise slightly higher cpu costs but they should still fit 350s are even harder to fit than ions though so no luck there that would give it at max skills 435 turret dps 1 dmg mod plus the dps from the improved drones above 1147 eft dps with ogre iis in reality less but good dps when drones can be used and subpar but respectable dps when they cant
seems reasonable that empires would control t2 but i like the idea of players being able to control resources if it gets too constricting it should be loosened but i dont hear very many people complaining

all the nano  ships were hella hella ghey and this needed to be done badly however the new system is totally ed and needs to be fixed even more badly
the thing that made 00 mildy fun is gone
ill put aside by bias against the recent patches to say thisi roam in delve as a hostile to bob and their pets who live there i have lived in that region for more than 1 year i represent the small scale pvper i take notice of whats going on who else is roaming what fleets are movingi in the last months it feels like im the only hostile in the entire region  whos not part of a blob i realize thats not true sometimes i come across other small fighters hostile to bob but there are so few of those that its easy to feel like small scale pvp is deadit wasnt always this way i remember there were more people roaming i lived thru these changes so i can feel things change every patch it gets worseblob wars still doing fine tho blobs just keep getting bigger and juicier

i have to agree with that it neednt be proactive heres a list of all the exploits but rather when they make announcements that indicate specific activities are an exploit it should be logged in some suitable easily found place like say the new official wikiit makes life a lot easier when you can explain to new players that a given activity is most definitely not allowed and point them to official info on iton that subject  said list really ought to get a forum area equivalent to the info portal or part of it where questions can be raised about precise wording ive seen announcements of exploits that left a lot to the interpretation of what was said  nothing worse than ambiguous law that cant be clarified

gl with that also let it be once again stated that anything you numbnuts  about in a cloaking thread i could do in a t1 frig
pro itthe whole gathering intel through sitting cloaked in a system for hours needs to be overworked at all atm you cant prevent someone from entering your system unless you have a 237 gate camp somewhere and even then its possible to get one in with a little luck and once your alt and thats the next you dont even need a lot of skills for that eng1neering v  cloak 1  10 days max is in then you cant do anything now imagine me starting a corp which has only one reason selling intel to whoever has the isk  wtb 50 cloaking 1 ready chars to provide corp mates with the right equipmenttheyre cheap and a couple of weeks later every 00 system with a station would have a cloaked alt in it you cant do anything to prevent thatim sure no one would like to have that situation
you misunderstand what is going onif some guy cloaks his recon and jets off into the distance no mwd just flying anyone who lands a 0km hit result on him will end up on a grid with a cloaked ship that is flying in some random directionthis is because the cloaked ship that is supposed to have a cloak will be traveling fast enough that it will clear 2km before the probing ship landsso in order to find the cloaker the probing ship needs to probe again and then approach the new hit result with a propulsion mod on this will align themselves on the cloaker and then you will run into him decloaking himyou can do similar things if the cloaker is orbiting point in space now this only works against afk people because anyone not afk will notice someone landing on grid and burning to them this will allow them to change direction and warp out to a new location this occurs whether or not the ship is able to warp cloaked since any ship that has a bonus to cloaking devices is able to warp instantly after uncloakingwith such a system present on all probesas it should be a system that only had pos system scanners would be an unfair advantage to sov holding entities then normal cloaking would have its uses since you could hide from directional scannersmaking it harder to figure out where to scan you down from and set up ambushes and ships with bonuses to cloaking devices would maintain pretty much their entire functionality so long as they were not afk it actually kills the afk cloaked person has no risk sitting in our space making us assume he is active problem and half of the raven ratter warps to a safe spot and cloaks the instant anyone enters local problem in one fell swoopgive me a bit and maybe ill write something a bit more formal and readable on the subject that can go in as an issue rather than the unreadable op
and add the the cloaker is within the bubble so no chance of living problem what is the max range of a hic bubble 30 km the cloaker running at 500 ms will need 60 seconds to clear it and can be scanned in 20 so as soon as you warp in a small squad cov ops hic fast ship to decloak it the cloaker has lost its advantage and kept the drawbacks at a gate with anchored bubbles it would be even easier
so you require a cloaker to jump into a bubble at 0km from a hicwhich would not allow the cloaker to cloak anyway not turn on its mwd before cloakingstandard procedure a scanner to start scanning at the right time on the gate the cloaker to not change direction at least one timeyea when a cloaker jumps into a camp all of these things minus the scan are already done and people are going to be swarming all over itthe scan doesnt change things in this instance
ever wonder why that hasnt already happened its completely viable with the existing game mechanics because nobody cares enough to bother except the anticloak whiner crowd if this was an issue it would already be happening  youre not the first to think of this i promise

because paying for the service is foolish when you can do it yourself
as it was a reply to your post 1 post above mine about scanning cloakers i did thought it was pretty clear but to make it clear step by step 1 scan the cloaker with the cov ops2 warp to the cloaker with the cop ops squad3 deploy probe and scan while the hic active the bubble unless the cloaker is extremely fast or the scanner ship war very far away the cloaker is well within the range of the hic bubble on the other hand the ship with a speed bonus cloaked cant warp cloaked4 when the scanning ship get the current cloaker position the whole squad can chase it it require very fast scanner but it can be done against a ratting ship with a cloak it will work wonderfully as those ship are very slowso it will as you put it but it will add problem as i said
it isnt harrassment its reconnaissance a very useful tactic it always helps to know what is going on in the systems around you wether your pvping mining or getting ready to do whatever i oppose changes to cloaking
what is the point in flying a cloaked ship if people can see you on scanner and probe you down easilyif a cov ops is easily probed that means i have to warp off every 30s or 60s keeping normal intel on the enemy becomes much more difficultthe whole probingbubbling and reprobing sounds like a real tedious process that will acheive no actionwhy dont you just nerf afkers instead idle for 30 mins  kick from server i know there are ways to get around this but not everyone is willingsmart enough to make a third party program
scan takes 20 seconds  10kmwarp takes 2040 seconds  1020kmyou can still just change direction after they get the second resultyea youre going to kill a ratter you should kill a ratter
no this will have negative effects on target calling in small gangs as you cannot differentiate between two enemies of the same ship type i like that negative effect such black and white thinking try pinpointing a single herring in a school safety in numbers has always been a defensive tactic its a good idea and if at anytime people do get to pimp their rides youll be able to call based on makings supported people should be able to hide their identities and also people should be able to block identities i get irritated and close my overview when in high sec because i get sick of seeing what idiots have named themselves many have done it simply to irritate the reader there doesnt appear to be any problem with people hurling all sorts of abuse at each other so the lack of identity would not cause many problems that i can think of also it might be irritating to be a z character stuck down the bottom of every chat windowbut that really cant be helped unless you have a search for char field for every chat box
issue eve has become small in real terms which in conjunction with sovereignty and pos mechanics has forced the game towards more a numbers game big fleets rather than meaningful roaming gangs and helped cause a general stagnation within 00reasoning eve used to be a very big place now it is relatively small and although yes there are small pockets of useless 00 space which are not used generally most of 00 is generally cluttered it is appreciated the drone regions was added but i do not think it has gone far enough space should be big with large expanses of emptiness in regards to population i like many remember when there was 510k people on server max which enable room to roam now if you go out roaming generally speaking you will generally hit the blobpotential contribution to a solution increase the number of regions  systems dramatically this could be hooked in with a storyline new gate technologies new npc factions  extending fw in to 00 for alliances etc what i am thinking of here is dramatic treble the number of regions  systems this will make eve big again and also gives eve room to grow or floor space as it were as it continues to grow from a population stance 45k pcu record so we are getting busier revise local mechanics instead of having a local count with names of who is in local change it so chat can still be done but numbers in system and who is in system is not shown introduce a mechanic though the scanner which enables you to get that information this would also help to build the scout role more whether that is through cov ops captor or perhaps new ship class  modules with supporting skills ie more meaningful data on who and what is in said systembenefitsthis does not impede the current large scale fleet warfarethis does enable roaming to become fun again from a pvp sense in regards to small scale fightsprovides the opportunity for storylines and way of adding additional content both player driven and storyline drivenprovides some opportunity for role specialisationprovides additional opportunity for industrial and exploration side of the gamehelps enable what made the game great before while supporting what still makes the game great todayno matter what political group in eve one is affiliated with bobgbcnc goon super friends etc etc i have had chats with peeps in most entities and these are the type of things that have come up time and time again in conversationit is appreciated that some of these changes may not be in the art of possible now due to ccp resources current plans etc but would like to submit for consideration

your ideas do not address the issue which as you stated was with sovereignty and pos mechanics thus it cannot solve the problems created by itas long as true 00 maintains the same pos based sov mechanics and as long as those sov mechanics make both logistics trivial for coalitions to maintain their vast regions of space as well as make travel so trivial that they can move their massive numbers to attack anywhere else on the map with ease then the fate of any new regions added are clear to anyone whod be interested in living there thus the way players choose to deal with the repercussions will remain the same be a member of a large powerblock or get steamrolled this remains true regardless of the number of new regions added adding more regions adds more space to be inhabited thus will allow the same coalitions that exist now to add more petsvassalsalliesfarmersetc ie numbers to their existing coalitions and unfortunately they will continue to try and use those new and improved numbers to attack the same posgrid in the same system at precisely the same time that another equally overwhelming coalition will use their new and improved numbers to try and defend said posthe space that currently exists is too much space for so little political blocks which control them all already if you want to change that it needs to be much more difficultimpossible for so few groups to control so much space a region at most and make traveling so difficultinconvenient that blueing your neighbors results in none of you getting any pvp whatsoever the south north southwest drone regions etc should not be coalitions they should be zones your group can conceivable attack the one you live in
i agree with the concept that 00 needs a massive reworking and ccp likely has a group working on that very thing right now the mechanics of sovereignty needs a good hammering and the benefits of sovereignty could also use worki do believe that the cyno generator modules for poses need a real change such as every alliance having no more than 15 based on a skill perhaps and only being able to use the generators for that specific alliance likewise ownership of regions could use some work but not in the way you described hard limits but rather increasing coo cost of ownership for poses further away from the alliance capitalas far as the increased systems i strongly disagree this is the biggest mmo out there over 5k systems to explore so by adding systems you really wont improve things the mechanics are the broken part so fix those first and society will expand
it saddens me that people see these as the only two options i am part of an independent corp that has roamed 00 successfully for over two years without membership or support from any of the powerblocks in fact we face direct opposition from the locals almost constantly  yet we have survived and profited the entire time creativity makes things possible dont believe all of the limits that you are told exist get out here and learn to thrive in free space the powerblocks can be reduced through intelligent independent pilot and corp actions it is the fear of risk and preference for easy empire isk that keeps this from happening
couldnt find your alliance name to confirm myself could you point it out for me here thanksassuming its not listed could you indicate the number of high end moons your corp owns poses on no need to give away locations just a number of dysprosium and promethium moons you claimif you dont hold sovereignty in any systems much less station systems and dont hold any of the real resources which are fought over you have no claim over any sov 00 space roaming sov 00 is pretty futile and typically a fruitless endeavor youll get more engagements roaming low sec and npc 00 regions and once youre done roaming no need to fly home 40 jumps just dock at the nearest station and youre homebut i dont think you mean roaming in the pvp sense it sounds more like youve discovered how to fit cloaks on a raven thats not living there and its certainly not thriving its more like scratching a living doing what sweatshop workers in other countries do simultaneously with 8 different characters during their 1216 hour work day theyre bringing far more isk than you are and converting it directly to real world currency and even they wouldnt mistake that for thriving in sov space
as a general idea thumbs up
as stated  were not with an alliance my corp name and character name are exactly as listed here  pretty easy to find with the in game search we have no ravens in our fleet not a single battleship actually we dont fly home  we live full time as nomads  home is where we park our ships we dont set up poss or claim to own any space we dont mine moons we make our living as we move and yeah ifwhen it comes to pvp  we tend to take more ships than we lose being outnumbered most of the time we choose our battles with care i fly with a small team of good folks who share my outlook we make a living thats more than good enough to keep ourselves well equipped with top of the line ships and equipment were quite successful in a niche that many people dont believe exists like you  the galaxy has more options than the standard approaches ive done the alliance  sov thing before  got tired of it the nomadic lifesytle has been far more rewarding for the past couple years we maintain a public channel its in the corp description youre again welcome to check it out in game if you like oh this might help i took a screenshot of the my bookmarks setting on the map i make custom bookmarks everywhere we go if its green weve been there and probably made some isk there
hell why notadd scripts to project other ship classes for bonus points
if you want realism the idea of a non atmospheric missile is quite laughable firstly the icon for the missiles themselves are like atmospheric missiles and that is funny what good are fins in space secondly if you did want to build a bomb that could track a frigate it would almost have to be as large as the target i think drones are ridiculously manoeuverable and damaging there should only be rockets unguided and fired from turrets and missiles that have crap tracking and can only hit large slow targetsthumbs down
it just doesnt seem right that a rig in general should not have a drawback while the others do the scales of balance would suggest this shouldnt beif you wanted they could make a mechanic skill that profoundly hampers the drawback
a rig that give powergrid should take away cpu and vis versa duhand correct categorization of rigs should be looked at as well
wat
hi everyone you may have seen me commenting here about various things but for those who havent met me or flamed me oxy goggles i am axel vindislaga ceo of a baby corp called unitive manifestation this corporation was founded to create a corp that had fair internal trading so far after recruiting a few players some old some new we have begun a corp business but have hit a snag only a small snag but quite irritatingit appears that ceos and directors cannot claim their own corps contracts why you might ask well as the ceo of my corp i do not want to exclude myself from working for the corporation i insist on transparency and the contract history i think would allow me to work as a member of my own corp as i do not view the corporation wallet as my money what i am doing is very simplistic there are many features that people are probably wanting that make far more sense that this there are other things also that would possibly help people organise their corps one feature i could use is a automated pay facility that pays members automatically weekly or monthly some of the tasks assigned to members have no way for me to include their share of the profit so i need to pay them directly and if i could simply type a figure into a field and have that payed to them at regular intervals i would like the csm to quiz as many ceos as possible and ask them what features are missing or are wanted and see if you can blitz them into the march expansion there are probably many far better ideas out there and i am really hoping to see some greater flexibility in my abilities to organise the corps internal financial flow
oh my what a fantastic notion bravo my wordsuch ideasplease post your ideas suggestions contributions many votes of support and im sure ridicule
no sbs dont need a covert ops cloak if you think that then you dont understand them isaac
i personally like how the stealthbombers are atm  and i dont think they need a covops cloak they just need skill and good bookmarks what also requires patience to make them i more wonder why they are not included in the different races weapons caldari uses missiles so the manticore is ok but why does the amarr sb not uses large lasersminmatar could use arties and gallente railguns instead of cruisesi dont know if this had been suggested before and if im posting wrong here please inform me
recently eve reached an all time high on players currently online now iam curious on the csms feelings toward the current size of eve is things getting to crowded or is it just fine as it is some points to considercrowdedalot of complaints recently about the status of high sec mining since it seems most of the high sec belts are completely gone at all timescongestion and lag are starting to increase in most majorminor trade and mission hubsalmost all static complexescosmos are being cleared out within acouple hours after dtrespawnmore to comeemptypiracy and lowsec pvp is very few and far between more to comekindof drawling a blank here to the differant reasons but you get the ideaacrel
i do not think that the galaxy itself is too small the individual systems might be too small tho there is a definite inbalance in the game in this aspect some systems with some professions can house literally hundreds of players while in other cases a system is too small for even 2 players at the same time just think about agent running a good agent running hub can serve literally any number of players while if it comes to ratting in 00 its one player per system it might make sense to revisit the size of the systems used for competitive moneymaking however dariuss incentivizing 00 issue the one we are going to discuss in iceland goes beyond this and suggest that it should be left to the players to invest into 00 and make systems better more lucrative bigger able to house more players at the same time this playercontrolled solution pleases me the most at the moment
 nvmanyway im all for eliminating learning skills its an obvious flaw and im sure ccp recognize that its the kind of thing that causes good people to not get through their first month because its imperative that you train them and its as unrewarding as hell if there is something that everybody has to do thats boring and pointless you might as well factor it out and eliminate it
well the idea of making the cargo containers and station vaults not suck has been proposed in the tasks here are the problems with them as i see it1 the items stored within are completely unviewable and inaccessible from the assets window2 you have to open them every time you want to peek inside3 station vaults cannot be moved at allnow id like to address these issues in the context of the tab system but i also would like to see how we can figure out changes to the cans as well1 adding the itemtabbing functionality would effectively end this the tabs could be added into the assets window as well have the tabs along the top and have the assets display only the items in the hangars under that tab but if you wanted more customizability you could also use cans to sort your junk this is where i believe that the cans need change also because then you would still no be able to see what was in the cans from your assets2 the tabs would simply be quicker no more right clicking like crazy opening your containers3 the station vaults are cool because they were obviously implemented strictly for a sorting sense but they are not good enough in my opinion the fact that you cannot break them down and transport them to another location really sucks the fact that itemtabbing would also solve this issue also is all well and good but the fact remains that we should also have the ability to move around the vaultsi havent changed my stance on the itemtabbing idea at all but i do see the merits of improving the can functionality alongside with it i see one to be a broken system that needs to be fixed and the other a new general sorting mechanism that would end the massive clutter if itemtabbing were introduced and the problems with cans were fixed i think my head would explodei vote for both
one item id like to see is a variablesize container call it a partition or something you right click on it pick its size in m3 from one to a zillion and it holds stuff without compressing it assuming the database can handle it you could also stick partitions inside partitions inside compression containers  theyre entirely nestable without issue you can transport a nearly infinite number of them easilyto save time might as well make them repackage to 1 m3 and yet they can hold as much stuff as you need cleanly combine that with a general container fix  make them searchable on assets remove the utterly boneheaded autolock feature on station containersor make some nonsecure ones whatever make it so doubleclicking on a container opens it all that stuff  and youve got a real solution to this problem using existing game mechanics thats just my pet idea though i dont care too much about the form of the solution i just want a better answer to a badly implemented system
no
supported
wait this is essentially a way for people to obtain the rare ores without having to set foot in 00 or low secummm im gonna have to go with no on this onewe need to add incentives for venturing into 00 and low sec instead of making it even easier for the industrialist crowd to turtle up in empiremake all the changes you want to how mining lasers and asteroid scanners work as a game mechanic but the rare ores need to stay in null sec and they need to stay rare
supported
yes because getting an arkonor refine every six hours will make empire broken 00 will still be far and away better at producing it than highsec actually what this mostly does is incentivize lowsec better as well as making mining at least 3 less boring
sounds reasonable
as always i support the dead horsei think that ccps way of handling a subject that have a significant support of the paying playerbase is disappointing at least give us a good reason to your answerpersonaly i think that this should have been made reality ages ago
two points here why theyre not committed to this idea and my counterpoints1 it requires a total rewrite of the starbase systemcounter i dont think anyone who plays eve would say they are satisfied with how the starbase system works currently hell i dont think even ccp is satisfied with it a complete rewrite is not a valid reason to shoot something downif your code is so rigid and inflexible to add a feature that could significantly improve the game experience the problem is with the code not with the feature2 it would require a complete art asset replacementcouter and what do you call the trinity graphics are you seriously telling me ccp will never replace the art assets in this game thats ridiculous for other games that could be acceptable however ccp has stated time and time again that they are committed to keeping eve alive and breathing there will be no eve 2 and because of that the game must keep growing and evolving if that means replacing art assets that have been good enough for 5 years then so be iti am still thoroughly not satisfied with ccps responses

sorry for bad english  it isnt my native languagebefore qrbombers were cloaking campers and their targets weresolo industrials and frigates even inties only if bomber successfully managed to web frig for two launcher cyclesin a gang without any other support using some tricks almost any lonely ship was beatable depending on amount of bombers bombers still couldnt play serious pvp with very few exceptionsafter qrsolo dumb industrials only every frig easily manages to escape out of the web even being scrambled with very predictable result to bomberin a gang without any other support almost useless  missiles delivers no damage ok 1513 of the damage to small moving targets with very few exclusionsbombs before and after qrhuge fail bomb just disappear if bomber was destroyed while it fliesreasons for posting thatbefore qr bombers were able to manage killing inties in some very rare cases they were and even did after qr they definitely lost this ability because webbed and scrambled intie doesnt die after the first launch and still have speed to escape out of the web of webbed bobmer before the second lauch so at the moment if you have and intie in overview  youd better dont decloak this is unfair  frigs shoud be able to fight against frigswhen i was trying to get the gate camp disappear there was a bomb launched but bomber was instantly locked and popped and bomb did nothing  it just disappear the offer as iswhilst developers keep trying to invent torpedo stealth bombers two minor changes should take placechange stealth bomber missile explosion radius bonus to 1995 per level so at covert ops level 5 precision cruise missiles could deliver a noticeable damage to interceptorsbombs should be a grenades means no matter what happened with bomber after the charge was deployed  it explodes in any case except charge destruction with some other aoe weaponupd added proposal
please do this fleet sizes need to keep up with the growth of the game and the size of the battles
no just because goonswarm wants it
yeah
jumping on the support bandwagon
seconded
i would support this thread but the support fleet is full and i cant join
i would like to add something into this as wellas times have changed and the mechanics by which fleet warfare has changed would it be possible to add a method to combine or split off fleetsthe current method to join another fleet is to drop out of the current one and then have to rejoin the other via the typical methods that are employed now its been a while since ive been in a null sec fleet especially the large ones that are being fielded now but i think that this would help out alot
goumindong was one of the crazier voices calling for big speed nerf patch but ccp managed to outdo even him in the crazy idea department now he is the voice of reason in comparisonits funny and sad at same time
noo do not slow align times jesus what the hell its called fit a sb
alright lets give all ships extra mid slot and 10 cpu are you sure thats better
i support this measure fix it please for faction war it would be a big help
i support this as well
im not exactly sure how accurate efts align time calculator is or even how its calculated i do however agree that the align time should always be slightly longer than lock time of the same ship due as stated earlier to lag time and reaction time factoring in making it even more difficult to catch a target trying to escape
supported
time is on their side with the passage of enough time this too will just fade away left to seethe just below the surface eve will go on advantage will continue to be given and no one will careon march 10 it is all over and nothing will matter the investigation will be moot advantage and point to ccp thanks for that shot of hope issla rata
so you passed all those details over to issler if so issler can you please follow this up and tell us is there anything to what rata has stated
id say the difference between trade skills and production skills is that trade skills do not create more game items or occupy game spce slots they simply fluctuate prices also i find in most cases that the items take longer to selll than they do to producei like that there is so much interest in manufacturing but think about the consequences you see that you cant build as much as you would like so you want more slots so every industrialist in eve suddenly gets more slots and the factories remain in the same supply i do not know what the situation is like in 00 but i cant see it working in highsecevery now and then i see items produced far below the level i can produce for if that door you want opened was opened it would slam in my face as every item began being produced by highly skilled and excellently equiped bps industrialists you never hear people complaining that there is not enough goods to buy i hate how in real life every thing is nailed down and controlled and i think that it would be a tragedy if that happened in eve too much i would like to chat to you in game i hope that you arent the alt of an alt posting alt
facelessness ftw
not supported just because a player is on the forums often doesnt mean they deserve special treatment above others who were affected by similar bugs and fixed thats what the ci stuff like this is saying well they were known in the forums so should be given special treatment no never period cis forum portrait lacking a proper face and them playing off it like others have does not make them a community iconsorry ci youre a good poster and all from what ive seen but accept youve been fixed like everyone else who had the forum bug and do the right thing and ask for people to stop making these threads
i would like that but only if the overview is frozen when you hold ctrl otherwise there is too much danger to unlock targets you didnt want to unlockim thinking of shooting lots of frigates in a battleship losing one target costs a lot of timestill signed the idea is good
as long as you can click on the icon to do it instead of just the overviewwhich you can at present that isnt an issue although i totally agree that the overview needs to freeze when youre hovering over it its really disturbing that i prefer to click autopilot on my hauler coming out of jita than to click on the gate and fly out because its faster to have my hauler can slowboat it 15 km than to click on the gate also another thought  can we cancel a targeting in progress its kind of annoying that it clogs our targeting for significant periods of time especially when damped and we cant do anything about it
didnt support own topic but 100 vote rate so far 
its a computerised navigational thing should be able to align to what ever you want
my god yes its probably one of the most annoying things making loads of bms in a system and having to open the people and podded window either that or a seperate ui window for bming and fleet like squadwingfleet warp
always wanted something like this support

you kill any ship that cant reach very high speed or warp under cloak so essentially you kill any ship under cloak with the exception of cov ops force recon blockade runners as they can warp under cloak stealth bombers and black ops as they have a speed bonus under cloak all the other ships will be still perfectly in range of your hic
and that is a bad thingthe above listed ships are the only ones who should be able to avoid getting killed by a superior force scanning them down in a safe spotremember you would still have to get the scan in the first place not that easy when directional scanners do not workthat means that cloaks become strategic modules and not you cant attack me modulesits a good thing
minmatar have be touted as the most versatile of races storywise this probably stems from the minmatar needing to field a ship with whatever was available to them i am guessingthis has been implemented in the manner of split weapon systemshowever split weapon systems are just weak not flexiblesure in the real world a ship hitting you with multiple damage types and vectors would be dangerous however eve is not the real world split weapon systems just result in an inability to fit the right damage mods and varying optimum ranges as well as a significant increase in the amount of sp needed to fly a ship effectivelyfor minmatar ships to be truely versatile they need to actually have some flexibility  not a split weapon systemi propose the following change  if a minmatar ship is intended to field up to n weapons instead of having x turret  y launcher hardpoints to give n instead have n turret and n launcher hardpoints this also ties in with the lots of guns approach of minmatar ship design this enables a pilot to field missiles or guns as heshe sees fitbefore the complaints about imbalance due to increased dps  i would point out that the missile nerf means this is likely to lead to lots of ac and artillery ships these both have significantly lower dps than both pulse and blasters the artillery alpha damage increase is only relevent on a small number of ships and is unlikely to cause game balance issues
i wouldnt go all the way to giving the typhoon 88 but 66 would be totally reasonable
that turns the typhoon into something very similar to a tempest
or a raven
agreed
unless youre a missile user
and then we could warp our fleet to within say 30 km of them doh this is an excellent idea
id prefer to be able to select bookmarks that could be broadcast to the overview own or fleet rather than all of them in some systems i have tons of bookmarks and for a fleet op being able to show only a subset would be good a check box next to the ones youd want to broadcast so you could set targetsalign pointsrep areas etc
heyyou stole my idea but absolutely signed
i like the idea but not for the reasons you suggest try a range of different pods that have different bunuses hmmm if i use that pod my weapon interface is superior if i use that one i get better agility and manaeuverability or what about the pod that can cloak hmmm for a whileor even this you must have a certain pod for this kind of shipi can see why you want the kind of pod you suggest and it could be one of the types available for the deep strike behind enemy lines pilots
no to the idea because its pretty stupid no offence thoughif you keep clicking warp to literally keep clicking it whilst you enter 5 hull and are about to pop your pod will fling itself out of the wreck into warp immediately you will not get scrambled at all its a common tactic used by exploding pilots lag aside youll go straight into warp if youre bubbled youre fecked of course
youre supposed to be vulnerable when youre in an escape pod its not a combat ship its a last chance lifeboat which  if youre lucky  might get you back home with your cloneimplants intactnot to mention that puts on robe and wizards hat pods are jovian technology and not subject to the same tech level adaptations that the other 4 races use
really simple easy request make a queue for onliningofflining and anchoring pos modules so that you dont need to waste hours of your life on what would have to be the worst task ccp has ever invented bar none in no way does it affect balance as it would be the exact same time amount anyone who feels otherwise i encourage you to go set up one or two deathstars
this has been raised several times before and im almost certain one of them has been escalated good idea but no need to support it
this is an area of the universe where people are deconstructed and shot accors space through massive cannons safely what a bad idea what gets me actually is why the sensors of ships cannot be swapped out whay are they dictated by the hullyou know i would be more accepting of the idea if you hadnt metioned holographics because you need something to project it onto and light would not fool a radar there are so many reasons this is a bad idea you need to talk to military professionsls to get a clue about high tech e war
could be worse one of jason edwards spectacular dumb ideas could have been on the csm agenda shudder
godawful ideacsm or not this is just an utterly ridiculous proposal
letting combat ships look like haulers is done for centuries allready so why not also do it in spacebecause whirates will emoragequit
lol you think pirates will be the ones who suffer horribly from this fail idea were trying to save you from yourselves though tbh we should give you the rope and let you hang yourselves with ithere is the ops idea translated into actual gameplay
i am sorting items by placing them into station containers that are huge even ships with fitting lives in contsbut relatively to database optimisation and speed up this feature would help a lot
please support this
i support allowing people with ridiculous names to change theirs for a fee but entirely at the disrection of the the gm  if its deemed that the individual is wishing to change their name for nefarious reasons theyre told to shove their money where the sun dont shineyeah right like ccp would ever throw your money back in your face but i can dream
this should be implemented so csm go do your job represent the players  i know that ccp declined it once but we want it and its too hard is not a valid excuse we will keep wanting it until they come of with valid design reason why it would not fit into eve
whether this be introduced or something similar changes to the pos mechanics are something we all want to see
everyone needs to read nyphurs original post incredible idea especially with the systemwide belts and the necessity for scanning them down in a very easy way also i love the idea of mixing up the minerals this could actually make mining in 00 worth it please ccp
the op says absolutely nothing in any part of the post that would lead anyone to believe that null sec would have higher amounts of rare ores in fact the op specifically says thishe even capitalized it twice im saying the op is wrong any balancing changes in mining that are implemented need to add incentives to mining in null sec and low sec make all the changes you want but the high end minerals need to stay out of empire
oh you mean the way they are completely out of empire whenever you get one of the l4 rogue drone missions and basically drown in zydrine and megacyte from the loot drops which part of the density of each individual ore  would be determined by system security rating mainly was hard to understand  or the example with 10 arkonor extracted 100 times slower than deep 00 arkonor and that even if you only read the text in the op which was as specifically stated the short version and completely ignore the linked thread because if you read the linked thread you would have seen it clarified with actual numbers toono offense meant but what you say is simply ignorantgiving people in empire access to some traces of 00 ores will do absolutely nothing to lower 00s rewards or draw quite the contrary if you introduce this system it means you can buff up the concentration of veldspar in lowsec but most importantly in 00 significantly above current levels thus lessening the bottleneck introduced by tritanium which in turn means more highends can be used locally in 00 which leads to less minerals making their way onto the highsec markets therefore highend mineral prices start to recover making 00 mining much more profitable again like it should at the same time lowsec mining would finally revert to being more profitable than highsec mining too as it was intended from the start and the same way it used to be for a long time before the drone regions appearedbasically you oppose the system because you do not understand what it means in terms of mineral prices and mining level income across security ratingswhat you fear this system might make even worse is exactly what this system will fixin case its not clear yet let me give you a very clear example of typical asteroids you might encounter10 system  anything from pure 110 veldspar pure as in no other ores or pure 100 pyroxeres rocks to composite asteroids made up of strange combinations like for example 10 veldspar 20 pyroxeres 5 scordite 5 kernite 2 crokite 1 arkonor01 system  anything from pure 250 veldspar rocks to hybrids as described above but with higher densities so say 30 veldspar 50 pyroxeres 10 scordite 10 kernite 7 crokite 5 bistot 3 arkonor or at the same time things like pure 15 arkonor rocks10 truesec system  anything from pure 110 arkonor rocks or even 900 pure veldspar rocks yes thats a rock that yields 9 times more veldspar per cycle than a current veldspar asteroid to any combination of ores you fancy
what problem are you trying to solveinsurance fraud can be sorted out by basing current insurance prices on current market value of the insured itemthe attractiveness of nullsec mining can be sorted out by making the abc ores rarerthe attractiveness of lowsec mining can be achieved by making certain ores only spawn in lowsectrade between regions can be made more attractive by tweaking the relative abundance of ores as akita t has statedadding new features for the sake of it isnt going to make mining more interesting if youre trying to make mining more interesting the only features you need to worry about right now aremaking all asteroids generic so thought has to be applied to selection of asteroids to minemaking finding the asteroids in the first place require more work than simply warping to a belt but let work than spending days probing out systems in the hope of finding an exploration sitethen again mining could get quite interesting if all belts had to be probed out with frequency of belt spawns increasing exponentially as security rating goes down thus 10 sec systems would be mined out by civilians they dont spawn many belts at all while 00 systems are plentiful remaining to be mined out by playersyou could even make belt pockets with variable levels of visibility so better trainedequipped miners can get to find richer asteroids this would make exploration training a requirement for mining fleets
you mean like grind some l4 missions refine the loot and swim in zyd and mega  with isk from rewards and bounties on top   some lp wow so much worse than 00 that i absolutely need to go zerosec for those profits 
this is a good idea in principle there are small tweaks here and there that i would suggest but that would be one i would rather take up with you in privatei recommend you read this thread on the same subject it went over some very similar points as well as others you may wish to add to the proposal
ummm start another thread maybe with some solutions instead of sitting here whiningif you want to see examples you can simply check every thread ive created here where i use a very clear issue solution formatheck ill even do it for you cause this one is really easyissueloot drops from npcs refine directly into minerals that are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain by mining in empiresolutionadd another step to production the new step would involve using the minerals to make the building blocks for building certain items much the same way that t2 production works nowwhen loot is refined it can only be refined down to these building blocks instead of the rare minerals needed to build themvoila problem solved you can thank me later
i agree on the mining profession needs a boostit is way better to do missions which in my opinion is wrong mining need to be in balance with mission running and ratting not better just as goodif mining could be more fun also it would be a plus
how about you do that  you dragged mineral availability to a pure mining related thread while ignoring other means of obtaining minerals that are better than mining
hello alli have recently been the victim of the empire war dec system i have a corp with just me and my alt in i moved out to the black rise region and set up a pos in a safe system 06 to be exactthe pos was a basic researcht2 component manufacturing plant and was destroyed 24hrs after war had been declared on my corp on effect on mei can understand why the war dec system is in place  its to give corps the ability to knock 7 shades out of each other with out the dangers that low sec presents ie the free for allin the case of the war dec against me i didnt even realise that war had been declared it seems that if you dont log on at least evey 23hrs and 59mins you may warp back to the empty space where your pos used to belet people have wars but lets those who dont carebear if you like get the protection they deserve from concordremember  safe space is only safe if you stick with an npc corp and it  sadly looks like thats where ill have to go to to recover the 3bil isk losses i suffered
brilliant
agreed
supported  sounds reasonable
nice idea
agreed its bomb it job is to explode shouldnt matter if the launchers still alive imo
only thing being that its remotely detonated iirc
did any bombers used in second world war have any remote detonatorsor maybe all of used now do have
well its a nice idea but no other t2 ship has 3 bonuses for its primary skill so methinks our respectable developers will not apply such changei suppose the better way is to change a bonus with explosion radius 1666 per frigate skill to 19 this must decrease explosion radius from 50 meters to 15 meters without gmp skill and will give a good chance to survive against frigsize targetsecond way is to change profile damage bonus to explosion radius reduction bonus eg 15 per covert ops skill level but theres another problem  bomb damage bonus will be the third bonus for t2 ship

mm guys this is stealthbomber so what if sb can fitted only maximum3 bomblaunchers cloak and covert cynosural field generator and nothing anymore after launch bomb launcher must rest 120 sec and then can launch next bomb so how is this ideasorry for my terryble english
yes and yes and some bombs were meant not to detonate till later time delay fuseing was popular tactic on boath sides current ord in militaries can use a remote detionation and i support this aswell
1idea bomb detonating if sb was destroed
yes sbs have needed a change for ages this i just as good as any idea1 for boost to sbs
atm i think the need to train bomb deployment past lvl one is non existant the activation delay should be much much lower than it is at lv 4 its at 128 seconds and the bomb launcher itself says its capable of a 2 sec rof bomb deployment to lvl 5 should get you closer to that 2 sec rof i dont feel this would overpower them as you wouldnt be able to launch any more at a target than u could now cause youd destroy any excsess bombs it would just make highly trained bomber pilots training worth something and enable smaller gangs to still deal with bs heavy blobs
oh  and while were at it where the freakin faction bombs the t2faction launcher and t2 ammo lets go chop chop
support
arnt we supposed to be working away from big blobs
signed
this gets my vote
exactly thats pretty much the only role they play noob cruisers only really because i can probably take out a non faction cyclone with my rupture setup tbqhthe only tier 1 bc worth flying is the brutix cause that thing is just a beast
i believe that projectiles could use a very slight buff not a nerf this would most definitely be a nerf
supported i especially like the idea of the smaller midguns being more effective against smaller ships and large vs large ships makes a lot of sense
agreed
i provided and put on my blog so it would be easy to find everything kept it private per eula and requirement not to share communication between ccp and myself offered to go through logs to pull them for the panel have heard nothing trying to be patient as there were quite a few holidays in there holding onto hope since issler asked for the documentation
searched your name reaped rewardsunstable wormhole particle acceleration superstructure  those screenshots are interesting to say the least issler or any other csm  please respond to this at least to state you have or are looking into it there is enough evidence there for it to be at least troubling
do want if this aint already planned for because it should be
yes
well the little mods are tiny are programmable by the nub programmersso i think ccp can  erm maybe not
12 at least 3 pfft lame
well i guess the csm wants to lower the war dec limit to one or prolly none only the negative 10 gank squadz will get pvp in hi sec sim eve from 0510 sec leastways that is what lavista vista told me he said how about one war dec i didnt even get to say anything other than greetingz and i opened a topic in assembly hall and thiz guy who ran about how talk to me in game vote for me and all that said he would vote no i mean how do you present your position if the representativez of the community wont even listen to you well at least i know he read this guess i will go lower my sec rating and start blowing up noobz like all the other frustrated pvpers
talk about totally taking what i said too literallyyou convoed me im heading out for iceland tomorrow for a whole week so as i told you i was rather busy having to catch up for 7 days worth of everyday doing in just 2 days is hard having to go to iceland isnt holiday at all which people seem to thinki did say that if anybody raised this i would vote no i argued that the current system is a paytogrief system and it should be totally overhauled before any change is made to said limit i suggested dropping the limit to 1 in order to prove that 3 is a sweetspoti can see why one would want to increase the limit but its a selfish reason in my eyes sure having more targets to shoot at is nice and all but it doesnt serve any more than that giving more targets to highsec griefers
i got to say i started a topic and you said you would vote no your my elected representative i didnt even get to say one word about my position and you proposed cutting the limit by 13 your supposed to listen to us and take our views to ccp the system is clunky and it really suckz im wondering why i even voted in that election the negative 10 gank squadz dont even give any warning just bang your in a pod then bang your in a clone our corp triez to practice privateering going after high value targetz who should defend their assetzanywaz take some time to see iceland what a wonderful people and country at least go to a spa while ur there
can i take ur stuffz while ur gone
support the limit of 3 is overly restrictive  corporations and alliances should be able to declare war as they see fit as long as they can pay the escalating cost a new limit of 6 would probably be a fair compromise
it should all be risk vs reward i could agree with ccp making a few totally safe systems but you pay a price for that safety for example only veldspar rocks the size of peas spawn there fly nothing bigger than a cruiser there and get no better than level 2 missions but you will be totally safe then carebears will have a totally safe place if they truly wish that and they can go there if they dont want to participate in a pvp in a pvp based game but the rewards are much smaller all this crap go to low sec go to 00 been there done that i dont like blob warfare and poss and who the heck are you to tell me how to play the game when i use a legal game mechanics to play quit being lazy and learn game mechanics quit trying to have reward with no risk we need to avoid this game becoming another mindless money grind mmorpg like so many others edit support btw
alliances can have as many wardecs as they want as far as im aware the point being that there needs to be a certain barrier to entry for grandscale wardec if you are so serious about wardeccing then you create an alliance its 1 billion thats a small fee to pay for griefing with no limits sure it does get slightly more expensive however i think thats entirely fairthis whole thing only affects small corporations who targets a large amount of other corps it doesnt affect anybody else thus you can deduce that the mechanic is working entirely as intended
ill never support this for one reason youre using wardec as a griefing tool rather then what its function is designed to bewar declaration should be used for when one or two corporations have forced you into a situation where war is the only optionnot as a yeah were a solid pvp corp so well war dec weak corporations for the soul perpous of grabbing their stuff and making their game experience miserablewhile i support pirate like activity lowsec hunting can flipping ninja salvage hell even suicide ganking is ok but i think its punishment is not as much as it should be i do not support out right griefingno one should be able to dictate to anyone else how they should play the game if a player wants to sit in a belt mining or run missions or transport courrier contracts they can however no one else should be able force another game style on to anyoneif war declaration had actual arbitration it would be much better but that will never happen so the only way to prevent pvp corps from forcing their game style onto others is by limitations
mispost
im supporting this i know i have far more than just 3 enemies id like to go to war with as a corp particularly for fw where vigilantes are all over the place
eve online is growing and will most likely grow a lot more this year the social aspect of the game is non neglectable aswell  and ambulation is coming the tools given to moderate a channel are too basicyou can make it a lot better with very few changesin my opinion the blockedmutedallowedoperator list in the moderation panel should be a bit more like the buddy listyou should be able to sort the list by multiple criteriastime blockedmutednamereason given for mute or blockand a ticker box with select allnone option  for mass actions because the isk spammerscammers have no soul so they dont really die you need to keep blocking them until you die  this could also be brought to the blockedbuddy list  because as we all know the blocked list is a mess when i mute someone a little box pop up to input the duration and the reason i think the reasontime should stay registered in the moderation panel and be visible in the appropriate moderation menu cough maybe api key enhancementcough 
every saw as beautifully ships explodes but why this explosion does not gives any damageexplosion damage reactor of the ship will add a little realness in a picture of fight in space and will strongly reconsider tactics conservative people certainly will write that it is awful because all will change but its much more interesting change rather than stupid nerf of one ship and boost other nerf of one modules and boost othersdamage type depends from reactor type ach race have different reactor type or 2component damage like thermalemexplosion radius and damage done can depends from capacitor size or powergrid output or some formula thats calculate reactor characteristics pg ouput stock recharge time and capacitor size i see problem in fighters that attack capitals but there are some ways to solve it 1 fast recharge of fighters shield in a dronbay2 drone sheld recharge module use energy from capacitor for fast recharge fightersdrones shield when they orbit own ship hi slot3 as a last resort special modifer for reactor explosion damage
actually hes referring to those large icons of locked targets at the top of the screen not the overview i believe new locked targets are always added at the left so there would be no need to freeze that display
i like it
yup
do it ccp
and another vote
also the tier 1 mining barge is used more or less by no one why not give that a purpose also
i do not support this idea i think its one of the logical limitations
they do exist ingameyou can already put rigged ships into your cargo
need confirm on thisanyone can
the scarity and limited resources should come from the material side not by limiting the number of licences that are allowed to build those items with reasonable me level prints and removing the t2 bposs or introducing free for all t2 bpos do nothing for material side of production materials are fine if you want dysp source you can always kick someone off from the moon and take it
which was exactly what he was saying should be removed

inactive accounts should have no impact ingame remove rp accumulation market orders contracts corp standings researchmanufacturing jobs both individual and corp within a reasonable 4872 hr grace period
while i whole heartedly support the idea of turning off rp generation and shutting down market orders this will not actually solve any problemsyoull end up with thousands of corporate orders insteadsay for argument sake i have 2 accounts i use these two accounts to have 1830 market orders on the market max market slotsi put all the slow moving orders on the account im going to unsubscribe to place them as on behalf of the corporation then unsubi have 915 corporate orders out there in which my active account can modify i wait 90 days then resub for 1 month just to enter new orders wait another 90 days etcthe ownership of the orders is the corporation not the player so although the logical choice would be remove them as well youve now found a way to greif a corporationload up the sell orders subsub it keeps that stuff locked away but not on the market imagine doing that to come expensive bpos etc
im going to copypaste something i put in a post in shipsmodules where someone was griping about ecms because i think it might do the devs some good i think eve is a great game and that ccp as a company does an excellent job at many things including choosing a vision and staying true to it while remaining flexible and paying attention to player feedback and ingame dynamicsedited for spelling
problemdestroyers are a limpwristed and seldom used ship in pvp or pve they find their biggest role in pve as a salvage vessel with most pilots moving straight from frigates to cruisers and into t2 ships without ever touching the destroyer those who do quickly learn to move on and forget they ever suffered the experience of flying one the situation is not much better with the interdictor as they are a one trick pony fit for speed andor cloak with an interdiction sphere launcher and use it to save real combat ships when retreating since the introduction of the heavy interdictor the interdictor sees less frequent use in gangs being consigned almost exclusively to alt pilots holding cloak on gates to protect the retreat of a fleet and the destroyer is a real novelty when seen in gang warfarepossible solutions are multitudinousincrease the damage output of tech 1 destroyerincrease the effective hitpoints of the tech 1 destroyerreduce the signature radius of the tech 1 destroyerincrease the resistances of the tech 2 interdictorrerole the tech 2 interdictor as a stealth capable fully or partial vesselrerole the tech 2 interdictor as a command gang warfare vesselrerole the tech 2 interdictor as an assault vesselmothball the entire ship class and give the sphere launching capability to another vesselthere are probably hundreds more possible solutions to the destroyer  interdictor issue that has been exacerbated by the recent speed changes though the problem existed long before them but the proposal here is simply that the issue be brought before the council and a direction decided upon my own personal preference would be to increase the damage output of all destroyers and to retask the interdictor as a stealth capable vessel similar to the stealth bomber or even the covert ops which would make for a very interesting pvp dynamic though anything to make these ships a more viable option in pvp and pve would be appreciatedthank you for your time
adding my own support to the idea
hellolately and always there have been a lot of discussion on removal of learning skills and related grind now my impression is that this is something ccp would like to do  but the ammount of technical surgery would be too great and the whine too extremeso what i suggest is not to fix these sorts of issues one at a time but make a framework that allows for effective restructuring and reimbursement of skillpoints where needed so that if a feature in the skillsystem regarded as not at all fun or simply illogical could easily be sorted out in say an extended downtime with database updates and a new menuin example if a skill is to be removed simply remove it run an update and when people log on they get a message stating n ammounts of skillpoints have been made obsolete and possible for redistribution i might be wrong but it might simply boil down to a bit of ui code a new slot in the database and a few more queries as far as i know no restructuring or removal of skills have been made since the beginning of the game and i doubt thats simply because everything is perfectwhat this could be used to fix right off is of course learning skills which kills a lot of player interest early on another thing that ive been discussing with a fellow player is that spaceship command skills would make a lot more sense if they featured frig cruiser dessie bc bs etc as independent skills and simply gallente piloting minmatar piloting etcim not saying the last have to be done ive never seen anyone else have a problem with spaceship command but it illustrates the maintainability developing such an inhouse system would produce thus i strongly believe both ccp and the players will benefit greatly from this long termhave a good oneted
i posted this in ideas forum where it was ignored i see this as the most pressing problem in eve today myself and quite a few of the people i know are about to leave the game all toghether because it simply isnt fun anymore and i know the people i talk to on teamspeak and myself arent alone in this a huge thread went without dev reply or recognizion a few months ago so without further ado i repost in this forum in the hope of finding someone in charge who doesent want eve to start haemmoraging players in 2009
on the eve of the record breaking sunday one week ago 45000 pilots in space at the same time myself and a few friends was on a roaming op in the east lo and behold in the three regions scalding pass insmother and cache there was less then 50 pilots online in the region of cache there was exactly 0 pilots in space according to the ingame map theese regions are as we know owned by either goonswarm or goonswarm pets we all know what would happen if an alliance would go to any of the station systems and start siegeing towers the 2000man blob would move to the system in a matter of minutes and when the agressors where vanquished the blob would move on leaving again the regions completely unused this has to change it cant possibly be the intention of ccp that 90 of 00 should have 0 pilots in space while thousands of players fight over a single pos there must be some way to break up the blobbing and the possibility to defend 8 regions in 20052006 it wasent this way a coalition consisted of 23 alliances goonsra gironrzr bobmcfix and they controlled 12 regions sometimes 3 following this rant comes a few suggestions to fix this currently broken system1 remove ice from hisec altogether the empires has ignored the warnings from enviromental reserchers for too long the ice belts of hisec has been depleted this will have two effects the revitalization of lowsec the miners will have to move to lowsec where they will be subject to piracy and in responce they will have to form alliances with pvp corps that can protect them an increase in fun for everyone involved except the macros and we dont want them anyway do we also the price of ice will increase dramatically making it a lot harder for the superblobs to have hundreds if not thousands of online and active poses at the same time it will also be alot more expencive to field 150man capital fleets supported by 15 titans2 make jump bridges and cyno jammers mutually exlusive items to make a titanbridge requires a cyno it wouldnt be too big of a leap to assume that a jumpbridge contain a machine that constantly cynos if you want a bridge to your station system or dyspo system you will also have to leave it open for enemy cynos unanchoring andor onlining theese modules should of course take about 1 hour per operation to ensure that a shuttle alt with the right roles cant just switch back and forth in the span of minutes3 make titan bridge use fuel in the same manner as a black ops bridge this will make moving a 1000 man fleet across the expances of space cost potentially billions and people will start regarding this as a last resort not something you do 4 times a day right now all you need to move a 1000 man fleet 100 jumps is a titan a couple of medium towers dont even need guns and a few cynokestrels4 make mining ratting plexing or mission running count towards sovereinty only sov 1 should be obtainable with pos after that the alliance needs to either mine or kill rats to continue increase sov i am sorry to bob and pl and other alliances that live only to pvp but i think it is silly that an alliance could have sov 3 in every system in a region with 0 pilots in space and no resourses gets used to offset the fact that some station systems have very few belts i point to an idea that was proposed ages ago by a pilot unkown to me that alliances should be able to invite agents to come live in their outpost one should be able to invite one agent per level of the local rats or one agent per level of the opposite empire witchever the choice of the alliance5 make stront timers unchangable if the pos has lost 1 healthpoint it is common to have an alt in a shuttle logged off at key poses and simply adjust the timers to ones own strong tz this leads to a cirkle where alliance a reinforce the tower in their tz and alliance b repair it in their tz leading nowhere
some very good ideas but you need to think a bit more about the worthless 00 systems
i like the plans you have for ice 
this just doesnt belong sorry hardly any people think this would be a good idea it opens up too many exploitsand it would be funny to see chinese farmers owning sov in 00
sounds like lots of good ideas to me the op definitely gets my overall support i completely support ideas 1 2 and 3 i have serious concerns about number 4 at this moment and a lot of other problems need to be fixed before it becomes a real option in solving the sov problem as for idea number 5 i completely oppose that one posses and sovenerity system need a revamp but the stront timers should remain as they are
supporting another 00 fix with the same ideas not sure how i feel on the stront timer changes i think i like them the stront and repping ping pong is pretty lame id rather the towers explode then get boringly repped into a long drawn out stalemate 123 are good 4 isnt very good and undecided on 5
lets not let the fact that theres a conflict involved and most of the people who would inhabit these regions are currently fighting stand in the way of a coherent argument interesting but the economic impact would be that itd tie blobs closer together as northern alliances would need southern ice while southern alliances would need northern technetium meaning youd just create trade relationships this essentially removes the inherent advantage of defense most people tend to get peeved with this when its a titan  cynojammer combo because it essentially means oh bubbles oh titan oh time to go look into jge a better solution would be to neutralize cynojammers with dds or make dds disrupt the cynojamming field on that grid for a period of time easy ways to counter this and seems silly to doubly nerf it perhaps a rethinking of your tactics may be more usefulupside more carebears to gankdownside sovereignty level 3 sovereignty adlasdadljw no one likes alarm clock but its a reality to make eve multiregional again not dropping the tower right off or taking it down to 35 and waiting might be a good solution and reinforcing it at an offhour time to prevent them from stront timing may help you here i think of all the things to complain about 00 youve picked and chosen the ones that have only effected you and your alliance while youve ignored plenty of regionsgroups that have small gang pvp cloud ring fade syndicate the dronies even with darius proposal on the table to make conquerable 00 more lucrative itd help free up certain regions i think a big part of the lack of alternative ways is diplomatic failures just because a game doesnt necessarily tailor to exactly your need where you want it doesnt mean you should deprive people
i support the ideas
i fail to see how most of eve gathering in a few systems to fight leaving 90 of 00 completely unused for months is an atlas diplo problemas far as 4 i think using the systems should be a preriquisite for owning them having whole regions empty of people for months at the time is just wrong in my book when it comes to our friend dlfgsfd he would need to plant a pos to get sov 1 in my idea then anyone can come along and drive him out its not like im proposing the removal of sovonmap
i support 1 2 3 5 4 needs work but perhaps something along these lines but a bit easier for an alliance to do without encouraging the isk farmersperhaps once you get sov 1 you could maintain pilots in system to get higher sov not suggesting enemy pilots have a countering effect even if its just alts online afk in system to hold it it will still drastically cut down on the amount of space the huge alliances can hold
my vote here
not that i really care but im not against it
i still think certificates right now are useless and maybe even dangerous but theyre here to stay so lets improve them in any way possiblesigned
i think they could be turned into a great way to guide new players at least to some degree in the right direction without making all the decisions for them the tutorial should probably mention the starter profession certificates as they could give newbies some clue about what to fit on the ship and which skills would help them the mostalso supporting the ops idea the cert settings ui appears to have been designed with extensibility in mind so this might already be on their agenda
not unreasonable my beef with certs is that the cert skills are at times unnecessary to the job titleexample  rare ore refining  for a harvester refining is a separate job
yep
good idea
at stealthbomber explosion bomb being charged blow up and putting full bomb damage for balancing destructing pod of stealthbombe pilotlike kamikadze ship
bombs are weak enough without another nerf
it would be a fun game mechanicbut when happens when people suicide outside jita 44 
completely agree with op
the issue is easy to agree with but you fail to adress the problems that cause it
as a small scale pvper with years of experience in 00 i can say that the biggest influencing factor that works against small scale pvp and roaming is the existence of jump bridgesthe great speed nerf ccp made didnt help the matter eitheri remember 00 before jump bridges anyone who remembers it should admit there was more pvp back then
simpleout of game ideamake eon the magazine payble via etc like sistemwould like to get eon but be able to pay for each number via ingame isk p

too bad it would be absolutely fabulous
its a pod if you are spamming the warp button as your ship enters hull you should be impossible to lock by even sensor boosted interceptors as you instawarpmore resists or hp will not help if you are caught in a bubble hit a smartbombing gate camp or just simply get caught it only prolongs the inevitable for a short whileso t2 pods are a moot point and unnecessary

i bought my toon and had nothing to do with its creation i should be given a chance to change the stupid name
unless you happen to have chosen a name that starts with a and you wish to participate in fleet fights without being the top of the enemys primary list every time supported
did you read the very next line the one where he says the density of each individual ore m3 of individual ore vs total m3 of ore in the rock in the asteroid belts would be determined by system security rating mainly and region secondarily with some degree of randomness added nobody is talking about a 10 belt being exactly as good as a 10 belt 00 mining would still be best likely by a very large margin as for highends staying out of empire why it was a sensible method of promoting interregional trade in 2004 but weve made that so flagrantly easy these daysfreighters jump freighters jump bridges carrierrorqual logistics intentional and massive ore compression etc that promoting it is a bit of a waste of time nobody wants pure bistot in highsec but a taste of it every now and then doesnt hurt anything
i would have stayed a miner had it been this way supported
what a pile of stif the system was implomented as proposed could use the same code as stations amything bolted to pos would be available in station panelall that rubbish we have to go through to 
i fully endorse this
not if the pos system is completely removed and replaced by something worth our playtimewrong the point it the current pos system sucks and we want it out replaced possibly by this proposed system variation of it or something else ccp migth deem worth their time to dowrong again the csm will be there with new delegates meeting ccp people from a software development point of view the pos system is huge and very integrated into the eve economy and game mechanics modifying the code is a pain replacing it is easierso it all boils down to showing ccp that maintaining the current pos system patching it with new concepts and keeping on top the current bugs actually costs more than simply replacing it or the silly parts of it like all the linking and numpty stuff  seriously just make it like the rest of the si process

i kinda like how it operates and like how in reality different flotillas coordinate with each other more than they do with allied flotillas you really need to have them fly together do the old military thing of having a connecting file to your 2 fleets and be done with ittheres a real simple answer to this problem
yes please  fleets need another overhaul with a more flexible command interface
i agrre sounds great
damn you goonies and your gamebreaking threadnoughts
yes and were also supposed to be working for peace on earth hows that working out design for the game as it is not the game that can only ever exist in your head
it seems that some ships did not receive an agility boost to go along with qrhowever if we are increasing the speedand therefore time it takes to get into warp we can easily make these ships more agile to compensate without any negative effectssince their combat maneuverability is more or less inconsequential
surreal but true supporting a goumindong topic
supported this massive change in combat mechanics has recieved no justification or comment from ccp
yeah the op makes sense not sure about the numbers but the concept is finebuthow about we give each type of gun a signature resolution and if the target sig radius is smaller than the signature resolution we could reduce accuracy proportionally
you could use your corp forum for that i agree with the original poster however that ingame would be bettershameless plug its still in beta but bleaklandscom is offering free corpalliance forums theyre private and secure of course
sound great i hope we get it

i agree
omg yesthis or maybe ctrlaltclick or altclick or any other variantion along these linesix
also another thought  can we cancel a targeting in progress its kind of annoying that it clogs our targeting for significant periods of time especially when damped and we cant do anything about it this
canceling would be handy as well
i support this as well as holding ctrl should freeze your overview
the problem i have with this is that it would greatly affect the tritanium supply in empire spacethe fact is that tritanium prices have been steadily rising ever since shuttles were unseeded on the market causing the price cap to be effectively removed this is a more accurate reflection of realworld economics in order to make this viable i think a blanket nerf to the refine rates of all ores should be put into effect  perhaps in a range of between 15 to 25
what does this have to do with the topicseriously this is about training times between the covetor and the hulk the covetor is a waste of time as most would skip over itwe are trying to find a way to make it useful again during the wait time between the 2 shipsthis has nothing to do with the bloody market hell it probially helps by increasing the sales for the covetorif anything the prices are likely due to macro miners not the ship
sounds good
just to put things into perspective  i want to train for all the sub capital drone ships ingame  so thats why the sin is one of my targets anyway my take on the sin was as the logistic multirole bo of the bunch1 with drone assistguard it can assign damagerepairs without needing to lock the target this makes it the fastest bo in this regard2 not relying on high slots for damage it can work as the neutrr boit has the drawback that it needs to wait for drones before it is able to gtfo if needed i think a larger drone bay your useless bonus idea would help here youd still be losing assets but you could have many many spare drones in bayin my view widow is the most useless bo ecm on a bs with cloak sig res penalty  the amarr and minmatar are the standard gank type ships best suited for hit and run type and the sin is the versatile multirole one as detailed above switching the domi to the megathron hull would make the sin a standard gank ship  so its a bit of loss in my viewagain i am not able to fly a bo let alone use it for the intended purpose so take my view as pure theory
seems so i stand corrected even better tho then we are on the same wavelenght on this issue
uhm i dont get the pointwhy remove t2 bposwith invention you can produce on a couple of bpcs at the same timend by selling more stuff get more iskmonth comparedto a singel t2 bpothis also counts with alchemy for the high end moon mineralsok they dont bring the same output without immense investionsbut you can get a couple of high end moon mins
if a ccp employee cheats to get a t2 bpo that doesnt mean t2 bpos are bad it means cheating is badif someone exploits pos mechanics and gets free moon minerals that doesnt mean moon minerals are bad it means exploiting is badlearn2logic t2 bpos for lp is maybe one of the worst ideas ever

which kinda goes to show pirates are worthless in every way including intelligenceit also benefits and fleet ops say having your cov ops share bookmarks with your gank squad so they can align properly and warp in on the unsuspecting sob togetheri like

thank you for your replies they are much appreciated and i will consider each of carefully for now though i would like to say my main goal is the reduction in time spent mining an asteroid which has already ran out of its ore say 1020 sec ago i also would like to see the lasers automatically switch rocks when the button is pressed and the removal of the bug that makes the laser waste power by starting a neww run after the progrram has removed the target and told you the asteroid is depletedmany thanks silverswann
i agree it would be great to have but may need to be limited to a small number of skills to stop character farming but as far as encouraging gameplay goes i find it frustrating and worthy as a reason to leave the game should my schedule become more intense simply put i hate having to log aver 6 hrs to change a skill
i also think that being able to train a skill that allows a second skill to be trained at a severely reduced rate only improvable by traing its relevant skill though still only covering in one day say the equivelent of 30 min to an hour of normal training
or u could just log in wen u can befor the skill is done and change to a alternative skill if u wont be online wen the main skill finishesworked till nowim not saying it is not cool to have ityeah it could be coolnecesity it is not on the other handjust my 2 cents
i would like to see a check mark or dragdrop a la grouping sort of interface for setting a module as perma run this means that the module would automatically turn itself on after a session change you would use it for stuff like damage control units and hardeners maybe even an afterburner mwd booster or repper on some setupsideally i would like to see the modules activate as soon as you lose your temporary cloak or invulnerable undocking status if you run out of capacitor and the module forcibly deactivates it should be removed from the perma run groupeditafter the first few negative replies maybe what im really looking for is for modules to just stay on when you jump through a gate ie if you had your hardeners or whatever on when you jumped theyre back on as soon as you lose your temp cloak
youve forgot to turn on your reppers again and got blown up in a mission didnt you
its an annoyance in pvp as well especially when roaming or travelling to an engagement id like to permanently turn on dcuiis sensor boosters and hardners
i dont think this game needs less interactionwould be bad for empire suicidegankers as well
im not horribly opposed but i dont see the need
me either too easy to tap that function key there are far more important matters to fix me thinks
cloak after a session change is the most relevant and needed one even for active pilotingdchardeners after a session change are the most relevant ones in afk empire pilotingfrom me thumbs up
bah pilot laziness should not be rewarded no support
oh sure its a convenience im just not convinced its a convenience we should be adding
i would like to see something along the lines of what you get in world of warcraft in wow you have an alarm feature enabling you to ensure you spend only what time you have to spare in the game i would like to see this feature come to the game as well as a countdown timer and a calender  having seen the post made by someone else
theres a clock look at it out of time stop playing
try buying an actual alarm clock and having it beside your computer or play around with the scheduled tasks in windows and get that working
ideal proposition i do not know if has been mentioned yet but i also propose a three strikes system for certian offences mild ones allow three occurances bfore serious action is taken of course after the first offence some action will need to be taken just milder for low end offences
i am not entrirely sure but i think that is already common with eula violation along gmsits like you get a warning for bad personal smacktalk in local if reportet or a small ban like 714 days for the secondthird issuehowever real exploits resulting into an permanent ban imhoi only know its case based
thing is theyre making a game and not a game based on either real life or tom clancy i agree that a comprehensive ewar system would be very interesting in a lot of contexts but im not sure if it really fits eve for example given the sizes of these ships and the sizes of grids just about everything on grid is visible to the naked eye if you used that parameter with a realworld sensor system the targeting mechanic would be click on it and start shooting id rather have buffs and debuffs than no ewar at all the mechanisms eve uses to make its gameplay are intensely unrealistic in all manner of fields  remember we dont pilot spaceships we pilot submarines i dont see any easy way to make an exception for this without ripping out the whole combat system and starting from scratch
currently we have some lowgrade only sets i would like to see hg sets be introduced as well bringing those implants in along with the other pirate implantssets that need hg versionscenturion  increased optimal for ecm tracking disruptors sensor damps target paintersvirtue  scan probe strengthharvest  mining laser range bonusnomads  agility bonusedge  reduction in booster side effectsninja edit to reflect all pirate implants pwhether you use them or not please support if you feel it needs fixed p
supporting my own topic
agreed there needs to be another mechanic for target calling as the abcs and zyx often get screwed over in the first minute of the fight what i dont understand is when you scan a ship down or use your onboard scanner no matter what the distance be it 1km or 1au it does not show the pilot name why is that but when they are on your overview at that 1km it shows the character name i vote to remove the name column from the overview and increase squad size to 15why remove the name column as it stands on the eve battlefield orders in combat are absolute which is not the case irl nothing is ever perfect the only mistakes on the field in eve is that either the character cant read or his overview is setup wrong people want to avoid the instapop this is how first set overview by type and distance not everyone will be the same distance from each other hence when the fc primes the scorp there may be 5 on the field and people based on their range are shooting the wrong one solution of course being broadcasts but half the time people dont read them any ways i think with communication being tougher on the battlefield it will make for more interesting combat a need for sharper fcs not pilots who can call names alphabeticallyas for changing the squads to 15 with a hockey for broadcast this seems like a good and viable idea again it adds diversity to the field without the isnta pop and a requirments for more teamwork and tactics
rather than modifying this so you arent the first to go up blazing why not come up with an idea that is beneficial for allfor instance how about a tagging system where targets are tagged with a number by the fc or a designated target caller and sort by that column the first dies the second becomes the first ectanother option would be changing your characters name name change proposalcourse then you just get a lot of lmn character names
this was originally created as a petition and the gm that replied redirected me to these boards so heres the original content of my petitionhii was just wondering if it could be possible that npc corp channels be available to anyone if they belong to the same factionat the moment it is treated like a player corporation and leaving an npc corp will often mean leaving it forever several players i know have even left months old characters simply to reexperience the more vibrant chat channels of the default corporationsi had run across the same problem when i joined the minmatar rms and discovered that rms and run are two different channels with absolutely no way of entering the latter from the former and vice versa i left a lot of friends in run it also means that joining a small corporation will leave you with virtually no one to talk to but the people of your corp the rookie channel the local channel and whatever chat room you decide to set up it gets a bit old after a while you might sayanyway player to player interaction is a big thing in eve isnt it i just thought more notice could have been made on the player communities so as i said i suggest making npc corporation channels available to everyone of the same faction ie freely joinablethank you for taking the time to read this and more power to this awesome gameericobsidian soulthe gms replyhi gm disconap herethis sounds like a pretty good ideai suggest that you post about the new idea for optimizing and improving the game in the features and ideas discussion section of our official forumsthe dev team regularly reads it and takes feedback into consideration while working their hardest to improve the gamehere is a direct link to the section
i dont think anyone cares in this case but youre not supposed to post gm responses on the forums fyi as for the actual idea i like it let people help new players join in interesting chat channels and get spammed by isk sellers if they like and it doesnt hurt anybody while giving new players a reason to move to player corps supported
currently some 00 entities are exploiting downtime to garentee thier towers are anchored and onlined safly without fear of being attacked by anchoring the tower just before downtime hits there is no chance for reprisal by the defendingattacking force due to downtime being 1 hour the tower will be anchored and ready online the moment downtime finishesby anchoring a pos before downtime and using the time during downtime to run through the 30 min anchoring on a large we may as well either remove anchoring all together or call this what it is an exploitproposal prefered pause the countdown on anchoringonlining pos and modules over downtimealternative if above isnt possible tho i dont see why it wouldnt be prevent the anchoringonlining of pos for 1 hour prior to downtime
wtf are you talking aboutseriously your alliance needs to learn to use dictors properly and destroyers both of which are fine except the gallente versionswouldnt hurt to have an additional t2 ewar destroyer or a t2 stealth destroyer mind you
youve got me there ive not flown in an outpost holding alliance since 2007 and im sure that allows you to conveniently pigeonhole my suggestion to the clueless category and move along ive done my fair share of skirmish warfare since then though so ive experienced the game through wcs various speed changes and many major feature additions i might not be the biggest evegeek but ive been aroundthe bottom line is that destroyers are usually outgunned by assault frigates a ship they are more or less intended to be a counter for and easily outsurvived by the same whilst the coercer and thrasher can deal some serious damage the other two are next to useless with the cormorants sniping ability of little use in most forms of engagement and again what the cormorant can do the harpy can do just as well with a higher probability of survival with the same being true of other races given that assault frigates are of limited use though much greater use since the changes to missiles at least for caldari and an fc would usually rather a cruiser than an af i think that lets us see where destroyers sit in the grand scheme of things struggling at the bottom of the pileinterdictors fair a little better especially if youre minmatar as they can dish out damage proportionally higher than their t1 cousins and their interdiction spheres make them fearsome when warped into battleship groups when camped cloaked on gates and in similar situations however their size means they can be swatted out of the air by heavy drones rendering them a sacrifice ship rather than a true fleet combat vessel since the speed changes of course theres little reason  unless you plan to bubble and run  to take an interdictor over its heavy cousin in hacrecon gangs and both of these roles would be better filled if the interdictor became a cloak capable vessel of some sort
i wont say a word about interdictors because ive never flown one or with one the current destroyers however need not be touched they were introduced to counter tier 1 frigates and for that they do a fine job they werent meant to be tanks they were meant to be gun platformsa solution to assault ships would be tier 2 destroyers perhaps with better resistances or slightly better dps this would keep them more fragile than the heavy assault ships yet stronger than afspersonally i like things the way they are the skills to fly an af are far greater than that of a destroyer just my two isk
if they ever wanted to remove skills they could do this then i dont think theyve yet wanted to remove skills though and i cant think of a reason that they would programming now for something you may do in future just seems like a waste of time for all involved
hahahahahaha nothumbs down
sigh no
sage sage sagethumbs down
i dont see why anyone would disapprove of improved maintainability but ok nevermind then
because it takes time to implement this sort of stuff and that time could be better spent elsewhere this isnt leaving road corridors undeveloped in city planning this is work that can be done whenever its needed without need for faradvance planning also if they do it now and then later need to remove a skill theyre locked into one model for doing so by public expectations that theyve fostered whether or not that model proves appropriate at that time thats also bad if you were talking about creating a better framework to do something they do routinely id be for it this isnt that
a sensible answer thank you i agree
i dont remember the exact patch when it happened but recently ccp yet again swapped out the nurf bat for a titanium bat with which to beat something into near uselessness we all remember the heavyhanded nurfing of the nos and now it seems as if missiles are on their way of joining nos as a relicafter the nano nurf missile boats were again able to hit roaming gangs much to the satisfaction of the statistical 12 of eve who is caldari however after this it became apparent that they were overpowered cruise missile ravens alpha striking cruisers into oblivion ccp the balance seeking people they are decided it was time to nurf missiles greatly changing the formula used to calculate damage against x sized ships moving y speednow in pvp it was needed but when im trading in my raven for a maelstrom to mission in simply because im tired of waiting for my drones to kill the frigs and cruisers of my missions its a bit screwy the selling point in my eyes of missiles has always been their ability to swap damage type done just by changing ammo all with no drawbacks like you see on other ammo types this benefit no longer outweighs their different mechanics over other race battleships using a tech 2 target painter on my raven with average skills it still required 2 sometimes 3 vollies just to kill a battlecruiser which is fine in its self but using the same tp and same missiles on a cruiser and i empty 20 missiles into a ship now to mission run or rat anywhere that requires you to prune belts more then once my only option would be paying the insanely inflated price for t2 precision missiles no other race has to use t2 ammo to kill smaller ships why should imy suggestion is one of the following thoughts on how to fix said missiles issuesa missile tracking mods turret systems get them even my maelstrom when fit with 1 tracking enhancer can hit a frig at 30km almost every time why cant missiles have mods to reduce the factor of sig radius and movement speed in the damage formulab 3540 increase to the sig radius of all npc ships keeping the balance in pvp of having to use specific missiles or specific sized targets but ones again returning their usefulness in pve tooc add a random value to the damage formula on missiles one that would equate to the barely scratches and wrecking hit values of turrets taking a turret boat and a missile boat of identical dps theoretical dps as viewed in eft when comparing actual dps on a target the turret boat almost always does more real dps due to the random factord remove missiles from the game as is and make them just like every other weapon instant hitting tracking dependent damageanother case in point of missiles failing compared to other weapons based off damage readouts from past pos sieges the dred a turret based dred and a missile based dred both shoot at a large tower both hit for quite a bit of damage while sieged dreds switch targets and both begin shooting at a webbing battery on the tower the turret dred hits the battery for near what it does on the tower as its still a stationary target however the missile dred hits somewhere around 13 the damage it hit the tower for because of the sig radius factor of missiles
i do not support this topic you had easymode turned on for so long you forgot what it is like for the rest of us now you are forced to join the rest of us
easymode clearly im a caldari character who just looks minmatar right no i trained from the ground up to fly one i just think its a bit pathetic that missiles are now more useless then ever whats the point of having them when theyre only useful using the missiles thatre 2k per shotnot to mention youre no doubt a droneboat player think drones were the only thing better then cruise missiles for missions 
no missiles are fine in pve learn to small drones
agreed
so what youre saying is battleship sized weapons arent the best choice for shooting cruisers and below sounds perfectly balanced to me
not only a matter of bs vs cruise even shooting a bs that is going more than 100 ms will cause a visible damage reduction
confirming the cursed2 is a noob who cant fit a ship
cruisesheavies are ok its the unguided missiles that are royally screwed by qrrockets do so few damage youre better off fitting unbonused gunsjavelins no longer reach as far as they used toexplosion radius is huge on unguided missiles and not reducible by any skill or module
no missiles are more fine now then theyve ever been
yawnsnogoes back to enjoying his minmatar battleship
the missile nerf was heavy the basic idea makes sense but it was carried too far why they changed explosion velocity i dont understand a simple rate of fire increase and increasing the slope of the sig radiusexplosion radius damage reduction calculation would have sufficedthat said it is what it is yes it was a hard hit yes we feel like we were baited n switched regardless i doubt well see a revisit of this change and at the end of the day minmatar really is a fun race to train until it gets nerfed too
the only thing thats wrong with missiles atm is that the explosion velocity of class x missiles does not match speed of class x ships added to that is the fact that there are more skills and mods to increases speed than there are to decrease explosion velocityclass x missiles should do 100 damage to class x ships t1 vs t1 as a base this is then modified by skills and fittingclass x1 missiles should do 50 or something damage to class x ships t1 vs t1 as a base  again modified by skills and fitting after the base has been applied
there is already a giant missile thread probably would of been better posting theremissiles do not need to be unnerfd but their nerf values for explosion radius and velocity do need to be tweaked due to over nerfing
i have to agree with the op most of our ships are great gun boats but still have that ambiguity and weird hardpoint load out its not too bad but but the biggest issues are out tier 1 bs and our dread out of all the tier 1 bs the typhoon is rather useless especially after the torp nurf utilizing autos for most of my career i can not fit a decent combat setup for the typhoon because of my poor missile skills meaning instead of opting for a good cheap tier 1 bs in pvp i have to spend more on either a tempest or maelstrom when i see all the other races tier 1 bs being used in pvp all the time caldari get teh scorpion great ecm boat gallente get the domi a very versatile and well rounded ship and amarr get the apoc a great gun boat that can hold its own the same goes for our dreads after spending all that time to get in one and avoid haveing missiles my whole career it was pretty much a waste to train up for the cit torp matari hardpoints need a revamp as it stands each other race only has to use one type of weapon and minmatar in order to be efficient in some of their better ships have to be more skill intensive not to mention half the ships armor tanking and the other half shield tanking but thats for another threadsupport changing minmatar hardpoints
ehh i dont think messing with the high slots is the right way to go about thisminmatar ships should have tweaks to other areas mid slotslow slots bonusesive always been happy with the high slot layouts on most minmatar shipsbut i tend to fall short in other areas
personally i love 4 i want asdfasfds and his friends in a place where i can kill themand as for the ice belts nevermind low and nullsec force asdfasfds and his pals into 00 i want to kill them a lot and force the pay to play alliance already harboring these cretins into exposing themselves totally
if im reading the proposal correctly what its saying is that sov 1 would be under the same rules as at present but unless you use the system you cant get any higher than 1 afsgfklerw and his friends would have to be working for an alliance that already has legitimate sovereignty in order to make a difference to sov levels
too much bad ideas mixed with some passable one in particular i find your ice idea suggested by other players at nauseam very self centeredi want more targets i want to inconvenient the alliances it will make high sec pos a thing of the past not my problemthere is people that dont play for your 00 sovereignty games
id rather they were gotten rid ofthey are useless at best and misleading to new players at worst
yup if ineve can do it then ccp should be able to
i would like to see more black systems id also like to see more different nebulas id like some sections of space to be vast and empty black expanses id some to have unique and beautiful nebulas nova remnants etc we need badlands in addition to more empty skies
yes please  i have to rotate the camera in some systems to see the green glow of active modules 
1 but to the align idea it has somewhat limited use as fleet members would not be able to see their fcs bookmark now if they removed the regroup and replaced it with a force align command but thats another discussion
i agree this idea sounds great i would also like to see the ability to have moveable buttons like windows that can be moved around the screen at set for vaious things such as docking in station upon being pressed also i would like to see a hotkey fuction that does similar
thought id chime in cuz this is on my mind all the timeyes it is too crowded 35000 generally on most of the time when it was 15000 it was great but 35000 is much better for other reasons and i cant wait when eve hits 100000id like to see 10000 more systems stretching the galaxy out a separated high sec region might be a good idea if it takes 200 jumps to get from high sec to your destination would be nicethats explorationnothing to explore right now there are people everywhereglad to see this will be happening in march or at least i hope it will with wormholesalso with more people we need more items to create and trade t3 is nice but paying 17b for a shipwell well seeas for lag 700 people in jita still plays ok and way way way better than say a year ago
glad to see a followup meeting on open issues and a great wiki to go with itim personally very interested in issues regarding factional warfare glad to see that those issues are talked about too however did not find the issue regarding alliances corporations in alliances possibility to join fw  is this issue already decided uponoverall great work csm delegates  you are doing a valuable workbest regardst 2
indeedi have to keep tons of station containers around to organize my stuff 
1although id have no problem with staying with containers for sorting stuff is the various improvements people have already mentioned were implemented you can already turn that off in the containers settings
yes but its not stored on the server but on the clientso whenever your settings disappear be it reformat or new patch all container are locked againfunalmost forgot  signed
ok thats crap and odd considering that the setting is per container youd have thought it would make more sense for it be server side
against  and strongly sofirst of all  if you are allowed to change the characters name are you also allowed to remove the employment history because if suddenly joe average is showing as having been in my corp and i am convoed by a ceo for a reference  then i will have to say eh we never had a joe average we did have a joe dumbass but i have no way to know if it is the same guyyour name is your most important asset in eve have a good name a name remembered by people as a trustworthy and respectable player  it is worth more than isk
not exactly a compelling argument you say weve never had a joe average bye the person asking the question leaves confused and will remain so until they learn to read what a pitythis thread has seen the same arguments over and over and every one of them has been thoroughly debunked so please stop repeating the same old crap and come up with something newsigned
i do not support this i do not want this idea implimented
a principled bump for greater gloryme signs
can you elaborate on that  what exactly is so terrible about not having to log in just to change skills then log out immediately after or so terrible about not having to worry if your skill finishes during your lunch break or not 
strongly in support of this
i too walk my car uncanny anyhoo supported no reason this has not been implemented before
i support this 100 just enabling one other skill for training after the first would be superb
im actually going to disagree with this idea fleets are capped for strategic purposes and i cant see much reason to need more than 250 people warping in to the exact same spot large fleet ops generally involve several groups throughout a system such as support ships securing gates and capitals beating on a pos and i think a lot of the fleet size issues can be resolved by creating new fleets for groups that will not need to be in the same spot at the same timealternatively however i might be willing to accept a change that would allow one fc to send a warpin request to another fc in the rare occasions that you might need the 500man lagfest for some reason
thats a cool idea
sod go the whole hog10 pilots  squadron 5 squadrons  wing5 wings  battlegroup5 battlegroups  fleet5 fleets  armada13000 pilot battles should future proof the game somewhat dthe downside would be that armada command would have to be rank 30 and would take about 2 years to train to l5
navy admiral rank 16 skill with lvl5 fleet command prerequisiteallows control of 1 additional fleet per level and just for fun 5 bonus to gang warfare modules per level
i like this approach to the fix its easy and simple and improves fleet size without laborious skill training
supported this needs to be addressed align times are crazyedit to tick the support box
supported with the little common background lag and modul lag it is fare to common to only see the other ship warping off before you can applay tackle
i support a change to the cyclone the main issue being all tier 1 bcs are worse than their tier 2 counterparts when generally the tiers are supposed to be different not better but i wont go there for this topic removing a high slot no change to hard points in exchange for a mid slot would work well for the design of this ship as it mostly benefits the tank bonus while still limiting the damage potential extra cpu would be nice but i feel only a small increase as mid slots generally use more cpu than highs on a bc i also wouldnt complain with a small boost 200 to base capacitormost shield tanking ships do function better as a support ship bringing a decent tankgank ratio while not having as much tackle at the moment that tankgank ratio is too low to use it over other ships and that extra mid slot helps bring the tank up to reasonable levels as a gang ship it falls behind the hurricane substantially for dps and some what for tankat the moment this ship is really only competitive to standard t2 fit bcs when using faction gear that extra money is better spent on a tier 2 bc while giving better insurance pay back and not too much good loot to your enemy i know a lot of people care about this
all tier one cruisers need looking atproblem 1 bad tank battlecruisers and destroyers for that matter suffer from having near bs size and speed but only have the ability to equippower cruiser sized tanking modules this makes it so only the passive tanked bcs drake have good tanks the tanking bonuses need to either be larger or the ships need to be purely offensiveproblem 2 tier 2 superiority for most races the tier 2 bc is in every way better than the tier 1 bc while being minimally more expensive and skill intensivewhat id like to seeprophesy and cyclone redesigned from the ground up possibly a khanid style setup for prophesy and a speed andor typhoon style cycloneoverall increases to hardpointsslotsdrone bayscapacitorhit pointspgcpu on all tier 1 bcs
the cyclon does need to be looked at currently its only use is as a component to make a claymore and a slipner
projectile weapons need a little love
good idea added it as 4th option
post 5 unless you want to change it to a mining nonstoryline mission
typical of the big boyz wanting to have all the funz alliancez can war dec all they wantz but the little guyz get hamstung lavista support is growing
i disagree
i give a thumbs down
same first fix wardecs no reason to make it easier to wardec more miners at a timeand half of the people supporting it here are your own alts
no way fix the fact that a corp can war dec another corp then not even bother to fight first add an activity timer that forces the deccing corp to engage the decced corp or the war is declared void i know but all the decced corp has to do is wait out the timer duh its their prerogetive as they didnt want to get decced eh you want better wars choose better targets dont increase the numbers of war decs
no if you operate in the way you say then fine but the war mechanics do not just apply to you they also apply to the pvp corps who are too scared to go to 00 and like to stay in empire grieving easy targetsi completely agree with lavista in saying that the war system needs a complete overhaulbear in mind that war is supposed to allow corps to compete over resources not to act and as way to slap someone from dissing them which is often what happens even if you dontwhat id like to see is each war needing to have an objection specified egprevent use of asteroid fields in x systemprevent use of lab slots in x stationonce the criteria is fulfulled for y time say a week then the war ends on its own if target corp resumes the activity within z time say a month then the deccing corp can redec for freeoh and the cost should be increased since the aim is to allow competition over resources if the resources arent worth a higher wardec fee then why bother in the first placeso bottom line thumbs down why is there is thumb down icon btw for this thread
nice twist on the victory conditions a bit complicated but it makes sensewars are supposed to be over resources of sum such or another problem is no one bothers to be that creative anymore
disagreethe wardec system is broken and needs to be redesigned before the number of wardecs should be expanded as for the limitation 3 6 or 9 wardecs per corpalliance ultimately shouldnt matter if the system is designed well at the moment though it would be too easily abused to harass smaller corps in even greater frequency
i like it at the very least pve would become a lot more dangerousedited to give support
no im just going to reference about 1000 scifi shows where the ships blow up but it doesnt hurt anyone else it isnt needed and ccp doesnt want to design another smartbomb in this game it would just create more lag and hurt huge fleet battles noisaac
honestly if you blow up a battleship at 5000 meters off you should get some amount of damage i mean for crying out loud its got a large powerplant a ton of ammo and so forthnot to mention that i think explosions for larger ships should bewellin the words of marvin the martianwheres my earth shattering kaboom i want my earth shattering kaboomwould make for a neat strat pack as much ammo as you can in your hold and if they blow you up at close range hehehe
heres a problem for youwar target kills your ship outside jita stationyour ship blows up damaging nearby neutral shipsconcord shows up and kills your pod for acts of aggression and to cap it off your sec ratting also gets a hit for each ship you agress
counter argumentconcord isnt responsible if your ships gets blown to hell and some passerby decided to get a little to closethings go wrong and if your in the wrong time at the right place oops
this damage would only effect ships that fought at close range unless the radius was very largei have to agree if the lag of 500 of ships and the thousands of drones receiving splash damage it would be an insane amount of lag generated now if in some way only npc delivered splash damage that would be interesting for mission runners
i do like both this and the suggested issue even if it isnt ctrlright click but ctrlshiftright click or somethingeither way i say yes to the initial topic and also ouldnt that be lovely to herschels suggestion
as a logi pilot i support this request
please please pleaseincluding lock cancel and overview freeze
pretty please and the overview frieze that would make life soooo much easier d
i agree with this the only reason i stuck with the covetor for so long is because at the time i saw mining as a temporary hobby to pass some time whilst training for other things on my main account
agreed  i currently use a retriever but have not bothered going higher as i am mainly combatshould the covetor be reduced however id get one of them most likely and then probably go for a hulk as wellas it is its too long to train for and i might as well go the whole hog and get a hulknone of the people in my corp bother with the covetor they are all going straight to hulk
makes sense to me
yup a slight drop in covetor skill requirements should do the trick
astrogeology iv makes the most scene for both the skills definition and the train time it takesastrogeology is a specialty skill that a t2 ship would need not necessarily a t1
that is not logic its opinion 
i like the sound of this even if it is only alligning to a mission start point
great idea
yes yes please tell us more about how a covops can find a target then bookmark it then warp back to a nearby station which may be several jumps away in 00 make a bunch of copies and then come back and pass them out to his friends in the meantime the target has been sitting there patiently waiting for the covops to make bookmark copies so that the hostiles in system can be aligned to warp directly to him and kill him we all know how accommodating those silly 00 ratters can be and we love them for ityes yes please tell us more about how combat works since ive never shot at anything before in my life it would be nice receive a few pointers from you oh wise sage of the autocannonsor maybe just maybe the only use this has is for single ratters miners and assorted other carebears to align to a safespot whereupon they can insta warp to it when neutrals come in system and be cloaked before the neutrals even have time to hit the scan buttonim just blindly flailing about for explanations here tho so maybe im way off base
great idea

thanks for the replies  good and bad for the people w negative comments they all seemed to be along these lines in defense i dont see it as supporting laziness as much as i see it as adding back functionality that should really be there in the first place why do modules deactivate when you jump through a gate everything else spooling up modules cap shield stays the same im sure it could also tie into their need for speed initiative im sure the 500 nearsimultaneous module activations can really hurt the server when a 100man gang jumps through a gate
sorry more playing this game on autopilot is not neededlets look at what problems your supposid fix is addressingyour mods dont worked cloaked so if your active and jump through a gate you should be turning your mod on only after you break cloakthe only time i see this really making a difference in teh game is afk travel and leaving stations part of the problem is leaving stations sometimes your at a black screen while undocking and ppl saw it as unfair to be shot at while you couldnt control your shipccp tried to improve on the problem by giving a 30sec antilock timer after undocking the problem is in some systems or in systems with giant fleet fights session changes will leave you at a blank screen this is the real problem ccp needs to address without this problem then the only time auto mod turn on would be beneficial is to those autopilotingalready we have ppl whining for autopilot wtz this is just a lesser version of that garbage imo but at the same time trying to address a legit problemnot supported but i understand what i think your trying to get at
thumbs up makes things a bit more fair for people with laggyhighlatency connections like mine
i dont see the need for this kind of thing the whole point of you playing the game is the skill level involved and the outcome of thatfor people that forget to turn on a module and suffer the consequences ie reppershardeners off then that is your own fault dont want that to sound mean but it is playing the game involves you as the player focusing on these things and if you cannot then you should not expect mechanics to be introduced to compensate for this and actually learn from this experienceyes it is annoying and i know i have done this a few times not even as a rookie but that is life eliminating this would take something away from the game and pvp as a whole because your skill and performance are meant to dictate the direction of your fight not some automated mechanism
no this is rewarding laziness and tbh this game doesnt need it if you forget to turn on your modules then mabye you should focus on the game not whatever else your looking at and as for the argue of jump gates again laziness lets not make the game less interactive isaac
now i understand how players can stand to have their bps tied down for such a long time and clog up the research facilities this will have serious repercussions that will not all be unhappily received but after the shock waves have finished rolling around new eden players will just get used to the new rules it just has to be supportedthere is no other rational choice it just isnt fairand as for ccp getting money well they are kinda running a business they have lives and need to eat take some time to actually consider their running costs i for one and happy to pay because i think eve is a project worth supporting and in hind sight eve tv was worth supporting and would go back and chip some cash to help out i am considering getting a second account but that might diminish my original and best guy
i am undecided about this sounds fair in general but how about market orders for a corp or research for a corp the ceo does not get to know if an account is going idle  and so heshe has the problem of suddenly have bpos not researching because someone did not pay hisher eve account for a weekhmmmi guess that means i am not in support of the proposal
while i can agree with the original idea and many more that ive read in post that mess with markets etc since it does ultimatly mess with it in the long run i cant agree with well pardon me for not been able to afford eve all the time some of us have other things to worry about other than eve so what your telling me is im to poor to afford eve and if if i cant play for say 9 months due to money problems that i should lose all my ships my isk my skills becasue i cant afford the subscriptionwell tbh thats whats happend to me i come back after 9 months inactive i had nothing in the market that would mess with it and give me an unfair returning advantage what am i rewarded with for re subing 15 million isk 6 months of skill training multiple ships gone removed i dont even have the character because that got deleted too so yeah understandbly im well and truly miffed ive paid ccp to play thier game which i think is worth the time and effot to play and i get kicked in the teeth and told that i need to place a pettion to resolve the issuesigning with your orginal idea not with removing characters altogether my counter argument to that is ive paid ccp for that privledge why should they strip it from us
you sir are a shining gem of intelligence in this otherwise mentally deprived thread
depending in the market orders that could be alot of isk loss by having market orders suddenly end they would have to be suspended
how in the world will suspending income and rp of accounts that arent being paid for going to hurt ccp that onetwo month a year that account logs in to harvest rp
good idea
excellent idea
there may be a potential problem that would prevent this dependant on how the background code worksthis may introduce an exploit where a player can bookmark another ship in space not being his own ie bookmarking opposition sniper fleet and being able to warp to it
right now the t2 nosferatu modules offer no benefits over the meta4 variants the modules are identical except the meta4 variants have lower fitting requirements there is no reason to choose the t2 nosferatu over the meta4 nosferatu i propose that the t2 nosferatu modules be boosted in both transfer amount and range even a small 10 boost over the meta4 would make using the t2 worthwhile this issue affects all sizes of nosferatu
posting to support my own topic
thing is theyd need to redo whole lots of items not just nos t2
the advantage is cost if you dont care about fitting use t2 and save a few million if you do care pay up and as the above poster said this is true of a huge number of modules
as said before if your willing to pay more then meta4 is the way to go if not go t2 unless ccp wants to change the entire mechanic of all similar modules this wont happen isaac
completely unhelpful comments aside it seems like a good idea
i do like the concept of an alarm or timer type featurein my brief stint playing lineage 2 there was an annoying little window that would pop up every couple of hours saying that you should take a break something like that would be usefull if you could schedule the messages yourself
couldnt hurt to have the option low priority though
tbh i tried hard but failed to come up with an issue that has less importance than this
supportand yes we do need ccps blessing before making a list eg the example thread was locked for being a discussion of exploits
ccp dont allow discussion about exploits because they cant be assed to fix them support
not really far because you read the eula so infrequently and especially at the start the mechanic s that the exploits apply to may not be familiar to you if youve not done them in game hardly far to expect you to remember a list of exploits that are meaningless to you
lets get this straightened outif ive got 8 to minmatar republic why then do i get a warning about being a criminal in minmatar space and attacked by minmatar policeyes i am a 10 pir8 but it should be concord flagging me warning me and spawning to plink at my ship gate police not gankspawnsthe minmatar shold well enough leave me alone especially if im in the militia and at a high positive standing to the entire faction
fair point how far done the security system do concord patrol the gates
im not a fiction expert  but isnt concord something like a un security force  a mutually agreed on security force employed by all of the empiresfactions and with jurisdiction in all of the empirefaction spaces
nope works as intendedconcord is globalits just concord going after you i doubt its minmatar navy  o if it was i guess concord deputizes them
works very well against afk cloakers it only simiworks if you bother to take the time with small fleet of recons if the person is active but then again if you know your being hunted and dont think you can avoid the gang hunting you then you can always either log or leave system
i think the only whiners to this idea are those that make living off if ratting in ravens in hostile space or those that griefmarket make isk off intel and do so scott free atm they dont like the idea of cloaking having counters and it scares them
wrong i am opposed to this proposal and i have never flown a raven and never engaged in intel selling
left off market whoring
wrong again i dont think ive trained beyond trade 3 and i still dont support this proposal
support both the above ideasi did have a nice solution to the bots land in my lap today however apparently one of the regular ice field bots in my home system is set to loot faction wrecks my miner killed a couple true sansha frigs and the bot looted one of the wreckswhat a nice feeling it is to have a bot flashing red grabbed my main and popped a fully t2 fitted mackinaw and am still watching the pod warp in and out so at least today i beat the macro miners sure tomorrow will be back to normal life can be good
by that logic we also need hg edge and harvest sets
updating post to reflect all the lg implant sets that need hg versions
imho harvest and edge are completly useless implants those should be changed
while i do agree they are useless implants lol they should still offer a hg version
if i recall correctly a dev said that booster production would be getting some love at some point so edge would then be good
just a simple request that cms ask ccp to include a module timer for interdiction sphere launcher as they already have done with all other modulesto my knowledge this is the only module that doesnt have any indication when its ready for reuse once youve fired off a warp disruption bubble
this is actually a pretty good idea i like it
i say merge all the newbie corp channels into a single and optionally joinable faction channeledit forgot to support this idea
there is empire channel for each empire faction it theory its function is exactly what you suggest you can even join a channel not of your racein reality at this moment there are 17 people on the amarr channel 19 caldari 28 gallente 6 jove  27 minmatarthe only drawback i see in your idea is the spamming of isk sellers but ccp seem to have resolved most of it i would prefer a revitalizing of the empire channels but supported
problem i want to talk to my old friends in runsolution make a new character in run and chat with themsecond solution make a channel and invite your friends make it open invite and let in everyone from run and rms and everywhere elseno need to change mechanicsi feel that npc corporations should be stepping stones for new players so that they will grow into real player made corporations currently we have this antisocial syndrome where solo players stay in npc corporations and stroke their epeen and scream against pirates and other inane chat the chat in npc corporations is pretty terrible a lot of whining and tons of misinformation that comes from long time npc pilots that dont know anything about eve i log on my noob haulerscoutcyno alts all the time the chat is not goodthe focus of eve should not be about npc corporations and this puts more focus on what should be a simple corporation for new players to get a handle on the gamethis mechanic will hurt new players in that they are having what should be a helpful channel spammed by old vets and long term npc players that do not know what they are talking about having new questions about eve and being too shy to even talk in your new player corp chat because it is being monopolized by people visiting with old friends is not helpful to new players add in the element of isk spammers and people just wanting to rant at others and you have a bad mechanicnot supported tldr  make your own channel or deal with it you shouldnt stay a noob with no friends forever
againsti dont want to support anything that increases the interest in the npc corps as i feel they are a way to escape retaliation
suporteddosent hurt anyone having old players join noob channels
only problem i can see is that the rookie channel might turn into a recruitment spam channel
well in a way that would be easyer for new players to find a home in a non npc corpbut i higly douth that as there are not that many corps that recrute people whit low sps and experience
not supporting npc corps are to stay separate and i do feel for those that wardeck corps and the wardecked corps run like chickens with their heads cut off to npc corps so a big fat no isaac
bad idea to idle the onlining it will give the opposing side 1 hour to gather people using outofgame means
and that is better than not being able to do anything about it howno one is forcing them to anchor them just before dt if this is implemented you can still anchor them after dt if you are afraid your enemies will use dt to gather people
quick frankly this just sounds like an exploit to me
supported  using downtime like this is pretty weak
if you do this then you need to stop all out of game timers continuing that includes poss coming out of rf skill training times continuing rd stuff continuing to accumulateit changes a giant dynamic in the game by pausing everything during the 1hr dtalthough it may be annoying to some the 1hr onlining time is more of a problem than the ppl onlining it during a dt imonot supported
coming out of rf i can understand but your argument fails for the rest of the timers they are not linked and i can see no reason to tie them all together
in all honesty a lot of the problem is poss in general not whether they anchoring then or later
perhaps that is where you make a mistakedestroyers are not meant to counter assault frigates never have beenthe af is a tech 2 ship comparable in firepower and tanking capacity to a light cruiser one step up like most tech 2 combat ships therefor the destroyer deals as well with an af as it deals with a cruiser miserablydestroyers are the counter to tech 1 frigates nothing more nothing less they also do well as a step between tech 1 frigates and cruisers for pve they are actually quite useful if you run level 1 missions toothe reason why they are of little use in pvp now is that fleets of tech 1 frigates are incredibly rare the goonswarm birth is past us and something like that is unlikely to happen againso eventually destroyers are fine the way they are they just are not fine for much anymorethe only thing that should probably change is the tech 2 version of the destroyer which is the interdictor those could use a buff to perform better against cruisers and assault frigates only a slight buff though after all their main role is not direct firepower contribution
t1 destroyers are fineinterdictors are good for one bubble for which you pay with your pod and shipkill the offensive ability of dictors and buff there speed while dropping sig radiusthey will still be way slower than ceptors so ceptors stay in there own job but at least it won be at the cost of your podgiving them a bonus to cloaks like stealth bombers isnt a half bad idea
for anyone interested im blogging the experience link is in the sig warning i type a lot
move to dronelands and rat plush tons of trit in it
thats why you ask your new recruit for references from previous corps then you talk to them you get references from from these references talk to them then you repeat until youre either satisfied with your recruit or have learned enough to deny this recruit or are bored and realize its a gamedoesnt anyone know how to do a real background check these days

as usual akita t is spot on these changes are both exciting and desperately needed
this was a great idea in 2006 and given that so little has changed except for the targetable modules since then with the poses its still a great idea ccps answers are not acceptable  poses need a lot of dev love anyway whether or not that amounts to a total rewritethey just came up with a whole bunch of new gates in the latest big patch new models for pretty much everything in trinity and are about to introduce a whole new chunk of the game that has almost nothing to do with eve currently walking in stations to say that its too hard to take something thats made a lot of peoples lives in eve hard for a long time and actually make it work better and look better is a c must try harder effort from ccp to be honestas for the csm you were elected to represent us if we want an issue to be raised and discussed it is your responsibility to do so if you think youve already discussed it then we have a problem either you didnt explain ccps answer to us satisfactorily or ccps answer did not satisfy us either way the actions with you still on this one

something needs to be changed about bombers certainly as their utility has been curtailed to pretty much nil the only time i ever see them used these days is doing fw complexes and even there they are pretty limitedconsidering their current gimped state making them able to use a cov ops cloak is more viable
i endorse this actioni had a hour skill finish in the middle of the night shrugs and yes it was indeed a much needed skill
im really not bothered one way or the other so im not going to support it

changing the formula for time to warp so that the new agility of ships results in prepatch warp times makes the most sense to mecurrently pvp is much too consensual
lol yes i support this 1 utility 1 med small buff to cap and cpu even with all of this the cyclone aint going to beat a brutix but it will be more able to hold its ownperhaps for another thread but yes the ferox got its buff some time ago and the brutix is still a viable choice but both the prophecy and cyclone suck tbh
agreed i little minmatar love would be nice
this has been swept under the rug and forgotten no investigation not one involved person has been contacted except to ask for my vote you know who i am ingame contact me for a copy of the database ccp has already said it isnt an exploit follow a few and you will know then talk to me ill show you how to see their cheats and where
i dont think this is that bad an idea if u post this in another thread i will support it as long as the timer is equal to the time it takez to get a war dec going the 24 hours for the vote and 24 hours for the war dec to take effect for a 48 hour total waiting period also any shooty shooty be the corp wishing to escape the war dec would cancel the peace drive another way for spiez to be effective i think the corp wishing to avoid war should have to pay iskiez also and go through the same hassle as a vote and declare peace and all that i think the devz would need to play around with it a bit and i dont think alliances should be able to use it just small corps
that just flat iz not true yes my corpm8s supported me here i would think that if you discussed an issue with your corp and then posted it here they would support you too
i totally support this idea

do you really think that trit prices going up have anything to do with shuttles do you know there is a new ship called orca and that people started to pile up massive ammounts of trit as soon as it was announced that the orca is coming since you always need a  load of trit to build anything bigthe second part nerfing the refine rates is obvious troll so i wont bother commenting it at allas for the topic i fully support the ops idea my ship progression was retriever  hulk and i still cant see why would someone bother with covetor in between
this has been discussed many times before in other forums and yet ccp has never changed itit should be changedi think they only reason they havent changed it yet is that they wereare trying to hamper macroers
supportedi have 3 characters currently in hulks and this has always really bothered me

completely unnecessary if you want to warp and cloak before some big bad pirate gets you make your safe spot near a celestial
this is just a way to ease things when working with bookmarks and i say only because right now you can more or less do it all the same its just a pain in the ass you have to keep the overview and opened bookmarks folder somewhat sincronized overview for align bookmarks for jumpthe result in combat is the same those ratters with a brain and a cloak are probably aligned and the mouse cursor over their ships warp button everywhere right now they will jump the same hide the same
because they cant already align to a celestial warp as soon as you enter sys and cloak on landing amiritesigned for me
i agree with many of the negative responses i see what its trying to address but im not sure theres really any need to introduce any new mechanic personally i think im rubbish at solo pvp and mostly its because i make stupid mistakes or forget to do stuff like overload my tank until after its too late to have made a difference i like this in some ways its the factor of skill or training or whatever that seperates a good player from just a player with a bajillion skillpoints and a wallet to matchwhilst im not advocating people pressing ctrlf1  ctrlf5 each time they jump to a new system just for the sake of pressing more buttons i think that taking some of the brain power out of decisions like is my ship ready for combat would be dumbing down the game to a certain extent the warp engine doesnt run when youre not in warp so i dont see why tanksensorpropulsion mods should permarun when youre not using themand  for perma cloaking hell no people will afk their blockade runner for 35 jumps and then stay cloaked for 4 hours until they get back from the pub or the ball game or whatever that really would be rewarding lazinessso sanswalloftext not signed

what is the worst part about eve really i quite like the pvp system even the pve isnt that bad although it could definitely be improved to be on par with the competition but thats for another day by far i feel that the single worst part about eve can be broken down into a single word time it takes time to do anything a lot of it for example lets say im a regular player i dont really like to pay 00 prices for things or maybe my market is undeveloped and im not able to even get the modules or ships that i want i decide to buy my ships from the nearest and cheapest market hub  jita buying a ship and fittings in jita can take 10 to 15 minutes or longer depending on lag even if you already know exactly what you want and are willing to pay the price then you fly 2530 jumps to your jumpbridge which depending on your ship can take half an hour or longer you get on the jump bridge which itself took hours to purchase anchor fuel haul and fit out the system has multiple other deathstars to prevent sovereignty from being lost  all of which also took many many hours just to setup and hours more to keep fueled you load up your liquid ozone which was tediously mined from ice for hours on end most likely by isk farming macros you take 4 to 5 bridges to get your home system by which time youve probably passed through systems protected by 20 or more deathstarsyou get to your home system with a nice little t2fitted sniping megathron you go on the op and after an hour or two of waiting you have a 20 minute battle where your side is victorious you feel good about it even though you lost your megathron you cant wait for the next battle  but first you need a new shipsee the problem here every single fun thing in this game is founded on hours upon hours of tedious work no one enjoys anchoring poses no one enjoys fueling them moving 30 jumps in a battleship is not fun yet they spend hours doing it as a second job so that others can have fun you literally might spend 3 to 4 hours of just moving your little ship around so you can have 20 minutes of fun a good game designer might look at this situation and say hmmm how can we decrease the amount of time doing tedious things that arent fun and replace them with more 20 minute battlesnow i know that ccp might be thinking this is intentional yes you intended for some parts to not be fun as a balancing tool if it takes a really long time to fuel and anchor poses it will decrease the potential for a small group of players to dominate vast amounts of 00 space but i would argue that this paradigm is fundamentally flawed  surely there must be a way of balancing things that doesnt require certain players to burn themselves out doing logistics work as a matter of fact there is its called isk  its already established limited enough to prevent takeovers and definitely would not be hurt by making it far more central to the game than it already is now given that this game takes place in a highly advanced future where we have rogue ais that control vast amounts of territory you might think that more of the world might be automated and thats exactly where i think the game should be going i therefore propose the following changes to the game so that every player can spend more time playing games for fun and less time doing it as a job im not committed to every proposal on this list  its just the direction id like to see the game go in
1 replace fuel with rent payable from the pos and completely automated on a weekly basis no phtsical object is required  set and forget revamp ice mining or remove it entirely revamp moon mining so that the pos empties itself to the nearest station with automated haulers moving at a schedule determined by the owner2 revamp the market interface to be more user friendly implement the interbus allow players to order with a shopping list instead of going through each module one by one3 encourage market hubs in 00 by allowing unlimited production slot expansions on outposts at an affordable price this would also make 00 less uniform and more interesting casual players need no longer worry about having to move six jumps away to get a script4 automated mining in 00 and lowsec by drones can be scheduled to only mine at certain times and are freely destroyable without penalty the player does not have to be in system or in space but if you neglect your drones you will find that they may be destroyed by competitors this creates new opportunities for conflict between corporations warring for control of resources while preserving the playstyle of pirates and dudes who just like to hang out and mine in highsec allows players to be more of a manager and less of an isk farmer instead of hiding from pirates players now get to grab their favorite cruiser and defend their belt operations the player may also purchase defender drones to destroy npc pirates  although destroying them in such a way does not grant you the bounty and concord regulations prevent ais from being able to attack pod pilots due to fears of another rogue drone outbreak5 replace strontium with simply being allowed to set when a pos comes out of reinforced allow poses configured in a certain way to have its timer set by members of other corporations in the alliance6 revamp the sov system and move it away from requiring long seiges this is already on the csm list but whatever proposal they make to ccps dev team should be made with the idea that it ought to be less timeintensivediscuss
ack make the galaxy small easy and remove depth i dont support the conceptmotivation behind these suggestions
yes the universe is smaller and easier i think thats a good thingi dont see how it removes depth unless your idea of depth is spend hours upon hours watching modules anchor so you can anchor a new one if anything the new dimensions and game mechanics it adds actually enhances the games depth
sure make eccm also give a limited protection against neutnos effects or webbing
i have proposed this several times beforei believe that 25 boost to eccm mods across the board would be a good change it by no means would make eccm users invulnerable to jammers and it by no means make dedicated ecm ships useless as people fitting those mods are gimping their setups
originally t2 was intended to be vastly superior to the standard t1 items meta 1 to 4 with only faction variants providing superior performance for lower fitting requirementsnowadays t2 is par average when compared to meta4 and on some modules ex reinforced armor plates t2 is just pointless t2 passive targeters what a joke t2 scanners cargo fitting ore equally pointlessthey do need to reexamine meta4 items against t2 and improve the t2 performance to be in accord with the extra fitting requirements this goes quadrupally so for faction ammos little of which has any meta level at all except missiles
the reason it costs less is because t2 is an inferior product that few people want i dont see a problem giving the t2 module some sort of benifit over its meta4 counterpart for its higher cpugrid requirements yea its true of a huge number of modules but that doesnt mean it cant be fixed there too and is not a valid excuse to not change this module
ah this is not the first thread asking for this so i guess this one will be similarly ignored

currently if you go to lowsec unless you are at a gate or station you have no securityi propose a concord faction navy it is similar in dps as the guns at the gates or stations however people in the belts or in missions then get additional security nothing powerful but still it is a little security rather then nothing the same time high sec criminals will be attacked by an appropriate concord faction navy
uh thats the point of low sec low to zip security if at allwhat your proposing changes that dynamici suggest you learn to play the game and deal with the hazards of low sec
jump into a system where you have 10 standings while you have 10 concord standing and the sentry guns will fire on you if youre too slow to warp gate security ships faction police vessels will engage you customs will not unless youre carrying contrabandno concord will spawn and if concord vessels are on the gate they will ignore you ive warped shuttles into concord blobs left behind after suicide ganks just to see what happens if i do it away from sentries such as at a planet the concord ships blithely ignore me
the op has a pointi think we should get rid of concord altogether use faction standings instead of security status use faction police for the work concord does nowedited for support
suportedwhit the upcoming local removaloh yeah it will happen u have no way to actualy see if a cloker is in sitem or notthat will make clokers way to uberoh and yeah i do prefer recons over many ships already 
why exactly
many proposals have been put forward concerning afk cloakers over the years and years and years that theyve been in the gameimononcov ops reduces sig radius of the ship by 8090 but its still visible in space if the pilot pans their camera around consider that at 50km even a bs is darn darn difficult to spot by the viewing field alonecov ops should be decloakable by a device sov system anchored structure but the module does not deactivate this will require an active pilot at the helm to refresh their cloaking module other than becoming visible no other change occurs to limit macros from reinitiating the cloakwhile any cloak is active all capacitor and shield regeneration shuts down and the directional scanner ceases to function
because it increases the costs of all actions via a risk increase it magnifies the power of cloaking devices as it increases the information difference that is created through their usethe risk increase specifically is bad because it encourages less risky behavior this manifests in three ways1 using cloaking alts to monitor in gates2 simply being in space less3 blobbingneither of these are good for a pvp game since that aspect of the game relies on people being in space and not always being in a superblob on the surface it might seem that players will have an easier time finding fights since they are more likely to land next to each other but that is if you assume that people will not change their behavior when risk is increased and they will in reality it means that whenever youre hunting you have to be constantly using the scan button since you have no way of knowing if a superior force is around or if targets are around as well you have to be entirely wary of cloaked gate campscloaks will turn a single inty on a gate into a possible 100 bs  with no way of you to know until they decloak and their dictor decloak fry you and to top it all off there will be less ratters and producers scattered in the areas where you can huntinformation is a key component of any pvp game and eve does a pretty decent job of balancing between no informationlots of risk and perfect informationno risk no information is bad because the risk stops people from doing things perfect information is bad because you will always know whether or not theyre going to win and how much it will cost them and as such no fights happen because no one is willing to fight eve has neither of these situations but if you remove local youre pushing eve towards the first and it would have disastrous consequences for the gametldr  everyone loses
in my opinion we have a problemcurrently people will fight outside stations such as amarrs main station neutrals can rush toward the combatants in the hopes of grabing lewt with little to no risk while essentially making it so the combatants cant grab the lewti propose a change to make it more like the eve online we love1 make it so the wrecks lewt is owned by both combatants2 theft makes you blink to everyone in the system not just the owners
no what did you expect to happen if you decide to fight outside of a station with a crowdsame principle applies in real lifeoh and theres plenty of risk the guy who goes blinky blinky to the original owner of the shipif you wana get picky about zero risk the guy salvaging the wreck left behind gets literally no risk at allworks as intendedstop crowding stations and camping them things are a little different at that point
it wont hamper 10k legitimate pilots one whit theyll move to their player corp and continue unaffected forever afterward they might recieve one declaration in a year if theyve got something to bother huntingmacros make themselves painfully obvious and a war declaration system is the only legitimate way to counter them unfortunately there is no way to affect them in completely untouchable except by massive suicide squads npc corpsand i dont do empire wars in 00 i can pop them as freely as i wish and do without ever worrying why because theyre in player corps but theyre still botting if theyre in npc corps theyre meat in 00 anywayyou overinflate the importance and risk of wars as a wahhhh cry me a river defense when in fact few empire corps are ever declared against unless they bring it on themselves by irritating someone theft smacktalk obvious macro behavior market underpricing ect

evilphoenix agreed new tagging system is a good solution
and you think you have problems 
suported
since i am not a dictor pilot i had no idea about this but you are right this is such a simple thing that it should be included it surprises me that ccp overlooked it in the first place
the galaxy as a whole isnt too crowded certain systems jita and surrounding areas and some mission and trade hubs are too crowded and then on the other hand vast swathes of lowsec and 00 are deserted
that would be the sig that i cant seeissler

as those who have paid attention might know we are in iceland at the moment discussing stuff with ccp today we had a long session dedicated to the pos exploit and although the nda does not allow me to tell you what we learned my personal impression was positive ccp has been very cooperative seemed to be answering our questions honestly and was open to discussion on the topic

eh why the hell not and make containers viewable from assets while youre at it
i support iti have bought toons off forums and as a result i am stuck with some ed names hell i created an alt with a ed name and have actually trained her up to be a decent pilot for corp security issues have the former name associated and viewable with the limited api since any corporation serious about security will ask appliacnts for this anyhow why the hell not set a fee to it same as changing your picture
lets say you are trying to find a war target called l33tzt00big but he has changed his name to c4ntfindm3 in an attempt to evade youwhen you type l33tzt00big into your search it should come up with c4ntfindm3s page with a tab showing his previous identities his corp history etc would remain entirely unchanged you track him easily and shoot him in the faceif its done like this then i definitely support it t
if you cared about your character name you wouldnt give your character such a stupid name that you would want to change it neither would you buy characters with silly namesno support from me
thank you for your replynow why wont you support it i think every argument against has been thoroughly debunked the exact implementation is up to ccp character name history or whatever which as a csm you would have a say in
proposal character name changethanks
if ccp was to implement this this would cure a lot of pos issues it would be possible to dock in pos game loads normal station enviroment would facilitate easier lab interfacing ie same as station and your alliance mates could dock and use labs assemblyarrays etcall using code already in game and when walking in stations arrives it could load the new station enviroment just as easywalking thru pos now thats a plus

i think the answer here is in the names and when we look carefully we will see past the desire to make every ship the bestobviously they cant all be the bestnot so obvious to some interceptor a vessel designed to be fast as possible to intercept and destroy attackers bomber a vessel designed to deliver payload to target hopefully without being interceptedso this is always going to be a game of cat and mousenot cat and cat or mouse and mousei have seen the stealth bomber and the interceptor at work and both are very nasty i really fail to see any problem here except that you want to dogfight in a bomberpersonally id want to use it to ambush large slow targets fitted for close range and make a hell of a mess of them
stealth bombers are completely gimp they are seldom fieldedthey do very little damage and the alpha isnt substantial enough to have an impactit would be great to see bombs forcing people to use an ab instead of an mwd i think some simple number changing would achieve this as well as the grenade like behaviour that should be incorporated

supporting this issue despite the fact that the data i have does not corroborate examples follow all unfitted setupscrow vs crowskilled 21s alignment 2s lock timeunskilled 3s alignment 25s lock timezealot vs zealotskilled 52s alignment 41s lock timeunskilled 77s alignment 51s lock timeastarte vs astarteskilled 78s alignment 39s lock timeunskilled 116s alignment 49s lock timetyphoon vs typhoonskilled 10s alignment 67s lock timeunskilled 148s alignment 83s lock timethe main reason im supporting this is that the issue of latency means that lock times of under 2 seconds are wasteful as mod activation wont realistically take place at this level this means that the fastest unfitted setup should really be aligning at around 3 seconds and that sensor resolutions should probably be boosted marginally to allow easier lockingits a very very fine line though overdo it and itll be dreadfuledit to check the supported box
indeed latency is best seen when running two accounts at the same gate a ship can decloak on one client yet still remain invisible on the other yes i know having two accounts on the same gate would do nothing to improve latency but it illustrates easily that it is there and to what degreethis inconjuction with the overview polling once a second the latency involved in activating a module like a warp disruptor after locking im sure most people are familiar with target up on screen scram flashing waiting for it to hook then the target warps away means that a typhoon vs typhoon with a 33second window of opportunity has a good chance of getting away unless hes a newer player in which case improved agility isnt helping him  just making him more likely to lose a shipi do hope this issue is taken seriously by the csm especially by those who arent heavy pvpers themselves but appreciate the necessity for unconsensual pvp in the gamecaptain thunk
should it be put into another thread yeah the ferox got buffed but it still sucks the brutix has its uses but is still fairly terrible compared to the tier 2 bcs the proper fix for the cyclone would be to fix tier 1 bcs rather than just the individual ships one at a time
why not its not like they gain anything of real value and it was somewhat ammusing
can only support this 
hehehe i asked this exact same question at the 2007 fanfest dev panelthey said that it would cause way to much lag to calculate all these damages and locations of shipsaltough it would be cool if youre in a frigate or other small ship and a titan next to you explodes that you go up in the blast with the titan would be ing cool

meh not a bad idea lets send it back to the top with an approval
there is an issue that exists where if a player scans down a mission and steals the item that is required to get to complete the mission the mission runner can open a petition to have his mission reset because he does not want to pay the other player to get the item back and does not want to let natural game mechanics to take their courseas per this postthis is an exploit that must be fixed as it gives mission runners the ability to rerun the mission and does not give them the risk of failing the mission itself of course they always have the ability to check the local market and buy the mission critical item however this gm sanctioned exploit should not be permittedconsider it this way a mission runner doesnt want to engage a player whos stolen their mission item thats fine they dont have to they arent being forced to either the mission runner has the ability to fail the mission by closing it thus losing standings or wait until after downtime so that the mission resets itselfa gm should not interfere with the natural gameplay of mission running even if someone enters a mission for the purpose of stealing the mission item what would happen if the player stole the mission item a second time would the gm restart the mission again would the player get warned for griefing even though its been documented that this isnt an offensethe options they have available are simple  shoot the thief buy the item failclose the mission or wait until after downtimei would like to see this problem fixed so that all gms are aware that they cannot reset the mission if the mission runner has had their item stolen by an opportunistic player
i support everything i have to say usually
agreed  this is a game of risk and lessons the natural course of game mechanics should be left alone in these cases
actually gms should do what ever ccp wants to allow them to including blowing up players for random laughs if they see fitrules are so boring
if someone steals a mission item from you they are flagged and you should have the means to take it backsupporting the idea already
having thought about it i keep comming back to several things we just do not have the information on and are most likly not going to get1 was probing ever intended to allow a person to to use it in this way or is it yet again another of ccp doing thier britny spears oops we did it again2 the rules that gms are to follow regarding mission resets are never going to hit this forum and this topic to confirm or deny anything a serious spanking would follow if they did i did however find several sections of the eula code of conduct and rules that and ill admit it does not say anything exactly about this specific topic could cover this as an exploitso while i do admit there is nothing written in stone tablets passed down from yon high ccp mountain top that covers this specifcly the wording can and is general enough that i believe it does
perhaps i should have posted thiscare to reconsider
more whines incoming
as you know i can not post anything from a petition that a gm has talked to me aboutthat said i do believe there is some sort of miscomunication going on between gms and whatrules covering this situation are to be followedif this is something that ccp is going to sanctionand give its blessings too then they had betterfollow it to its logical end newbies being scammedplayers ability to advance in the game being held hostage by older players with more skills you and your corp may not consider newbies worth the effort but rest assured someone is going to do it for kicksand jollies and isnt that a nice message to sendto prospective new paying customerscripes givem a chance and at least kissem and use a little lube go slow before you ram it home that eve sould be named eveil
this line from ccpplayers always makes me smile compared to wow maybe but any game that lets you convert  into isk to replace loses isnt harsh at all
mission runner can open a petition to have his mission reset because he does not want to pay the other player to get the item backsounds like a valid point to me ccp could monitor the data base to track downthose lazy and risk free farmers abusing the petition system
you might have also mentioned that the quote was from over a year ago posted  20080201 213000  17 it is perfectly within the rules of the game for someone to enter your mission area and steal the lootsalvage from the mission npcs if they happen to also steal the mission specific loot again this is within the rules of the game it is a harsh circumstance but it is allowed eve is a harsh place and there are often things that happen to you that are not perceived as being entirely fairthey may have changed the rules might have decided to give it a update heck a lunar eclipse could have caused a change of heart who knows
shoot the thief how about no most of the mission objective objects do not have a possession so the moment you take it if they shoot you they get concordokkenbuy the item they can put the price  10000000000000 iskfail the mission hardly an option at allafter downtime also doesnt work the mission would be marked as objective complete meaning it doesnt respawnso basically the options are fail or pay up whatever they demandsorry but this is far from optional seed all mission objectives on the marketorremove all mission objective itemsorkeep it how it is gm resetting the missions
i thought stealing mission critical items are considered an exploit under ccps current terms
actually it was harassment as you pretty much have to be harassing the person to be taking garbage militants or something they only serve a value if you get the mission owner to pay up which rarely if ever happensccp decided to reset missions instead of punish those players for harassment
back up your posts with a ccp link or kindly stop posting as it is ive provided the latest information i have and what youre posting is pure conjecturethats the nice way of saying proof or youknowwhatsnext
dumb exploit supported
lolat best its the gm who is committing the exploit what an absurd concept
snipas far as i know this is incorrect someone once told me i could petition it so i did and it was denied if it should not have been denied i want my faction standings back
lol
a relatively easy fix would be to make all mission specific items owned by the runner this may not elimiate all mission required item theft but it does give the thief a flag even for items that drop into its own container and are unowned within the current mechanic eliminating the potential concord responsenow to the meat of the overall argument is the thief really wanting to grief or just make a profit off of the runner if the thief is griefing then there really isnt much recourse for the runner save trying to get the mission specific items off of the market if the thief is trying to make a bit more isk then that thief should probably offer a reasonable ransom for the mission items say approximately what the mission bonus is worth on average a player may begrudingly be willing to pay up to a mil for those items if the mission is a lvl4 but if you set a ransom price of say 20mil for it the runner will most likely just write it off and take the standings hiti believe the theft of mission specific items is just plain vile behavior since the items in question truly have very limited value however i can see the draw for some to use this tactic for some easy isk
i appreciate the amount of conversation in this post one way or the other but i would like to call everybody back to the fact that a gm has provided the official ruling and other gms are not managing the responsibility as expected please make sure you check the supported checkbox so that the gms know that were watching and keeping them in lineif not the next gm exploit could be against you
that exists today if im not mistaken i believe that when the player takes the mission item he is immediately flagged i dont run missions  never will  so if im incorrect please let me know

i have to agree with the hungarian there what you describe sounds very close to a small pos i really see no benefits to this at all deep 00 is a venture m8 gain standings with the alliances that hold the systems you wish to explore and utilize their outposts
im supporting this as it is a good idea however this type of baseoutpost would probably be more suited as a pos module in an overall pos rework that we really need player owned stations are at this moment rather ugly and lend towards the poor classic graphics from 2003 it really wouldnt be much work for artists to create new modules
i like this idea specifically because it provides an option to the small independent groups to venture through 00 without begging permission from the alliances soveriengty does not equal omnipotence power to the independents
have to admit jamming is awsome as it renders for 20 or more sec a highsp char into a noob for that period of timenothing feels betterworse than thatproblem is not every falcon by itself but the hordes of chars extra trained to jam the living  out of peoplenothing against boosting eccmbut make it chance based just like jamming
falcons are far too strong every fight nowadays needs falcon support i have seen 40 mill skill point players perma jammed by a new falcon pilot despite the fact that their dominix was dedicated to fortifing its own sensor strength this shouldnt be possibledont forget that with a falcon its not just that they are certain to jam you its that they can jam you and your entire gang simultaneously too thats the most ridiculous
eccm needs to be stronger on smaller ships id suggest changing it to a flat boost of 30 strength midslot 15 lowslot that way interceptorsfrigates and otherships that are generally fast enough to close the range gap of the falcon can actually have a decent chance of tackling it and killing it without getting jammed easily and falcon warping off

this statement just sums up the amount of n00bs that have infested eve latelyguess whatthe falcon pilot has probably used most of his slots to jam your domi leaving the rest of your gang to scare away the falcon or are you saying the domi was on its own and you just want to whine for another i win module
people who defend current state of the falcon refer to its balance from view of big fleet battles  at least anything more than 8 people or soi would agree that when it comes to big scale fighting the power of falcon is smaller because it has major weaknesses that other people can exploitbut when it comes to small scale combat anything with less than 4 people on 1 side then the falcon becomes extremely powerful its strength  makes its own weaknesses immune to attackanyway we dont need to argue over theoretical advantages and disadvantages of falcon all we need to do is pull statistics from eve database  the falcons are everywhere most people who play multiple accounts have a falcon alt most people who fight against falcon lose their dominance on small scale pvp is evident in the numbers youll find it would be no longer a question of debate but a statement of fact
oh boy you lot have got my blood boiling nowi find it incredible that people and by people i mean armour tankers are crying about having to give up a midslot to fit eccmwhen their still able to mwdscramblecap injectsensor boost and many other things whilst running a tank but shield user continually get it up the assi think ccp should fix that imbalance before they even think about fixing ecmi mean its only been imbalanced for 5 and half years
no this one hasno the falcon would not need to use most of his mid slots to jam me typically one will be sufficient as the rest of my gang would be similarly jammed it would make it difficult to scare anyone away even if eccm were boosted sufficiently to be effective against a falcon then this certainly wouldnt be an i win button the only i win button here is the falcons ecm modules
im not crying about having to give up a single mid slot for eccm a pilot needs to fit his ship according to his opponent what i dont like is the fact that a single falcon can jam 6 gang members who are all fortified with eccm that is far too strong all fights these days have falcon pilots on both sides and the winner is either who jams first or who has the most falcons this is ludicrous
well tbh jamming needs to be hit hard with the nerf bat i fitted a hype with 3 magnetometric backup array ii and 3 eccm  magnetometric ii and on all counts i was jammed by a falcon with one racial of each type tech ii and a multi spec tech ii i managed to lock the falcon for about 2 seconds which tbh just is not right and on the other hand aruzus got hit way to hard with the nerf bat if falcons are not hit hard by the nerf bat reboost the sensor dampners and please this is not about chance i was jammed the coding i would say is at fault
yes and the reason why meta 3 is cheaper than meta 4 is because its an inferior product few people want you propose a buff to that
i appreciate your comments but would like to add that some people are required to move around from place to place house to house and may find dragging an extra peice of equipment inconveniant also it must prove usefull for wow to still have it in the game for instance you may wish to meet someone in game at a certain time or maybe several people throughout the day having multiple alarms will save you buying an expensive clock to ensure you leave on tim it will also be easier than leaving the game to look at the windows calender
lately when i have been seeing corp members replys to peitions they have been getting a ton of copy and pastes nothing showing in our logs and getting their tickets closed when an issue is legitimate and if the bother escalating it it gets fixedwhy is it that you allow such incompetence to work for you in game petition system
wrong place to talk about it
1 you just admitted to rule breaking2 they are cookie cutter out of necessityif you need to respond to the petitions every 30 seconds you end up not wanting to be typing like mad instead you have cookie cutter copypaste jobs
a gm would have to be insane not to copypaste solutions to the common problems the answer is usually the same so why bother typing it fresh every time
currently if youre in missions light drones will mwd just to go 5km ending up in going far to fast and orbitting like mad around rats essentially doing nothingin pvp the drones will do the same if the person is stationary or slow moving if the person is moving fast they go fast fast fast maybe getting 1 volley in then turn off their mwd and then sink back needing to catch up againthey are quite ineffective
a jason edwards thread about a legitimate problem whats next chribba proclaiming his love for plagioclase drone speeds should be designed to match the target instead of just having fast and slow as options

i actually started formulating a response before i realized who you wereyoure the worst troll ive ever seen on this forum 4 topics in 24 hours all 4 of them are halfbaked and borderline insane ideas please go troll some other board instead of clogging this one with utterly insane suggestions

imho with the coming of t3 these lets modify this old unused hull for t2 threads will soon be obsoleteso thumbs down
not a bad idea although i am opposed to it by doing so you are taking away the need for jump freighters not to a very large degree but still to some degree carriers are fleet warfare ships and they need to keep that role if any boost needs to be made it should be that they are able to carry combat ships with cargo holds full of whatever since the holds are small compared to a rigged iteron industrialshaulers should be moderated though
logistics should be made harder not easier
read the sticky at the top the cousel brought up carriers weak logistic abilities to ccp ccps response was yep we know we did that on purpose go get a jump freighter if you want to haul something other than drones
so effectively ccps attitude to carrier pilots is frack you go sit and spin we dont care how about a separate fuel bay for capitals that has a skill that will let you increase that and some way to move fighters into the drone bay from the corp hangar at least a mom has enough space to hold one fighter in its bay to move it over im more looking at space needs for stront and fuel go into a combat area and hit triage it wont last that long especialy for a round trip and forget it if you need to drop gear off to combatants so they can refitdl
this game was much more fun before all this capitol ship crapim against this idea if you want to haul stuff use transports its already all too easy and safe nobody should be this safe this easy
continuing with the idea for planetary raids there should be a base chance for a successful raid on a colony with no military installations of 75 instead of my earlier proposed 10 reduction in raid chance there should only be a 5 reduction per fully staffed military installation with a maximum of 5 military installations effective there should also be a 25 base chance of a tracker being placed on the raiding ship allowing the raider to be visible to all players in the system and to make the raiders ship warpable whether the raid is successful or not each fully staffed military installation max 5 would also increase the chance of a tracker being placed by 5 overall giving the colony a 50 chance of placing a tracker on the raider if there are 5 fully staffed military installations on the colonyso a colony with no military installations would have a 75 chance of being successfully raided and a 25 chance of placing a tracker on the raiders ship 3 fully staffed mil installations change the chances to 60 raid and 40 track and 5 installations fully staffed would give the colony a 50 chance to raid and a 50 chance to track this gives the colony owner some good viability in using the otherwise nonuseful unless invaded colonial marines it also brings some real risk in smallgroup raiding insofar as there is a chance you are gonna be a big target whether or not the raid is sucessfulthis tracking idea can be of great benefit in strategic warfare however raiding parties can be used as cats paws setting off alarms in more remote systems causing groups to divert military resources just before the main strike force hits as with everything in eve there should always be a potential downside

00 is zip security if you want to live in zip security go therelow security isnt low security it is zip security with a pest amount of dps which often times isnt a consideration this has led low sec to being the barren wasteland that it is if ccp wants people to move to low sec such things need to changelearn to play the game sigh i used to live in low sec all the time this was back in the day of nanobsubernos beside hictors i lived in a low sec much more dangerous then low sec nowand i did all this well before you joined eve online
lowsec is lowsec is lowsec lower sector status that means there is no patrol you want highsec security stay in highsecisaac
this could work currently low security is more like no security at all everyone knows it entering lowsec system from hisec one where single ganker can do plenty of nice kills if players get a weaker and smaller version of the concord for example one spawn for all not for every hostile ship spawn capable to tank by tanked cs or bs not mentioning small rr gangs then more ppl will go or at least consider going into lowsec which apparently give more targets to kill by wise groups of pirates and larger ships wont be useless except fleet ops or npc missions like now single concord spawn could make a single hostile to retretat but if he bring two friends then they should be able to kill a concord spawn and the victim even if he is in a bs toolow sec shouldnt be a good place to hunt only for small or bigger groups not for single ship like now its just to easy to kill someone in lowsec ss drop is meh it takes 4 days with good rats in 00 to repair ss from 100 to 195

low security is very low security dont believe me go to rancer and get your ass blown to hellsnip  mitnalyour low sec system called they want there idiot backsnip  mitnalwhat you propose would turn lowsec into a ghetto high secand while i do not like pirates at all i have to side with them in the fact that removing them from the game completely would ruin the gameif your going to post ideas then at least bother to put some thought into it and stop posting like some damned 6 year old who knows nothing of what he speaks ofone of the reasons i dont post ideas is because i take the time to think it out for a few hours and i realize its not likely going to work you have to take into account factors that effect the game in long term not short termand your so short sighted your blind as a damn batgo live in rancer and come back here and tell me you think low sec is too easysnip  mitnal
i can think of a better way to do thismake penalties sentries etc in 04  01 different stagger how dangerous areas are with 01 rightly being the more dangerous rather than simply the furthest from empire

crack open eft open a chimera fit kestral fit and rokh fit fit your medium slots all to cap recharger 2s  1 stasis weboverload the web how long does it last3mins 55 seconds on the kestral4mins 45 seconds on the chimera5mins 10 seconds on the rokhshouldnt the larger ship become the far more large heatsink who is capable of absorbing a larger amount of heat thusly allowing you to overload for longer however why does it overload shorter then a battleship
compare the amount of slots that should probably be the reason cba to check the slots now but if the rokh has more midslots thats your reason
1 less actuallybeside the point im saying that the same module overloaded should be giving x amount of heat while the larger the ship the more heat it can absorbso a stasis web in a chimera can be overloaded for like 10mins
yeah it could lead to something like the privateers of the old times

oh yes real life is so comparable to eve online even then your posit is wrong if there is a fight outside grand central station people get around but they dont steal anything from the newly dead guy if they do the rest of the crowd can attack the thiefoh yes the guy who just lost his ship is in his pod trying to warp away in haste is going to be putting up a fight with such thievessalvaging the wreck not lewting is indeed zero risk which ought to be as it is equivalent to basically going through the trash bins around grand central station nobody is going to have problems with those peopleglobal criminal is moreso a concordokken deal i simply suggest an appropriate allowance for thieves anyone who sees theft go on gets the opportunity to shoot and fire on those thievesor not i have something additional to add too which he doesnt have
yeah you live in some crazy version of eve in which theft isnt personal and involves everyone in the systemif you want a place where everyone shoots everyone go to nullsec thats what its for we dont need to discourage thievery in high sec its one of the few things left to make it interesting
ccp already stated it would open up a can of worms that they did not want to deal with case closedpersonally i find it annoying like everyone else however i find war decing their corp a pretty effective way to get the loot returned or a similar amount of damage inflicted
they may well not be able to do anything about it but the concepts were talking about arent rocket science in the meantime they dumbeddown and arbitary model theyre using for sensors and ewar leads to all sorts of extreme side effects just look at all the crying that was done about dampeners and now falcons its always going to be something when your system is that arbitrary
i agreeif your really worried about salavge then play the game the way it is supposed to be played  multiple playersget a corp mate or other mate to salvage whilst you kill thingsit is a multiple player online game so play it that way and you wont have any issues
i agree with scatimthe system isnt too crowded but the various aspects need to be extended a bit as there is a lot of congestion in various high sec systems and not just the trade hubs im referring to belts herelike introducing mining of the rings of planets etc making belts large enough to surround a planetthese ideas would forceallow players to move about more instead of being stuck in the same 200km area of spaceit does appear that ccp want a giant universe with lots of very tiny dungeon areas where everyone congests they need to think on reworking the processes
i think 00 is too crowded in a way its not crowded with people if you would travel through 00 there would be lots of empty systems but its too crowded with posses and sovclaiming looking at the sovereignity map now almost every system has sov this makes it almost impossible for small alliances etc to establish in 00 but i think what we need isnt more systems but changes in the systems of industry and posses to disallow one alliance to take insane ammount of space
good to know that this is a topic at least i am not so fond of the fact that you are not allowed to discuss the issue tho i would like to know some specifics about what was being created what reactions approx how much of the market was being created this way and if there is a plan to increase legal output to make up the gap certainly this will effect no one i can understand not wanting to name players or corps it is not fair to the honest players in those corps i may have missed something in the 100 page monstrosity the announcement thread has becomebut there have been no real specifics given out my mains corp has put construction on hold for lack of materials and uncertainty of the future of the materials market at least tell us what we are not allowed to know
while we cant discuss the specifics at the moment there is a dev blog on its way which goes a lot more indepth into what we discussed in our pos exploit meeting with ccp and no no names are named
i disagreeskins for the ui would have no effect for macroingwe arent talking about modifiying the game engine or process just the look of screen colors transparency colors etc
ccp and players would never allow half of the improvements youve suggested yes because they can be used as exploitswhat we are referring to is screen displays onlylike moving the shieldsarmourhullcapacity display to the top of the screen or the bottom right change it to light blue instead of white with damage as yellow instead of red allow the slots to be to the left of the shield display instead of the rightall these things would be client specific based upon xml data if file doesnt exist then use default settings etc we are not talking about any sort of data mining for t he ui only skins that other programs have the ability to dosarcasm mode onthere would be no way to macro this oh hang on you could get a macro to auto change colours every two minutes wow what an exploitsarcasm mode off
my point is this developers never intend for their apis or customisation tools to be used for exploits but sometimes they are because someone else finds a security flaw my examples are deliberately overexagerated as i stated in the original post some people beleive that a read only file like an xml file or an image is completely safe because its not executable code the true is that a hacker can sometimes embed certain character sequences or codes or data in the file that can cause the reading program to beheive abnormally or to inject executable code it is a risk maybe not a huge risk but things like this do happensarcasm mode onyoure probably right there is absolutely no history of software or games containing security holes and bugssarcasm mode off
sorry if this idea has already been thought of but i havent seen it so i thought id post itinstead of adding bookmark to the context menu what about adding the bookmarking option to the shortcut keys list it doesnt have to have a key assigned by default but those who want it will use it my idea is to have the default name auto assigned with the bookmark autoincrementing if the same name already existsbenefits very little programming needs to be donedrawbacks name of bookmark cant be changed by default but players would have to go to pp to change the bookmark name but it allows the saving of safespotsideasother benefits drawbacks

even though my alliance uses them a lot i can get behind any improvements to stealth bombers
i support no pay  no train thank you ccp for putting a stop to this no support for the whiners those who threatened to quit over this please do so promptly
your numbers are flawd and clearly setup to support your point of viewyou cannot put a fixd number on how often todd is onwithout any researchlets give another example mine clearly setup in favor of my point of viewjoe who is subscribed sporadicly and franks who is permasubscribedjoes accounts 17940  040  2  14352franks account 17940  100  1  17940therefore franks permanate account yields more money for ccp and less resources on both time and server resources managing multiple accounts90 of statistics are made up on the spot
you need a hobby sorry to be the one to say it
like maybe oh i dont knoweve online
this needs to be a top priority fixthere was no good reason for making it harder to lock someone before theyre able to get away the balance was good as it was and noone was calling for this change the new lock timetime to enter warp balance is particularly painful with frig vs frig situations where latency now very often is the deciding factor this was already a problem before the change but a small enough problem to be acceptable now it no longer isbeing unable to lock someone in time due to lag  and were not talking fleet battle lag here but simply the normal background lag of any even almost empty systems  is incredibly frustrating and undermines the whole pvp experiencelike someone said above the balance were talking about is very delicate and a rebalancing measure could easily be overdone im not asking for any drastic changes or a party favor done to me as a pirate so i can omg kill moar bearz1 but simply like the op says that this balance be restored to its previous valuesv
supported it seems to be getting to where sensor boosted interceptors are mandatory to have along to reliably catch standard platetanked cruisers flown by competent people catching frigates of any sort much less interceptors forget it
if you have the old stat check the mixed race faction ship those on caldari hulls the moa for example were left out when the caldari ship got the agility boost no idea if this time they were boostedthe gila current inertia modifier is 046 againt 038 for a moa the moa has an higher mass but when it is a single race ship caracal vs caracal navy the ship get a mass and inertia modifier boost
i hate to derail my own thread but to be honest the ferox isnt that bad for a tier 1 battle cruiser the only reason that people dont like it is because its a rail boat instead of a missile boatback on topic its not possible for the devs to consider every possible angle in the game that a single nerf might effect and even more impossible for them to forsee how a series of nerfs will cripple a ship until someone raises their hand and points it outthe cyclone is the result of a series of unrelated nerfs that have all culminated in the ship being nearly unfittable and what is possible to squeeze on it isnt worth taking into combat
adding my voice to the call for trasparency
or at least acknowledgement of an overdue issueconspiracy theory or not the fact that ccp have now gone quiet on yet another issue again certainly raises some eyebrows they really dont help themselves in the eyes of at least some if not many  it makes them appear guilty of something themselves
dudeyour sense of humor

still waiting on an answer here why is ccp not dealing with petitions about macro minerswell look into it does not close a petitionweve checked and hes not a macro would be sufficientwe are too busy to ivestigate this would be sufficient3 weeks have gone by and one particular macro is still not banned even though the petition has been closed
yep  i have given up reporting them if its sweatshopworker theres not much one can do its within eula even if it leaves a bad taste but a macro must be banned
thought this was just about macro miners whats your problem with mission runners and ratters
i figure its because they know they are not fooling anybody by not banning large amounts of subscrption income for them so they just ignore them whats insulting is when you see one of them buying 10 60 day gtcs at a time one for xmsjg paksjf jgofhs etchs etc
they are dealing with it just because they choose not to divulge to you the progress of their investigation means bugger all frankly
bump
so we should take for good the word of a 3 month old character that has never done a mission that is possible to get a mission reset through a petition on a regular basis when we all know that the average petition has a reply time of several days or even weekstaht stretch credibility too far for me
ive had a mission reset when an item either didnt spawn or i missed it admittedly a very long time ago so maybe the gms have changed the rules since
i think the second part of that phrase should be kept with the first that guy has 10 standing with the first agent the one you get at the end of the training and no standing with any other agents sure it is possible to get a mission reset when1 you are a very young character and you did some error generated by inexperienceor 2 if the mission failed for some bug that the gm can verifyi think that no gm will reset a mission if the target item was stolen by another player unless it was one of the starting missions done in the school system by new playersbut then harassing new players in the starting systems can be a bannable offence while doing the same thing in all the rest of eve is not a problemedit spelling
ive heard reports of it from a few of our alliance members whereby they were not in starter systems and the missions were immediately respawned so i do believe that it might happen if even sporadically my reason for this vote is to bring to light the possibility that the gms might not have a rulebook per se as much as a go with your gut on this one when it comes to resetting missions hell  you never know if the mission runner hasnt said ive killed everything and the mission item didnt drop to get the gm to intervene in this specific instance it affects more than the runner and thats the reason for my requestqft starter systems have been off limit for a long time now
fully supported  the question is how common is this situation  ive been probed out once in my entire career  failing a mission is no deal to me at allgosh  i cant believe im in support of griefers
first in your op you state that mission are reset like gospel truth without any confirmation from a credible source again a guy that has never run a mission is not a credible sourcesecond this is the second time is see this thread with the same arguments not sure if done by the same player and not interested enough to research it through the forum the same flimsy evidence of some guy saying that some other guye has sad that it seem more a campaign by some people fearing an instancing of missions or some change in the crucial loot mechanism that a real complaint of something happening so someone has ever tried to get a mission reset because someone has stolen the loot it worked some reply by people that actually do missions and dont steal loot and salvage for isk and giggles would be much more credible
thisthumbs up
itt people missing the point regardless of your personal view of whos credible and im beyond reproach tyvm  why do you think im not an npc ninja or not dont you think supporting a fair and just gm exploit resolution rulebook is a good ideaif not feel free to not respond because im leaning towards that chance that you might be trolling my thread
supported  this is a blatant exploit of the petition system by both the players and any gms involved i have done this in the past as a way to get money from mission runners unfortunately one of them shot me losing his ship and another just refused to pay but at least their decision resulted in loss of standings so they had some incentive to pay up i dont appreciate how ccp seem to be constantly making highsec safer
nah judging by some of his posts he just thinks he knows everythingoffical stance no problem here move on out people nothing to seebtw that gms dont have a guide of rules for resetting missions and go with their gut i think thats true of most of the things that happen in this game not just missions
oh and supported if they arent resetting missions then where are the threads of outcry from the mission running community
im sorry gm sanctioned exploit sounds very much like the game rules to me and a bad case of sour grapes on your part
do you think the rules if they exist stateif you find a juicy mission and claim that another player took your mission critical object regardless of whether said item was taken or not  then please feel free to contact a gm to have the mission reset
as jason edwards stated before your options in this instance are really more limited than may appear how else to complete the mission if the person who took the loot is ransoming it beyond your ability to pay and the mission is flagged as completed and thus will not respawn with the next dt
then tough luck  you had the chance to stop the mission item from being taken because the thief got aggro if the thief really wants to screw you over he can do and thats what is great about eve you can always screw him over later on in some way if you really want revengehowever it is very unlikely that any thief would demand an unreasonable ransom for an item that is otherwise worthless they want to make money just as much as you do and theres no point demanding an amount that wont be payed a reasonable amount for the standings for a l4 mission would probably be around 20 mill which is what about an hour of grindingessentially stop crying and learn to negotiate
if stealing the mission critical loot is not an exploit and is harrassment that goes unpunished whats to stop me stealing that loot from good missions with another account and then getting them reset or getting a friend to do it on an alt maybe for your example the objective should not be flagged as complete until you have taken the item back to claim the reward and the mission itself is completed
supported
and your a hella 
i am sure to have already seen and voted a similar suggestion but repetita iuvant
ummm i cant really think why i would want to sort by meta levelbut i would like an easy way to see from assetsall of my shipsall of my t2 itemsstuff in cargo containersi support making assets screen better but this specific change is meh
i support improving inventory management
easily supported
you dont do pve combat do you
supported any improvements to inventory management are very welcome and essentially necessary at this point
i have all of the good meta loot from missions memorized i think most of the mission runners do as well because the missions and loot are exactly the same eg you get x set of drops from guristas and y set of drops from sanshas not all meta 4 loot is worth a damn either take accommodation large reppers for example however an arby hml or a unstable medium neut is cash money sort by type works fine on the assets screen if you are a mission runner you dont anything via the assets screen you drag meta loot into a can and haul it to a trade hub to sell itdo you do pve combat
owned maybe poor old heschel has been stuck in hakeri working the quiet level four agents there so long that he has forgotten players may have systems other than his own for sorting loot very good point vaaland supported just to make life easier
anything to improve asset managementak
in my humble opinion pvp in this game started down a slippery slope back in early 2006 each successive major expansion has added elements to the game which make it more and more difficult to engage in nonconsensual pvp which i consider to be one of the major foundations that this game is predicated upondoes this mean that i believe that no fights are taking place in eve anymore no at all but i do believe that fights are moving more and more towards fleet battles and shoving piracy faction warfare and skirmish warfare asidea few of these suggestions probably could warrant their own thread but i dont want to behave like some people do in this section of the forums and slap every half witted idea i have into a new threadhere we go1 make local chat delayed mode at the same time give the scanner screen a passive always on mode that is chance based linked to signature radius and is system wide when turned on it will constantly scan the entire system it has a chance based ability to notice incoming ships based on their signature radius ie a rifter may not ever be detected while on the other hand a thanatos has zero chance of hiding2 reduce the size of all non 00 chokepoint gates to the size of the original amarr gate3 roll back the agility boost from quantum rise this is a free pass for anything cruiser sized and lower and when coupled with the ginormous new warp gates they are simply invincible4 give haulers and industrials a 99 reduction in cpu cost of warp core stabilizers and make them cost 5000 cpu to fit haulers and industrials dont have the means to defend themselves combat ships do we need more standing and fighting in this game and less running away like sissy girls5 remove warp to zero and replace it with a skill called warp accuracy this skill will reduce how close you can warp to a gate by 2 km per level ie lvl 5 warp accuracy allows you to warp to within 5km instead of 156 raise insurance payout of t2 ships to within a reasonable cost of the hulls 75 would be reasonable and would cause people to reconsider standing and fighting instead of running scared7 remove jump bridges or raise the fuel cost for jump bridges by at least double to discourage using them 100 of the time jump bridges are a free pass from pvp and allow alliances to police way more territory than they have any business holding in the first place ie smashkill had no real business holding all of geminate they simply used jump bridges to police it and when a dedicated alliance came knocking they crumbled in less than a month8 station hugging undocking from a station should automatically place the player 5000m from the station and moving away at full speed if you undock then you should be ready to fight if not then wow is thatta way9 cloaking devices cloaks should all have their cpu raised to 5000 and all ships designed to fit them should have a 99 cpu reduction recons bombers black ops ect10 trial accounts should not be allowed to enter low sec or null sec if you want to scout then pay for your second account ask a friend to scout you or fly something that you can afford to lose11 npc corporations should charge taxes based on skillpoints the more skillpoints you have the more they tax you a 30 million sp char in an npc corp would be paying 50 taxes as an example12 corporations who leave an alliance during a war should still be attackable during the duration of the initial war after the initial period they will not longer be legal targets
wow quite refreshing to see a pvper with enough foresight to actually keep balance in checksome of your ideas however are slightly flawed but far better than a lot of the stuff i keep seeing ill wait and watch for comments before i make my own conclusions
some good some bad many interesting i think 2 6 7 8 and 12 are good 1 3 and 9 are real problems but i think your solutions need work 4 was basically solved with the stab nerf a couple years ago and even more so with the new importance of scrams  if combat ships want to gimp themselves for questionable benefit let them 5 is interesting but ultimately doomed to failure and databasebreaking numbers of instas and 10 and 11 are just dumb i think youre missing the more fundamental problem though  people dont have enough reason to go to areas where nonconsensual pvp happens lowsec sucks and 00 is dominated by gargantuan alliances fix the riskreward for small groups in unsecured space and youll get a lot more action going on even if none of these changes are implemented
i agree the percieved iron grip of the megaalliances and the inability of most small groups to learn to adapt to the threatsgain the rewards of unsecured space is the key
risk reward for 00 is another topic entirelypersonally i find hundreds and hundreds of people in null sec every day the incentives must already be there at least in some small part the only problem is that ccp has handed them a smorgasbord of tricks and tactics with which to avoid pvpshould there be methods to avoid combat yes there should however currently the field is heavily skewed in favor of avoiding combat rather than engaging in it all anyone has to do is refer to my partial list below for some of the most common methods of avoidanceus pvpers on the other hand get this and this two methods to engage in pvp vs 12 to avoid it yeah thats a bit skewed
the rewards are there just they only draw professional 00 survivalists when i think back to a couple years ago it was actually a lot easier to roam free and avoid combateveryone had libraries of instajump bookmarks stabs had no penalites there were no ships that could use warpbubbles what has changed is the environment logisticshauling almost completely avoids the gate systems small runners get caught in interdictor bubbles shopping and travel are just a jumpclone away cynos pop open left and right like fireworks in some areas if youre in with the local poweralliance you basically have a different solar system and different travel network than independent or hostile roamers why bother with the potentially dangerous main roads when you have private and almost 100 secure backstage passes
i was referring as much to lowsec as to 00 and its not another issue at all more people  more fights and you get more people when it sucks less also a simple enumeration of the modules that let you fight vs modules that let you not fight is entirely useless its the equivalent of saying that because there are 24 frigates and only 12 battleships frigates must be twice as good besides you forgot a bunch of them  this this and this off the top of my head
oh  i really like ideas 1 7 and 12
great well thoughtout list neesa i also think you should not be able to jump through a gate if you are warp scrambled maybe thats taking it a bit too far hehe
lets not split hairs you and i both know full well that those are merely variations on a theme i merely gave the two most common variations on that theme
to date ive paid for eve either via a monthly credit card subscriptionfor the first 3 years and arguably the most expensive way to pay here in the uk or via game time codesgtcs were until recently the most cost effective way for people in the uk to pay if wanting to pay on a monthlybimonthly basishowever for us uk players no matter which option we chose we have to pay the additional cost of currency exchange on top of our subscription costsgiven that the uk is is one of the largest national player bases i think second only to the usa if memory serves is it not reasonable to expect that we should have the option of being able to pay ccp directly in our local currencymy request is that the csm raise this issue hopefully with the support of the player base to ccp in the hope that we can ask them to consider providing us the options of direct debit subscription creditdebit cards payments and gtcs in our local currencythanksyouxd andy
not going to get very far with this one chap
there are plenty of fpss out there alreadyno need to dumb down this game we dont need to turn eve into world of spacecraft
negative not supportedyour throwing to much into this single topicyou might want to break down everything your saying in its individual issuesin the beginning of your post you seem to be against the way the entire logistics system works which if your system was implemented pretty much ruins the current market systemhowever there is a solution to what you wantplay on the test serverno having to jump 20 system to get what u wantfights equipment ships fuel are all in 1 system fdj its perfect for what your looking forhowever its rare the population there goes beyond 100 people although it does happen
this is probably one of the few things i agree withto make the market user friendlyeaiser to usebut again i suggest u break up your topic into its individual partsas well perhaps start it out in the features and ideas discussion forum
if you want to play a game where there is little to no effort in fitting out and moving space shippies then go play freelancerdont deprive us of the depth in this game because you dont appreciate ityou chose this game not the other way around adapt to the game or kindly  off
im all for a shopping list  fittingpresetsbut as far as market hubs are concerned this is up to us players jita as a market hub wasnt created by ccp people just used the market which was closest to their agent  mining spot  00 systemim certain that the largest alliance in the game should be able to set up a new market hub if they set their mind to it youre totally right with what parts of eve are boring and time consuming except maybe for mining which does appeal to some players or their wives but not all of your proposed solutions would improve the gamewhat i would love to seealliances creating safe havens in 00 i think the main reason why 70 of eve players are hanging around in highsec empire is because everything is closeby and pretty much safe maybe if alliances could erect pos near gates once they have sovereignity 4 pos that would warpscramble and web you unless youd have the correct password or generally having more control over the space you claim making it secure enough for industrial corporations to operate this could also help in drawing a clearer frontline  anyway my 00 knowledge is very limited edit for clarificationim in favour of 1 alliances taking matters in their hands and use diplomacy  renting contracts  mercenary services to help markets develop in their systems i know that similar efforts have failed in the past2 giving alliances better means to control traffic through their space currently there are either nrds or nbsi policies applied in 00 both systems cant handle 600 traders in one 00 market hub think of jita in 00 the first system would allow an enemy to gather his troops quickly without you noticing it in time the second system would require a huge blue list  and would still open all doors to spies being able to transform a sov 4 system from 00 to 04 or even 05 with a limited npc police force could help  or instead if you could close a stargate in the heart of your space to all reds provided you control all surrounding systems 
if your trying to tell that 1 falcon pilot perma jammed 6 of you and you were all carrying eccmi am going to come out and call you a liara dominix carrying 1 eccm has a magnometric sensor strength of 43im sorry but a falcon is not going to perma jam anybody using 1 jammerand you say there were 5 others in your gang all carrying eccmso in closinggbtwow scrublearn to counter your enemy before crying nerf
fact mate i am not lyingwell they do sorry matei can counter a falcon i use another falcon thats why this is so silly it is obvious to me who is crying here
erm no that was fitted to one ship my hype and you can really tell when somone gets very aggresive about a subject and very defensive that deep down in there little soul they them selves know by the god of chance that the falcon is a win mode do all recons give you this advantage no they dont read what ive put and think about dont ramble think before you speak my mum taught me look at the whole picture every battle scence you can think of its not hard to work out what needs to be done
lets keep this constructive guys how can the eccm work script or skill enhancement or whatever so you stand a chance without nerfing the falcon to hell and back
well looking at the counter for damps  tracking disruptors you actually benefit from just fitting those modules you gain something from it even if you are not dampenedtracking disruptedso while my sensor booster also gives me faster locking or more locking range and my tracking comps  enhancer give me better tracking and range eccm gives you a few more  of not being jammed with one racial jammerwhile this sounds good versus only 1 falcon  or jamming boat  it actually becomes worthless looking at the number of falcons aroundeccm gives you moar sensor strength meaning the falcon doesnt need 1 racial to jam but 2 or a mix of different racials or a racial and a multi or another of them 20 falcons in your gangin the same time there are no signaldistortionamplifierlikemodules for damps tracking disrupts whatever ewar if im not mistaken
several people in this thread have already pointed out that the countermeasures for both dampeners and tracking disruptors are useful all the time while eccm is merely a paperweight until someone jams youi think that two things need to be done to eccm to make it more useful1 raise the percentage of sensor strength bonus that one eccm module gives you the best named and t2 modules should both give somewhere in the neighborhood of 120 boost instead of 962 eccm modules should significantly lower your signature radius it makes complete sense that a module that is distorting your profile on someones sensors would also lower your signature radius by a percentage say 10with the increased significance of signature radius in modern eve combat this would be an all around useful module
you do realize you have to put on the right races eccm right and that perma is short for permanent not once every three cycles rightnow that is an interesting proposal makes sense in terms of flavour and would make the module better for generic combat
i personaly share many peoples fears of modular ship design while i have and i must stress this never ever been dissapointed with ccps nerfs changes alleged gimping etc and i regard them like many of us do ascompetent imaginative and visionary geniuses i do have to express some fears how for instance does ccp propose to explain the tech 3 technology why if pilots discover technology such as this would they not be able to apply it to older ship models if new technologies discovered would it no completely surpass old technology how many carriges do you see today i worry not for the actual gameplay itself but for the integrity of the story the continued validity of eve online that makes it so immersive that seperates it from the mainstay of other games please ccp pay close attention to that aspect of your new expansion pack make it as completely enthralling as the others and dont let the spirit of eve be dilluted
that works well when you read the problem and understand the answer that relates to it ive seen some that are utterly ridiculous unhelpful and also prove what was sent was not fully read or understood
hey sshole the word is spelled incompetent stop wasting everyones time
well if you girls would stop spamming petitions maybe the gms would have the time to stop and read them on occasion
if the game was more stable and had less bugs theyd get fewer petitions
hey tard stop being such a complete and utter face and contribute something meaningful to the discussion to the op whilst pro forma responses are disheartening they are a sad necessity in the light of an insanely high workload
can anyone tell me how to appeal a petitionthank you

hi there everyone csm includedi would like to ask all of you to join me in trying to collect some ideas with small ccp demand and huge impact on game featuresi am particularly focused on metagame roleplay options player created content and events and market economic issuesthe challenge is to word a short and extremely simple idea that has extremely wide consequences and potential for creating content i would hope we could end up with a top five or ten list of these and have the csm present it to ccp dev crewkindest regardscaleb
i might as well throw the first one theni find the issue of static prices of npc facilities and station etc a reducing gamefactorwhy not go all out and get eve totally supply and demand player controlledput up npc stations for rent thus making all its functions pricewise controlled by playerswith a few simple features the exploit griefing of this would be avoidableall stations leased run for max 6 months bids on leasing the next period makes it almost impossible to hog a station bids should be held in escrow so no abuse is possible this would seriously make things aggresive financiallysince pos dont show in ingame info lets not claim that pos have any of the same trafic potential even though i admit it would be even more awesome if pos would take over every aspect of the game in timeas far as i know the management options on npc stations are already in there for gmccp to operate if i am not mistaken that is
why not just let caps jump into jita oh the insanity here comes bob with the months haul from all their little pets 50 caps jump in fully loaded with mins and lootz from all the ratting and complex running and moon minin etc etc nc hot on the button has scouts in jita watching for just such an occurence and has war decced all the bob pets and of course bob oh my jita fills with explosions nuet haulers scurry from stations grabbing everything they can oh the humanity i cant stand it let caps jump into jita now i just think it would be tooooo funny
is there a way to ban someone from the assembly hall after posting several ridiculously bad ideas in a row and pushing all the good ideas to the second page
yeah
i agree with this post
anything that will make this game more closely resemble tradewars 2002 lol
im sure ccp has a list for the gms just let us have a lok at it too
im all up in your blog atm
i am also cyber stalking ozzie
i just did here and afterwards saw this threadi suppose the best place to propose the idea if it hasnt been done already would be in the eve technology and research center section of the forumsthe idea if pursued would likely set eve quite a bit apart from other major mmosedit consider it done i hope it isnt a dupe
please support this topic
your avatar represents you in eve online the fact that you will no doubt change while playing eve implicits that you should be able to mirror that change unto your avatar i see no reason not to let this happen other than possible technical issues seeing as scamming and criminal activity is perfectly legal within the bounds of eve changing your name to get away could be seen as nothing more than a small addition to the gameplay features
i mustve missed the warning message when i started that said dont choose a name that starts with an a as fleet overviews are generally sorted by alphabet and you will be targeted first every time
no no no no nonot what this does this is like saying that jaspet is an incentive to go to lowsec so you can mine zydrine jaspet is worthless so its no incentive what you want is a way that provides all ores evey where but provides higher yields in lowsec  00 so that it ensures that lowsec  00 is always more valuable what you have at the moment is that veldspar rules all aside from abc ores what you want to do is have it so that even in 00 mining veldspar will make you more isk so that the devaluing highends dont make it so that one day highsec is more valuable than 00 or at least asvaluable sans risk which while unlikely is possible with the current mechanics it already has happened to lowsec this is unacceptable in my mind we need lowsec to be twice as good by value to mine in in order to lure i mean encourage people to go to lowsecthe fact that all ores would be available in highsec means nothing if their yield is pathetic it would mean that no matter what mineral you wanted lowsec and 00 would always be better it is ridiculously broken that there is no more valuable ore in lowsec than highsec at the moment back when i started playing lowsec was 2x more valuable this made it somewhat worth taking a risk any less than this and i think it wont work as an encouragement give highsec 10 yield crokite give 00 1000 yield veldspar   note actual details can be worked out by someone putting real thought into it im just saying what the goals should be with a move to making everything player run and giving the incentive to move to lowsec  00if youll wake up youll see that the rare ores are not as rare as they should be the drone regions have ensured that this isnt going to be the case and that the mineral basket is not able to be adjusted by miners without changes stop thinking about rare ores and start thinking about valuable ores because this was the original goal of moving the high end ores to 00 to make 00 valuable this is what is needed because the current system is broken where even much of 00 is only as valuable as highsec this is somewhat on the right track with density etc but im not limiting my support to something this specific the base concepts i support are lowsec immovably more valuable than highsec by at least 2x impossible for players to change this 00 more valuable again even the not so good 00 distribution so that mining as an activity causes the stability of mineral prices not as a whole but in relation to each other so that as a particular mineral gets over valued people have an ore to move to that will help correct that this will mean that loot  droning will not have the effect it is currently having in terms of mineral values only in terms of quantity for low ends this should also solve the transport issue as such things can be mined locally for high ends you could still have some regional variationi remember zydrine being added to jaspet and the multiple tweaks to drone loot taking place to try and restore the broken imbalance in mineral prices this is what happens when the mechanic is not there for players to do it themselves mining should be this mechanic
hi please read the two lines following the one you quotedthis means that mining in lower sec would get you more isk every time guaranteed currently the system does not do this even though you only get zydrine starting at jaspet in lowsec the ore is worse this literally makes the ore betteri personally think it should be actually higher density ore i dont think that mining more m3minute is a solution as it would mean more hauling as well i want the ore in 00lowsec to literally be better sure arknor in high sec but 110th yield on the other hand 10x yield veldspar in 00 etcthis means that the system can not be broken by players like it has today lowsec will always be better than highsec and 00 better than lowsec i think giving very low yield highend ores to highsec in exchange for very high yield lowends to 00 does work
if you guys seriously think that having a higher abundance of veldspar in low sec and null sec will suddenly make all the industrialists think to themselves oh wow now its totally worth it to risk my hulk faction mining modules and expensive mining implants to brave the hordes and hordes of pirates and pvpers then you are simply ignorantno amount of incentive in the game is worth the loss in productivity of having to warp out of your mining belt dozens of times per day whenever a neutral enters system or losing a few expensive shipsfirst something needs to be done to make industrial ships more survivable theyre huge slow as agile as a sloth in a jar of syrup and have no means to defend themselves when caught so why would any sane person leave empire with them when empire is at least profitable without interruptionshort of seeding t2 fracking bpos in the asteroids themselves there will never be enough incentive to leave empire unless a more creative way is devised to make low and null sec industry less risky
cant you have your corp secure the system if youre in a corp that uses nothing but mining lasers you stay in highsecor pay somebody elses corp for security but if youre in a balanced corp get the pvpers to run some gatecamps while the rock jockeys mine the fancy ores if theres money to be made somebody will make it  not everybody is as riskaverse as you are
but its not purely a case of being risk adversein many cases the corps out there simply have no interest in mining or in miners they want combat pilots who can both rat to pay the rent to whichever feudal overlord they owe their corner of 00 to in the first place and fly fleet ops to defend the space they are rentingand because of those two commitments they sure as hell do not want to waste their valuable ratting time or pvp time on less productive things like protecting miners a very big chunk of the economic model of 00 has become so addicted to ratting bounties that other than pos networks for moon miningt2 production chains its a cash economycash economies buy the majority of the manufactured goods they need  so they are at the mercy of high commodity prices affecting the cost of the manufactured goods they are importing from empiregee sounds like the real world doesnt it you want to see trit prices go down then corps and alliances in 00 need to spend more of their time developing their own industrial infrastructure instead of btching about the high price of trit coming out of empiresure that means rethinking a huge number of strategies for surviving fighting and prospering in 00  but that might actually do some folks some good anyway and omg folks might even have fun too players need to change their approach to playing eve instead of trying to change the game mechanics of eve itselfit would sure as hell give the devs alot more time to develop cool stuff and ultimately we cant have it both ways not even in eve thanks for reading if you made it this far through my preaching
theres a whole lot of out there  not everywhere outside highsec is rancer or delve theres a whole lot of places a 10man corp could set up in 01 and nobody would even notice and if the ore there was twice as good as in highsecinstead of being actively worse like it is now there might actually be a reason to try even in 00 if you can keep a decent level of security  it doesnt have to be perfect just good enough  miners can go about their business largely unmolested the attitudes of the existing corporations might not be along those lines but theres no reason it cant work and furthermore you cannot get trit any more easily in 00 than you can in 10  veldspar is the trittiest mineral in the game why would anyone mine it in 00 when they can mine it in highsec make a better trit source  doesnt have to be a new mineral could just be some kind of improved veld  and 00 might actually be able to supply its own minerals sanely youd need to rework pos manufacturing for it to make a lot of sense to try but that can be done with this mineral proposal and if you think that was bad go look up my csm page  youll see a real wall of text
this deserves a bump
introducing ambulation is bound to have its own bugs no i think its just ccp being lazy about it or not caring this whole dillema tells me that they are more concerned with wowizing eve with useless features like ambulation i must say from the screen shots it looks really goodhowever i will stick with my roots blowing the crap out of everyone else in space where the game originatedas ive done in every thread on this mattersigned
having now spoken to all kinds of devs the last few days trust me if they had the resources they would love to do itits sadly really simple redoing the whole pos mechanic with this thing is a huge task right now we have a system that works even if ccp does realize its by no means to the degree of awesomeness as they would like totis a shame but im afraid thats how it is
that might be the silliest thing ive ever seen in a flame thread check your facts i too sign this its wrong
supported horrible change i love seeing 6 cruise missiles from a raven with bs v do crap all damage to another battleship i really wish i could be in those ccp meetings tbh lets come up with a way to calculate that cruise missiles can do 10 of the damage they previously did to an npc battleship and lets see the forums eruptsigh
not so turrets were calculated against transversal speed therefore if a ship was speeding towards you you would hit it for full damage in a turret boat with missiles that battleship that is 40km from you and mwding straight towards you you cant hit him for any damage doesnt that sound stupidthe new missile calculates against only speed not transversal why should a battleship be able to speed tank missiles that easily regardless if hes going straight towards you or notagainst a turret boat you always had to watch your transversal now against a missle boat it doesnt matter close far direction could care less just go somewhat fast and hes screwedi dont care that there is a speed penalty it just seems that it is to much out of line if there is going to be a tracking penalty now just as there are with turrets then make missiles almost instantly hit like turretsi dont fly missile boats for pvp only ratting and i guess that will now change but honestly now there are ships that take forever to hit a target and when they finally do dont hit it for any damage wow sounds like a great ship
missiles have been ridiculously terrible ever since qr they retain all their previous disadvantages with travel time and now they perform really badly on battleships that are coasting after deactivating their mwds

no support manage your skill training use eve mon and stuff get skill plans you people wanted the ghost training to be removed and now you want to change skill training while your offline  afk  there is absolutely no reason for this  get your skill plans managedifno pay  no trainthen not online  being afk  no skill change if you only want a plan go and download eve mon for example
doesnt a wildly used third party app show that there is a problem with the skill training system how do you plan for the unexpected events because if you can answer this last question you are doing much better than anyone else who is telling us to plan our skills without telling us how to plan for unexpected thingsalso who was asking for ghost training to be removed be sure to link us to your proof as im not aware of anyone commenting on it until after ccp removed it
supported idea maybe no need for bigger fleets if we put up some alternativeconnect multiple fleets to maybe something called platoon or metafleet so that people can still warp to members of other fleets but some features just dont work like adding people from different fleets to your watch list and stuff
the solution is easy add a new skill called task force management and with every level you get to control an extra wing in fleet i would then go further by adding advanced leadership with every level allowing you to add another squad to your wingthis would result in five extra wings and five extra squads per wing increasing the maximum number to 1011 in a fleetthis may sound like an absurd number but i have been in scenarios where 2 or 3 fleets are not enough plus after all if you think its excessive dont train the skill
i like it
still doesnt allways work because of the initial lag the other night i had a badger locked while my mod kept blinking yes he was in range then all of a sudden it goes back to 3 seconds then at about 15 seconds he is gone a mechanic needs to change for the lock timing and the lag factor because too many things get a way if you dont have a hicdic around or a few ceptorsedit forgot to click support topic
it gets my vote
how someone whos capable of intelligent coherent thoughts can hang out with the rest of those slobbering fools is beyond me but i totally support this proposal

i love the idea for low sec or somethign but it would be used as an explot tactic when ships a and b are fighting outide a station and ship a intentionally loses so that it can damage a hauler that just undocked and then some other shps of thiers undocks and scoop up the loot the the hauler pilot just sits thier in thier pod and watchs thier loot get hauled away and if ship a was wardeced by ship b there coudl be no los in sec status for any one one involvedit woudl be nice to see it as a low sec or 00 feature though

they dont need to give details surely they can simply explain why they are not removing reported and obvious macros from the game even if the answer is only we are too busy wouldnt it make sense for them to stop trying to deliver new gadget like ambulation and instead focus on solving existing problems if they cant afford to do both
macro mission runners and macro ratters i really have a problem with anyone violating the eula to achieve and unfair advantage
absolutely no support here some people put a extreme ammount of work and isk into purchasing t2 bpos and with invention there is a way of going into t2 production without having t2 bpos if you dont like invention either safe isk and buy one yourself or go along and do something else with your gaming time

any time you bottleneck a resource in a game this tightly someone will find a way to cheat as the op stated this craptastic system has been the root of the two largest scandals in the gameim not sure if your method is the best way of going about it but i completely and 100 totally support the removal of existing t2 bpos from the game and reintroducing them through a less ed manner
no simply put the fact is they can demand whatever they goddamn feel like for it and the fact that there is no upper ceiling to that means that they could very easily demand a ridiculous sum and when you fail to pay up they just walk away laughing their little heads offand the bolded part merely amplifies the viewpoint that what they are doing does indeed consitute harrassment
right i am of course only in favour of this in legitimate cases of harrassment and not someone using an alt as you say in order to capitalise on a particularly lucrative missioni like the proposal you put forward  that would realistically provide a viable path out of the situation should the op get their way
i agree that players shouldnt be able to petition it and get off the hook this easyon the other hand i actually did have two genuine cases of the mission item not dropping or courier item not appearing in cargo bay and i think its hard for ccp to discern in all cases if the item got stolendestroyed instead of not appearing due to a bug of sorts
agreed 100either make missions instances or advise gms what sandbox play means
ing supportedya know i used to think all the ass licking your corp members did to you in these forums was pretty sad but even being the stubborn idiot i am i can occasionally admit when im wrong about something maybe all that ass kissing isnt unwarrented at all you have some damn good ideas and i support all of them so farhurry up and run for csm these dumbtarded csms we have now are all failbears and probably support gm intervention for their magic high sec riskfree isk machine when i take somebodys damselmarinesfreedom fightersyadda yadda they should be able to either take them from my can at my leisure buy them from me or get them from the market thats it i never knew this kinda crap was occuring thanks for the heads up
you are not asking for a fair and just gm exploit resolution rulebook you are crying that a specific exploit exist and that the gm are accessory to it and what is doing a corp called tear extraction and reclamation service hard to guess righti am not trolling your thread i am truly convinced that you are strongly biased in your op and motivated reasons that are far away for fairiness and justice
the point if so far i have seen no credible proof of missions being reset if not for noob players or bugsit is always some alliance member had said that he can get them reset who said that when it happenedif you have some gm mail or player mail saying that the mission was reset petition against it and if refused escalate and go to the internal affairs stealing loot is a valid action has always been but i have never heard from a credible source that a mission will be reset if the crucial mission loot is stolen so for the nth tiem you have any proof
in the hypothetical case that such proof could be obtained would you support tchells proposal
yes i can see people petitioning for a mission reset for noobs errors and while they are new players or bugs not for other player actions it can be annoying if someone steal your target item but it is part of the game
like it has been said before if the item didnt appear of a bug it should be reset but i dont think to the practical side a gm can determine if it was a bug or another player so it all boils back to the mechanics sideso if it was acquired by some other player it should set off a flag and the mission runner should be able to take it back by force and add a little flair to the mission
oh and stop feeding the trolls ffs
obviously ccp schould at least make sure that the rules they state in the forums are beeing carried outone should not forget that some mission runner might only claim to have gotten back the mission item to discurage pirates from doing so again
good idea
less time is good
definitely a good idea people are always talking about ways to bring the 00 population up and fast clone jumping will have a ripple effect on that as well as have beneficial effects for skill training
i like it
you used a locator agent on me to make a point on the forums thats dedication as for the point at hand i have all the meta 4 stuff memorized too its the meta 13 that screws me up but even if i had it all memorized id still be asking for this feature because new players dont and they shouldnt have to go through a year of waiting for show info windows to come up to learn it its not just about me
i dont support thisonly really of use to missionratt farmersmaking it easier to sift through your loot and thus making farming easier is a bad thinginstead of this id support a reduction in the ammount of loot given full stop
making it easier to see details at a glance about what you own is never a bad thingdenial of ui improvements for everyone to minimally harm mission farmers is overzealousness and kind of silly
supporting 23481011local fix is already being worked on by ccpwtz is fine maybe jumping into a system should kick you out farther to make up for the 60 webst2 insurance is fine if you cant afford it then fly tech 1chance of csm being a crucial part in getting any of these suggestions to tranq zero point zero percent 
oh im not fooling myself i realize that none of these changes are going to be made even removing local wont actually happen once the carebears start threatening to quita couple of pointsthis game has shifted from being a harsh gritty game of consequences to one where there is very little risk involved as long as you take a few very easy precautionscarebears are a vast majority of the game currently therefore any changes that reduce the safety of carebears will cause them to quit which will hurt ccps wallet which they wont allow to happenyou can expect most changes to pvp from this point on to favor the industrialist  carebear crowd since thats the machine that feeds ccps bank accounts and with the economic situation that iceland is in they simply cant take any chancesthis post is basically my last hurrah before i throw my hands up in disgust and let the carebears have what theyve whined so hard to create if by some incredible miracle they actually implement a couple of these changes delayed local at least ffs then eve will be worth sticking around for currently my play style has been pushed aside in favor of other play styles so theres really no incentive for me to keep handing ccp my money shrug
at first i was like holy wall of text batman this probably isnt worth readingthen i was like i should have thought of this stuffif either 8 or 9 ever were to go into effect in eve i would have a sex change and have your babies
your line was two methods to engage in pvp vs 12 to avoid it yeah thats a bit skewed  theres no counting system that results in those numbers and even if it was the case its irrelevant im agreeing with you on the overall topic i just think that that particular argument sucked
so you say that you suck at gatecamping so bad you need all of these to catch anything
some excellent ideas i liked the one about the warp skill for making it 5km at lv5 is balanced for both pvp and traveling not like the current system
changing the warpto distance wont work it will result in the recreation of the instabookmark market if you are too young to remember the instabookmark market  get off my lawn
number 5 changing the warp to distance to a skill isnt a very good idea imo because if youre using it to catch people travelling in order to pew pew them all youre going to end up doing is catching more of the noobs it will quickly become a mustlearn skill for everyone much like learning or navigation so the only ones who end up warping in to 10km from the gate are first dayers in their shiny new atrons pirate broadswords will shudder under the gallant return fire assuming of course that the poor victim realises what the hell is going on whilst this is a great way to pad out killboards killing more noobs in front of the gates to highsec isnt exactly bringing back thrilling pvp combat and its far from newbiefriendlyhaving said all that most of your other points are wellconsidered im interested to see which ones travel the furthest 
i probably made 12 billion selling sets of instas so yes i remember them very well remember that these arent fully fleshed out ideas any rollback of wtz would absolutely have to come with a limitation such as no bms can be made within 115km of a gate or something similarly creative

eve has become a pool of whining carebears who sit and make isk and horde it like it is real money let us take away their money and liberate their soulthe only way save eve is to kill it one pixel at a time
theres plenty of whining all around  dont give all the credit to the cearbears i still see plenty of good pvp engagements on a regular basis theres a lot of whining lazy pvpers in this galaxy who give the cearbears some competition in the biggest bucket of tears contest note i dont think the op of this thread is one of them
looks like another force everyone else to play the way i want them to thread between the pvpers who want to turn this into space call of duty industrialists who want to end all loot drops and miners that want to end all drone rewards people are trying to end all choice in the gameplay the game they way you want but dont expect everyone else to be there just to be your contentthe biggest problem with getting the carebears to stand and fight like in other mmos is the fact that to pve gear sucks for pvp and pvp gear sucks for pve so if you arent out looking for pvp there is no realistic chance to beat the people that are looking to pvp if you cant win there is no reason to stand and fighton a side note htf do i get my picture to show up
some interesting thoughts therepersonally i only began playing this game because i was interested in the competetive no holds barred world it offered and non consensual pvp has to be a part of thatnot taking part in pvp has to have a price as does taking part jumping into lo sec or 00 is showing that you have taken the choice to become a target being declared war on does not however there are too many price free ways these days to avoid combatnon consensual pvp is the only reason i am not playing another mmorpg
these ideas are largely terrible
no they simply dont pander to your version of eve which is ginormous fleet vs ginormous fleet
thread gets my vote but i think some of it is just dreaming 3 4 7 i just dont see happening regardless of any good reasoningeve is too much in favour of avoiding pvp these days  that is for sure personally im an advocate of solo playing quite often the buzz of the 1v1 combat setups on both sides ideally catching targets which just station or gate hug proves very difficult they can take a shot and if they dont like how its going get out in such cases which make up majority of fights the defender dictates if he wants to fight or notit becomes more efficient to fly around in large groups who can just insta pop targets before they have a chance to reactbut boring as hell with a definite lack of buzzthe lack of choices currently preset in eve is exactly what puts me on a downer fleet up  instapop stuff or mission  horde isk
no theyre simply terrible your ad hom aside
hardly the best thread in history but youre being a bit harsh care to elaborate
its just a rehash of a bunch of terrible ideas that have been presented in the pastwith the exception of 2 and 3 one of which is just a less thought out version of another complaint should i have to elaborate on old arguments when no new arguments have been given in support
he cant elaborate elaborating on why goonswarm thinks each one is a bad suggestion would open him up to flames to the rest of the community who think they are pretty decent ideas for the most partyou have to remember that goum is the mouthpiece of goonswarm and therefore whether he thinks something is a good idea or not if it doesnt further the goals of goonswarm then he is obligated to denounce them as badnone of these suggestions benefit ginormous alliance game play in any way and in fact two or three of them put ginormous alliances back where they should be on common ground with the rest of usgoons without jump bridges jesus holy hell theyd lose 25 of their members in the first month
i thought that this comment was especially funny

ford youre in goonfleet youre used to getting things easy so whenever something isnt you feel a special annoyance over itthe rest of us are used to it and have learned to like it in fact we cant let go of it the amount of effort put into something determines how much pleasure we get once we accomplish a goalwe savour the grind so i cannot support thisas for pos mechanics there already are threads for it and that should be looked into at least speeding up certain none defensesov related modules
calling eve a game is really not that accuratein games like counterstrike or call of duty you want no barriers to the twitch eve is more of a simulated worldwith a simulated economy for any economy there has to be a certain amount of unpleasantness so that you are willing to pay others to handle those things eve would grind to a halt if the unfettered frag fest you want ever came to be eve is very realistic in at least one respect in real world combat ops every hour of action usually caps weeks of prep
as for the pos systemmost people agree that the sovereignty system is stupid and iirc ccp is looking at revamping itas for the restbe creative buy your shipsfittings in bulk and have them shipped to 00 or just buy them in 00 just because jita is cheaper does not mean you need to go there
problemthe retribution is the cheapest assault frigate on the market and the least desired pvp assault frigate in the game its use is limited almost entirely to npcing against sansha and other emthermal weak npcssolutionsdrop a high slot and add a mid slotdrop a low slot and add a mid slotadd a mid slot and alter the ships attributesany or all of the aboveconclusionan extra mid slot would allow the retribution to be an acceptable ship in both fleet and small gang pvp in both situations the ability to fit tackle and move at speed are requirements for small ships without overly affecting its ability to shoot rats its current primary function whilst further balancing might be required to stop the retribution from becoming too good discussion on this issue is surely requiredthank you for your time
yes swap a high for a med
i get the feeling that that idea would be too good to be true but considering that last slot is usually empty anyway id love it
no
sunshine is the best disinfectant
how about making all ecm function like an ecm burst ie just breaking the lock of the target or alternatively reducing the length of time that you are jammed whilst keeping the current cycle period of ecm this way ecm can remain at its current strength whilst allowing those who are effected by it some opportuinty to counter it being able to somewhat counter ecm even if your not explicitly prepared who can possibly fit for every eventuality is not unreasonable imo after all you are affored the oportunity against all other ewar to take some action to mitigate it ie shooting the bugger
everyone knows that mate if i say permanently i mean it or perma in this case 1 race jammer is quite capable of keeping a sensor fortified battleship permanently jammed
in most situations i find the need to have 2 eccm modules which severely gimps most shipsplease add 100 boost to the module simple and effective
please visit your user settings to reenable images
a t2 racial jammer on a maxskill falcon with 2 rigs and 2 distortion amps has 1377 points of jam of its good type a dominix with one eccm has 431 points of sensor strength thus a single jammer will succeed 32 of the time i wasnt kidding when i said once every three cycles bad luck and targeting time make that more annoying but if you say a single falcon permajammed six fortified battleships youre simply a liar even if its fitting seven racial jammers and the races line up it has a 047 chance to jam all six of you per cycle even if the fight only lasted two cycles the odds of you all being jammed on both of those cycles are less than one in 44000
factor in locking time for that battle ship and you have a pretty serious problem a faclon with racials is likely to jam 3 battleships for 30 out of 90 seconds adding an extra 1030 seconds of locking time rarely gets consideredand this is with eccmeither way people defending falcons are just failing to acknowledge that is poor game design all binary mechanics which form the back bone of most ewar including neuts arebeyond this having a strong specific counter to something powerfull has the effect of creating an equalibrum in which either can be considered typical in all situations as opposed to this
okay so in 3 20second jam cycles you spend one jammed and 98 seconds relocking the falcon or 61 with a sensor booster even if you dont use that though you have a lock on him about half the timeor a bit more often if its random when jams are instead of every third and remember this falcon has a paperthin tank  even if you use two lses and a dcuwhich is a huge tank for a falcon it still only has 20k ehp which means it can go down fairly quickly thing about that killboard screenshot everything on it is dead also it should be noted that im not trying to defend the falcon here its a bit op and there are some solutions id like to see implementedsay swapping jam ranges with damp ranges and making remote eccm better but the standard onboard eccm modules buff sensor strength enough a secondary boost to make them better in nonjam fights like the one proposed above would be fine but theyre good enough at their primary role i dont think its as ludicrous as everyone claims but a few tweaks would be appropriate the problem isnt on the eccm side though
i believe the proof is in the puddingconsidering that ecm now appears to scale quite happily in fleet fights i think itUFFFDs time for a either a boost to there effect counters or a redesign of the effect of jamming
i support some form of change to the ecmeccm issue one logical fix is impliment a skill to increase sensor strength the abundance of falcons in a small fleet fight is astounding i leave with a 10 man hacrecon gang that has two falcons and hit a 67 man gang with 34 falcons and 2 dps ships we have tried fitting eccm and sacrificing mid slots and still get almost perma jammed every time and our falcs are usually rendered useless after one cycle i think a skill to increase your ships sensor strength is in order that or give eccm moduals a secondary boost so they are not usless
there were some questions about some information i was provided that i wanted to repond to the thread only allows a single response so here is my answerfrom the call for csm transparancy threadso once i get back from this trip i was going to respond to rata rata provided me with a lot of detail about an experience he had that seemed unusual in particular rata had been one of the few players that had pursued the encounters that could be located as result of ship logs that aspect of eve has been removed i always wondered if the dropped ship logs meant something but never spent any time researching it in fact i had never met anyone that had so before i answered i needed to do some research in the end there was nothing unusual about what rata encountered but he had found aspects of eve few other people ever experienced pretty cool rata good job because no one was taking advantage of this ccp eventually decided not to continue the experience and to put the resources that had to be focused on that feature onto other new or more popular featuresthe summary is rata found a very cool thing that was in eve in the past that no one ever seemed to be interested in and that the experience has been removed to allow the resources that had to go into creating and supporting that feature to be assigned to stuff more people seemed to enjoy this wasnt some sort of back door but an encounter not may folks discovered if i have any reaction to that i learned it was that im kicking myself for not putting more time into finding out what rata had it seemed pretty coolto rata sorry i hadnt gotten back to you directly yet i will definitely still follow upfinally in terms of march 10th cant say if that date is exactly the day but from what ive seen march th may be the day a lot of folks say it all began and i mean that in a very good wayissler
well in case of t2 weapons for example they get a natural boost from the specialisation skill which only applys to the t2 version of the weapon for nosferatus and similar modules there is none of such bonuses applyed so well there should be a good reason for the increased fitting requirements isk in most cases is not a problem for pvp most people pay a lot of isk just to be superior in pvp also the meta level should indicate how good a module is compared to others of the same type if they want to keep it that way they could at least fix the meta levels to show up in a correct line
no offense mate but you can get a decent little watch at walmart or whatever large department store you have in your country it can have a alarm on it for no more than 1000 usd if you can afford a eve subscription you can afford a watchalso if you have a hard time remembering when your appointments are eve has a notepad or you can get some postit notes as well
will cost less for entire playerbase to impliment irl than it would for ccp to put dev staff on incorporating it ingame
i want more than a video there are still videos floating around of rifters flying in atmosphere of planets link me to a dev blog article interview or anything confirming the existance of this
but if ccp allows do design own ships then constructed amarr ships will look even more like a giant golden dildo then they are now

woot i have stalkers so the meetings are over the minutes are in to ccp to review they have agreed to allow me to post the following tldrs tho i hope they dont ban methursday 15th january 2009informal meetingsi moon material exploit taskforceccp discussed the moon material exploit with csm this presentation was highly indepth and a lot of things were mentioned a full devblog comprising what csm was shown and the answers to some questions during the meeting will be posted at the end of januaryii qa new testing initiativetanis used the csm as a sounding board for a new idea for qa testing involving the players lots of things were discussed and the idea is still being formalised more information about this will be given after more discussion between csm  ccpiii apocrypha overviewcsm was given a tour of some of the parts of the next expansion ccp wanted to change the way they worked on large expansions so they now have small cells working on separate things at the same time while everything we saw was covered by our nda the general csm consensus for what is coming is omgwtfbbq111eleven111iv gm meetingthe lead gms guard  grimmi gave the csm a general overview of gm team structure the logs they show nothing  some gm stats to be made into a regular report is being considered reimbursement policies  may need explaining better and looking at possibly changing the basic policy in general they do not reimburse ships in fleet fights they do check server logs for lag also every petition is replied to by a gm no autoresponses they just sometimes use the same text for similar petitions csm were asked for feedback on the reimbursement policy as well as alternate punishment for offenders
full minutes of the meetings will be available next weekformal meeting day 1  friday 16th january 2009i incentivizing 00  environmental effects
x factional warfare  focus  goals
formal meeting day 2  saturday 17th january 2009i mission monopoly on standing
as you can see these tldrs are pretty concise and to the point the incentivising 00 issue alone was 2 pages of raw text in the full minutes but ccp and csm thought it best to get these out to you quickly rather than make everyone wait until the full minutes were reviewedid just like to personally thank all the ccp staff that attended the meetings it was an intense 3 days of meetings but i think everyone agrees they were highly productive
lazy aussie gitcouldnt you of linkifiedpseriously thanks ozzie for getting this up quick i look forward to the predigested minutes that ccp allows through the filters

i fail to see mention of batch job installation
so i wanted to take a minute to share my thoughts on the 2nd csm meeting im still in iceland still suffering from time zone shock and a result i am not going to say everything i hope to share in this first postimpressions of the second csm you have elected a very diverse set of players that demonstrated a mature commitment to making eve a better place everyone in this csm struck me as passionate and reasoned in their views of eve we all seemed to work effectively together with both other members of the csm as well as ccp our interactions with ccp were very much as partners instead of adversaries i believe as a result the meeting was very effectivelet me start with the pos exploit ccp took this very seriously they will soon share all the details anyone could ever want with the exception of naming which is against their policy and that policy was explained and makes very good sense i was very impressed with the effort they put into this and the new process they intend to add to make sure something like this is going to be less likely in the future other csm topics everyone should understand that the realities of software engineering result in feature roadmaps that may not support immediate reactions to opportunities to change features every issue that we raised was considered and will have positive effects on the eve we all experience at some time in the future when these effects are enjoyed depends on a lot of factors that arent always easy to understand for example a particular idea my be delayed because the pieces of code that need to be added or changed also related to another 5 features so as a result those features may be delayed to allow the parts of the team best able to create the changes to be able to get all the related changes in together the summary though is everything we discussed will be part of ccps planning going forward if not as a specific we did this feature exactly like suggested but as a your ideas definitely helped us address the specific issue you raised fashionccp in general software development and test my background is software engineering what i learned was that ccp began as a very organic development organization they now see that more rigor in process is key to future success i learned that they are making serious commitments to adopt the processes that lead to best in class software organizations i saw a commitment to everything i would have considered key to creating a great software development organizationccp in general game design love what i learned they get it more often than not they had clearly already been thinking about the issues we raised in many cases they asked us for reactions to some of their ideas i also learned that there are a broad range of focus within the groups that influence design there are folks that love the pvp aspects but there were industrialist and miners as well all i can say is i met a group of people that i believe will continue to amaze me with the experiences they will createccp in general csm support ccp has massive commitment to the csm they believe the csm can be a key part of making eve something very unusual and successful you definitely should believe the csm is being listened to on that note please continue to hold us accountable to you as the member base in a very real way we are your voicecont
initial comments pt2summary i wasnt really sure what to expect looking at the last csm i was worried that the time could have been contentious and unproductive i was happily surprised i think the current csm worked very effectively represented a broad ranges of views in a mature fashion and that we were listened to by ccp this is a learn as you go process and will continue to improve and that finally the ultimate sucess of the csm is not so much the csm or ccp but the pilots of eve becoming supportive and involved in this unique political processso as ive been known to say stuffs getting better stuffs getting batter every dayissler
i really dont want to sound like a suckup  but i enjoyed working both with all my coleagues from csm aswell as with ccp personel meetings were highly constructive and productive and i am looking forward for making eve better place for all of us
also special props for omber zombie for taking minutes with fued up hand
there is nothing wrong with black ops recons or anything else its taken me a while to realise this but its true the only thing that is wrong is the covert cyno let the covert cyno be opened in a cyno jammed system and bingo all problems solved all black ops would have a purpose and alot more people would fly them means people sat cosy in their supercaps safely behind their front lines would get a rude awakening as their cyno jammers get popped by a recon gang and a cap fleet jumps inwould make me restart training for black ops bs instead of just training all racial reconsedit  allow black ops bs to use covert ops cloaks too whats the point in using a covert ops ship that cant use the cov ops cloak unless they have already changed thathavent checked in a while
what would be needed is a way to match the new name against the old name with regards to searches buddy lists etc so that it is still possible to find people using the original namethen youd need like a new tab or an addition to employment history called known aliases  literally other names the character has gone byif you have them i cant see a way for a scammer to hide by changing name as long as people are smart and check the tab
love the idea of an anchorable structure in belts
i think alliances who manage to establish a number of colonys throughout adjacent systems in 00 and manage to protect them from enemy invasiondestruction should be rewarded with gradual increases in security status in that system and the benefits that go with it  sentry guns on gates etci think this system could be developed into a system of space management in eve that would recreate a frontier based style of warfare for alliances where alliances would have to nibble away at each others frontiers to try try and reach the centreimagine if the number of higher sec systems in an alliances territory kept increasing in number and also sec status if they reached 08 or above how about the reward of a stargate back to old empire high sec space appearing and cute lil carebears can come and mine for the allianceor the alliances colonies and stations might take a percentage of minerals and isk just like the empire stations do so the carebears feed the alliance without even necessarily being members of itjust a thought
one major issue the devs would have is the introduction of the hundreds of new item types that would be required to implement this idea if the ore that you mine still takes up the same amount of space in your hold but you mine three times as much of it per unit time  that makes your operation three times as efficient if you mine nine times as much of it per unit time youre still maxed out at three times as efficient because you just filled up your hulks hold and are now wasting orefor ninetimesefficient veldspar youd have to have a specific ore type that was superdense veldspar or some such it has to be an item that can stack in the hold of the ship mining the oreone simple change to make nullsec mining more attractive would be for mineral compression to be boosted then again go check the dev blogs and note by ccp staff in particularso lets wait to see if something comes of all that talk about moving asteroid belts out of system space then we can talk about revamping the mining system
yes it will as it will reduce the price basic supply and demand given demand an increase in supply will decrease the pricesure it is traces per individual miner but then you have 15000 miners and those traces add up if you are worried about low prices of zydrine and megacyte and high prices of tritanium this is precisely the wrong way to gopeople will start avoiding rocks that have lots of tritanium but show no traces thus reducing the amount of tritanium the amount of zydrine and megacyte on the other hand will go up and thus the price downas for nyphurs insurance problem the solution strikes me as simple make insurance payouts and insurance contract prices dependent on the price the character actually pays thus if i get a dominix bb for 10 million insurance will cost me 3 million and if i am foolish enough to undock and selfdestruct i get only 10 million leaving me in the hole for 3 million not with a profit of 3375 millionas for this partthe problem nyphur makes is that these limits arent hard limits it isnt that the price cant go below the bounds he describes but that due to the way insurance works prices wont stay outside of those bounds for very longsloppy analysis imo
oh and a follow up question for the many keynesians herethere seems to be an underlying assumption that people mining say crokite should earn more than people mining veldspar at all timesbut if everyone decides to go mine crokitewhy should this be so if bob a and goons all stop shooting each other and everyone hops in a ship and heads out to 00 and mines crokitewhy should the one lone guy still in emprie mining veldspar make moregranted the above is fantastical but this whole thread is motivated by nyphurs complaint that mineral prices cant move outside a fixed price range now it seems people want to have a fixed income rangeyouve never read finn kydland and edward prescotts paper on the inconsistency of optimal discretionary plans have you kinda undercuts that whole tweakable thing to discretionary economic stabilization policy
redesigning local is a huge task right now we have a system that works even if ccp does realize its by no means to the degree of awesomeness as they would like it tothats a copout that can be said for essentially any change to the game the amount of resources required is irrelevant ccp put together a massive team for ambulation which is not necessarily something the community has asked for certainly not on the scale of the pos issue which has been around for three years are you telling me that in three years ccp still has not been able to find the time or resources to seriously consider this issueim sorry but the more i hear from devs the more i realize they refuse to listen to the customers even considering this whole csm gimmick
copied from ambulation thread quoteother information those players that do not wish to interact with the fullbody avatar aspect of the game will not be forced to do so a la the now defunct earth  beyond and their station interface instation servers will be seperate from the space servers so there will be little if any lag introduced into the other environment if theyre moving the station enviroment to another server wouldnt implementing this idea enable them to walk inside player owned stations moving pos code to the other server and thus speeding up the game code

facepalmnop this is a massively multiplayer online game bolded the important bits for you if you cant work out that its 11pm and set a longer skill going then thats your problem 18pt text on the forums doesnt make you right edit  andwhy of course yknow how everyone uses eft there must clearly be something wrong with the way every single piece of ship equipment works that we have to play around in eft to work out our fittings oh and i think windows needs to be changed because i need my third party mouse to make it work and yeah the remote control to my tv needs some love from the developers too i had to go to big w for some third party batteries yesterdayso basically no mate just because we use eve mon doesnt mean theres anything wrong
i thoroughly support this system even if it is only a single skill queue or next level of finished skillthis system does not make ingame experience less complexes or easier does not put hardcoreactive players at disadvantages or heckif you dont want to use ityou dont lose anything too if you rather stayed up late at night to train next skill or juggle skills everytime you want to sleepaway from eve kudos to youthis system wont prevent you from doing that but the rest of us would really appreciate this systemplease ccp 
dual skill training small queu large queue to me it does not matter  i do however hate 6 hour skills cant even get a decent nights sleep over these  dual skil them with another 6 hour skill and voila 
every time i have suspended my account i have indicated lack of a skill queue as the reason because it was the reason i needed a break from the game so why keep my subscription unless im gaining something from iti fully support an extensive skill queue it is good for me as a player and good for ccp as a company as it stands i will only subscribe for the 1 or 2 least busy months of the year when i know i have time to play if there were an unlimited skill queue i could just leave my subscription active without feeling like im wasting money and log on whenever i have free timeand as akita t points out the one and only logical reason for not having a skill queue in the first place has vanishedso please either put ghost training back to the way it was or add an unlimited skill queue to make casual gamers like me happy or just ignore the problem and save me some money in the process p
no it just means that the equipment interactions are too complex for most players to do in their heads so my suggestion to fix the problems that eft shows is for ccp to make an official version though that would be a waste of time as it wouldnt do anything that eft doesntbut a skill queue would add functionality that evemon cantthere is a difference between something being designed to require third party support you examples here and something that had third party support show up afterwardsnow could you answer the other point in my post how do you plan for the unexpected events because it is really the more important one as evemon can only deal with the events you know about in advance
i was one of the people who first set about working out the acceleration time formula and i know that it isnt very accurate in certain cases  in particular with larger ships and mass addition from multiple plates
supported
i dont know if this has been mentioned yet but could there be the possibility of using your characters sp total as a bank and spending them on skills to test out the new things introduced that you normally wouldnt have specialized training for could just reset the skills at each update for mirroring
any newsjust seen this thread had forgotten about it lol
about time
looking forward to the publication 
i wonder whether a solution would be that when a ship docks the pilot has to enter a random security code for the final docking latches to be attached if not the ship gets pushed back out into spacewouldnt take much coding from ccp and would certainly cause a hiccup in the macro process
okay most of us have done it at some point with a friend or just for the hell of it we exchange a can with a neutral so that we can shoot at each other in high secwhy dont we just make an option allowing us click on someone you wish to pvp against and propose a duel with that person who then has the option to either auto decline pvp duels or he can get a popup of the proposed duel and can accept or decline it in high sec most of the time people who want to duel have agreed to it via chat anyways in high secthis not only makes pvp a bit easier for those not at war with each other or in the same corp it increases ship losses which increases market activity and it also gives players more options for fun consensual pvp which we almost all of us enjoyjust an idea
firstly it is duel not dualsecondly you can already accomplish this by flipping each others cans id rather ccp spend their time on more pressing issuestldr  no
what would really be so bad about it
wow is that way want duels they have tons there ccp has more pressing issues than this isaac
actualy u can not duel farlyremove the posibility of remote repboosting on the dueling coupleand then u actualy have a fare 1vs1 pvpsuported
as it was already stated most duels are dishonored by interference or acts of cowardice while i may not duel myself i tend to refuse them because of that factsupportedif your going to duel you fight to the death and everyone else should stay the  out of the way short of watching
a duel is a contest of honor if you have lowered yourself to dueling dishonorable opponents the shame is yours it is not neccessary to spend time developing game mechanics when combat is already allowable i do not support
i guess you are just talking about hisec concord might allow it  for a price a few million isk at leastand if you just want a dual without paying then losec or even nullsec is thataway though to be honest i quite like the current can flagging method more like a throwing down a gauntlet kind of thing
i think the problem is not the ability to throw down a challengeits interferenceand asking them to go to lowsecnullsec only compounds the problem
npcs or magic buttons should enforce a carebear pvp mode in low sec and null sec players enforce the rules in low sec and null sec if you dont like it then gtfo of lownull secif you want a carebear pvp mode in high sec then you solved the problem yourself use can aggro mechanicsan arena setup so that players can create a tournament easily for their corpalliance for s and giggles would be nice but you are blatantly asking for a carebear world of warcraft mechanic to be added into eve so my standard gtfo of eve response applies
well gee vaal youre about as bad at subject comprehension as i am at spelling all i am proposing is an alternative to can flipping two people in high sec want to throw down instead of flipping cans have a scroll down option where you can request a pvp flag with the other ship which can then be accepted or denied by that ships player can flipping works too i am just throwing out an idea to make the process a bit more streamlinedso vaal ert how am i asking for a carebear world or warcraft mechanic again lets meet sometime and go flip cans with each other mmk
i think it should allow pvp between the 2 parties for their current ships only this way someone doesnt accept and go grab a bigger ship etc on another note wtf is wrong with you people this is a decent and simple little idea to make the game just a bit better
being an occasional mission runner i beleive the missions should only be reset in the case of a mission bug item not dropped key rat doesnt spawn etc which should all be in the logs though it may take time to go through themi dont think its the standing drop that people worry about as much as the lp loss that they would have gotten for completing the mission especially in a faction navy missionwith regard to gms resetting missions it would be interesting to see the stats on how many missions get completed compared to those reset on a weekly basis and the reasons behind the resetsto mission runners if you know that a firm like tears operate in an area find somewhere else to runmissions or accept that they will bust into the mission and salvage it
also people can sell modules for stupid prices on the market in remote regions griefing people who want to buy stuff of course nobody would ever buy those items but its still griefing thus traders are griefersas for your suggestion that its harassment you are stupid its worthless to everyone except the mission runner to which it is worth quite a bit since they are trying to sell it to the mission runner alone then its value it considerable however if the mission runner refuses to pay up then it is worthless essentially they griefed you by trying to sell you something for an excessive pricejust to demonstrate how stupid this is say i attacked your ship and ransomed you for 100000000000000 isk an obviously unreasonable sum by your logic this is griefing because they are asking too much however it is no different to them just blowing you up in the first place which is perfectly legal therefore this is not griefingassuming youre in a t2 rigged t2 bs with t1 fittings the ship is worth a lot but it will drop very little of worth if destroyed now this is no different to the griefer stealing the mission item and charging an excessive amount for it yet it is obviously within game mechanics therefore your arguament fails
signedi cant believe that introducing 24h long queue with just one skill can seriously break something down in game balance even if ccp have some doubts about longer queues or more advanced functionality this simple change should be more than enough to stop most of complaintsive cancelled my previous subscription and stopped paying money to ccp btw mostly because of this  i had to remember about changing skills when i was not in the gameif ccp respected my personal life by not making me wake up in the middle of the night or install eve on my work computer just to change skills i would really appreciate this
please dont do so i really dont like the idea of a skill queue its a game mechanics fact that people got to manage their training and considering that you can switch the training without losing skill points on like lets say a half way trained skill gives people the ability to plan their training if people are too lazy to plan their training the need to lose lets say a hour or 2 hours of skill training from my point of view and i am playing the game for 5 years now its a part of the game to manage your skillswell if people ask for skill queues because it makes life easier id like to be able to accept multiple missions from a single agent just to not have to dock inbetween the single missions i am running  same argument it makes my life easier and no i am not aiming towards more profit just less traveling time coz i am lazy just like the people above are too lazy to manage their trainingnot supported
i do not support this there are far more important and fun things ccp could work on i strongly encourage players to get over it and learn to manage time and logins
how do you plan for the unexpected events things like a traffic jam making you get home later than expected unplanned downtimes etci notice that almost all the people against skill queues keep telling us to plan our skill training but they never tell us how we can plan for things that we cant predict they either dont mention it or tell us to just suck it up and forget about the lost sp
supported and wanna more than 5 clones coz all my five clones are with implants
i would like to see jump clones nerfed or even better removed
this seems to be a good idea 
oh and unless im blind and it already can be don an option to look through containers in remote stations would be nice d
just like i think he was being unfair for slamming your suggestions without reasons given i think youre being unfair for calling him a mouthpiece of goonswarm yes hes a goon no hes not some sort of mindless propagandaspewing automaton if you want him to engage in sensible discourse with you you ought to start by not issuing groundless insults also if your goal is to put ginormous alliances on equal footing youd do well to shut this thread down right now and save yourself the trouble even if it was possible to make a game where 5000 players are on par with 5 id want no part of it
1 interesting idea2 yes3 yep4 to a point5 totally agree6 disagree i think ships should be more costly make them stand and fight in other ways but if they stinkunlucky at pvp make it costly so they get smarter keep the market flowing dont give free money away7 i agree to a point i think it is getting too easy to move long distances allowing mega war machines to just pounce at will anyplace in the galaxy would be interesting to see what eve would be like if movement of war fleets was a lot more limited8 totally9 long over due10 yes11 mm not sure on that one12 um sure
make this game more cutthroat
its almost impossible to catch someone in empire that you may attack and actually destroy hisher shipdocking games high agility on the ships jump portal games etcplease make it more difficult to avoid all fighting once undocked if you undock during war its a decision you have made and it should mean something
signed some good ideas here1 interesting  a delay to local would be great indeed2 not bothered either way3 never gonna happen4 good idea5 i like this alot everytime it is brought up however people bring up the bookmark argument heres the answer  put a 5km warp disruption bubble around every gate in empire at least so it doesnt matter if you have bms or not you get stopped right at the edge i used to love the rush id get from the 15km dash to gatestation i miss it6 i agree7 not bothered empire hugger lol8 good idea i agree9 meh this isnt something that bothers me but i know it bothers many 10 awesome idea11 good idea ccp would never implement it though 12 great idea i would actually extend this to individuals aswell perhaps a 48 hour cool down rather than a week it is way to easy to corp hop and avoid decsoverall some great ideas here although i doubt ccp will ever implement any with every patch it gets harder to engage targets that dont want to be engaged another year and i wouldnt be surprised to see a pvp flag that will be a sad day for eve and the day i cancel my account
back during the first csm he was probably the most reasonable one amongst the bunch if he had run this time around id have voted for him without second thoughtsand as said those suggestions are mostly crap they do not solve the fundamental problem of pvp today the lack of reasons to fight in face of bad odds the suggestions only make the costs higher andor restrict peoples abilities to do stuff
i did run the last time around 
another facepalm hai ccp can haz all good missionz befoar i logz for teh nite plixyou want everyone to just do their worlds collides and blockades and let the others expire while asleep or at work why why dont you just propose they remove the allegedly crap missions from the game
even better idea why not have the agent just list all the missions available then you select the one you want every timeunsupportable imho youre the type of player that gives mission runners a bad name
we should stop replying to his topics maybe he will go away
i fully support this but only if all lvl 4 agents are moved to low sec and null sec
as youve seen from this thread
have to post i support my own topic silly forums
your link is brokenanyway im just a new player so i dont know how large fleet battles affect performance on the premium client however your specs are a bit better than mine and my computer runs the premium client just fine have not done large fleet battles yet caldari and minmatar stations sometimes produce some skipping when being looked at but if i need to i can turn down the graphics settings i have shadows and the bloom effect enabled
have you even tried running premium liteoh wait you have no blithering idea what it takes to run nor tried itim not going to give support to something that is nothing more than pure ignorant speculationthumbs downi suggest you wait for it to be released before you pass judgment
if this is your system you should have no problem running premium im running the current premium version on an intel p4 32ghz with ht 2gb ram and a geforce 7600gt with 512mb vista home premium 32 and it works fine with the processor running at about 7080 the only time i have big problems is when the background virus scanner kicks ini think youll probably find that the premium lite comes with a set of switches to tune the client for the machine just like premium but until further details are released im unable to support your suggestion
in case you didnt read my first post i played full version of premium and all it did was give me an epic headache and obliterate my os please do not pass judgement on what i think it takes to run it as the full version of premium doesnt work on my over the top pc for supreme commander forged alliance which requires more than eve
then dont bother posting here because you obviously didnt readi said premium litenot premium again stop being ignorant and start thinking before you post
please stop posting thank you for thinking half a second perhaps you need a full caps statement to understand what i didi used eve online premium graphics and set everything to absoltue minimum settings and it destroyed my operating systempepsi caffine free pepsi pepsi one it doesnt matter still is pepsi im against the removal of something that works just fine for me the way i want it to now if youre only here to flame congradulations youre only proving you didnt understand the reason for this post in the first place i am against the discontinuation of the classic client i do not want anything to do with premium anything because it does not work for me i dont care what the premium lite says it is as it is still containing the word premium which in case you didnt hear me the first time doesnt work for meyour arguement is flawed on the basis that youre 100 certian that lite will not work no because im for the fact that classic works fine for me and i wish to continue to use it which is the purpose of this threadyour arguement against me is that a shoe to the head is not going to hurt as much as a boot to the head i dont want to be hit in the head by either thank you now until you can argue better than a shoe to the head you may want to think about what you say next unless you really are a forum troll
drake is correct in essence on the issue i suggest you read the dev blog on the issue to get correct information
im sure that ccp had some long involved discussions about this before they decided to drop it i am involved in software as a developer and i can assure you that having to maintain two versions of similar software is a pain in the rear it takes time from the developers the artists the qa guys everyone  and it can be expensive deprecating the classic client would free up a lot of resources that can be used to fix existing issues and work on improvementsthe premium lite client may run very well  well have to wait and see they may have a release cycle where the classic premium and premium lite clients are all available while they work out the kinks in the lite versionpersonally im sad to see it go but if it means more resources devoted to other issues then im all for it im sorry that you are having problems with the premium client but have you tried filing a bug report and what do you mean by it obliterated my operating system if youre talking about the old bootini thing thats long gone and i dont think it affected vista systems anyways
my argument against you is your ignorance in assuming that all things are equal all things are not equalpremium client and premium lite are worlds apart you think they are identical they are not if you bother to read and do your homework before blasting me with your ignorance of the situation it would be a little differentwe dont know the requirements for premium lite because it has not been released yettop that off with the fact that others are running premium on the hardware configuration similar to yours means your obviously making a mistake somewhere along the lineyour asking for them to keep classic with absolutely no knowledge of the forthcoming new client such things are nothing more than a testimony to your ignoranceif your going to assume the world is going to end then you will live a stress filled and very short lifei suggest you take a step back and be patient enough to let the good folks at ccp do there bloody jobs instead of declaring there work to be a total failurefor all we know premium lite is classic 20so instead of jumping to conclusions i suggest you look before leap eh
i knew that the first time i posted it is still going to use the premium graphics though or did i miss thatnope apparently i got that 100 on the money even so a lesser rendered version of a ship of premium will take more resources from my system than a classic version and i dont see any reason i should be satisfied with being forced to upgrade without a say in the matter of course if they cut expenses and income by more than expenses what they do is moot in process anyways so let players speak let them voice their choice arguements are irrelevant on for or against reallyi see three things possiblewith the loss of classic client they loose some playerbase they guess that 95 of the playerbase can upgrade to what theyre calling premium lite without changing any of their system1 if this is true then they cut out a development process cut costs and improve quality losses remain minimal compared benefits2 if this is not true then they loose more playerbase but the development cost cuts keep them in the black3 if it is way off then they loose more playerbase than cutting of costs increase the bar for people to start joining and start running in the red leading to higher subscription rates and less playersis it wrong for me to not want number 3 to happen and people to actually voice they want the classic or do we want to wait and see which number comes up then again there are no hard numbers yet only a guess thus the reason for this thread no need to bicker over it i prefer classic the way it is it has my support and i want to know who else thinks this way do we or do we not get a sayif you dont like what im saying dont reply its like saying you dont support itif you support this petition reply check that support this topic box while youre at iti remember there being 45000 players online at one time i wonder how many of them prefer the classic over the premium but if were going to bicker over it all day then nothing gets done no data to use and nothing happens other than a giant fireball where information was supposed to go so this is my final post in this thread
i believe you are missing the point that drake is making in that we dont know what the specs will be for the premium lite client until it happens even then there will be beta testing and a min requirementthe way i read the ccp announcement was that the premiumlite client will make use of the same code base as premium with down graded graphics and maps that will allow users to run on boarderline pcsultimately this is a commercial decision by ccp to allow them to push eve forward and maintaining 2 seperate codebases is holding them backas far as your system goes as i said in a previous post im using a system that is by far inferior to yours the gpu is an agp8 fit card and premium works well as for eve obliterating the os what do you mean the only major issue with premium that caused an os fail was the bootini  up and that only affected the xp and prior os as to my knowledge vista doesnt use a bootini
are you ed only positive repliespeople can support the topic or say they do not like this proposal i disagree with the op and suggest you look up discussion in the dictionary as you have zero understanding of this forum and are just a whiny 5 year old that is having a tantrum because god forbid someone disagrees with you grow up
while i agree with you 100 it would have been a lot funnier and probably more demoralizing for the op had there been no more replies
after reading all the complaints about eccm its ineffectiveness on smaller ships and the fact that it doesnt supply a bonus to your own ship when there are no jammers in play ive thought out and played around with the following suggestionto solve the first problem i suggest we change eccm to a flat sensor boost rather than a  boost part of the reason why people dislike falcons is there large jam range and the ships that would be capable of crossing this range in a reasonable time and could probably kill the falcon in the same timeframe often have low sensor strength and limited slots ie taranis claw vagabond crusaderfor our second problem changing eccm to have a signiture radius reduction will help achieve this there are no modules in game currently which have this effectproposed modules for lowmedium sloteccm tech i 10 sensor strength 25 signiture radius reductioneccm meta 1 11 sensor strength 30 signiture radius reductioneccm meta 2 12 sensor strength 35 signiture radius reductioneccm meta 3 13 sensor strength 40 signiture radius reductioneccm meta 4 14 sensor strength 45 signiture radius reductioneccm tech ii 15 sensor strength 50 signiture radius reductionthe midslot equilivant will be able to be scripted for either sensor strength or signiture reduction and it can be overheated too the lowslot one becomes more valuable than it was previously giving the same stats as a midslot unscripted and less fittings  needing to be activatedexample on a taranisbefore a taranis fits a tech ii eccm it also has a microwarpdrive and a warp scrambler even with the eccm fitted its chance to be jammed by a gallente racial from a falconrook is 801 assuming 1 racial is used falcon has 3 sdas and ecm range rigsafter a taranis fits a new tech ii eccm with sensor strength script  mwdws 9 base  30 the chance of the falcon jamming it now with single racial is 362 the taranis now has a much better chance of taking out the falcon or forcing it to warp when it gets into range than previouslyvagabond before 1x old eccm 515 chance of getting jammed by a single racialvagabond after 1x new eccm 32 chance of getting jammed by a single racialdominix before 1x old eccm 328 chance of getting jammed by a single racialdominix after 1x new eccm 272 chance of getting jammed by a single racialthe numbers look alot better for smaller ship classes and dont change much on battleship numbers
if your goal is to make smaller ships able to withstand ecm better this is a good way of achieving that but your numbers are really high for battleships  30 is a fair bit more than they get now interesting proposal but probably too much of a buff still thats just number tweaking if eccm is going to get a change this isnt a bad way of doing it
most ship modules have a faction variant that is slightly better than t2 some of those have officer variants which are much better yet other modules dont have any faction variant mods that are by no means overpoweredin particular active eccm and passive eccm a bit underpowered would not break game balance with addition of faction and officer version target painters also rather underpowered no problem adding faction and version shield extenders large and medium ones are pretty powerful tho not game breaking with faction variant officer version may be overpowered but theres always the pricing issue armor plates only the 1600mm is very powerful now same idea as shield extender tracking disruptors powerful on curse but very specialized no harm in adding faction variant sensor damps same as tracking disruptors ever since the great script nerf they became half of what they used to be in game faction variant would not make them more powerful than they used to be years ago and even back then it wasnt all that badthere may be other mods that dont have faction version but these are the main ones that people would be interested in buying not asking for officer version for all of those but just faction version to start with
i dont think i support faction extenders or plates but the others could probably work
not supported1essentially you want to set up your death stars moon mining pos and research and production pos with no logistical need to me that breaks the pos mechanics pos warfare aside you remove the human element of maintaining your 00 pos network when the players that set up mining posresearchproduction pos for their alliance never have to do any work to make sure a part of their major infrastructure runs smoothly is absurd you want to set it up do the work to maintain it plain and simple2 i support this idea to an extent i believe you should be able to order moduals and have them delivered to any area of high sec for a price allowing it to be npc delivered to low sec00 is touchy how would it be defended what if your npc convoy gets gankedas for a better market browswer i agree it could better imo you could take the ten minutes to setup your quickbar by your ship setups that way when in empire you click your sniping mega tab and all the moduals you use are in a nice list you can click on3you own the space populate it yourself hell even capitalize off of a bare market buy bringing down a load of good named and t2 items and selling them for a mark up there is no need for unlimited production slots just better management station a is only for market production as worked out by panel of alliance leaders station b for public use first come first serve4 last i checked there is a whole skill set for industrialist and mining using automated drones just takes away from all those miners that mine belts for a living and if you dont have any miners recruit some5 why remove stront what about all those towers you get to take down on the first op because someone forgot to strontrestront them this pretty much removes human error6 being adressedthe tediousness is a part of eve i was in goons for a while and know that it is not hard to have bulk items brought down from emp from the freighter pilots for a small and reasonable price if you dont allways have time ask a corpie to help you out ive never had a problem
big fat no your obviously unhappy with working and want everything now now now sadly how our generation is turning out your suggestions basically boost the crap out of huge alliances and will make more power blocs your also nerfing miners so are you planning on paying them back for their wasted sp 3 only going to happen with nrds based alliances since any nbsi alliance wouldnt allow this to happen 4 seriously big fat no there are lots of miners that would demand their sp back for this horrible suggestion if it were implemented 5 stront is fine l2p6 not a good idea for fixing this problem your obviously tired of your war with bob and just wanted unlimited pewpew rather than all the work it takes to maintain an alliance play an fps or something eve is not how your wanting it to be isaac
there are some ships that are less than perfect for pvpingso what i rather like my retribution the way it is i dont want to lose a high and i dont want to lose a low amarr is strong on low slots and weak on midslotsof course there should be a few ships that arent good for tacklingkeep it the way it is
the retribution is fine as it isif she lost a high slot where would i put that nos for pvp or the salvager for pveshe is not perfect for pvp but she does quite well someone else just has to do the tacklingwhen i want a ship that is able to tackle i just use my vengeance
as said above the retribution is fine want to tackle look up interceptors or vengeance not all ships were created equally isaac
nah im eagerly awaiting the use of this ship the way it isworks as intended
deffinitely needs a 2nd mid to make it a useful ship whatever the method it needs that slot
i love the retribution it is a great ship for what it does it isnt designed to be a solo pwn boat  it is designed to melt things if you want an amarr assault frig for solo pvp work get a vengenace and fit it with blasters ha ha otherwise friend a friend to tacklelosing a high or low slot would make this ship too much like the other ships in this categoryi think the retribution could use a boost of some kind  it is fun to fly but it just feels lacking that said i dont think an extra mid slot is the way to go i wouldnt mind an extra high slot and a bit more cpugrid for another gun if it can only do one thing it should excel above and beyond other ships of the same class or make it more maneuverablejust my humble opinion
they use uv in hospitals for a reason out them alloh and i will not vote for any future candidate who does not support naming of the characters and their alliances naming of characters does open the door for finding the rest of the roaches in this game obviously ccp cant do this so they should let the players themselves find them
on related note we need faction and officer versions of active eccmtheres no reason why that shouldnt be in game right now
thats a boost i can support for that matter im fine with sensor strength skills too
i always wondered about the ship logs myself but i never thought there was anything about them because nobody ever talked about it what did rata find
as someone who runs a small very industry minded alliance and i mean very small i feel there is not enough resources in high sec any more there is just too many people out there popping rocks and the risks of loosing a hulk in low sec  the rewards of mining there unless my alliance had about 20 more people who were there only for pvpprotection but that has its down sides too who wants to sit there and babysit miners i can feel the flames coming already and i dont care it really is getting to be impossible to live in high sec as a small corp with trit prices hitting 4 isk in places all the standard haunts for my alliance suddenly being mined out and in place of the belts there are now more can flippers and more merc corps more than willing to try to ransom a perceived carebear corpwhat is currently happening in the game is good for ccp more users more stuff happening more excitement for people etc but it is bad for those of us who think that trying to get buy in null sec or even low sec is too risky so much so that recently i am thinking it may be a good thing to close the mineral portion of my corp cut all production and do nothing but research from now on makes the game less fun for me and my corp mates but spending 3 or 4 hours just to try to fine a descent belt to mine is is silly
i cant do anything but completely agree with issler her words are teh truth the csm team is great despite us being from completely different gameplay areas we managed to agree in almost every single issue and showed a consistent front towards ccp ccp seemed to be taking us very seriously they were well prepared for the discussion they did their best bringing the most related ccp devs to the discussions so the ccp staff was rotating throughout the meetings the devs really seemed to have a clue about the problems we were raising and often prepared powerpoint presentations or statistical data regarding the details of the problem or the way they think things should be they were also very open answered all our questions except the few involving character names as for the issues my general feeling was that they kind of know whats going on and do have plans to fix them question is only when they get time to do it as the issues were clear to them most of the effects we were having on ccp was getting the problems higher on their priority list it is interesting to hear their comments on the problems instead of patching the surface they usually want to go for the core of the problem to eliminate it properly they have some really really good ideas and i can only hope that they implement them asap
i am eagerly awaiting the responses about the exploit ccp has a chance here to gain back some credability i appreciate csms efforts and representation of the players i read the initial grilling you guys gave on the exploit keep it up
so many flaws in your argument that i dont know where to beginfirstly you missed windows as a bug that should have been obvious to anyonenext so according to your logic winamp by introducing skins for their winamp players introduced a huge bug that everyone can exploit and lay claim to millions of mp3 files oh yes as an example with worst possible resultthere are countless programs that have the concept of skins why would introducing skins to eve be an exploitall we are really talking about it the ability to mod the graphics files and locate them in a format that can be easily replaced like in evedataskinsdefault for the default skin and a different directory for others change the eula that you cant modify the program that you cant modify the default programs or graphics but using skins in their intended form is ok then we can replace base default graphics files with our own a little bit of testing with regards to buffer overflows would handle most of any issues that could result but lets face it reading the directory handling output for said read use list of directies under skins subfolder into a dropdown list using default skin unless settting has a valid subfolder checking files of graphics for valid graphic input otherwise default graphics is used easy simple to implement and good for the game as a wholeim not saying that a buggy program wont have bugs  duhthe intention is to adequetely test any portion that could have issuesmodifying graphics files should be allowed under the eula as long as you dont modify the default graphics files so somewhere to put the modified files needs to inserted into the programso a litle bit of forethought before posting mindless drivel would be appreciated some people at least want to have an intelligent thought out conversationps im one of them and your not i assume botox is one of them too but never met him so dont quote me on that
what is the critical number of supports before a csm will champion the proposal any other csms willing to comment on this clearly your character names are important to you now because youll always be known as a csm unless afterwords you want to escape that title
the number of players in eve makes this a very fast selfbalancing system if the prices drop low enough that its profitable to build and insurancefraud some ships those prices will be countered almost immediately youre arguing on a technicality that they can go below those prices but wont stay outside of those bounds for very long but unless your definition of very long is less than a day thats not truethis wont work under this system i could put a dominix up on sell order for 400m on an alt and then buy it on my main character that would then insure for 400m costing me 120m and if the ship costs about 60m to build that means i just made 220m out of thin air and why stop there why not put it up for 2 billion then id pay 600m to insure it and get a 2b payout id make 1640m out of thin air
the way insurance works in real life yes yes i know is that the insurance company will insure you for market value thus you could buy your raven for 80m in caldari space head over to minmatar space and insure it there for 90m as an example assuming ravens are more expensive in minmatar space for whatever reason then commit insurance fraud collecting the payout and making a profit the only cost to you is the time to travel between caldari and minmatar space with your cheaplybought ravens insurance premiums should be linked to market value i expect the supply of 80m isk ravens will quickly dry up if people keep buying them just to selfdestruct the ship once its been insured for 90m in another empirethen again youd make more profit just selling the ships on the market since you could avoid paying an insurance premium in the first place this would also make suicide ganking a little more costly allowing a slight nerf to concord to balance it out
no incorrect its not about the ore typethe underlying assumption is that people mining in a 04 should be able to make more iskequivalent than any people mining in a 10 and that people in 00 should be able to make more than any other mining in 04actually make that people mining in lowsec should be able to get at least twice the equivalent isk value of a highsec miner 00 miners should get at least twice of lowsec miners with deep 00 miners getting twice the equivalent of shallow 00 minersthe lower the system security the higher the potential iskequivalent reward you should be able to obtainand thats simple gameplay or game mechanics common sense which right now is broken and this system can help fix it
again thats completely abusable what if i manipulate the market price of a certain ship in a remote backend region to thousands of times its normal price and then commit insurance fraud not to mention the fact that if it were implemented prices of ships would likely enter into an everincreasing spiral
youd better not be including me in that keynesians crack seriously though the reason crokite will be better than veldspar is that its rarer and harder to get your hands on none of these proposals will change that so far as i can tell if they do then yes crokite should be cheaper than veldspar im a fan of as free of a market as we can put into this game and floating mineral prices seem like a good way of doing that also thanks for the link good stuff i can definitely see why it won a nobel amazing how long it took people to clue in that the private sector makes its decisions based on things other than blind parameterization but at least theyve mostly clued in since then now all we have to do is apply the same analysis to all these infernal bailouts no no no make it dependent on global average market prices thats not seriously scammable
well i havent wanted to trot out this big gunbut the above example leaves me no choice get rid of insurance insurance is for something that is costly and rare the scenarios nyphur cooks up are ones that suggest blowing up a ship is not rare but in fact desirable so desirable people will do it as soon as they undockthis is why car insurance works in the real world you dont want to crash your car because1 you might get injured2 you might get suedof course there is the issue of moral hazard ie with insurance youll be less careful than without it but that problem in car insurance is off set by allowing insurance companies to seperate people by risk catagory and charge different deductiblesso long as people could have a reason to go out of their way and blow up their ships you have a problem the problem isnt mining it is insuranceor a global median so some twit cant build 2 domis put 1 on the market for 900 trillion or some suitably large amount sell one to his alt for 1 isk off marketeg contracting and make a killing if you really really want to keep insuranceactually that did seem to be the thrust of nyphurs post but oh well again my question why if the market evloves in a way that makes this not trueso what why care except for the pirates most players dont like low sec why the piratesyou have the assumption that mining in 04 should be more lucrative than it is but you have nothing to support thisbut 00 is less risky than low sec which shoots this viewpoint out of the water i know guys who can mine all damn day in 00 with far far less risk than in a 02 system why intel channels cyno jammers sovereignty etc all make 00 safer than low secno it is your belief of how the game should work the game mechanics as they currently are make low sec less desirable because it cant be secured like 00 and the ore in low sec sucks relative to the ore in high sec and 00 when you take into consideration the risks involvedyou want to make 2x in low sec vs high sec then put crokite and bistot roids there
details something thats an average in principle it doesnt have to be the mathematical mean of markets and yes i do want to keep it  its a mechanism to keep people from getting too badly in the hole if they have a run of bad luck a game especially a game like eve needs that to keep players playing
i suppose we could make it the mean of those ships soldother things that could be done is give players a finite number of insures a monthsay 3 or 5 maybe make this age dependent after that you are deemed a bad risk and you are cut off for a month or two now losing a ship actually means something besides just as a way to scam the systemi can appreciate that but the issue strikes me as one of insurance and that market vs tweaking and tweaking and tweaking mining for ever and a day so that peoples expectations of what mining should be are metoh and as for all the changes suggested here here is my prediction it will change nothing in regards to low sec for the most partwe have joe the miner he sits in his hulk on average 2 hours a day every day at the end of a month he makesmmmm lets say 350 million isknow he could be making 700 million isk in low sec if he can spend just as much time mining away there as he does in high secim thinking this isnt going to happen why pirates those loveable aholes in eve that like to fly in and kill people just because they can so now part of that 60 hours is going to be spent not mining now joe is going to be speding time buying a new ship gathering up the fittings and then getting it back to the low sec system he is mining that is lost time and thus lost isk and lets not forget the replacement cost of an exhumer that is going to further reduce the net return for joe now joe might even been earning the same as high sec or even lessin fact now joe can even mine some of the high end mins if he works on the right skills so now his empire income goes up so does his low sec income potentialbut those damn pirates joe wants to be left alone to mine in peace or with his corp of like minded playerslow secnawwant to get people into low sec get rid of the pirates but that is the point of low sec this is where small piratepvp corps can live and do what they do and to be clear im fine with this even tho it isnt a style of play that suits me ive learned how to cope and spend as little time there as possible
wont work median sale price sale prices can be manipulated at a cost of only the market fees for the transaction a few extra hundred fake purchases of a certain ship a day across all major regions for 1b each would cost sales tax of about 1b total per day but would raise the median price several hundred million a stockpile of those ships would then have increased in value by a few hundred million each since they could now be insured for a few hundred mil and selfdestructedand if you think there arent people with enough money and vindictiveness to get people to work over the entire eve global market on a ship pouring billions into transaction fees in the process think again if its possible to do it and possible to make a killing doing it people will do it stop fooling around with marketadjusted insurance and start coming up with alternatives if you want real market tracking insurance it would have to be paid in minerals and would need to pay out the ships mineral composition rather than isk
nevermind wrong thread
but theres a difference this idea will require a lot of artwork and mechanics reworking local wontof course they have considered it but its a matter of priority just like everything else i think its a high priority but we have to realize that ccp has limited resources they also have shareholders who they have to satisfy if they stop doing new stuff to attract users then the shareholders wont be happy im sorry but you have no idea it seems i can obviously not convince you that ccp listens but they do
lavista  this idea is dragging along for 3 three years if they were interested in it they would have done at least somethingin the meantime we gotoutpostoutpost upgradessov overhauljump bridges and cyno jammerspos modules outside force fieldnow some of these are quite heavy some of these are light changes however its still a lot of work to breakfix a badly designed systempos overhaul is not even a low priority task that devs could work on in spare time  it is still a very demanded issue it is important for lots of current eve playerbase and will be asked for by the future folks that stay in the game past 2 months and make it to 00actualy this is a more valuable feature than new eyecandy or ships as it keeps customers satisfied for long time not only 2 months or so until the new ships or eyecandy get boring  you can grow your playerbase by either getting new players or also retaining the old ones

increase the cost and reduce the lenght of validity of the declaration in line with the size of the corpalliances involved ie if a 2 man corp is war decced by a 26 member alliance they alliance pays more than if they decced another 26 member alliance and the declaration would last no more than 2 days aas opposed to the full weeki know thats rubbish but you can see what i meanlets face it the people wouldnt go to 00 so ccp bought unrestricted pvp to the people

im still trying to work out if they are back from holidays or a still off celebrating with their mouldy wine according to the way they think they tweaked missiles sbs should have been more effective against larger targets but the whole thing is just really a massive fail the problem with sbs is a battleship sized weapon on a frigate still thinking its on a battleship so the ideal target  obviously someones way of thinking is a capital sized ship or larger i would actually like stealth bombers to be put to good use with the ability to alpha falcons with the right setups that would give them a use and clean up the falcon whingers all in one go

yes please i love to fly sbs even though im terrible at it  and have noticed that they really are pretty awful now sbs were not that great before but fun but after the qr release nothing but sadness
i like the idea of being able toa set bomb as remote detonator orb set bomb with a time delay fusewith the caveatthe bomb itself would not move after being launchedif a bomb is set with timedelay it will explode whether or not the sb is alive or insystem conversely remote detonator bombs will die if the launching ship does or if the launching ship moves out of system edit forgot to support the threadskills should determine how many bombs a single character can have active at a time this would mean that a small pack of highly skilled sbs would be able to set up a major trap for incoming enemies much like a string of claymore mines do today or set up a cluster of bombs to detonate simultaneously at a predetermined time this would make the sb much more of a minefield generator and best used for defensive emplacements or sapping duties
sbs definitely need a revamp but definitely not this way theyre anticapitalbsbc strikeforce antifrigate role is already ocupied by tons of other ships of various sizes

currently ccp plays eve against its own customers i am not accusing ccp of giving any advantage to these corps in recent times be we all know past incidents certianly have crossed that line the moto of eve is trust no one and to that end we as players know we must hold that linei would offer that in the spirit of fair play and to remove all doubts while restoring a measure of confidence all members of ccp renew their commitment of fairness and sever all ties to the existing corporations and alliances they are in ending any doubts about their commitment to the people who quite frankly pay their salaryrecent events of the pos exploit have had the shattering effects of an event horizon and as much as i would like to believe ccps word i find it very difficult to stray from the moto which has been inplanted since the 1st time the nice pirate offered you your stuff back in a shiney new jetcani would ask my fellow players to join me in a call to end all doubts about ccps commitment to its customers and desire to end all suspicioni say this as a player not affiliated with any of the major corps i have no alts and no agenda other than seeking to create a new level of trust with ccp
great more drama
i for one have all the confidence in the world that ccp is not to be trusted
as an independent player in a small corp with no ccp ties i do not support this
this even if there have been problems the solution is not to kick devs out of the game
i did not say out of the game i said sever ties with corps and alliances
i understand what you meant i still dont support it
thats the point then they wouldnt be playing the same game as us
the success of stackless io has given rise to a new and fairly broken tactic for starbase defense a defender only needs to gather a relatively small force of battleships or long range cruisers and position them around the edge to the forcefield they duck out of the shield fire a round or two at their primary target then duck back in before anyone can return fire this makes it impossible to put dreadnoughts into siege mode without losses as a decent enough bs fleet will be able to kill them within 10minsto be this seems to be against eves riskreward system a small force of battleships can kill capitals at very little risk to themselves the ability to do this should at least allow for the chance for all battleships to be destroyedas far as countering this tactic goescapitals cannot lock onto a subcapital fast enough in the time it spends outside the shield let alone hit it with any drones it requires a large number of subcapitals to lock and kill a ship skirting the shield before it goes back inside and even then there is nothing to stop a ship using its local reps should it survive this is assuming that an attacking subcapital force is not taking substantial more damage from starbase guns  defenders skirting the shieldwebs are entirely ineffective once a battleship has begun moving into a forcefield there will always be enough inertia to carry it inside especially if it gets to activate an mwddoomsdays do not counter this a doomsday animation plays for 15 seconds giving plenty of warning to get back into the shieldi can think of three methods to counter thisthe first is to alter the range at which targets can be locked around a forcefield for example a defending ship can be locked once he is more than 1 metre from the forcefield however a ship within 5km of a forcefield is still treated as being in one and cannot lock their own targets open warp disruption fields or drop probesthe second is to have ships with the 60second aggro timer be denied access to any forcefield until that timer expires this would work in the same way as not allowing docking with recent aggro it would give time to kill or web a ship before it could be safefinally  some form of area effect scramweb field that does not require a target lock to reduce max velocity or disable mwd this could be in the form of an anchorable or heavy interdictor script however this solution would require the most balancing away from starbase mechanics
a small active group of defenders behind a fortification should be able to put up a hell of a fight against a larger attacking force remember the alamo
erm whats this got to do with stackless io that simply remedied a problem that came up as fleet fights got to ridiculous proportionsi can remember doing this in an osprey in 2006 to rep its shields and  the attacking dreads off buying time whilst more defenders come nothing new here and nothing that needs changed imo
i remember hearing fcs talking about this tactic on vent back in 2007 when i was a noob in frege so i doubt its a new feature or tactic of pos warfareplease correct me if im wrong
for those of you who believe players assault a starbase should always take billions in losses per tower reinforced or killed  how do you counter pos spam an invading force just needs to drop enough towers to take sov then keep them alive at very minimal risk to themselves and huge cost to the defenders even if they do lose a tower its only worth like 4500m compared to the potential 15bn in kills for each tower that is fairly broken riskreward to meif you want to defend something you should be risking something to do so
this feature avaible for a long time of course stackess io reduced lagg so this tactic can be used in greater scales as well ive been doing it on both attacking and defending side as well it works but you definetly need a lot of piloting skills to stay alive u know what i ment if uve ever been primaried by 30 dreds  50 support when sitting in a bs so my suggestion leave this feature as it is dont allow people to win battles just by pure blobbingfor you jitacitizen4756 my friend learn how to fly a ship properly and dont blame the game mechanics for your lack of piloting skills eve is not just game about skillpoints and isk u need to be smarter than your enemy as well
i havent played against this tactic myself but the natural response seems to be bring support ships you dont want your dreads swatting bses thats what your bses and hacs are for and furthermore even if it does cost you more to take down a pos than the enemy loses so what you chose to attack you ought to take higher losses in the default case the guy with the fort and the fixed defences ought to beat the guy who just has the fleet you have the initiative they have the advantage in a fair fight its how attack and defence always work
as far as i can tell being on a fortified defensive operation is suppose to offer your greater chances of survivabililty while being able to maintain a lesser degree of offensive capabilities i dont see the issue whenever i was in a pos sieging gang we all had rr and logistics and rarely suffered a loss if your going to ask this to be an exploit why not station hugging during a station fight to me the essentials are the same the target gets primed and deagresses gets some reps until he can dock same ideanot supported
the op brings out a fundamental design flaw in pos bubble game mechanic even if its not that effective to exploit its poor design in terms of game balanceto make comparison with station hugging you have 1 minute aggro timer that prevents you from docking this timer was put in game for a reason precisely same one as op is talking about now if pos shields didnt allow someone to enter if they still had 1 minute aggro timer then everything would be fair and it would be just like station huggingi want 1 minute aggro timer to effect people wanting to enter pos bubble
ephemeron would u risk your 9 bill isk 3rd nightmare to kill someone 15km away from a deathstar i dont think this would change anything in small scale pvp if there would be an agression timer for pos forcefields if your enemy had the opportunity warp to his pos then you allready messed up something the only thing it would achieve is to make pos defence even more imposible for small corpsalliances if they dont have the numbers so basicly generating even more blobs with more lag
the game has inconsistency that needs to be fixedstation hugging 1 min aggro timergate hugging 1 min aggro timerpos hugging no timersif you argue in favor of having no pos timers then you are also arguing in favor of removing gate and station timers because they all represent the same type of game mechanic on which people base their tactics
to be honest gate agro time can be annoying when someone deaggress with a bs and gets out of certain death by using it as a feature for stations i would do exactly the opposite increasing the aggro timer for 23 minutes
im not sure the three gate station and pos shield can be logicaly tied together with the inconsistency described gate and station both involve a session change insideoutside station or new system with all of the loading involved in that change moving through a pos shield is a matter of moving a few meters a friendly pos shield should not make a person wait 60 seconds to move back in
there is a small difference you are missingstation at least npc station and gate equivalent to a neutral port they will not usually freely accept a warship firing against some other shipfriendly pos equivalent to a friendly fortress they usually open the door for friendly units while firing against enemies following and attacking them that is a big difference to be precise
not an exploit jsut a good use of tactcis just assign fighters to an inty or fast locking frigs so u can lock there ships before they go back into the pos
both stations and gates are not player controlled so the ruleset is up to the npcs ccp in this case a pos is a player owned structure  thus player controlled and the rules are different 
ever wondered why local suck so badwhell here is an oldnew idealocal filterbasicly what i am thinking of is in line with the filters used in the overviewyou can filter the local channel based on player who have positive standing to you players with neutral standing to you players who have negative possibly hostile standing to you and war targetsprosthis would greatly increase the usability of the local window because right now even at a resolution of 1200 vertical 1920x1200 or 1600x1200 and maxed out local you are only able to see 2530 players without scrolling you can monitor the local in a glancewill reduce lag because a new player wont need to dl the whole local list upon entering a systemwill help find your fleetmate on jita local consi cant think of any right nowps here is a pic of what im thinking of
this would be better than the current option i think if implimented this should also include an option to view comments outside of current filter cant think of a better way to word that right now so that you could choose to see any comments made in local by people outside of your current selected filter
signedwould be a great feature
it would also be nice if there was an additional change to local that being the removal of character portrait in the list and just have character name to consolidate space
signedor at least make it optional as it is in the chat box on the left side of the local window ie add show portrait in the ops list of show  checkboxes
im am gabriel cruz and i approve this message
well i feel that the entire pipeline between oms and tama needs to be given dedicated servers to stop this lag only other thing to fix this is to fix the way drones work to stop lag drones are the main cause of fw lag fleet fights are fine untill people pull out the drones and even a few drones start lagging everything
supportedthe issue is server side lag not my pc
ffs any gang bigger than 15 becomes unplayable we cant get any decently big fleet out any moreits very frustrating to see your ship still alive desync and find yourself in clone bayccp needs to fix the lag problem or fw will die completely
yes god fix this friggen lag cant have any battles over 20 ships sometimes even that much screws everything up everything was fine till the latest server rebalance a few weeks back lately its just horrible
this is surely the only course of action that can save fw from being a complete washoutkanes idea should at least get a trial
signed
you are a heartless monster
ie miss a letter when docking so you are pushed in space to be killed by enemies great way to make low sec even more interesting
underhanded stuff makes eve eve removing that is bad
relying on game mechanics to set up safe fights sounds like every mmo i gave up on it aint eve
you really need to learn to insult someone better maybe a your momma joke wow has 1 million subs it is possible there are game mechanics in wow that are gasp good while i would never want eve to turn into a wow clone i still would like to have a 1v1 pvp fight or tournament style fight if i wanted to instead of getting jump and poped like a school girl from those meanie piratesi am no game dev but i am still pretty sure it wouldnt be that hard to make this happen and for some reason i think it might help eve in some way possibly by accepting change instead of hiding from it like i do sun lightand while i do accept that i will be flamed for this think about this on the wow forums thats all they ever do is complain and flame each other  but please if u do flame me try to do a good job kthxbye
maybe you should train basic reading to level 1 duel pvp flags are a very popular world of warcraft and wow clone mechanic sorry if you are clueless to one of the most popular video games ever but i like to know what i am talking about what i am against is the immunity from interference from other players while dueling in lownull sec the whole point of eve what makes it different from any wow clone is that you are free to do what you want which most certainly includes disrupting other peoples business what you propose is a restriction on this freedom by making it so you cannot interfere with duels in lownull sec this is against one of the primary concepts of eve nonconsensual combatas for your bravado i have no fear of noob mm drake pilot 146731 i dont even have to look at your killboard you are mmexbruce  you are whining about nonconsensual pvp  you fly a drake i have heard your whine before and it is pathetic i do not duel people in high sec space i do things like ohhh say help kick your previous worthless alliance out of fountain duels in high sec space are completely useless to the game they do not properly mimic lownull sec combat so they are useless for training streamlining the process is useless it is already streamlined you warp to a planetsafespot and drop a can with 1 ammo other play picks up 1 piece of ammo and you get to your carebear ranges and carebear each other to half armor and pretend like you are relevant to anything i have already briefly gone over what i would like a tournament style of combat to be in eve which would include gasp 1v1 duels your idea would bring nothing to the game if you came up with an idea that would improve the game i would certainly support it but stealing a carebear feature from world of warcraft and blindly wanting it thrust into eve is a terrible idea and you should be flamed a lot worse than you actually are
vaal heshe has said that it is high sec only there is no way this would ever work in nulllow sec and i know ccp would never do that this is a high sec only option so we can have some fun duals and lose ships for lols and victoria could u edit your first post to show that is high sec only so people do not get confused again thanks 
hey guysiUFFFDm still in reykjavik but i did receive some good news from the developers it sounds as if you might soon get your wishsince iUFFFDm constrained by the nda i canUFFFDt go into details about their rough plans but suffice it to say that your pleas have not fallen on deaf ears
oh crapwow in space anyone 
thanks bunyip i just hope its contained in high sec only and that low00 can still be ganked while in a dual
serious pwnage happening here
ive only pvpd once against someone else and it was a learning experience for me we didnt fight to the death for honor or whatever he was teaching people how to properly fight and how to fit your ship his shield tank was insane btwthe only issue with new things people will try to exploit it while im not exactly sure how pvp flagging would open up exploits im sure some people will figure it out and when that happens the devs will have yet more work bahill give my support as well although i dont pvp
are you ffing serious whos pleas more carebear hellokitty idiots please find a bridge ingame and jump off it
of interest to most of us is the concept of risk versus reward in eve and how that translates into various ingame activities often there seems to be much concern expressed by certain elements within the community that a real balance has yet to be achievedthere is also an issue of certain events in game that seem out of place and to me at least immersion breakingin addition a segment of our community is hampered by current mechanics with regards to being unable to truly perform what could otherwise be a viable profession in new eden as a service to our greater community and to in my opinion help to bring our universe closer to perfection i propose the following1 eliminate concord reward concord is immersion breaking period2 scrap the current bounty system in favor of the followingrisk a activities that currently generate an aggression flag will in addition also generate a criminal bounty no player generated bounties for example some hypothetical numbers flip a can 1000isk steal from a wreck 2500isk attack an innocent 5000isk destroy the ship of an innocent 100000isk pod kill 250000isk b the criminal has the ability to reduce current bounty by ratting or even collecting bounties from other criminals c if a player is podded while that player has a current bounty on his head the player loses the number of skill points equal the isk value of the current bounty d bounty accrual will not exceed the sp total of the character as you can see we now have a viable profession as a bounty hunter a realistic and rewarding scenario enabling hisec piracy and a significant risk factor added to balance it all outthank you
the thing that stands out the most to me is the bounty system i dont think i like your other changes but the bounty being a generated amount for various acts is nicely thought outdont like the skill point loss though that seems a tad unfair that said it would stop the friend or alt from podding and collecting the bounty
i stopped reading here your proposal will never ever ever happen
hahahahahhahahhaehehehehehehehohohohohoh coughgaspchokediesseriously where you on drugs when you posted thisthere are thousands of flaws with your idea but to pick out the most blatant onewhat happens when you start accruing large amounts of isk and then you get an alt to kill yourself to collect the bountyah yes a new sport isk farming by bloodreallyreallystupid ideaand thats ignoring the removal of concord
currently the jump from highsec to lowsec is a cliff just like the jump from lowsec or in some cases highsec to 00 recent improvements to ship hitpoints and an increased number of t2 ships have meant that these cliffs are exaggerated and more prevalent than theyve been in the pastfirstly i propose that the damage of sentry guns is dependent on the security status of the system this would be less of a cliff and more of a slope into 0004 150 of current damage03 100 of current damage02 50 of current damage01 25 of current damagesecondly i propose that sentry guns damage increases over time similar to the increasing concord response this would be a relatively slow increase perhaps 5 every 60 secondsthese changes have several effectsit would mean that 04 is slightly safer than it currently is hopefully this will encourage more pilots into lowsecit would mean that 01 is closer to 00 although pilots are still at the mercy of sentry guns and security hits hopefully it would encourage alliance warfare to spill over into empirea disorganised gangsolo pilot would have to rely on a high initial alpha strike whilst an organised gang could rely on logistics spider tanks or better ships this becomes easier as the systems sec status decreasespiracy can still exist and in fact is easier in the lowersec systems a gangpilot cannot simply camp a single gate for hours on end eventually the guns would overwhelm a pilot and they would be forced to warp out
not radical enough in my opinion but signed on the principle 200 in 04 and scaling down as appropriate to 25 in 01
youve got it  were ninja salvagers and looters that being said weve seen first hand the damage mission runners do to a system come to dodixie for the missions stay for the lag and we do our best to clean up the clutterregardless of whether we steal your mission item or not is it fair for the mission runner to reset their mission give me a rp reason why this might work oh all of the sudden were suddenly rocketed backwards in time this isnt star trekfairiness aside sorry couldnt resist its an issue that needs fixing at the very least devs must be held accountable to a certain level of discretion and this must be upheld across the board if its not fair to reset a mission because someone stole the mission item then everybody should be held to the same ruleim guessing no somebody seems a bit too biased against us
with all due respect valid reasons aside all your doing is weakening the barrier that leaves some risk to literally zero riskyou guys have it made in the shade you have literally no risk at all in what you do and yet you ask for moarif anyone is guilty of bias its you tchell right down to the coreyour just too damn proud to admit itthe road to hell is paved with good intentions
ill admit it  theres no risk today ive figured out that frigates my frigates anyhow can easily tank 3 mission bss for the duration of the salvaging expedition and that theres little a mission runner can do to combat what i do sure ill lose some salvage to fast tractors or blown wrecks but yeah theres nothing that can really hurt me in a missionkinda like the mission runners ehi invite you to look up an old post i made in regards to smarter ai including mission rats that would appear specifically to aggro suddenly appearing ninja salvagers and smarter ai that could follow you out of a mission if you ranboth of these options were ideas to increase the flexibility and immersion of the mission running system and not further bork it as it is today with the perpetually resetting mission hackim not biased per se but ill fight to keep what i have now for as long as i can
the point is that thie exploit dont happen the only proof you put out is the word of your unknown alliance mate that can set them reset i asked again and again for some prof at least the name of this guy that say he can get his mission reset regularly what you do is to cite yourself again like you were a source of divine truth i have never heard someone i know in game saying that he has got a mission reset after the mission goal item had been stole and i know enough mission runnersso ask this guy to post here saying what are his magic words to get the mission reset
wow thats a good argument it doesnt happen so theres no need to hold ccp accountable to a set of rulesim being rational youre being foolish im done responding to your foolishness its obvious you have no intent on agreeing so ill ask you again to troll elsewhere
im all for this fix as long as everyone in deadspace shares npc aggro its way too easy for a loot thief to roam about the mission freely while the mission runner himself is aggroed by 30 npcs webbed scrambled andor jammed if anyone jumps in friend or foe aggro needs to be reset and split among all present equallyif you can live with this then i wholeheartedly support your thread
you scream it exist it exist  remove the exploit but you dont care to prove it i can suggest you get a job as witchsmeller pursuivantyour thread speak of a mission reset exploit not of give the gm a comprehensive and fair set of guidelines so i reply to your thread and your op
6 monthz later and still no skill queue showz the lack of appreciation for the customer base this iz overwhelmingly wanted by the fanz get off the stick pot or whatever ur stuck on and do it

did you not even read the minutes from the csmccp meeting we had last weekfor everybody who still read this topic
at this point i think there are a lot of people who wont be happy till they see a dev blog on it maybe not until its implementedmy response to heretraining till level 5 training to a moduleship and training to a cert are unacceptable to me because they dont let players chose the skills they wantthe con can easily be answered with a no as most people would have other skill they could plan insteadif the answer is yes we would need the ability to add skill books to our character sheet before we meet the prereqs while blocking us from training until we meet the prereqsfor simultaneous training the con isnt relevant as if they want a short skill to train fast simultaneous training will only work if the total speed of all skills being trained is always the same as a single skill being trained assuming the attributes are the same if this does not hold people will still be logging in at odd hours to change skills the instant they endfor allowing a queue of 5 or more skills i dont see how the con too long periods without user interaction holds on my character level 1 of a rank 2 skill takes me 13 minutes meaning 5 of them is still under an hour but level 5 of the skill takes 7 days 17 hours not to mention bs 5 which takes about a month the length of the longer skills tells me that ccp didnt care about long periods of no user interaction when they coded the skill system so i dont see why they get to bring it up nowa single skill in the queue would be enough for me as would simultaneous training of two skills but a longer queue or simultaneous training of more skills would make me happier until it get to the point where i cant use all of themmeaning a lot more database calls
when you sort by type it should automatically sort by meta type in forward or reverse order as desired
supported
full support for inventory management upgrades since alliance hangars apparently aint gonna happen they should at least give us as much as they can personally i feel that inventory management should have about as many options attached to it as the compare button on info screens but that is prolly asking too muchedit forgot the thumb
just make it so that you have to put some sort of conditions in a war dec im sick of being decced by 00 corps who arent good ebnough to be in 00 who just war dec you and never respond to any calls of why and when they do respond its because you were there
i support this only because it helps the ransoms come in besides eventually we keep deccing the same corp they will eventually stop paying the ransom and then we still get to kill them still gets the 24hr cool down period and the ransom goes to the war deccing corp not to ccpconcordidea supported
genius granted theres nothing new but simply having the ability to extort using in game mechanics is rather nice its not as if it would take a whole heap of developer time either its a fairly simple concept using already existing mechanicsyou clearly missed the privateer nerf doing so now would cost more than you could reasonably recover and whilst it may be profitable to do this over a long period of time you wouldnt be able to spam wardecs at everyone you see to make a quick buck
i dont even do wars yet but i still think its a good idea amazing how none ccp members can come up with better ideas than ccpdoes this mean something

1 interesting idea and one i can kind of agree on the problem is how you would implement this would there be a second local window to constantly monitor or would the people show up in general local in this way you would also receive some idea of the ship type the opponent is in those who notice the number rise can count how long it takes to have the avatar show up2 interesting idea but how would that benefit either the pvpers or the nonpvpers3 this was done to account for the removal of mass as a calculation admittedly they did go a bit too far for smaller ships but it also helps the pvper4 this was dealt with in the nerf of wcs so thereUFFFDs no real need of it also if you were to include it you should also include barges exhumers astrometric frigates etc5 no while this idea was posed before i think the current system works well enough if you donUFFFDt like it donUFFFDt camp gates and instead surf the asteroid belts6 t2 ships have the insurance that they do because people are supposed to use their brain before engaging in combat iUFFFDd be perfectly content if they just removed insurance all together7 agreed on this point alliances can now be everywhere and nowhere at the same time using jump bridges reference the recent bob stunt for an example supported8 while i agree with station hugging being removed it should be instead handled in a different way the aggro timer should prevent a ship from docking all together if it comes from a player  npc aggro timers shouldnUFFFDt affect this9 agreed 100 cloaking ships should be limited to the highercost t2 ships to give those who use cloaks for reasons other than surveillance a second thought10 i agree generally it would help the newer players and those with multiple accounts could simply use a slot from one of their other accounts to accomplish the same thing11 no if this gets implemented youUFFFDll need to compensate the npc corps in some way shared aggroability to erect poses npc corps already have enough penalties12 they might be able to do this but only if they donUFFFDt leave the alliance in the first 48 hours this way they wonUFFFDt be a real player in the warjust my 02 isk from a carebear who understands the validity and necessity of pvp from the industrial side
i do agree with goums post for once
this wont bring any more prey to the belts i agree that local needs to be changed actually it needs to be replaced with an alternative relying more on skill but not being able to scan rifters at all will just mean the predator has 100 of the advantage over a miningpve shipno lets move away from spawn camping gatesthere needs to be a balance there should be a chance to escape an engagement an aggressor finding a target should not always equate to a kill for the aggressor i would need to see numbers from ccp suggesting that not enough ships are being destroyed in order to agree with you on this if it isnt affecting the overall economic health of eve then it doesnt need changinghell no so a player running from a gate camp of 5 spawn campers is a sissy  basically you want instant death for anyone not in a blob just nothis sounds reasonable but again id need to see how it would affect the overall economy of the game ships destroyed vs ships created serverwide id like to see this happen but you said it yourself dont fly what you cant afford to lose so not really a problem huh good point i agree
no dont like station huggers then stop station camping no station campers no station huggers simpleunless youre planning to give some kind of survival chance for other ships to survive an aggression then no and using a scout alt is bullsht 1 spawn campers usually have eyes monitoring whos jumping in when a scout jumps in there is no camp to be seen when a main jumps in surprise 2 using alts is metagaming 3 having friends follow you around every time you make a low sec jump is ridiculous to say the least i agree to an extent see abovelol way over the top although i wouldnt object to some form of taxation by npc corpsthe whole point of declaring war is to disband a corpalliance if youre accomplishing that dont see why youd want to prey on ex members so this ones an iffy for me
i realize that im going to have to repeat this about a billion times but for expediencies sake i did not fully flesh out any of these ideas many of them like this one still need some more meat on the skeletonfor instance perhaps a new module that will increase the chance of the scanner finding ships with a smaller signature radius more meat on the bonesim sorry but this isnt call of duty you dont spawn at a gate if you get pod killed then you go back to a clone from where you can choose to undock or not you can also choose to jump through a gate or not gate camps are never going to go away as long as they remain the primary means of entry and egress from a solar systemmoving away from gate camping in eve would be like going to a call of duty server and saying hey guys lets not shoot at each other tonight well just sit around singing songs of peace love and joythe overall economic health is now the driving factor of eve really ok lets go have a really long discussion about ferrogate in another thread cause the economic health of eve is a farce at this pointim saying simply this if you are in a hauler or industrial then you should have a good chance of being able to get away wcs are a good means of providing an escape on the other hand an armageddon who foolishly jumps into a gate camp of 5 guys shouldnt be able to laugh it off and wave by to the campers in local simply because he has 8 wcs in the lows wcs need some sort of limiting factor whether its limiting the classes of ships they can go on or how many can go on a single shipthe average player base of eve is a t2 ship player base this was not true when insurance was introduced into the game but it certainly is now most players flying around in t2 ships when given the option of fight or flight will choose flight simply because of the cost of replacement make insurance payout at least even half of what the hull is worth would cause more people to stand and fightthis is the best argument you could propose if you undock from a station then you should be prepared to fight the little yellow and black warning sign in the lower left hand corner of your station screen is a consent to pvp buttonwith ambulation just around the corner theres plenty to keep the sissies occupied inside the station anyhow
a 15 million isk module that uses a pathetic 30 cpu to fit takes only 510 days to train for and eats less capacitor than a civilian shield booster should not equal complete and total immunity from detection any argument in opposition to this statement is silly and illogicalnpc corps shouldnt be tax shelters plain and simple if you want a tax shelter then go form a corporation of mission runners and make the base tax 0 what gave you that silly idea ive never war decced an alliance in my life to make them fall apart i war dec the alliances that i know will provide targets i personally couldnt care less about the political landscape of eve and most of my fellow pvpers dont either what i do care about is war deccing an alliance immediately 56 corporations leave and then two days after the war dec is over i go back and review those corporations and guess what theyve rejoined youve used the world bull a couple of times and this definitely fits into the bull category
since when do wcs modules help with bubbles and hics 
maybe they will consider it when all the uk players start to drop there accounts due to the high and climbing cost of playing i know im struggling
id like to see this but i dont think it will happen until the pound gets stronger but supported as it makes it easier for me to work out my subscription costs had the suggestion been made 612 months ago it may have been more actively supported however i suspect the uk will be taken into the euro fold within the next 1218 months so what does it matter
would be nice ofc if ccp would support all national currencies but i doubt that it would happen as in essence what you are asking is ccp to pay the currency excange fee instead of you as customer plus there is danger that everyone and his dog are running for weakest currency available at that moment to minimize subscription cost thus introducing additional uncertainity to ccp incomethe way pound is going at this moment on the other hand i would not be too surpriced if you guys would have also euros in 3 to 5 years assuming euro will not crash also ofc crashing currency usually happens with heavy money printing and eurozone is also printing rather hard
local for mission runnersnow i havent checked but i have a feeling the server is the one sending some sort of code or possibly even the whole textnot to mention these little messages are extremely annoying removing them completely would be an improvement not to mention a possible improvement in the node
i see why they have things like that for immersion and so on but in practice they dont really work very well id prefer to modify rather than remove but the current system is kind of lame that said bandwidth is not a problem here most missions dont even generate text and the few that do arent going to cause much damage seriously its plain text
ehhhh less text yes none noworks as intended even if its a bit annoying at timesbandwidth wouldnt be an issue in this casetext is just bits off of a byte
i never even look at local when im mission runningso i end up missing most of those messages maybe another windowtabwhatever that can be turned off if a player doesnt want it
cool
i would have liked this even when i started playing over 2 years agoi still like to have it nownever understood why we couldnt do it before either
i like the general idea very much i think what your original concept needs is1 making it easier to implement into current eve framework2 making it more useful especially in high sec3 making it more balanced and prevent abusein the following text i try present you with some suggestions i dont expectto solve everything but perhaps i come up with some useful improvementsnumbers in bracket show which of abovementioned goals its aiming forthe habitat ship i suggest a single ship type habitat ships market group to be added eitherone hull type per race or simply just a single ship 1 ship would have no highmedlow slots at all and no rig hardpoints eitherlike a freighter instead a current anchoring system would be utilized as muchas possible although some tweaks would be necessary 1 this ship could be deployed anywhere only limitation would be minimaldistance 05 au or so from major celestial objects like stargates stationsmoons etc to avoid interference with other eve life habitat would bedeployable even in 08  10 23 deployed ship would act simply as a slightly different type of control towerfrom now on ill refer to a deployed habitat ship simply as a habitat 1the habitat habitats could be anchored quite close next to each other making thepossibility of building a whole space cities2 habitat would contrary to a pos generate no shield and its hps would beway lower 3 habitat structures anchorables would be basically very limited versionsof current pos structures certain areas moon mining reactions would not be possible to do in thehabitat at all while other stuff like blueprint research would be available ata cost of severe penalization and disadvantages compared to pos will bediscussed below 23 habitat would have no reinforced mode 3 habitat would have no intrinsic defenses but there would be special typeof batteries available as anchorables 3 in high sec racial starbase charters would be required as an additional fuel3 habitat that is online ie has fuel would be impossible to detect both byscanner and probes 2 i think last one needs a thorough explanation imo it is necessary that thehabitat itself cant be detected otherwise it is completely useless in lowzerosec however while not the habitat itself the ships operating the habitatand players will be required to operate their habitats a lot due torestrictions that would apply will be detectable and even better it wouldntbe a deadspace so probing them out wouldnt be hard once a solitary habitat isdiscovered it would be basically lost to raiders as habitat servicesproviding structures being it refining arrays assembly arrays minilabs anddefensive batteries would be way too ineffective on their own it wouldencouraging ppl to build a conglomerates of habitats mainly to share defensesand partially to increase service capacity larger the conglomerate higher thechance of detection it because more ppl would be operating it in detectableshipsto be continued
the habitat structureshabitat would have a powergrid and cpu like pos control tower of course only afraction of what small pos has a new set of structures basically derived frompos ones would be added with various functionsi propose following habitat structures further tweaking may be necessary forbalances sake defensive batteries  generally way less effective than those of a posprimary defence of a habitat as proposed above would be not to get detectedin the first place 3 minilab doubletriple research time multiplier blueprint must be presentthis would allow new players research some basic stuff but noone sensible wouldput a t2 bpo into a paper installation like this due to habitat lowereffectiveness and relatively high running costs it wouldnt imbalance thecurrent bpobpc industry 2 assembly miniarray similar penalties i see no reason to limit productionto ammo given those penalties are severe enough to make it useless for bigindustrialists 2 long range survey scanner special new piece of equipment that allows a minerto scan a whole solar system and gives him aggregated stats of the belts likeasteroid belt total amount of ore approximate number of rocks orerockasteroid belt 1 1234567 1234 100005asteroid belt 2 6234567 123 5000015asteroid belt 3 12234567 2345 600005numbers i just made upthis would be useful in those systems where there are 10 asteroid belts whichare constantly mined out by  well by those who mine them out  thisslightly smells of a fluff but hey if this wouldnt be too hard to implementit would increase the usability of habitat both in low and high sec even more 2 tactical news broadcasting relay  a ministructure giving the owner a mildto mediocre improvement in his combat effectiveness like 510 provided he isin the same solar system can be anchored in high security space only becausethere are no tactical news available in low00  this would be a motivationfor owning habitats for mission runners as well as give a small edge to thedefender of high sec deployed habitat given he fights a comparably skilled foe 2yes this one is a little crazy i knowone more part to go
raiding habitatsi believe the abovementioned system makes habitats not only a good thing tohave but also makes raiding them a viable business because habitats would be like an added value for successfully scanning a playersometimes you scan someone down in a safespot and sometimes near his habitatand sometimes you find out a whole habitat conglomerate and its time to callfor friends and have some fun as habitats themselves are impossible to detect it cant happen that onefinds a habitat without anyone knowing so theres no need for any mails likehabitat is under attack because either you are there or you build togetherwith someone you trust who is there and should send mail to you concord protection in high sec is interesting question there are twopossiblities1 make habitat ship and all components very cheap 10m ship 13m structuresbut make concord not guarantee safety of these structures attacking habitat inhigh sec would then act like flipping a can  defender might choose whether hewants to shoot back and allow attacker to hit him too or just to watch but tohave his ship safe2 make habitat more expensive and cover it by concord protection in highseci think the option 1 would add more to the game as high sec is already rigidenough as it is so to be able to legally destroy someones cheap habitat andloot it would be a welcome change explanation might be likewarning concord police force does not consider citizens space habitats apriority as everyone is given the chance to live peacefully in stations assuch attacking a habitat while still considered a crime will not result in adeadly response but rather only in a security status hitsummarymany ppl agree that there should be something like mini pos available in gameespecially for newer players shipbased habitats proposed by bunyip might besuch a solution what i propose here are adjustmens to his original designrefining usability and desirability of such habitas as well as making themeasier to implement within the current eve framework as i assume it mightlook like ithabitats would serve as a sort of minipos their appeal in high sec would be anchorability in 0810 possibility to me researchcopy blueprints despite doing it way lesseffectively and in a fairly risky way blueprint present in the habitatcompared to the pos various minor advantages for minersmission runnersin lowseczerosec habitats would work as a personal mini station offering basic stationservices at remote places always with less effectivity and more risks involved for a big corps and alliances habitats could most certainly act as a greatlogistics support behind enemy lines always nice to build a little habitat complexto support your fleet  further implications in this field need to be thoughtout as i have little experience therefor pirates aye i wouldnt forget about you folks habitats would add a wholly new profession of habitat raiding they would add some extra fun into scanning down ships because from time totime you find yourself warping to someone who is being supported by sentriesof a small space city loot blueprints manufacturing materials stuff ppl store there frommissionsplexes temporarily salvage from t2 built habitation moduleswell thats it kinda long sorry  i wonder if someone really read through it
i know the problem it is sitting in front of your keyboard did u ever think about updating your drivers directx or windowscause if the eve premium client obliterated your system with the specs u posted you seriously did something wrongand im not gonna support this topic ever cause i want the guys working on the classic client to work on something usefullbtw with my old 8800gts 640 even slower then your card i was able to run a premium client at 1920x1200 and high settings and a highdef movie on the other screen i hope u get the clue
fixdstop ranting you fraking loon youre making us look bad nothing has been released and you dont have any of the specseb
yeah i like this a lot  the sig reduction makes sense and gives eccm modules something else to offer just need to balance those numbers a bit but i think youre on to something here
i like the proposal to script them but not give them a set additional sensor strmore likeunscripted eccm ii  60 sensor str 12 signaturescripted eccm ii  120 sensor str or 25 signaturewith faction  meta levels scaling appropriately
noeccm are in balenced whit other moduals
i think we all have had the interbus system on our wishlists in some way or formwe all feel its needed for logistical purposes and to increase our gameexperiencei think we need to think outside the normal gaming mechanics in order to get something that is actually going to work and get usedso i am suggesting we think about some sort of non griefable system in order to motivate anyone from using this service it has to be a no looser situationthat is why i think we need to make the system some kind of contract based when a player picks up an interbus hauling contract he shouldnt be forced to do risk evaluation in short the ship should be destroyable but he should be unpoddable if he isnt risking anything but an ad hoc ship a lot more players would work these contracts in mechanics interbus could simply give you a clone for the mission thus you simply return to the original station if you get shot downif you pod an interbus pilot you get standing penalty and this in turn should make pirates an incentive to leave them all alone because they would loose the chance of using the service themselvespackages should be dropped to space and be undamaged but only accessible using special hacking services in pos interbus packages should always be contraband in all sec space if delivered to a 00 concord or interbus station it should get a reward and the package returned to the origin station to enable redoing the missionprice and reward should be based simply on jumps and system aggression situation number of destroyed ships last 24 hours and standingi think this is somewhat simple to create and would really solve a lot of logistics issueson a side note some attention should be on balancing this so non interbus hauling would still be worthwile and preferably even more lucretive
supporting faction eccm and target painters but none of the rest enhanced lses would make passive shield tanking even more terribly overpowered
i would support all but faction lse or 1600 plates to many hp in the game already
the problem is one of scalecast your minds skywards what do you imagine me i think of huge gas giant planets asteroid fields with asteroids 100s of miles apart but an almost endless supply of them stretching on forever flowing twisting nebulas comets flying through space on orbits a million years longyou think of big things yaif eve was done to a realistic scale then just one system would happily contain 50k players 100k players or even a million playersbut eve is not a simulation of life in space 1000s of years from now just look at the physics i mean wtf so how do you bridge the gap between the edges of the imagination and new edenyou have to think big one of the best suggestions inho is to look at the asteroid belts make them encircle the planets or at least make them 1k  2k rocks big and thin them out that way you would start to create the feeling of huge scales a belt stretching off out of sight in both directionsnow lets look at the warp drive why do you need bookmarks or an object to jump to this makes no sense and makes any system feel small surely you should be able to tell your warp drive to take you where ever you ant to go in a system feed in the coordinates and zooooom your thereeven the biggest system feels tiny when there are only 30 or 40 things you can actually warp too you should be able too warp anywhereopen your mind and expand your horizon
slightly different formulation since i think we should recognise that overcrowding is or will be an issue my own personal impression is that new eden now feels too crowded already though i can appreciate that others might not feel the same way crucial points to understand about the perception of crowding are that different pilots seek to do different things in space and thus seek different population densities and thus the number of solarsystems must scale up faster than a 11 ratio with pilot count to achieve the same distribution of population density ie going from 20 k to 40 k pilots online 2UFFFDUFFFD might require going from 5 k to 20 k solar systems 4UFFFD to maintain the same sense of crowdednessperhaps a policy of increasing density is intended though it would be nice to know what is the intended densitygiven at some point new eden became or will become overcrowdedquestion 1 how is that measuredquestion 2 what should be done about it at that pointof course the answers as alluded to above start to get complicated pretty quickly overcrowded for a highsec mission hub is different from overcrowded for a 10 truesec solar system
dude please dont let them backburner this any longer ccp needs to come thru on this one it is long overduethanks to the whole csm for raising this issue keep the fire going guys dont give up on the skill queue
we aim to please we are just as eager for this feature as you so stay tuned
it sounds really good and i am looking very much forward to see what eve is like 2 years from now i mean so far eve has changed since it was first released but most of those changes came from ccp now that the community has a real option to not just suggest but also help prioritize and give feed back on ideas and suggest improvements i think that eve will be a more balanced universe then it already is because in the end a few hundred people cannot ever hope to identify and correctly prioritize the needs of the thousands of people playing eve
did oz get to see a doctor
thanks for all the work guys
see a doctor i saw dr eyjo i may have alcohol poisoning right now from drinking with darius and a couple of devs last night thoreyka vodka 4tmfw
nice work guys keep it real
cyno jammerpoppedby a recon gang have you ever attacked a competently fitted cyno jammer pos
great idea  hope somebody in ccp will think its their idea and run with it
signedcreating tabs would be amazing not only could you sort your items much more efficiently but when you are hauling the items that a group of players has acquired you dont need to log or remember everything you were responsible for carrying you could easily create a tab dump the items in there and split it later without any hasslebrainstormi guess to add to datas idea it would be nice to have a sorting function and a tag that could make certain tabs universal or local to each stationsorting be able to assign item groups to certain tabs and those items will automatically be dumped into the proper tab when you click a sort function after a full cargo load of ratting the salvage ammunition weapon turrets and misc modules would all be sorted into the proper tab with one drag n drop and a right click option on all or selected itemstags you can make a tab like ammunition and set the tag to universal now you have an ammunition tab in all stations then you can make a tab blueprints with the tag set to local and it will only appear in that station with this feature you wouldnt have to create all your tabs in every station and you wont have tabs for specialized sorting clogging up every hangar you have items in
i like the idea and it would save a fortune in station containers everytime i movedthe next logical step would be to merge the items and ship hanger buttons into single button my equipment with the hanger being an additional tabi would restrict the number of equipment hanger tabs to a max of 7 each tab then can contain freight cans that sub divide that group thus if i want to move everything is already packed in freight cans and you just load up and move why 7 its in line with the corp hanger so the mechanics already exist they just get extended to the player i also cant see any reason for more as this is the way i would name the sectionsgeneralhighsmedslowsammominsoresalvagerigsthere also needs to be a way to see whats in a can without opening it almost like an inventry option on the a right click menu especially for remote viewingedit  list format
heres another scenario what if youve been playing awhile say 2 or more yearsmarch will 3 years for me  and oneday you come up with a name you like better the option now is to just deal with what you have now or start a new character i dont know about everyone else but i dont want to start over just to get a different name not that i dont like the name i got just have one i like more known aliases  i like that ideaagain i dont see what the big deal is personally i dont see it effecting the way others play hell you can even do some roleplaying as to the reason for the name change though something like this will need a limit
whatever the important part is that it becomes a system that adjusts to the market as it actually exists with minimal possibilities for abuse instead of being the current system that treats base prices six years out of date as holy writ i dont care about the details so long as it meets that goal effectively
why  because good gameplay is more important than realism thats why we also have submarines in motoroil instead of ships in spacewhy care  because the lack of appropriate rewards makes people stay away from lowsec because of the pirates little over 2 years ago lowsec was a thriving place to live in because rewards were decent enough to compensate the increased risks now they no longer areand its not a random unsupported assumption its one of the basic tenents of the game which has been tortured long enough sacrificed on the altar of economic realism
i dont want to be mean but there are no magical solutions to any problems you cant just say whatever and i dont care about the details the details are what needs to be worked out before you know if the idea is even feasible yes in an ideal magical world the insurance would track the build cost of a ship in practice thats almost impossible to implement while keeping it free from manipulation quite literally the only system that i can see working is switching from isk to minerals and these arent just fiddly implementation details  these are core mechanics that we need to look at and say yes or no tolets say insurance was replaced by npc ship salvaging youd hire an npc salvaging company for say 10mmonth to service you in a region and from then on any time you lose ships in that region they return 70 of the minerals required to build it to their home station youd then have insurance that tracks market values but that decision to switch isk to minerals causes some farreaching effects on the eve economy the isk flow into the game from insurance disappears which must be estimated to see what effect this would have on eves current rate of deflation and see what problems might arise furthermore the insurance system would be reducing demand for all the materials used to build ships by up to 70 effectively increasing the amount on the market by a huge amount compared to now what happens then is anyones guess these arent fiddly implementation details theyre actual gameplay concerns that need to be discussed between players and with the ccp economist
youre right of course the details do matter  there are plenty of ways of doing it that dont meet my goals thing is ccp is going to do the detail work either way we can suggest mechanisms but theyve got to vet it no matter how good or bad the initial idea im not convinced that mineral insurance is the right way to go  as you say itd be farreaching  but even insurance based on actual mineral prices instead of base prices would go a long way towards fixing this it still leaves a fairly gaping hole for faction ships which is unfortunate but solving the problem for t1 and t2 is still a huge improvement over the status quo and if youre really worried about faction ships not having a market value make lp tradeable somehow
you do know what the median is right youd litterally have to sell 50  1 of the domis on the market in the entire game could it be done yeah maybe but it would be fcking obvious as hell what is going on much more so than the moon mining exploit call it an exploit and be done with ityou could also make it the average median value for something like 30 days now you have to make fake sales orders for 30 days for 501 of domis in game just to try and get that price up to 1000000000 if you fail you are now outusing the latest data at eve central 1097 dominix bbs for sale as a guide 342576000000 isk lets just say you are out 343 billion if you fail and that doesnt cover the 40 billion or so you needed to actually make those domis to begin with and youll need about 153 trillion isk to make the transactions and youll have reserve all that isk for 30 days just to try and influence the priceso yeah theoritically it could be done i dont think it is anywhere near as easy as you make it out to beas for basing the isurance payout on the value of the isk embedded in the shipim fine with that too make it a 30 day moving average of the median price of the oreat least i got you talking about the real problem and not the symptom
regarding deflationi think the worries of deflation in the game are overstated why here is the problem with deflation1 you go out and secure resources to make 100 units of x lets say it costs for discussion purposes 500 isk2 you make your 100 items3 due to deflation you can only get back 300 iskyikes youd stop that line of manufacturing post haste its a total loserbut do we see this are ships like the megathron not being made no so what is going onhere is an idea deflation is an artifact of the introduction of new ships into the gameat first these ships are of limited value and purchased by peope who want to one of the first to own the neat shiny new toy real world example the iphone people lined up and paid a premium to buy the phone to them it was worth it to be one of the first with this new technology of course like in eve they whined bitterly when the rest of the market waited till the price came down and then boughtbut hey people whineso when you have new items introduced into the game then there is a potential for deflation to show up in various indices simply because the new ship goes from selling for 1 billion to 250 million due to competition
signeddrones are a secondary offensive system much like missiles are in comparison to guns every single thing missiles have should be crossreplicated to drones as well as theres absolutely no reason for disparityalso in reference to this issue as well please look at denerfing the eos myrmidon and also providing a buff to the oneiros via a bigger drone bay for more rep drones perhaps even limiting it to rep drones as otherwise its a pants logistics shiprationale for this is that blasterboats received a big nerf with the speed nerf and gallente is meant to be an up close and personal punch you in the gob race plus drones currently a myrmidon cant take out an ubertank drake which is ridiculous and the eos is severely capped in its capacity

that eye candy keeps the younger player happy gives something nice to look at while they pew pew pocket money mounts up you knowthe older player proberly into industry has made such a commitment 
ccp have said they will not remove local without changing scanning mechanics to allow for a similar level of intelligence gathering as for artwork well ccp has been revamping art assets entirely anywaythe greatest stakeholders not necessarily shareholders in this game are you me and the rest of the player base with an unhappy playerbase ccps shareholders i wasnt even aware they were publicly traded but thats for another discussion i suppose and investors will certainly be very wary about their investment in this corporation they have projects in the works for new players the everimproving new player experience the boxed version walkinginstation and possibly more im forgetting its unwise of them to place us older players at a lowpriorityof course you cant and thats not your job anyway i dont mean to belittle the work that you and all the csm do i voted for you after all its simply frustrating that something that has gotten this much attention from the forum regulars at least has not had so much as a peep from ccp in regards to their implementation plans
yeah also make looking through 1000s of bpos and bpcs a bit nicer
lets hope its not too much work
1and what about price changes for bombs 6 mil for chance to be killed  too much i think 
1in current situation bomber must be boosted via increasing explosion radius or velocity because now it is absolutely dead ship

please please put a word in so that they dont implement it as a train for this certificate option it was mentioned at fanfest a major portion of the fun in eve is the offline planning in this case picking the skills yourself those who want to train for a cert can just add those skills to the queue themselves also great to hear that they have noticed the unwashed masses d
and please please can they put 7 implants btw 
should have been done a long time ago
the skillsystem should never have been developed without it 
good point
can one of the csm please confirm that they will take this issue forward to ccp
does lovedogg  sexdogg didnt take long for the alts to start pushing in their votes i hope ccp pays attention on whos putting in the votes 
more likely to be your alt matrix skye
they are not playing it with you unless you are in their corpalliance they are playing it against you it is like a fox in the hen house no matter how well ya know that foxsooner or later the chicken look to goodno matter if you are a supporter of detractor i think we all would love for this constant suspicion to end as long as ccp is directly playing for corps who play against their customers their word will have a deserving degree of incredulity
never trust ccp to do anything about anything and hack cheat and exploit your way to the top
kinda hard to evaluate your own product if you dont even play with it including areas of highest risk in credibilityyou people are so high strung on paranoia wait eve is all about paranoiathere out to get me no no not the white coats anything but the padded mmffffhhpphhh screams
i as a member of the csm had meetings with the devs gms pos exploit research team and even the ia department after having talked to them i concluded that the measures ccp implemented to prevent their employees interference with ingame politics andor the welfare of individual playerscorpsalliances were sufficient they seem to be taking this very seriously since the t20 incident unofficial chats with individual employees also confirmed that there were strict regulations indeed what i heard there in reykjavik regarding the followup of the t20 incident convinced me completely the time of ccp staff interference with ingame politics is over
so devs would have to announce their characters then right you dont think that will unbalance the game either they form ccp ingame which would be even more rife with abuse potential or they sit in npc corps and wind up looking more like mascots than players secrecy of dev characters with internal affairs backstopping to check for abuse is the best option
they have systems ok what systems who oversees those systems would it be ccp again isnt this like a michael jackson day care i am not paranoid at all i am in fact being quite logical i know that if the opportunity exists to get an unfair advantage in a game of anon people that advantage will be used i think for the 150 a year i am dumpin in i should be able to ask these questions and get a conclusive answer lets do a short hypothetical if ccp had its own named corp with its emps as players what would your thoughts be on the fairness of them crushing your pos and destroying your ships you would be podnow what is the difference between that and a major corp with a ccp member in their corp nadda zilchdevs need to test game mechanics they can do this without playing the game in a player corp we are the customers eve is the product what is going on here is like buyin a ipod and having steve jobs show up to break it all the while telling you it is fairhonestlyam i that far off base here please if someone can pose an open minded reasoni am all ears to hear it
someone has a very big chip on there shoulder that or an axe to grindwhat i find utterly hilarious is you comparing an ipod to a video gameand ipod is a piece of hardware you buy it one time fee and you own it i hope steve jobs smashing it well thats just proving how foolish you are for giving it to a total stranger  o oh and steve jobs is not apple hes steve jobs a human being who happens to work for apple granted a figurehead but hes just a manif your going to compare eve online to a real life object then at least have the sense and intelligence to use a subscription based item like a newspaper magazinebecuase eve online is not a one time purchase item its a subscription based itembut sense you didnt have the brains to figure that out i guess its safe to assume you wont bother hearing me let alone listening to anyone else who are wise enough to see right through younow if you excuse me i have my interents ships to attend to because this is a game and its supposed to be funccp are doing a fantastic job and they can do whatever the frak they want hell id be honored to have a dev in my corporation at least i know someones paying attention to the game mechanics and it would be just a little bit obvious if they abused the systemall your doing is spewing the vomit of paranoia and conspiracyswow is that way oh and your fired i never asked you to represent me or my corporationwe the shadow cadre can speak for ourselves thank you very much please exit the stagethanks
this seems like a good start however i would request that at the next csm meeting it be suggested that all ccp employees chars are independantly audited annually by an external company much in the same way as most companies work when their accounts are auditedim not asking for devs to be named or removed from alliancescorps just to have a transparent system in place that the players can trusti dont support the ops position in fact i find it refreshing that the devs and other ccp members actually play the game and experience the same issues we players do desync lag etc they can also test bug reports and possible exploits outside of a test environment
why would i trust an external company more then the guys that bring me this game how on earth could they discover anything ccp doesnt want them to find out ccp has made mistakes but seems sincere in its efforts to prevent future incidents they are in the best position to monitor these issues anyway if you dont trust in their efforts then the trust in dead and buried and no manner of gimmick will be enough to restore it let them play the game and force them to try aspects of the game they are involved in developing let ccp monitor them for any abuse if they cant no one else sure as hell cant
yes youre that far off base i work at a software development company in real life our clients pay thousands per license and hundreds per license per year for support and upgrades we take the best care of our clients we can our clients are not authorized to dictate internal company policy if we do a bad job  they go buy software from our competitors period get over it
great more dramaif you dont trust them dont let the door hit you on the way outbtw just in case noone mentioned it yet  i call dibbs on your stuffbuhbye
pay for an ipod once much like eve you do not own those songs i actually do not have an axe to grind i see this as a way to end all the conspiracy theories ccp in my opinion is deserving of them as long as they have players in corporations that play against their customersi understand the need for devs to work with the mechanics of the game however it is not necessary to play withfor customer corps and alliances obviously i am not speaking for those in opposition nor do i care much for the bile being spewed i have not insulted any of you i am simply looking for a constructive conversation i find this type of response more akin to wow if anythingit is pretty funny how people get so pod over a simple discussion my postion is not set in stone only a fool thinks they know 100 that goes for those that believe ccp 100 and for those who follow conspiracy a 100my pov is not either but when someone tells me to trust them and that they are monitoring it after what are clearly far reaching incidents i think it is high time someone at least opened the door and asked for more clarityno matter if you agree with my over all position i am sure we all would feel better knowing exactly what those systems weredoes anyone have a problem with just knowing
oh so now your talking about the songs on the ipod yes i actually do own the songs on my ipod and iphoneyour logic is really screwed up you know thatwhat did you download them illegally pirate them is this implying your breaking the lawwow says a lot dont itjust as messed up as your op
i already do trust ccp tyvmif you dont trust them then dont give them money every month ffser so you are saying that every dev will eventually cheat facepalmcruisecontrol
eve is an mmo limiting devs to npc corps empire and banning them from interacting with other players is a stupid idea
if there is nothing to hide then why is it hiddenif ccp wishes to end the constant conjecture why put your company in a position where the most amount of suspicion could be developed again i think you are all missing me here you want this crap to end as much as i do simply doing nothing has not worked telling people to leave will not work none of that solves the problem  none of your emotional responses will change the fact that the problem of conspiracy and suspicion will exist for as long as ccp plays within corps that their customers are inthe problem will not go away no matter how much anyone plugs their ears and hummsthis problem will only get worse over time unless ccp does something other than just say they have systemsif you are truely sick of the drama we should all care enough to find a solution i am not saying my solution is the best or only one more that we simply should find one to that end i am certianly open minded
dude what youre missing is that most of us arent agreeing that there is a problem my replies have been consistent and unemotional im not angry or upset or sad i just dont agree with you
you have no solution to your problem which consists of paranoid delusionwithout playing the game they bloody well cant make it any better and you havent offered any alternatives you either accept what your elected representive from the csm says or you pretty much should just get the hell off this boardif you dont trust the csm  or ccp then not only should you probably give up on the board you should probably leave the gamewhich leads me to the inevitable when you leave  can i have your stuffs
open minded like a safe
umm not to put a damper on anyones day but just by moving bsing can usually dodgeoutrun incomign dread fire hell the freakin nid min carrier can almost outrun a freakin citedel torp or at least i heard
exploit noterrible game mechanic yesthis ok im going to shoot oh wait now im a coward and im going to instantly be safe stuff is bogus gameplay want to engage fine then accept the fact that you should put your ship on the line for at least 60 seconds
not trying to poke holes in your ballon but in 00 stations are player controlled they still have a 1min aggro timerat first i agreed its a legit tactic but coming to think of it it needs the same aggro timer that stations and gates have this way your logistics for repping the shields can duck in and out wo the timer while a ship that commits to combat by leaving the shield and shooting has to have some risk behind itsupported
if it had to go one way or another i would absolutely argue that we should remove the timers entirely however a more sensible solution along the same lines would be to allow sovereignty holders the ability to set their own aggro timer for gates andor exempt their own alliance from them
signedthought the aggromechanic stuff would be bad and the other stuff too imhoid prefer to give people a sensor recalibration time of 30 sec wouldnt help much except expending their time outside the forcefield till they can shoot at allor make it take some time to loose lock once your target entered the ffso once they just hover into the ff they are still lock and shootable for either 30 sec or till they made 50 of the way to the tower itself  large pos 15 km med 10 km and small 5 km range to the towersomething like that
this sounds like an nc whine thread tbh 1 stick a bunch of battleships about 150170km off of the pos in question and a couple of logistics 2 turn brackets on and watch the pos shields closely3 when a battleship exists the forcefield call him primary and nuke himdifficult i know feel free to drop a some isk in my wallet for the easy advice learn to play the game or complain on the forums enough so the game gets changed for you
the same good advice can apply to station and gate hugging lets remove those 1 min aggro timers as totally unnecessary now that we know how to properly handle those situations
failure to read ftl this is a thread on going in and out of pos shields no where did i mention gates or stations but please continue bring irrelevant points regarding stations  gates so as to deflect from the topic of discussion and the subject line regarding going in and out of pos shields
whats amusing is your failure to see patterns and similarities in game designif you fail to see how station and gate hugging is similar to pos hugging you need to invest some more time into postsecondary education one can only hope that ccp doesnt listen to people who clearly have no understanding of game design
what is amazing is your inability to understand and comprehend even at a very elementary leveli guess perhaps if you shoot your guns you should not be able to warp out for 60 seconds as welleither bring a valid argument as to why you cannot park a fleet of battleships outside of a hostile pos and shoot anyone leaving said pos or just give up you look silly tbhor as i said before whine on the threads loud enough about your failures and perhaps just perhaps ccp will change the entire game to meet your needstheres an easy solution to ships coming outside of the shields simply because you are to lazy or perhaps just to stupid to adapt to the tactic does not imply that the game is brokenfeel free to bring a valid point to this argument instead of well perhaps we should just get rid of gate  station timers as well  i love the tears please bring more
if you must change the mechanics how about letting you acquire and maintain locks on targets inside the pos shields when fired upon if they are inside the shields when the weapon arrives to account for missiles then the shield takes the damage as if the pos itself was targeted outside the shields damage to target as intendeddreads and other supporting ships target the battleships and open up if the bs happen to be outside of the shields when the ordnance arrives
your guess is just further proof of how clueless you are when it comes to game designand again you completely miss the point and being facetious i doubt even you are that stupid first nobody here arguing about who or what the battleships outside pos can shoot nobody is trying to deny your ability to bring a bunch of bs to a poswhat we are talking about is the current ability of defender ships to deaggro without timers and enter safety of their pos bubblethe key game mechanic here is to instantly disengage from battle and become invulnerable by crossing 1001000 meter distance to pos bubble and even avoiding session change timers the ability to instantly reenter the battle by crossing 1001000 meters in another direction  away from the pos bubblethis is similar to station and gate hugging in a way that people use those game objects to escape combat i dont think its necessary to provide proof that people do indeed use gates and stations to deaggro and get safe a very long time ago eve did not have any timer restrictions on this game mechanic and people abused it widely then it was deemed by ccp that this game mechanic allows for some ugly game play  something that just doesnt seem right people escape without consequences too easily so in their wisdom they have added the 1 minute timeragain the 1 minute deaggro timer was added specially to prevent people from leaving combat area while shooting other people and being immune to warp scramblers warp bubbles without any game mechanic forcing them to stay and not jump or dockwith the current pos bubble game mechanic we have people leaving combat area while shooting other people and being immune to warp scramblers warp bubbles without any game mechanic forcing them to stay and not enter the bubblethe similarity is clear  in all cases people see an opportunity to get safe away from combat while engaging in battle without real consequences the game objects involved are different the fleet compositions may be different but the purpose of tactics is the same the result is the same  to get safe out of combattherefore its a no brainer to conclude that the game mechanics of station hugging gate hugging and pos hugging have to share the same rules for deaggressing and getting safeto that i can say quantum rise patchyou are right that ccp listens to whiners in a very big way if ccp cant be trusted to make the right decisions we just have to scream louder with the right decisions so maybe their random idea selection person picks the one he sees most gotta work with what you got theres no way ill allow whiners with bad ideas to outshout me quantum rise disaster must not be repeated
simple and manifest idea i agreedisable all for example in jita would be also helpful
very usefull suggestion signed
if local is going to remain as an intel channel this is how it should be done this should be done whether local stays or goes
thanks for the supportactually my original idea was that this filter would not filter the comments but now i think maybe it should the last time i was in jita it was full of spam as for removing the portraits that would affect the standing bracket and would occasionally slide over the name making it unreadable but yes the could add that one too just unclick everything

was expecting a terrible local change thread disappointedidea is solid just like making standings appear on local was put into the game this should be implemented as well
is this kind of like that exploit bacon but for the hearing impared
i agree with the op
this would just make local even more of an intel tool not supported
signedgood idea aganola
excellent ideai hope ccp thinks the same 
you made a typo  you spelled utility ccp should have implemented themselves wrong other than that its similar but this proposal is better  more detail audio cues would still be nice of course but we can bring those in later
very much in favor this also might help oh i dunno strong small gangs meet larger lessrigorous ones
1 most of the people in fw are in it because they dislike the laggy blobfests in 00 whats the point in fighting in small gangs if theyre still laggy as hell
quite interesting 
not much to say other than supportedtheres a lot that needs to be done with facwar having enough server resources to handle the 80person fights which can occur is a bare minimum to start
we had the most ridiculous lag during one fleet everyone was desynched people had ships targetted that were already dead and peoples overviews and screens were refreshing and flickering like crazy after petitioning a loss a member of my corp was told he was not allowed to petition losses due to lag any more because get this he didnt contact gms to request node reinforcement for the eventin case the guys upstairs at ccp are listening theyre completely missing the point fleets in fw are formed inpromptu they are usually not planned in this particular event the enemy planned their fleet but we formed an adhoc fleet in defense we had no way to know the node needed reinforced as such i wholeheartedly support this suggestion to permanantly reinforce old man star and tama
supporthmmm we may be in same fights it was less laggy on kilboards 
signedwe have already performed all the suggested lag reduction steps there is still a problem
weve had a few really laggy fleets so i wouldnt be surprised in one in particular a corpmate lost his zealot in tama and was told he wasnt being reimbursed because he didnt ask for node reinforcement node reinforcement has to be done at downtime i dont know how gms expect him to magically know we would form a fleet and hit a caldari fleet a day in advance since these fleets are a practically daily occurance it makes sense that the high load fw systems be permanantly reinforced for ccp its a matter of efficient allocation of resources but the number of people fighting in fw daily surely makes it high enough priority i mean were talking about most of the fw scene being completely unplayable at peak times this isnt like an alliance lagging while hitting a pos one weekend this is an entire avenue of gameplay that many hundreds of people are playing at peak
black rise is under performing and needs looking into
i would love something this simple just make it so your stuck in limbo if you fail the password and have to keep repeating it until you get in the station then no accidental misreads of the password as has been suggestedit doesnt stop the mineral from being mined and hauled just from multiple trips taking place without user input i would love to see the brakes pumped on the macroers even if it means entering a code just like this 100 times a day
lol
you sir would be more than welcome to farm as much isk as you like of course it does seem to be a rather poor and counterproductive way of making cash imohere ill help you with some calculationsthe criminal isk selffarmercriminal character starting sp  20 million goes on a killing spree in jita while his alt eagerly awaits to pod his main close bycriminal character shoots and podkills 3 unwary pilots no one else is around at the time as our intrepid mainalt combo has done their homeworkcriminal now has a bounty of 750k isk on his head a nice payout for surecriminals alt now trains his guns on the main character making sure to pod him so he can collect the desired rewardoutcomealt is 750k isk richermain has now lost 750k sps maybe racial bs5 or somethingretraining the 750k sps will take perhaps 2 or 3 weeksat this point i dont think i need to do the iskhour calculation suffice it to say that it would most likely be more profitable to mine veldspar in your newb ship than to farm bounties on yourself
somewhere far off the way main parks industrial with full hold of small ammor or somesuch and jetissons it noobalt also in industrial takes ammo from mains can by 1 unit at a timeprobably macroing getting 1000 isk bounty on himself each time when ammo is all taken alt ejects from the ship and main pods him with the single gun on his industrial collecting ton of cash he then boards alts industrial and alt returns and boards mains industrialif there is a unreducible sp minimum and the process repeats if the alt has  billion skillpoints he is biomassed and new alt is bornanyway if there is no concord there will be no safer grounds to trade produce mine and run missions who wouldnt gank a helpless missionrunnerminerhauler that will eventually lead to having markets nearly empty and noone around left to kill so concord stays it may be buffednerfed but its not going away
good point so maybe we limit bounty accrual to not exceed the total number of sps of the character upon which the bounty is placedsay someone then wants to farm isk off an alt using can flippingeach time the alt physically dragged a unit of anything from your can to his he would get a say 1000 isk bountyin order to accrue to a 1 million isk bounty the alt would have to physically perform the illegal dragging action 1000 times no character can even start with 1 million sps so one would have to invest additional time a week or more i suppose to train this mule so you could simply get your newb alt an accrue his 800k bounty canflip yourself 800 times  and profitif thats the way you want to make isk i can live with it as far as safer grounds is concerned employ a merc or a newly fashionable bounty hunter corp to act as your police or create a police unit yourself within your own corpi can envision roaming police units just looking for the flashy flashies kinda like ratting imoof course if you happen to be flashy the only way you could become nonflashy is to go find some rats be they pcs or npcs hehe and work of the bounty station and gate guns would remain as they are faction navies would remain as they are perhaps we could even increase their presence in the higher sec systems but they would still be defeatable and not uber and unkillable like the current incarnation of concord happens to bei suppose that if you are flashy you would not be able to dock in any station belonging to the faction that placed the bountyso if you get a criminal flag in jita for instance you could not use any stations within the cadari empire while youre criminally flagged you would have to make a run for it either safe spotting leaving caldari space or hiding in a corpalli pos somewhere until you could get the bounty removed using the prescribed method of bounty removal or get podded whichever comes first
big no to this new players need a place where they can learn the complicated game mechanics without getting instapopped constantly and learning nothingi dont see how a police force is immersion breaking in fact having no police would be immersion breaking even in the wild west of the old usa there was sheriffs and police a civilizedtechnologically advanced world without a police force of some kind is pretty nonnonsensical even to science fiction writersyou idea is near the right track but still pretty far off concord still needs to protect aggression from being rampant in high security space a fun bounty system like this could be implemented against 50 and below pirates who want to enter high security space but just yanking concord from high sec would ruin eve just as fast as adding in concord to low sec
i understand your concerns where i would differ is due to the fact that it would be counterproductive to instapop newbs if the result of such an action placed one in jeopardy of losing 250k skill points or so i would thinkcurrently there is no real deterrent to hisec aggression imo simply get your gang together and go suicide gank some hauler you get your isk for your ship repaid via insurance and apart from a few minutes downtime face no real consequences for the actionon the other hand the concord mechanic though effective at intaganking criminals seems like a hand of god type mechanic and imo detracts from the reality of the game i believe that pirates should be able to actually pirate in hisec space for the potential of great rewards but i also believe that the risk if the pirate is actually caught should carry an equally heavy pricelet players be the police with assistance from current faction security systems industrialists will eventually learn to happily employ them
1 no2 a i like this would fix the current bounty systemb makes sensec no makes utterly no sense and that would actually make eve too hardcore to be enjoyable d also nosince i overall like the bounties based on actions i would vote for that i dont think the victim should receive penalties rather give the bounty hunter more rewards for number of bounties collectedthe alt killing however remains a problem
this is completely insane and game breaking i cannot support this my head hurts
this idea pretty much makes me want to barf such a sad and poor excuse of an idea not to mention you nerf the crap out of freighters with this ideaoh wait no one would ever undock gg you destroyed the game of eve onlinebig fat noisaac

corrected your use of accurate removal of part of the textyou are asking for the correction of a specific problem that you havent proved exist and you are trying to pass it as a general problem blaming the gm for action they for all i know and for what has been proved they dont do
seed all mission items on the market and this gets my support make the price high enough so a lower price can be asked by the loot thief that should make both parties happy no
that works for me of course if youve ever checked the market theres always a huge amount of mission items there for the purchasing now it might just be that the mission runner is unaware and who am i to tell them but still they are available and usually at very reasonable prices
depend on the mission item some are generic trade items and can be purchased on market to substitute for those dropped in the mission some are unique items with a name similar to those that can be purchased on marketif you want to check if the item is in one category or the other the easiest way is to rclick on the item and check view market detail if it is missing the item is a unique item with an unique id spawned for the missioneve a similar same namesame characteristics item spawned for another mission will not do there are particular items spawned for some mission that have no market bar but can substitute for the same item in another mission but those are items spawned in event missions that you can do only once
not supported if in fact the petitions are getting granted in the first place i think they shouldwhen my mission running fit has some usefulness in this sort of pvp encounter then its not harassmentas it stands now the item thief has a ship he knows will be at an advantage against 90 of the ships hes likely to face in the mission if the thief recognizes the mission they might even have time to tailor their damage output to go against a weak spot in the mission runners tank hrm a raven in a guristas mission i think i will switch to an em damage gank setupnot to mention how many mission runners carry a point on their ships thats about the last thing you need in a npc mission there is no real risk to the thief unless they get alpha strike destroyed or for some other reason cant warp off fast enough for the incoming dps
did you not even read the minutes from the csmccp meeting we had last weekfor everybody who still read this topic
aye
supported i also like the idea of simply changing the mechanic to be able to jump twice in a 48 hour period i actually like that idea better but would settle for a skill that reduces jc timeas for the notion that this would decrease risk of pvp i think this is a good thing i dont think that it would reduce the risk in a game breakingunbalancing way and it might get some of those carebears into lowsec more pvp cant be a bad thing right
meant to add the thumb 
supported i hate that the turnaround is too long to jump down to do something and jump back at the end of the day at level 5 this skill would reduce the jump time to 14 hours which i think is good enough to use jump clones to go for day trips
jump clones totally need workhow can characters in stories jump several times a day and yet were limited to onceid completely vote for the notion of modifying the current skill to allow for an extra clone and an extra jump per day lvl v would mean 5 clones 5 jumps per day otherwise the flavor text talking about mental training to prepare for transit between bodies has no relevance when we can be podded 50 times in a single day and not suffer in the slightest provided you pay to cover your sp

ah so you delegate haulers to wcs ships remove their cloaking options and then hop into a hic happily poping any indy trying to get by with your own wcs suggestion so much for your ideas 
if only there were a ship with an infinite amount of warp scrambling strength  neesa you are delusional since you keep mentioning call of duty perhaps you should just go back to that game and stop trying to make eve online an firstperson shooter
let me guess use a scout1 did you read what i had to say about scouts did you even care wheres your reasonable solution in avoiding gate camps gatecamps as it is right now is a rolling of the dice outcomes should rely mostly on skillin other words i dont care gimme what i want now1and yes the overall economic health of the game is that important whether you care or notdammit again offer a sensible solution in avoiding gatecamps but get the feeling you know using alts is a crap shoot and just dont care about balance and by the way have you ever heard of hicsill leave ccp to check whether what you say here is substantiated though so far i think youre mostly full of itquestion is is this the best you could come up with forget skill roll the dice sucka campers outside you lose1 no thanks
and now your argument is kryptoniteproof i take it you must really love camping gates and you seem to really want them to be the iwin buttons of eve screw everything elsei agree but you still dont find a 50 tax a little over the topand now your obsession with firstpersonshooter games becomes clearer there are games where you can mindlessly shoot others with no goals in mind eve happens to be a little more deep than what you think it is dont misunderstand do what you like but do stop trying to make eve into a stupid nogoals mindless shooting fps thank you
skye im not debating you anymore your best debate consists of qouting me then going youre wrong 11 you dont offer solutions you dont offer compromises come back with ideas and then ill dignify you with responses oh and post with your main if this is your main then youre part of the problemno i dont give a rats red rear end about the political landscape of eve heres why1 ferrogel duping cheating for four years has made the entire political landscape null and void we dont know and will never know how widespread it was and any alliance that benefited from it and holds 00 territory has a baseless claim to it2 giving a rats arse about the political landscape of eve means i have to shoot at poss for 12 hours a day no thanks ccp can keep their shietteh system of determining system control cause i dont want any part of pos bashing
i have clearly stated at least twice in this thread that ships that are supposed to have cloaks should have the cpu reduction that i proposed in case you havent played in a while all of the blockade runners can now warp cloaked so your argument falls short
i dont care whether you debate with me or not im not bringing your flaws to light for your benefit as i know you have a selfish agenda already and nothing will convince you of otherwise i do it for the readers to realize why most of your points are flawedyou think theres a problem with wcs when in fact there isnt we suggest the use of infinite point heavy interdictor cruisers and you babble apples and oranges1 i mean wtf you babble about people having to use alts to detect gate camps and i counter your argument with valid points on why scouting is no where near a reliable source of intelligence i even point where i agree with you yet you come back and babble that im just saying youre wronghere are my points on why scouting is no longer a viable way of detecting gate camps and im not doing it for you so no need to respond i do it for the readers1 alt scouting is metagaming metagaming isnt healthy for the game when the counter to something is a metagaming tactic then something isnt right and needs looking at2 having a friend or corp member scout for you for every low00 jump you make is unreasonable i hardly doubt many players log in to serve as a suicide guide for most of their time3 scouting wont save you in most cases anyway gatecampers know better than to sit around a gate while there are no targets and aggroed to the gate turrets they warp away and use an intelligence gathering member on the other side feeding them information on whos jumping in in other words scout jumps in no gate camp in site as soon as a juicy target jumps in surprisealso yes overall economic health of the game is that important why do you think ccp hired an economics expert to monitor activity in a game if the eve economy goes to shambles it is potentially game breaking whether you care or not and why are you bringing shooting at pos into the conversation why are you derailing your own thread if you didnt know everything in eve affects the economy but yes youve already made it very clear you dont care about any of that you just care about being able to shoot mindlessly and about eve fitting the game to your needs alone unfortunately for you eve is more than just you and its the reason it can accommodate thousands of players instead of just youyou didnt counter my arguments and quite frankly dont if you dont want to it just shows youre not interested in the overall balance of the game feel free not to respond to my points as i really dont expect you too anyway again my points are for the reader anyway not you

i apologize if this issue has already been raised by the csm i didnt have a chance to go through the wikithe contract system has some flaws i would really like to see addressed i believe that a few minor changes would be feasible with minimal effort from ccp if the issue were just brought to there attention these issues are centered around the contract auction functionality1 i can appreciate that public contracts can only be claimed in region but it is unfair to require every bid on an auction to be in region every time i am outbid i have to fly back to the region the auction is held in to place another bid if it could be adjusted so that only the first bid you place has to be in region that would be great2 allow users to specify a maximum amount they are willing to pay for the auction so that the server can autobid me up to the point of my max bid i would say this is not critical i would not want it if it became a server load issue but it would be nice3 exact end date  time for auctions are needed less than a day simply does not cut it why should people waste their time bidding on auctions that will end when they are logged off see next point4 i just logged in after getting back from work the auction ended while i was logged off i didnt win but my journal has no outbid notifications since the contract no longer exists i have no way of seeing what the winning bid was or getting any further information in fact aside from contract auction bid refund in my wallet i have absolutely no information or notification i hope the csm or someone at ccp can take notice of these problems so that in game auctions can be a usable tool
essentially turn the auction bit into more ebayish course i say that veryvery carefully as ebay is not the greatest example of what we need or wantsupported either wayid really like to see a karma tool for contracts so those who frequently issue contracts can be karma slapped for scammingnot saying this will stop scamming necessarily but a good way for people to report on there experience course the system is only good as the feedback
generally agreed though im pretty sure less than a day is antisniper just allow auction contracts to include sniper provisions in them though and that problem goes away none of them are huge problems but theyre all things that should be fairly quick fixes especially 1 3 and 4
are you sure that is a bug and not just the random generator landing twice on the same mission which would be dumb luck
i think i read somewhere that this should not be possiblebut that was eons ago and by now i know that it can happen now because i got the same mission several times in a roweither way i agree that we should have more options with missions like reduced pay for better selection
not supported perfectly fine game mechanic start up with other npc corps to expand your horizonsif you give me a menu to pick from i will always take the one with the most targetslootsalvagerocks to mine given 20 or so level 4 combat missions available to each race then half of them will be available at any given time adjust numbers as needed or allow for two instances of the same mission in the listhrm i need some more omber and kernite to restock that storyline mission station i will take the enemies abound for a few million isk

this is in by no way related to my alliance  corpbut honestly the whole csm is a joke i seriously have yet to see any fruit to come from this in the end the decision is ccps and ccp will do as how ccp sees fit now if the roles were to be reversed then i could see some validity to this but not until then i cannot see 1 thing ccp has actually listened to and made a change in the favor of what was voted for ie nanonerfs 30 pages of people saying dont nerf nanos and yet what do they do the exact opposite and one is to take ccp seriously with the csm as it is now csm  pr stunt with fluff and whoo ha

yes please ive long dreamed of spreading eve over three monitors comms windows on the left my ship in the middle and the overview on the rightitd be glorious
i was just wondering have anyone ever played the game called outpost 1 there you would land on a planet that was enough suitable and establish a colony why im bringing this up is because it had a very nifty design you could build underground facilities in levels surface underground 1 underground 2 etc it should probably require alot of resources to create and maintain but should produce something that is unattainable in any other way something that has nothing to do with income perhaps an elite standing andor your own governing rights establishing your colony will be far from cities but it has great potential as a stepping stone for ground troops and combat with the awaited expansion this can be quite fun but the issue would be on balancing the player owned corps and alliances with all the rumors and conspiracies going around id never trust for one group to have any of such power so it must have very firm balancehope im not making a fool of my self by speaking out my opinions
i still dont see the problem that is the allure of eve to me that it is largely left alone on a daytoday basis by the developers especially in the economy so the economy has evolved in a way that is different than the past get used to it that is the way of an economy economies are dynamic not static if you want static then eve is not the game for you then you cant have the same eve economy you had 2 years ago without either a time machine or radically changing the game todayand you havent explained why your proposal would change anything about the lack of people in low sec so i can get 2x the income the pirates are still there id need at least 2x the income after losing my ships my implants updating my clone more frequently as well as the time spent recovering from such incidents further the more time one spends in low sec the more frequent this happens and thus necessitating even more tweaking and all you have really is i think it should be this way
youre missing an important part of the equation if its proper deflation the materials go down in cost too paying 250 to make 300 is just as good as paying 500 to make 600 the problems are twofold  one a lot of priceseverything npc basically dont change no matter what the inflation level is at and two inflationarydeflationary expectations tend to warp the market horribly but a lack of production is not a predicted problem the only reason it happens in places like zimbabwe is that theres usually some kind of economic madness behind the monetary problems and that affects the underlying reality money is neutral  it doesnt matter whether you add a zero or drop one the real economy is unaffected
who says it has to be dominixes it would be best done with cheap ships that are very rarely sold and remember that you only need a handful of actual ships and can resell them over and over again to yourself at the hyperinflated prices to manipulate the price upward all it costs you is the transaction fees a few tenths of a percent for the inflated price sales and what about people doing it on a smaller scale they could just buy up all of a particular ship in the game for a few days to drive the median price artificially high and then suicide them all for a profit all theyd need to do is drive the price up by 30 to break evenim telling you if insurance is made to track the market someone will exploit it and just saying dont do this because its an exploit now is not only ineffective its also in direct violation of some of the basic tennets of eves design philosophy they are not going to make market manipulation against the rules nor do they have the resources to investigate and follow up on cases of manipulationim going to repeat this because you skipped the post in which i said it there are no magical solutions to any of eves problems people post them all the time asking for things like local to be removed or insurance removed or all of eve turned into 00 not everything has a simple solution and you cant just ameliorate the problem with a broad hack like tying insurance values into the market it feels like the right thing to do and trust me i was arguing for it a while ago but it has negative side effects that must be examined in detail and addressed before going forward and if an alternative system can be made that accomplishes the same goal with fewer problems that should be considered more highlywell no this is all a symptom of a much more fundamental problem the insurance prices are based on the npc base mineral price index which is no longer valid and no longer enforced by npc market orders tying them into the current prices is a bad idea for the reasons explained before if you want to make insurance completely selfbalancing you can cut the pricing step out completely by delivering salvaged minerals instead of insurance isk to the value of those minerals this has the benefit of being 100 impossible to corrupt through market manipulation if you manipulate the mineral market its the same as manipulating it for a profit now which some people do but even that idea as i put in a previous post isnt perfect and the rammifications of it on the mineral market and inflow of isk into eve need to be examined in detaili had some ideas about trying to make this playerbased this but its late and i have an exam tomorrow ill post them tomorrow if they still make sense then i know a lot of attempts have been made to construct a system of insurance that thrusts it into the playerrun domain but ill give it a shot anyway
this strikes me as a logical contradiction very rarely sold means it is a ship that is in limited supply now unless demand is also quite limited the price would already be highperhaps you can give an example of a cheap ship that is rarely soldyoud still incur the sales tax each time which is where youd run your greatest risk at best youd reduce your production costs also youd reduce your payout too because with so few ships youd limit your returnback pedalling notedin all seriousness buying up the cheaper ships would influence the median but if you didnt succeed youd still be out the the transaction fee as well as the money you spent buying hundreds of ships have you looked at prices on the market are they that wildly disparate i dont think that is the casei find this amusing in a thread of this nature oh the irony a thread where the suggested solution is infinitely tweakable seriously half the threads in this forum and the market forum are about forcing the game to met an individual or some subgroups idea of how the game should beand why shouldnt insurance fraud on the scale you are talking about not be deemed an exploit how is it different than the moonmining exploit people found a loophole in the mechanics and exploited it same with the insurance fraud you are talking aboutyou mean like your multipost opus on revamping miningconsidering that you havent shown any reasonable weakness i dont see the problem and just because many things dont have a simple solution doesnt mean sometimes simple solutions arent the answer a 30 day moving average of the median price is a much much harder creature to manipulate than a simple daily averageoh and implementing a 30 day moving average of the median sale price might be a very tricky and complicated change to the game code i dont know i dont do that kind of code writingi read the part about deflation and i think it is over blown i think it is more the case of being an artifact of patches and new items being introduced
herschelthe point is that with deflation and that it takes time to build stuff that lag results in a loss not a gain so deflation can be a problemoddly deflation is a problem and hyperinflation is a problem a moderate rate of inflation that is well behaved isnt that big a dealit is with deflation there was massive deflation during the great depression along with a severe reduction in outputi agree over the long term short term though i think changes in the money supply can have effect hence the phillips curve short term it worked over a longer period people figured the trick out and it stopped working also the neutrality of money arguments hinge on the assumption of flexible prices add in some price rigidity you might find money is not so neutral

in looking at evecentralcom the number of ferox on sale is 608 compared to the dominix 1097 that isnt that bad and compared to the myrmidons 659 that isnt half bad too tired to check the rest
608  aprox 19 mil  under 12 bil vs 1097  aprox 47 mil  under 52 bil  id say theres a noticeable difference alreadyyup glad you took the most expensive ship you could find on the list the one that least fits the profile out of all given exampleshow about a sigil then  you will notice that while a reasonable price based on manufacture cost is under 500k the median price for sales orders on evecentral is roughly 36 mil  you didnt even have to bother manipulating the prices they are already premanipulated for you and it wouldnt take a huge effort to push them well over 5 mil or so nearly 10 times the material cost at the momentso you were saying 
only if you have massive and crazy deflation if it was 10 per day id agree fully at even 10 per month its a fairly minor effect on most things and since those thingscapital ships basically are known and lag equally for everybody then the price drop on them will lag by production time theres not generally a huge stock of titans being unloaded especially into a buyers market agreed as long as the rates small and predictable it doesnt much matter which way it goesin eve at least  irl theres some psychological and seigniorage issues that make inflation preferable the depression is a terrible case study in a lot of ways because so much interrelated madness was going on that its hard to sort it all out trying to sort out whether those two effects were causally related or merely the result of bank failure tariff walls customer confidence issues or any of a hundred other issues that made the depression as nasty as it was is next to impossible and unfortunately we dont have much of a case study other than that for prolonged deflation in a modern economy frankly the closest we have to a case study is eve itself in recent years but there the level is so lowonce you account for reduced time horizons that its barely noticeable i agree my statement was a bit bold given the lack of good evidence but most of the theory ive seen suggests that its a collapse in demand that causes deflation in most cases not deflation that causes a collapse in demand i realize im getting dangerously close to keynesianism by saying that but it does make sense the problem is that initial phillips curve analysis neglected to account for psychological factors  the expectationaugmented phillips curve works just fine i know its you who linked that paper earlier and that youre likely aware of this but its an important point  its as much about managing expectations as it is about long and short runs its one of those amusing things about economics sometimes optimal policy is to lie your face off getting back to the point at hand though youre right about price flexibility being important which is why i advocated it as an important part of the solution and yes there are points at which superneutrality of moneysince thats really what were discussing here breaks down if ccp were to make insurance cash in and minerals out for example the effects probably would be as nasty as suggested the deflation would be horrifying theres reasons that my preferred solution is tweaking the system while leaving it entirely iskdenominated and fear of macroeconomic shockwaves is right up there on the list i wouldnt advocate a serious change like mineral insurance to eves monetary policy without an equal and opposite counterchange  eg making pos fuel attainable without cashfor example but a couple percent one way or another is small potatoes i trust dreyjog and the devs to look over the numbers before they do anything too huge and make sure its sensible
what are you talking about you cant just inferr details like this from economic theory actually log into the game and check the bloody market there are plenty of ships that are rarely sold and could be manipulated up without a lot of people noticing akita posted a few of themsince youre not grasping this ill run some vague numbers to show the feasiblity of such a manipulation in a broad sense lets say someone builds a thousand crucufiers at a cost of around 200m then they decide to raise that price across all of eve to 1b per unit assuming full transaction fees of 1 no skills each sale at 1b would cost them 10mil in brokers fees and to manipulate the prices for a day theyd need to do this around 500 times a day across all of eve to be sure they make a new median so they spend 5b on market fees and once theyre done they have 1000 ships to insure and destroy that will yield 700 billion if its a 30 day moving average its much more expensive to manipulatedont be an asshat thats not even close to backpedalling backpedalling is where you admit a point was wrong and withdraw what i did was state two separate valid concerns of markettracking insurance if you have any actual objections to arguments i post make them otherwise id appreciate it if you didnt try to attack the argument by attacking the person behind the argumentin this case it would be ccps idea of how the game should be theyve posted many times that eve is meant to be a harsh hypercapitalistic universe where you can do whatever you want theyve made it explicitly clear that market manipulation is a supported mechanism and if you want proof go looking for dev posts on market manipulation what youre asking for is a mechanism that generates isk out of thin air to be partially manipulatable by players on the premise that if anyone actually does manipulate it theyll just get banned why would we implement a system that we know is abusable right off the batdont be an ass that was a complete overhaul on mining not a single simple magic solution like remove ecm from the game or make insurance track the market i also delved into the impact of the changes something youre happy to ignore as manipulation is improbable and difficult on any kind of massive scale youre even happy to ignore ships where the median sale price tracks above their mineral cost like frigates and haulersi think im done debating with you at this point its clear youre not debating youre just arguing and theres a big difference between the two if you have any factual holes to poke in my posts by all means poke away i dont pretend to be infallable but but you could at least provide factual arguments

i disagree with the no brainer pos defenders are defending a pos it shares very little similarity to a fight outside a station or a fight at a gate to use a familiar moviecombat analogy its like archers on a castle wall ducking behind the protective walls in between volleys theres much bigger stakes involved than a fight at a gate or station losing the castle using stations and gates to escape combat is part of a ship to ship fight defenders using fortifications to thier advantage is part of defense against a seige not the same linking pos shields to a gate jump or docking because they allow a deagress is a huge logical leap as the deagression is about the only thing they have in common if a pilot in combat ejects from thier ship they deagress too right at least until someone locks the pod by the logic youve used ejecting must therefor equal docking and jumping
even if we take point of view that pos defense is inherently different from other type of pvp i think that the current game balanced is shifted too much in favor of defenderswith the current sovereignty system cyno jammers the defenders have it way too easy theres no good reason to keep a shady game mechanic like this
why does fi even existfrom the main page were toldfeatures and ideas discussionget feedback on your gamerelated ideas and suggestions from our developers and the rest of the communityhowever its really just a place for players to arguethe exact same ideas are raised week after week month after month ideas are suggested as though no one has ever thought of them before either due to the seriously faulty search function or the lack of participants trying to search beforehandand when these ideas are discussed quite often including links to past threads on the same topics the most common retort is ccp knows we feel this way about this topic if they havent changed it by now they want it that waybut really i have to believe that fi is simply where ccp moves suggestions and ideas that they dont want to bother with whether its someone complaining about macros or wanting a way to detect cloaks or simply wondering why the mouse wheel scrolls contrary to common sensibility its been seen time and again a new face and name among the threads ccp xxxxx or gm xxxxx and when readers flock to there in anticipation of actual acknowledgment for their ideas all they see is thread moved to features and ideasso long story short how about some of these devs start doing their job how about they start reading these threads and providing some input now and then not only would it do wonders to please the masses it would quell the everspawning threads when someone could simply link heres where we talked about that last week and where the dev came along and saidperhaps just perhaps if some of the ideas were taken into actual consideration instead of pushed out of the room and told to sit at the kids table because the adults are speaking maybe these same ideas wouldnt be resuggested time and again maybe the players voices should be heard once in a while since it is our subscription fees that fund those devs paychecksjust a thought
i see two obvious problems with your proposal one dev time is a finite resource and theres only so much of it that they can spend on the forums replying to us nice as it is really isnt a important as improving the game second its generally considered impolite to tell your customers that theyre being idiots and should knock it off which is the response a good number of the threads deserve just as discretion is the better part of valour sometimes rendering yourself incommunicado is the better part of public relations now i think that the forum could use a bit more interaction than it has at present yes certainly some structural fixes would be nice  make the commonly proposed ideas sticky a list with responses instead of a list of 90locked threads for example but there are real limits on what they can do especially now that so much of the devplayer interaction has been subsumed into the csm
agreed
the devs do read the fi forum they did use to post more but whenever they said something about anything people would read whatever they wanted and start whining on the forum hence they post less now they still read the forum and take ideas into considerationfor most of the common ideas there is allready a dev blog or a dev post to quote
1 why not spend a little time improving aspects of the game that the players would like improved then fi may be a lot of whining and incessant chatter but its also a place where a lot of valid ideas are discussed and ironed out to what most feel are acceptable resolutions only those threads disappear when everyone comes to an agreement and yet cant do anything about it without ccp taking action2 if csm are supposed to be the point of contact between players and devs then maybe they could take more initiative in making the public heard i know that a lot of csm do frequent fi and i greatly appreciate it but it doesnt mean that ccp has done anything to quell the frequent and repetitive outcries for changeim not saying that every idea needs to be implemented in fact most ideas that arent beneficial are usually argued into oblivion by the general populace anyways but the few that are discussed and worked through could at least receive official input rather than just dying off and being resumed the following month
trying to argue a topic today using a dev post from 3 years ago isnt helpful times can change opinions can vary and certainly mechanics have been altered since it was written so whos to say that when dev x didnt approve so long ago that dev x even works at ccp anymorei realize that without the right approach it would only amount to ideas being retold week after week and devs repeating their opinions just as we forum writers keep repeating ourselvespoint being why are we paying monthly without acknowledgment why does our link to the devs the csm have to be monthly subscribers as well shouldnt someone at ccp collecting a paycheck for a days work be addressing some issues too
most of the time someone else knows if it has changed and will correct you right away as you stated why should devs waste precious time repeating stuff if the players can do it for freethe monthly fee doesnt exactly buy you a dev answering your posts moreso since as i said the answers get ripped apart right awaysure a kind of fi wiki could solve such problems but i really cant see that happen
i think ccp should continue being very careful with what suggestions they impliment the worst thing they could do is listen to all of the ideas on these forums eve is good because its built on a vision and is not designed for the masses the way some other mmos are i highly encourage ccp to continue ignoring most of what happens on the forum and continue doing what they do  making a good game
signed and marcus it was about time someone did thisnice work
can you prove that devs dont read fi because i do see some blue bars in there not a lot not all the time and not in every thread but they are there that indicates to me that the devs are in fact reading our suggestions a lot of the suggestions in fi are for lack of a better word stupid some are trolls neither of these two require dev attention and the poster a few above me is right devs used to post a lot on all the forums but then people started taking every single post they made and making it internet law then they were all outraged when something diddidnt happen that went against what the dev had initially said so why would they invite that drama onto themselvesyou can also find suggestions in fi through the sticky of ideas that were implementedfor example this one this one or this one and before you say it yes those are fairly old threads but all the ideas have been implemented in one form or another there isnt really a suggestion in your op as to what you want done or at least nothing with any sort of support or evidence theres accusations of devs not reading the forum which blue bars indicate is not the case and cant be proved either way and the implication that you want fi to have more relevance which again cant be quantified or defended since we dont know the level it has now to be completely honest this seems to just be a im tired of seeing the same stupid threadsideas rant and then the classic my sub fees pay your salary do what i say thread while you do have some pull as a customer and while ccp has made efforts like the csm to listen to player feedback they dont have to they own the game they can change it as they want and if we dont like it we can quitthats just what i see though shrug
how many of those blue bars say something other than thread moved to features and ideas because someone was trying to raise a topic in a forum that actually receives attentiondoes this mean that you feel the devs are incapable of posting a reply without painting themselves into a corner yes if a dev says thats a good idea some may take it to mean well do that tomorrow but it would be better than everyone admitting its a good idea and nothing coming to fruition from iti appreciate the input i really doyes i agree that i may have failed to properly word my original statement to form a cohesive argument free from bias and aggravation i am only humani am not trying to say i pay your salary do as i command i am only saying that it would seem some folks at ccp arent earning their paychecksim not saying that every idea on fi should be heeded far from it in fact we all know that a lot of horrible ideas have sprung to life in there and they are usually told so repeatedly until they die agonizing thread deathsbut a lot of good ideas have sprung up as well and keep springing up week after week because nothing is done about themas i said originally even if a dev were to show up in one of these threads to show their pretty little face with their pretty official avatars and say this is an idea with merit we will take your comments into consideration it would do a great deal to appease the masses it would show that people are voicing their opinions for a reason that they are being heard and recognized for their input that the devs are actually concerned that their game is pleasing to the customersthese statements of the devs can do what they want and if you dont like it you can quit are simply unbelievable of course its their game they operate the servers they write the code they make the game but they didnt make it just to say they did it they made it so people would be drawn in and play it and they made the game the way it is to turn a profit from people enjoying the game and continuing to play it so they could stand to at least make an effort to please their customers if only to keep the subscriptions rolling inagain im sorry if i come across as just another disgruntled player who wants it his waybut you have to admit there seems to be a lot of disgruntled players
absolutely and id be a liar if i said i was never one of them the qr speed fix i was and remain utterly opposed to it doubtful about the arrival of t3 absolutely a myriad of other changes all throughout the years ive played have at one time or another made me ask the quesion are the devs and i even playing the same game i agree that its in no way difficult for a dev to post a quick interesting idea well look into or or we tried that and it didnt work or even well put it on the drawing board soon but i have to disagree that its in their job description they are tasked with developing the game thats it they can take ideas from anywhere they want and ignore other ones of course its silly to ignore the suggestiongs of your player base and ccp has made a good effort in my opinion to keep a good level of game balance v appeasing whiney emoranting on the forums compared to a company like blizzard who seems to make all decision by counting up the number of whine threads and then nerfing whatever its about ccp puts some actual thought into things most of the timesorry guys still bitter about my arazu and my nanos also agreed that saying we made the game we do what we want is a bit of line with what could reasonably happen of course ccp is a business and their goal is for their product to do well which means pleasing their customers which sounds quite cold as im sure there are those at ccp who genuinely want us to like playing eve without too much selfinterest but eve is and always has been a very niche game it does not appeal to a wide audience like wow does and it has a fairly high turnover rate if the emoragequit posts in general discussion and new player questions is to be believed as a result we definetly have to take pleasing the customer within the context of we didnt design eve to seem like a cold harsh world we designed it to be a cold harsh world something to this effect from wrangler i believei would love to see more dev posts in fi in fact i would love to see more dev posts period i miss the days when oveur or tomb or wrangler would flame people for saying stupid things or a dev spam thread would appear after a patch day when everyone in the office was  drunk it strengthened the sense of community between devs and players and made it feel less like a companyclient relationship i also apologize if my reply seemed a flame or a shot your initial post made me think you were just ranting but the followup shows youve actually put some thought into the post which can be a rarity on these forums
from having spoken to a number of devs when i was in iceland last week a very large number of devs actually do read that very forumso this is a nonissue
because  much as im occasionally one of the ones to make the most noise  theres limits on what they can do a lot of the best proposals are complex and difficult they take hundreds of hours to implement and hundreds more to test there arent things you bang out over a coffee break and when youre talking about a proposal that large at a company as large as ccp has become that means going through everybody from the dev team schedulers to the marketing department you cant just read a post say good idea and run with it that way lies a buginfested nightmare im sure they take the ideas into consideration but the dev cycle for anything but simple changes is likely up around a year these days even if they jumped right on it you wouldnt know until next fanfest probably and even then itd just be bits of hype and some trailers i take your point i have some issues with the way the csm has done business  though most of them are being worked out  and i think theres still improvements to be made but nothing there requires as drastic a change to forum policies as you seem to be proposing the solution here seems to be most likely that if you see a good fi thread crosspost it to assembly hall for csming its annoying at times having to fight the same battles twice but thats the preferred path for playerdev interaction these days and it seems better for all involved for people to work through it rather than ask for shortcuts that probably wont happen its not as cozy as it used to be but neither is eve
im signing this only on the basis that id like more dev input in fi i do think marcus was ranting a bit but to be fair its getting to a frustrating boiling point to be specific1 i see more dev responses that are actual input to ideas wrongly posted in general discussion than i do in features  ideas heck last week someone got torfi to post again after a year or more of silence by posting a rant about graphics updates in gd  over the last year ive seen hundreds of graphics requests along the same lines in fs without so much as a hint that they were considered2 there is absolutely nothing wrong with the devs posting questions if a dev on reading an idea which they claim they do immediately thinks hmm what about this aspect have you considered that then i see nothing wrong with them posting that a simple quick oneliner to provoke thought in the right direction it helps cull bad ideas that simply dont address the full game it helps focus ok ideas into good ideas it helps illustrate ccps position on a given area and the acceptable impact on it3 if devs read an idea that they themselves are already considering its great to hear about that and allows more focus on the specifics of the idea as well as better and more informed discussion about the pros and cons earlier if posters in fi are stupid enough to believe that what is stated is fact rather than an idea to be fleshed out they are missing the point of the forum4 occasionally an idea comes up that is essentially a rehash of the same idea talked about by ccp themselves years ago to name a few planetary interaction player housing environmental effects etc  what were never told is whether ccp just put them on the longterm backburner or considered them and decided they just didnt fit with the game we used to have a drawing board sticky that oveur made which died a death some time ago so much for communication about what ccp is consideringat present those of us that dare to rebut ideas and usually get called insults as a result are usually accused of being subjective or not being prepared to change a given area i know from watching fi for some time that there are plenty who are quite objective when discussing ideas they arent seeking to promote their niche area of eve above all others though they may defend it however ccp can provide as objective an input as can be expected and any increase in that is goodccp input is good for the community and helps form closer bonds between ccp and the communityon a closely related topic i also would like addressed the distinction between assembly hall and fi as they seem to be duplicates of each other but only one is actively promotedthats an unfair and inaccurate statement what marcus is asking for even if its a bit of a rant isnt that devs read fi  its that an increase in dev inputto the fi forum would be beneficial it does state after all suggestions from our developers  i havent seen any of those for a long time
welcome to an online forum been here long the forums are here to entertain the masses when they get bored of the game or a place for people to vent when they get ed of at the game its mostly garbagethe eve search engine sucks goat nutz ccp needs to post a sticky to wwwevesearchcomthe rest of your post pretty much degrades into a general whine for attention i know where yer coming from but its not like then never take any ideas from fi i would hope the devs are busy improving the game rather then surfin the forums that are for the most part mindless drivel anytime there is a ccp responce everyone and thier brother jumps in with thier 2 cents or tries to draw attention to whatever tangent they feel is game breakingccp does have people that read the forums and pass on info can they read every single post maybe should they noif you have an idea or suggestion its your job to make sure its posted in well thought out and easy to read format keep it in the first few pages and ccp will take a look at it sooner or later dont expect them to bend over backwards for you though its thier game and thier business they run it as they see fit
youd get a thumbs up if you proposed more moderation in fiyou wont however for just asking the devs to post moahrif i were a dev i wouldnt post in fi i wouldnt bother digging through all that crap of witty one liner ideas and blatant whining fi has gone to the ter not because of the absence of devs but because of the absence of reason the last reasonable posters have long been spammed to death by 4chan memes and dont bother anymore
while i cant make any guaranteesid imagine that fi would find itself more direction and guidance if the devs were to give input once in a whilefor instance if we were told this idea was discussed at the 1492 convention and it was found to be distasteful then players could link that quickly when the same idea is brought up repeatedly it would also allow us to know when was the last time they considered the idea in case patches and changes have made it more likely now than it was back thenif players were told this idea has merit however we dont feel that this is exactly the approach necessary then players could continue to discuss the topic and possibly iron out the details end result the players do the devs jobs for them by brainstorming a concept to an acceptable conclusion and the devs get to take credit for the implementation were happy because our ideas are recognized as well as possibly implemented and the devs are happy because now more people enjoy the game and their subs keep rolling in
as long as the one who made the kill shot is responsible for the damage of the explosion i have no problems with it
it is a startnow it only needs to be implemented
if youre worried about suicide ganking fit a tank to your exhumer be aligned with a celestial objectyou can reduce ship speed to 1ms to stay aligned meaning you only have to worry about getting to warp speed still a lot faster than having to turn to face the target
please add the ability to oppose an idea as well as support it i feel it would give a better indication to the csm if we could show our disdain for an idea as well as our support give us the ability to give the thumbs down
i am all for the thumbs down choice
yes please
this should have been a feature from the start wtf ccpcsm
usefull idea
this has been requested like a billion times but since it still hasnt happened ill support it again
im sure they thought of it but decided it might hurt peoples feelingsthis game is getting more carebear with every patch
supported
you really think so adding in a thumbsdown would allow objectors to walk into the thread post  no and tick the unsupported box whereas now were more likely to see something like thisin many ways i think being able to give the thumbs down might be a slightly gentler way to let people down than the current method
supported not sure it should be thumbs down instead of please visit your user settings to reenable images
ccp needs to wake up and do some serious performance analysis on servers of the fw systems

bump in high secbegging all of your pardons since nobody flips cans for pvp in lowsec and nulsec i didnt really think to point out what i meant but that is my mistake just as much as my spelling errors ki am talking about an alternative to flipping cans for pvp in high sec and allowing for a interface option thanks to all the thumb uppers
yes high security space is completely different high sec only is fine as long as ship loss is incurred in other mmos the losing player does a kneel or bow or whatever and no one ever dies if this duel stopped the fight at 1 structure that would be terriblestill if you are allowing duels i would rather have an arena setting where you could easily make small tournaments blah blah blah i think ive gone over it alreadyconsidering the amount of time spent traveling fitting and stuff to get to high sec to arrange a duel is spending 10 seconds to setup can aggro really that difficult also consider that it will take 10 seconds to right click on your opponent and send a duel invite and then he has to accept it you are basically spending the same amount of mouse clickstime so i dont exactly see the issue that needs ccps attention also now everyone is inconvenienced with having to shut off duel invites whenever they make a new character or wipe out their cache lastly if two new players want to duel they ask someone and they quickly learn about stealing and can aggro mechanics which is a good thing too many negatives for a meaningless mechanic roll eyes at bunyips comment god now you have us all scared
please  please tell me that youre joking that would be against one of the core elements of eve
guys youre judging something you dont know anything about its not the end of the world for evei cant say anything but please dont judge it before it occurs its not how you would probably envision it wait until the dev blog then give feedbacki can say that the csm was almost unanimous in our concern for the effects of this patch but ccp has their act together please wait and see
yeah guess youre right after all they allways stuck to their vision of a harsh dark unforgiving world
thumbs down for thumbs up p tttstill supported
yup
there are way too many pussies in this game lol
oh this is a suicide ganking whine thread ok cleverly disguised this thread is stop flying afkhaving pirates lose months of skill training for popping random trash ships is not the way to go there are plenty of deterrents to high sec ganking already the only problem is that it is so easy for anyone to get very rich in high sec that they are a valid suicide ganking target nothing wrong with using teamwork and cheap ships to take down slow expensive targets that do not defend themselves
quote mining skill adetermining the intent of the author faili want to remove concord and have actual players police the game in order for this to be viable there needs to be a real deterrent to random crime so the game doesnt turn into a grief festin the spirit of eve however there should also be adequate reward potential for pilots that chose to take such significant riskget it
i dont believe that removing learning skills is impossibletheres a difference between impossible and just not wanting to take the time and dotif it is the other option is just max them for everyone 55this cough cough mechanic can really put off new playersa new player doesnt want to spend 3 months training skills to learn other skillsthe excitement of a new game will go out the window really fastthere is a reason that 80 of new players quit within a short period after signing upsay what you will eve needs to make some changes to bring in a broader newer playing basejust my two cents and no im not a noob ive been her almost two years have 4 accounts and all of my players are way past training any learning skills
good idea
take interbus for example they are friends with all the empire factions they are enemies with all the pirate factionshow about the opposite new faction perhaps not necessarily new eom maybe who is friends with all the pirate factions and enemies of the empire factionsthat way you could recover pirate faction standings that you would have lost doing perhaps ratting or missions
juat out of interest  where is that elusive storyline agent for interbus since thats what you would need to use them effectively jove space for half of the pirate factions there are already workarounds in place trying to get the problem with the other half fixed is already being discussed afaikedit you might want to look here here and here
1st quarter of 2009 this is being fixed
this is just a rough idea and i may miss some important angle exploit that would make this a bad idea but what about the followingone of the problems with lowsec is that there is no good reason to be there iskwise you can rat or mine but compared to highsec missions or secure 00 space ratting the isk per hour it is not work the risk of ship loss i propose a new bubble type that you can be used in lowsec to close off a system or group of systemsthis new type of bubble that can be used in low sec would work like this1 this bubble can only be deployed within 5km from a gate2 warp drives can be activated withing a 20km sphere around the center of the bubble so you can warp out after jumping through the gate into the system3 if you attempt to warp to the bubble you get pulled out of warp at a random location on a 200km sphere around the bubble you can not warp to the gate in order to jump out4 someone getting stuck in a bubble does not change aggressionsec statusgate guns etcwith these bubbles you can deny access to traveling through a star gate but you do not get free easy kills from people jumping in unscoutedcombine this with improved pve isk in the form of better mining minerals or bounty rats and it should become worth it to have an mixed fleet where the pvp players set up these road blocks on the gates into a system while pve make money rattingmining in lowsecyou could also set up a roadblock and request toll for passing through
such a thing already exsists its called gate campssorry but your making it more complicated than it already ispirates arent likely to play nice like you imply it and there version of a toll is called a ransomnot to be condescending but its the truththe best way to make low sec more inviting is to have a faction that you can join in which you are the local sheriffbut thats going to take a bit of work as there are expploitable problems with that bribes and such
i dont know about this particular application but the idea of a bounce bubble as an additional option to the sticky bubble is interesting
its only the oposite of a gate campgate camps only work on incoming ships exiting ships you cant stop unless they dont warp to zerodenying them an exit is only the opposite of denying entrance into a system via the use of a hic or an interdictor
you dont get more people into lowsec by making it even harsher  all you have is more pirates and fewer targets you get more people into lowsec by making it more profitable its an interesting proposal but im not sure it actually would be useful for anything
since probing and hictors lowsec is unsafe enough already and pretty much same as highsec rewardwise it doesnt need to get any worse
as a pirate i guarantee i would use this on outgates way more than any industry corp trying to lock down a system for a minin op or whatever while its make my job easier it makes people less inclined to come to low sec which makes my job harder not supported
i think this bubble idea should be seen in the context of some other isk giving enhancements one of the problems with lowsec is that it is hard to close off a system bubbles in 00 allows one to close of a system but it results in you having to scout all your jumps at the cost of nearcertain deathmaybe something similar to a plex timer but that last 30 minutes and then gives out a very nice isk bountyin that case if one is close to the 30 minutes on the timer one would have a reason to fight in order to defend ownership of the systemthe main thing is that this bubble by itself is not as deadly as the 00 bubblesif you warp to a gate and end up at a random location 200 km off the gate you will just warp off again since there is only a small chance that an tackler will be right on youyou could also make these bubbles expensive and take some time to anchorunanchor so that when you bust a camp you can take their bubble cause pirates not to always scout with alts and runaway at the first sight of a close fightjust thinking out loud
the thing is right now if you jump into a pirate camp during jump into a system you are close to gate and unless mega webbed will more likely start heading to the gate and start fighting you will get away or die but likely not discuss a ransomtoll feeif you are in the system with the pirates already you ignore the pirates warp to 0 and go with agility or some warp core stabs you really do not need to worry most of the time when in anything smaller than a bc
with this you might even be like failed state militias with a reputation of respecting tolls and make isk using reasonable toll fees1mil for a bshac500k for a bc200k for a frigcruiseri am looking for ways where pvp in lowsec has a reason
your assuming a great deal most pirates these days shoot first and ask questions later no ones going to use a system that isnt as simple as it is right nowand theres an increasing number who do not honor ransoms either which gives way to the mentaility of everyone saying frak you and write off there ship then and there
its not harassment now or there would be actions taken against the perpetrator which there are notwelcome to eve been here longexactly right and exactly why its done heres a tip  dont engage the thiefi have a question for you  lets say your mission is invaded by someone stealing the mission item and you petition to have it reset you get it and the thief returns to steal the item again so you have it reset again what happens when the thief petitions you for harassment since he now has had to steal the mission item twice youre obviously griefing him because your exploiting the gms mission reset and not using normal game mechanics a term which is quoted  oh so much  in the forumswhat then why is it fair for you to call foul on harassment and not them
the answer is obvious the gm would laugh at the thief because its obvious the thief is harassing the mission running with intent to disruptoh im sorry thats common sensei guess you where expect us to fall for your trap of illfatedgreedinfested logicyou really think the gms are that dense to not check the logs and track historyoh im sorry is the poor little ninja salvager crying for his ransom because the pilot is reporting harassmentno favor will be given to you people because you have zero riskyou reading my lipszero riskperiodand until there is risk you will not be heard i dont care if your queen of the galaxythats the bottom line right there
i think the system in place needs refining alittle as i have no qualms about somebody entering a mission i am doing and cleaning up after me but do have problems about somebody stealing a mission specific item that is not seeded on the marketwhy not make the system better to keep the salvagers on thier toes randomize the mission item and make that the only item in the salvage that can not be taken by a ninja salvager without some kind of penalty sort of like a booby trap maybe this will put some risk into the profession it should beand a final though i had were do you draw the line between griefing and normal gameplay 
thank me heh  bigger than the queen that youre not the only voice to be heard thats a very limited view you have there  tchell dahhn is being selfish so lets not even listen the ideas that make sensethats ok  mission runners arent the only players in the game
sorry to burst your bubble tchell but your stuffed up pride is making you stupidthe voice i speak is one of rationality and reason unbiased with the fact that im not really interested in the greed or ego of eve i seek to play the game to be constructive and to further my corporation the games too large for self indulgenceyour trying to make the bank robber look like the victim in this sad little tale of your so called exploit complaintwhile you have valid points the underlining agenda is a little too obvious and that is why you will be ignoredas ive said a thousand times until there is risk you will not get your wishall you have to do is scan probe out the mission area show up salvageand leave with a ton of iskone would call that isk farmingzero effort very little time invovled and you make out like a banditsomeone war decs you you go hide in your little hole and wait it out or run off even if you did fight youd have better finances than anyone else combinedninja salvaging at the time of its first inception may look like a valid tactic but any tactic overusedabused would quickly change that opinioncase and point ghost trainingand thats undeniablewhats going to happen if you salvage a wreck and you get aggro how about taking a security hit for interfering with empire missions after all you are interfering in the affairs of the said sovereign empires that hand out these missionsyou may think im just rattling my gums for the sake of the carebears you oh so hate with a passionbut in reallity its because of those carebears your making millions if not billions with very very little efforteven then this so called mission reset exploit is actually in your favor so it gets reset that means more wrecks to clean upguess you didnt think of that did youdont want double the trit bars tchell lost your way have youeveryone knows that mission payouts are worthless salvage is what makes the iskand your little business of taking advantage of that daresay exploiting that fact is going to get a little negative attention because you are not getting any danger or risk from doing it to begin with until you decide to get even more greedy and steal the loot and then hold mission items for ransomthis is why this topic falls under a controversial category and one that will not be paid attention too until ccp finds the time to bother listening they have other things to take care ofuntil there is a defense against invasion of missions im not going to sit here at let people be blinded by your holier than thou attitudeyour excuse of shooting back when they take loot is completely unreasonable unless the mission runner is smart enough to use tactics to wait out the aggro timer and even then its destructive to the mission runners environmentwhich in turn leads to the age old argument of eliminate the mission runners and send them packing to lowsec or endless wardecsat that rate i might as well go get a copy of warhammer online and say frak itbut we arent there yet and im hopefull ccp wont fall prey to such things
i stand corrected you have made me rethink my entire profession and i thank you for your input
tt
no proof apart from an alt claiming he got a mission reset maybe he did it to annoy the ninja guys it looks like it worked because now tchell is crying make sure you catch some of your own tears to fuel your shipszero support for a profession which is below corp theft in my book
hmm some peoples children
funny who this whole thing stems from a single quote from a gm
technically two both ccp ytterbium and ccp prism x seem to share the same opinion which leads me to believe theres more silent support at ccp that we dont hear from
whos the one with the stuffed up pride it is not for you to declare that you speak with the voice of rationality and reason your abuse of ellipses marks you as an undisciplined thinkeri fully support tchells proposal  that gms be given a firm guide on the conditions under which a missionspace reset is considered appropriate if someone steals your mission loot just fail the mission it costs you less than onethird the reputation gain from a successfully completed missionand drake please leave the ellipses alone all those pauses in the sentences might be dramatic when youre coming to the denouement in an epic adventure story but as part of an argument over rules of a game theyre pretentious and make it look like your brain isnt fast enough to keep up with the argument

in an effort to provide a more interactive method to voting on issuesideas i propose implementing an ingame voting method for ideasissuesthe approach would be for ccp to implement an ingame voting mechanism based around the ingame browser which would be accessible via a link on the browser homepage the reason for the implementation to be performed by ccp is around trust to prevent abuse and for a tool to facilitate and promote by ccp the csm processthe available list of voting topics would be managed and controlled by the csm the period for voting should be long enough to gather opinion but short enough to allow it to actually affect the csm meeting cycle the list of items should be limited to prevent burn out of votersthe results would be available to the general public  the csm at the end of the voting process the information couldwould be used by the csm to aid their decision making process additionally extra information would be gathered by using the process including but possibily not limited to number of pilots who examined at least 1 item number of voters on a topic number of  votes number of  votes number of people who declined to vote no identifying information would be gathered as part of the voting process for the general evepopulation this information would be used to provide some statistical information on participation of the csm processthe issue summary page would display the links for previous issues and their results the current voting period expiry show the current issues heading and your votevoting status on the issueclicking into the issue would display the issue heading issue description and provide options to 1 vote for 1 vote against 0 abstain  optionally there would be a comments field limited to 1000 chars adding comments would only be possible on voting once you have voted on an issue you wouldnt be able to change your vote optionally the system could show the votes of the csms including their name alongside the issue before you vote this would allow pilots to examine the direction of the csms to votes inprogress
vote on what
no thanks i cant support this
supportedninja salvaging is a legitimate profession if someone left a wreck floating in space its up for grabs for whoever gets to it 1stthanx for linking to the guide
absolutely supported ours is a growing profession and i support anything that will swell our ranks
thus far forum moderation has been offlimits for the csm we have nothing to do with which threads should be sticky or noti suggest you ask for it to be stickied in the sticky thread there is for resources maybe mail wrangler
i would prefer to keep our profession smaller cant have everyone doing it now  
supported  only for the fact that some douche bag from goons doesnt which means the post should be beneficial for the real player base and not the minority power brokers
this the reason why the vast majority of eve players are carebears is i suppose because of the hoarder mentality give them a reason to fight and they will most of them see isk as something of real value and ingame it really is or does one get his or her broadsword as a present for venturing into losec and are scared of losing it right or wrong i dont know but eves tough men continually whining about carebears kind of gets old with time even if they do have a pointyou want a fix to this give the mission npcs much better ai and change the missions from the mass slugfest they currently are to something that has more quality and more variation currently missions are totally predictable the second you find out about evesurvival and the npcs are always totally unlike real players and far more stupid make the missions chance based on what npcs are there make the npcs faster cleverer you cant tell me a computer based ai is slower to react and doesnt know all the tricks than a real player and above much more dangerousthis will make it much harder to run missions having a side effect of getting those who do run missions less frightened of losec and pvping and also it will help make losec and 00 npcs more dangerous thereby adding a bit of a thrill to ratting and chucking a bit of a spanner into fleet ops in 00 where npc rats are just a sourse of incomemaybe i see all this wrong though i dont know
maybe  have you been a nice boy this year
but its ing expensive
nice job guys  especially about the skillqueue
thank you and keep up the good work csmoh and thank you ccp too
im sorry but im going to be a bit blunt hereyou are obviously not reading devblogs at all in november there was a devblog on what the first csm did of big thingsif you then actually also read the meeting minutes from the csm2ccp meetings from last week you would realize how much the csm has actually influenced once the full minutes are out it could quite possibly blow your mind a whole lot of things have actually been fixededit forgot a bracket
then post the minutesand please refrain from putting items on the agenda such as general csm operation any feelings of impotence you have doesnt warrent a place on the agenda for discussions with ccp and only harms the perception of the csmthe current csm is doing a more effective job at communicating with the evepopulation and while some of your discussions may be covered by an nda with ccp  simply reporting that provides a layer of transparency that people will apprechiatepersonally i would find it interesting if there was weekly figures available that showed the percentage of the player base that used the forums this would help show how representative the forums are of those playing
they have at least the short version the long version has to go trough ccp to make sure that everything is finewhat are you on about it was frankly a good discussion we had with xhagen and co it was very productive and a range of different ideas and solutions were presented if we dont solve fundamental problems in regards to communication now which we have there wont be a csm in the future because nobody will care anymore i agree thats why we had the above issue we want to do even betterhm thats an interesting idea
this so much this

i agree as well
please support this proposal
hey wow lets you do it change your appearance change your name all for a nominal feei guess if you dont have an awesome name like i do you can change it if you want
awesome idesme wants
sound good  bumb
some drone mods worth fitting would be really nice atm the only real faction drone equipment are intergratedaugmented drones which arent worth anywhere near their price tag 90mil for a set of five lights is beyond stupid and when you factor in how frequently drones die is there any reason why you would want themimo sentient drones spawns should either drop a set of already assembled intergratedaugmented drones or considerably reduce the materials required to make them of course even if these changes were implemented would they really worth buying over t2
drone lovers need some ccp love ill support this hey any chance of throwing out some ore heavy mining drones too
this nerf is completely bull my t2s hit for far less than my t1s training for t2 cruise is now a complete waste of time by the time ccp gets done with their nerfing edness my t2 cruise will hit softer than an all out assault with miner iis this nerf is by far the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen and is completely unjustified the t2s were great to mission with but are now completely useless who knows when theyre done nerfing caldari pilots i will probably be able to be taken out by an ibis with a civilian gatling gun idiotssigned
i dont really support the op but given that theres definitely a missile problem and that no other realisitic alternatives appear to be available signedt2 missiles are to this day still broken and are the only form of t2 ammunition that never gets used  even more so now faction missiles are so common changes to t2 missiles and perhaps the modification of ballistic control systems to increase explosion radiusvelocity would resolve this problem without breaking anything else
i wish i could switch damage type of missile on each target with my rails gallente
i wish missiles instantly hit their target and that i could fit a new damage type as quickly as lasers can change crystals
and have the optimal range of autocannons
and ignore all damage resistances
my proposal for war declarations are as follows1 warring should only be allowed in high sec if both parties agree to it paytogrief is not be acceptable high sec is high sec and should not be reduced to 0 sec just because some pirate corp pays money to concord so they can kill innocents in peace2 to compensate for this effect concord respond times should be heavily increased and also be given a random factor to simulate a more realistic scenario concord ships should patrol solar systems so you never know where they are they should still remain around stations and jumpgates in high sec as well but maybe not all the time also on a side note i would be very grateful if concord ships assumed a more static dignified posture when patrolling jumpgates etc not spinning around the gatesstations randomly especially battleships do lose a bit of their dignity behaving in this manner better if the larger ships could assume a more majestic formation on a static position to the side of the gate or similar interceptors and frigates may continue to orbit the jumpgate though that still looks realistic but they should have a much wider orbiting range simulating patrol flight paths 
i know this will sound really weird but tbh i feel that the currant dec mechanics are more in favor of the agressed than the agressor as the defender can just corp hop as many times as they want to get away from war andor just hop into the nearest npc corp for example a corp deced a friendly corp of my alliance that was going to be joining us some guys from another corp we knew had a load of alts they had bought of ebay and illegaly bought isk made an alt corp and made the stupid mistake of putting one of there main chars in it then deced the 3 man corp that we were friends with so the corp that was attacked joined the alliance and as soon as that happend litiraly 3 seconds after they joined the alliance officialy and we coudl shoot the agressors they either logged or jumped form systme now a few days later they droped the dec and were pretending to be hired by someone else but we knew who they really were now after we decced there corp they all hopped corp to another corp then we deced that one and they all hopped to another one then we went after that one and they all either didnt log in or just went streight to npc corps now before someone says i have just used this thread to whine about corp hopping the point im trying to make is that dec mechanics as a whole is broken pretty much evenly both ways defenders who  someone off can just hop to the nearest npc corp for cover till the war blows over and of course there are those who do it to freif others so in all honesty maybe this should be looked into for both sides
this post deserves a get back to wow
for your information ive not played wow even once and whats with the immature impoliteness and your banner is completely out of line

if you must change something this is about the only reasonable modification

i think this idea is best explained with an example you are in lowsec happily missioning away and you are set upon by pirates you are able to send out a system wide distress signal that people not in your fleet could respond to possibly other runners who are not in your fleet or a corp that has claimed the system and can defend you if you have paid them a fee it also goes that pirates could respond to this beacon as well leading to more fights possibly occurring away from the standard gatesbelts this could also see use in fw areas where you may have a target pinned down solo and you ask for anyone to come help back you up this may be better implemented by being able to select an option where the beacon is only sent to allies or something of the sortthis simple feature could allow other players to more effectively cooperate maintain security in a system without needing the overhead to fleet up as far as i know the only way to warp to someone is to fleet with them and then warp be scanned down far too long for when a quick response is needed or manually type out the location you are in if you are near a celestial objectsystem wide distress beacons also have a lot of precendent in scifi shows  this is not meant to replace fleets but rather to do just what a distress beacon is intended for broadcast your location when you need assistance and a fast response is requiredobserving the signals would require another windowoverview setting and there would be the option to block signals coming from certain people to avoid spamtldr version at any time you can send out a signal that anyone else in the system could warp to this signal can only emanate from your ships current positionedit someone mentioned tossing a bookmark into local that seems like the simplest method of implementationanother edit if a bookmark can be tossed in local it would follow that a bookmark could be tossed into any chat eg into militia chat if you are in fw normally however tossing a bookmark into local would be the fastest way to hope that there are kind hearted people out there or at least people who will come in and kill the other people as well as you 
after some consideration i have decided to support my own topic
another precedent in scifi movies is that not only good guys respond to distress beacons are you prepared for more pirates to arrive when the beacon is sent or for traps to be set by priates using the beacon mechanismif both answers are yes  i dont see a problem with this idea if someone really wants to give everyone in local the ability to warp directly to them they should be prepared for whatever consequences follow
sorry i like the idea but not the exact wording
this would be a good source of the lol but thats what local is fornot supported
same if this means anyone  including more pirates could warp to you ill sign in support
not supported local is already there for use of that naturegranted its a perfectly good idea and a valid one logistically balanced in the fact that the risks of calling attention to yourself is not necessarily a good thing as wellbut again it would cause more harm than good on the server as i can see it nowimagine if you will a 1000 ship vs 1000 ship fleet fight and in the middle of all of that a couple hundred decide to broadcast a distress signalme shudders
while i admit to being somewhat of a carebear i am definitely of the opinion that pirates could respond exactly the same as any other player in the systemi had previously stated this withit also goes that pirates could respond to this beacon as well leading to more fights possibly occurring away from the standard gatesbelts 
the overhead would be similar to that of sending a message in a channel and if you recall the live dev blog hundreds of people were messaging simultaneously without lag
but you cant warp to someone in local can you
no local doesnt work for this purposelocal help help im being shotsomebody where are youlocal im in belt 32somebody warps to 32 70km from youby this time you are already deadeven worse if you have to do the whole fleet invite warp to member thingy
this is exactly why i am proposing this feature i was just checking that something analagous to it didnt already exist
you think that people are going to respond to a beacon by a unknown person in an unknown location where unknown activities are taking place i think not leave this mechanic in star trek shows where it belongs
i lawled at this1 pirates will come and gank u i wouldnt gank but id come and wait for antipirates comin2nd local is your friendcorpallaincewattever elseplus distress calls would be spammed in fleet battles to cause lag and dcs
they very well may come gank me but if i am already screwed ill take my chances  i am under no delusion that this is a safe thing to do its a desperate thing to do
what do you think about this optioncharacter progress will be fasterit will reduce time of characters standing in spotone more isk drainoverall faster ability to access and enjoy eve parts which person preferto elaborate this ideayour character would be able to finish training of skills instantlyfor a costone exampleengineering rank 1 have 256000sp so this is just a proposal fee will be 10isk per sp so from engineering 0 to 5 would cost your character 2560000 iskcruisers rank5 have 1280000sp because its rank 5 it will cost 5x more per sp so price to train it from 0 to 5 would be 50x 1280000  64000000 isk access to this feature could be added via agents to use this feature will not require any standing but with perfect standing fee could be 10 loweri granted myself freedom to give answers on some questions which i presume would be of interest to youwill this feature be unfair to old charactersnot at all yours old characters would have same advantage as new and upper hand you already saved billions by training them in standard wayhow will this affect character marketprobably it will make this option redundantand gtc marketmore people would start to sell them so your isk will start to worth a little more at the end i do believe that this option will return to eve those players who just get bored and quit burned out before they reach something that they want to do and fly this will reduce waiting and those boring days and weeks granting all players faster access to desired gameplay style
supporting this
not supported breaks a fundamental
not supported fundamentally opposite to the eve approach to things
firstly not supportedtrollsecondly something like this might actually work as long as its balanced lets say you put your character into intensive training that reduces the time it takes to train an idea by a certain percentage this costs isk and begins by talking to an agent in your starting school station once started your character cannot leave the station until the skill training is complete or cancelled and if cancelled the skillpoints you gained will decay at half your normal training speed for that skill meaning it must immediately be started to train normally which will then train at half speedgreat if you plan on training straight into capitals not so good if you plan to actually play the gametroll
this is so wrong and the conculsions are so flawed that its unsupportableplayers leave eve for a multitude of reasons they get bored with the mission grind 00 fleet lag have rl issues buying sps will not get those backcruiser 5 is about a 32 day skill depending on attribs if you cant wait that maybe you should ask is this game right for youthe basic premis of this proposal appears to be  i want an uber char without working for it well boingho if you dont want to put the time into developing your toon cancel your account and contract your stuff to eveuni
character bazaar is that v way its the existing official way to get skillpoints for isk why do you need another crappy system
supported
totaly 100 not supported this is totaly against what eve is about and gives way more of an advantage to much older and lifeless players
looks at thread titlethis idea is stupid and you should feel stupid for suggesting it
wrong char
please excuse the expletivesare you fecking insanethis would undermine the entire point of skill trainingthis would allow some one with billions of isk to1 create a new char2 pay for 60day time code3 spend isk in the char to get them to a sellable level4 sell the char for more isk than the outlaythis would also open a hole for people to start selling more chars for rl cash

could ccp please put a red thin boundary on bpc icons this would be really handy
hehe got to support my own topic
read this though
i see
the reason they didnt do something to distinguish the two is because scamming is an important part of eve and when you get to it scamming has to remain easy for it to be even still in the game just look at the contracts system some things are made in such a stupid way that it could only have been made to help scam
false its cos db in short was not made for recognizing  if bpo or bpc edit forget support  i know itll be hard thought
this has nothing to do with scammingit has everything to do with making sure you dont mix your green apples with your yellow apples
this has been brought up a thousand times before everybody wants it but theyd either have to wreck the database or write a new one to do it and its not worth the effort required if theres a simple answer i want it but to the best of everyones knowledge there isnt
signed
dont just type signed people you need to put a thumbs up t
ah just wanted to be sure thanks
this guys got it right no problem here move along
not signed but not for the reason you might think see here
agree with op30 vs 30 fights should not produce that much lag this last summer we had 70 vs 70 fights and we didnt even receive half the lag we do now in theses small fleets
well ccp would have to give a flying phuk first apparently they dont second it might help if they would perhaps admit there is a problem their logs never show an issue after those two steps maybe theyd get around to fixing it in about 18 months or so maybesorry but fleet fights and fw are pretty much massive fail theres better pewpew to be found elsewhereps ccp u suk
this really has been an issue when having fleet battles i think that fw areas both caldari  gallente and amarr  minmatar need more power to the server sideyes there are people with bad overview settings however there is heavy lag on fleet battlesim hoping for more focus from ccp to the factional warfare in other aspects as wellbest regardst2
why not make the covetor into a drone boat give it some role bonuses and bigger capacitybandwidth then how about we get some larger mining drones while were at it
signedthe time difference between retty  coverter  hulk is too similarthe only reason people might fly the coverter instead is if they cant afford the hulk
simple solution make hulk require exhumers v
um thats a little extremereducing the covetor to astrogeo iv would be a lot more consistent
not really 95 of hulk pilots have it anyway
thats quite reasonable actually considering what it ishulks are the top end of exhumers if you need mining barge v to fly a covetor it makes sense that you should have exhumers v to fly a hulksolves the problem quite effectively
lol  i can quite see the little stone rolling 
totally in support of this
signedperhaps the duel arena can have some settings that must be agreed to by both parties before you can fire upon eachother similar to 2 parties agreeing to a trade in station for example arena radius time limit propulsion limit maybe even a bet when 2 players agree to a duel a beacon of some sort is dropped players must stay within a certain radius or they automatically lose you could have stats for wins losses draws and cowardly warpouts now you have a statistic box that will show up in your character info that can give players bragging rights and a heads up on duelers that hide their tail between their legs similar to the duels setup a draw can be agreed by both if the duelers are unable to break eachothers tanks and decide to end it before the time is up my idea for the propulsion limit is intended to prevent one character from orbiting in circles just inside the arena limits with their mwd to exhaust the time limit and gain an automatic draw when they should have lost this is ofcourse situational and up to the players to decide if they want to use such a limit before the duel begins the only setting that would be required is some sort of arena radius and a time limit any other settings would be optional i think that with a system like this no one can say this is a carebear duel you decide you wanna battle here are the rules you shake hands and start fighting eachother no need for wardecs no need to travel any distance any time anywhere lets fight now this idea doesnt seem cowardly and cute rather quite honorable the only way to get a win is to destroy the other ship or if the other player dips out the only problem i see with this type of system is that dueling in low sec may allow players to boost their stats by having their friends attack the other player and boost their personal statistics there could be a few solutions to this restrict duels to empire space which sadly would exclude some players ornullify low sec duels where other players interfereorhave two stat banks for duels in high and low secor it could just be the risk you take if you agree to duel in low sec or if you are at war and dueling in empire thanks for reading if you say tldr then you should leave this part of the forums

what is it anyway with older players and the constant sneering at carebears carebears and losec pirates and everyone else in eve all have one thing in common they spend huge amounts of time either perfecting skills actual combat skills or earning isk or whatever carebears are afraid and rightly so that if they venture down into losec or 00 it will be a painful and expensive process not everyone but many below 04 love to kill noobs because it boosts their egos but in the main the fact is that most in losec have been at the game far longer than those in hisec ie carebears all the wow is that way zomg eve is becoming wow stuff is really getting old i think if losec players gave hisec noobs a good reason and no camping the first gate they come through amazingly doesnt count as a reason to go into losec such as invitations to fly and train with them and learn the ropes maybe more would goas every clown here constantly states eve is a harsh place its like the real world in that respect and just like in the real world people who even if is virtual work hard to earn their isk and theyre scared of losing and their implants bla bla bla treat thecarebears with more respect and less teenage epeen erage and im pretty sure youll get more of them in 04
i bet the pleas of those opposed to duelling in eve havewhatever it is i expect its another dumbingdown move for the game that looks good on paper and turns out to be terrible think faction warfare but no just think fw
i disagree regardless of how serious one of the duelers may be this is still a game not a fencing match nor a martial arts competition nor a fight to the death right now its more similar to a thumb war you shouldnt have shame because the person on the other side was dishonorable and used their index finger to get your thumb down but maybe the next time that person proposes a thumb war you may offer to use katanas and have a true duel if a specific way to duel was implemented the dishonorable may be discouraged to partake in other words players who truly want to duel can do so effectively with a system that promotes honorable gameplayyes combat is allowable but not anywhere anytime and sure you could declare war but then you have the whole corp or alliance on you for a week we are talking about a one time deal lets fight now and its over i believe the purpose of this idea is to have a function to duel in high sec without having to flip each others cans im not saying it doesnt work but in order to duel here players are using game mechanics designed for something else its great that people have used this method to fulfill their desire to duel but it still leaves plenty of space for people to cheat andor waste your time why not create a mechanic for a purpose people obviously would like to see and why not have a dueling system where the cowardly and dishonorable opponent can be discouraged to play or tared and feathered for running away this is not a nerf of any sort and doesnt impose on any other form of gameplay already available this mechanic doesnt affect anyone not dueling so why are people so against it i think the majority of people against it just dont care to use it

i am against anything which limits the consequences of bad decisions in eve consequences are what seperates eve from other mmos where dying simply means respawning somewhere and perhaps a little embarassment say a person is in a bar and some dude starts tryinig to pick a fight with them the bully has 4 buddies back at his bar table the person wants to kick the hell out of the bully a very serious consideration in this situation needs to be will his friends stay out of it when i start pounding on him even if the bully agrees to take it out side agreed to a duel can we be sure his buddies will not interfere no we cant its not fair its life i do not want more factors in the game that limit consequences of our decisions to continue the analogy find a way to get out of the bar or deal with the fact you might be fighting five dudes
the beauty of eve is that the only honour in the game is what you bring to it putting mechanics in place that can be an obstacle to dishonour would be a horrible mistake in my opinionfollowing the analogy of a thumb war the index finger example is a dreadful one what would be more apt would be that you start thumb wrestling and one of your friends turns up with a sledgehammer crushing your hand this to me is the way eve should be and the ideas in this thread distastefully try to take the game away from this i would support changing the game to allow combat against anyone anywhere anytime as long as it was as unregulated as zerosec combat currently is anything else would be fluff and a waste of man hours to develop one time fight flip those canscp forum is for your tarring and theres nothing wrong with using the can flip mechanic if a dueling system consisted of being able to choose to flag yourself to someone in highsec and nothing more i could understand that but its not what wed see is a system of honour points and epeen waving and theres more than enough of that at presentthis mechanic could and would affect people witnessing a duel as currently if i see people dueling in highsec i may well decide to attack one of them myself and take the concordokken just to  them offthat my friend is the essence of eveonline and all that makes it great
if you want to engage in unregulated pvp action you have the freedom to fly out to low sec and do whatever you want that is the beauty of eve the purpose of this proposed game mechanic would be to strictly have a 1 on 1 duel with someone flipping cans allow a whole corporation to engage in combat people who actually want to duel are discouraged to engage in these battles purely because its not worth risking your ship to some dishonorable jackss who has his buddies waiting to warp in and gang bang you after this happens a couple times to someone one will probably loose interest in engaging in this type of battle i would have no problem risking a 200mil isk battleship if i was sure that no one else would interfere if there was a 1 on 1 dueling system we would see alot more pvp and in turn stimulate the market i would be 100 satisfied with a simple flag that allows combat without additional regulation my only intention for proposing an arena and some sort of regulation would be to support a point system if there was oneno it wouldnt affect any witnesses this mechanic wont prevent you from being a moron and loosing your little ship when concord pimp smacks you the 2 players can flag eachother as ok to fire while you can throw away as many frigates as you wish in attempt to pss people off you wont be tipping the scales of any good battle when your ship gets popped in 20 seconds i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume are smart enough to not waste an expensive ship in such a manner it seems to me that you are one of those people who will can flip for a duel and then call in a swarm of corp members to bombard them this is why you dont want them to create this mechanic because it would be stealing your fun go back to a noob system and drop more cans that say your cargo container and no that is not the essence of eveonline that is the essence of a person who relies on pssing people off to enjoy the game because they have become bored with it
no it wouldntthis is a streamlined mechanic that prevents interference but that doesnt stop some idiot from jumping in and getting concorded because he wanted to do said thingthis just makes sure any interference including repping or corp flagging would be concorded for interferencenot that it would stop you you get anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds o 
that ladies and gentlemen is what we call a straw man
so im at this bar and this bully starts picking on me if i decide to fight him and put my fists up i run the risk of his brute friends stepping in and sucker punching me i dont disagree with this statement at all but the scenario we are asking for is a place to spar with a person in an honorable way we are playing a game not dealing with drunken brodudeshow about this scenario you are at the gym and you come across someone you want to spar with youwanna go for a boxing matchthemsure next thing you know two people jump in the ring and start beating the living daylights out of each other one person will win or both people will become exhausted and call it off either way both players get to say good match regardless of who won the difference here is that you have both agreed to a fight for fun and it is obvious that no one else is gonna jump in to support one of the fighters this isnt a bully scenario if some idiot brings brings a barbell and wails on one of the contenders you better believe the gym staff is gonna be calling the police that is lifethe game already allows us to walk down the street and start a fight with a stranger we are asking for an arena so we can battle for sport if there was a point system attatched to it like i proposed above you could keep track of who won who lost who had a draw and who ran out of the ring like a little sissy sport
yeah but arent you the same guy who argued earlier that this wasnt a fencing match or martial arts match now youre comparing it to a almost exactly that my point is that eve is and should remain a lot closer to the bar parking lot than the health club
an arena is a good idea but that is not what the op wants any arena would have to incur ship loss it just has to otherwise it is a huge immersion breaker have you ever seen duels in other mmos it completely breaks any immersion you may have as it is two people just messing around instead of dying you kneel down and a healer who watches nearby heals people and they are instantly ready to go again it is incredibly lame to watch and pointless as no one actually dies eve is about meaningful losses and combat dueling without ship loss is out of place in evethe whole point of eve is that you are given the choice to be in a bad corp that breaks dueling agreements or be in an honorable corp that honors 1v1s with the current system you have the choice with your system you have no choice because you cannot dishonor a duel it makes it have zero honor oh god ehonor honor is only accrued if you do something when the temptation to do evil or nothing is therei dont see why we cannot have a few arenas around the galaxy for duels and tournaments but a flat out acceptance of the extremely lame wow dueling mechanic is wholly against what makes eve different from wow and wowclones
no the camp was actually quite split on this very thing
o rly let me ask you this the situation above you have a billion or so in bounties from a nice life of crime and suddenly you get caught in a bubblecamp or get podded due to not getting your pod out due to lag or to a discocamp congrats you are back to 0 skillpoints what would you do quit i hella would loosing skillpoints is not the solution the rest of the idea looks half okay except for the remove concord idea that sucksreduce the amount of high sec yes but not make everything lawless the nobs would get permaganked and quit within hours
thank you for your timei would simply ask you to reread my proposal as your premise is i believe highly unlikely based on the proposal i submittedyou could not have a billion isk bounty on your head unless you actually had a billion skill pointshere is how i see this play outplayers would form corps of bounty hunters security forces or simply bodyguardslarger corps would create their own divisions probably but smaller corps would be able to hire such independent corps to protect their industrial assets miners and even mission runnerspirates would have the opportunity to gank everyone sure but they would also be subject to actual consequences for doing so in empire space a pirate or group of pirates for that matter would have to decide if ganking a newb was actually worth the very real possibility of losing a significant amount of training time as a matter of fact smart pirates will probably be very selective about just exactly who and what they will choose to engage considering the fact that once flagged the roaming bands of bounty hunters and other players can take a free shot until such time as the pirate can remove the bounty by ratting or podding other criminals themselvesnow if you are a pirate and are both elite enough and dare i add stupid enough to accrue a bounty which actually equals your entire pool of skill points that would simply be your own fault kinda like flying on ap and afk through losec carrying a bunch of titan bpos
fair enough i missed that point but my point still stands  skill point loss for doing what you want is not beneficial to the game a pirate that regurlarly pirates would end up with a huge bounty its not uncommon today with pirates with billions of a bounty if you could only get up to your skill point max not only would it tell people exactly how many skill points you have but it would also be a meh reward for the one that manages to pod himi still do not like it
fair enough but consider the following points if you would1 a smart pirate would likely not allow their bounty to get too large2 the system allows for the pirate to have a chance of reducing or eliminating the current bounty3 with the elimination of concord hisec pirating would allow for significant profit potential4 bounty hunting now becomes a valid profession with many potential clients to boot5 newb corp hugging becomes significantly less desirable as players mission runners industrialists traders etc will seek viable corps that can provide actual security6 mindless ganking and griefing simply for the lulz though possible would actually be punishable by other players7 losec benefits from immediate viability versus hisec in fact only the real difference would be that in losec there would be no significant faction navy presence8 macro miners and other nondesirables could now be properly terrorized the list goes on but you get the ideathank you for your consideration
sorry i missed the part about the meh rewardagreedperhaps we could add a small modifier to the payout but i would rather that the majority of income for bounty hunters and security type personnel would come from fees payed by the players they are working for
i can agree with the idea behind your suggestion but the actual game mechanics would be idiotic skill loss is a bit too harsh for a penalty so if anyone ever pirates after this change they probably spend most of their time ratting to keep their bounty low
indeed they probably wouldharsh dont do the crime if you cant do the timeyeadont do itmaybe there would be whines about bounty hunters camping hisec gates waiting for the unwary yet flashy flashy pirate be fun to see i suppose
no you dont get it 100k sp lost for a single shuttle kill is way way way too harsh of a penalty my adequate reward for risking my entire character is you are losing a whole months worth of skill training for one ship how is that balanced not even darkfall is having sp loss afaik and it is because people will just quit the game en mass players dont want sp loss and it has nothing to do with them not being hardcore enough losing 250k sp in eve can mean you cannot compete effectively for 3 months who wants to play a game that ruins your character for 3 monthsgod forbid the server or i lag for a few seconds and i get podded now my character is almost worthless that is pretty much how podding in high sec works you lag on ship destruction and an inty grabs you and you die having your characters life hinge on lag is terribleyou are making it so i have to risk my entire character just to kill one enemy ship risk vs reward is completely out of whack in your idea i risk my ship to kill an enemy ship if i am risking my sp then how about a way for me to kill your sp hell if i am risking my sp how about i gain sp when i make a kill in high sec that would be better balancing of risk vs reward if every ship in high sec carried 5b of loot then ok great rewards for great risk but less isk than what youd get while ratting suicide ganking doesnt make people super rich contrary to popular belief for risking possibly your entire characters sp riiiiighta mechanic like this is fine but the sp loss is way way too much i like how you think this would be hardcore while it really just makes the game more carebearish as it completely favors carebears since they dont have to risk any sp at all and get the insane rewards of high secchange sp loss part and we have a good idea that i would support
there have been a number of posts on the forum that have crossed my attention and i am sure many many that i have not which are blatently posted for no other purpose that to bring nationalism or racism into the gamefor example linkimo this is completely unnecesary in the world of eve everybody is created equal whatever the race  skincolour  religion  nationality of the pilot behind the screen is it is completely irrelevant to the gamei would like to ask the csm to ask ccp to enforce more severe reprocussions on the anyone involved in this it is not only offensive to those it is aimed at but also to others reading the forumsand just for the record i am white english and aethist so none of these threads that i have seen have been directed at me
im just as offended by overactive censorship as i am by stupidity and bigotry theres a grey area here i suppose i support the intent behind the thread i just urge the person judging the level of offensiveness of a thread to use a lot of good discretion and judgement for the record i really enjoy the fact that the galaxy we play in is so diverse that the language spoken in local and the times people are awake change by the region especially in deep 00 awesome and realistic

fw fights of 30 on 30 are having terrible lagwhen we whine about it we get the typical response fix you client settings as if we have not all done so alreadyi think that the lowsec servers are plain underpoweredoverloaded but maybe it is a network issue although evevoice seems fine through all of the lagplease help us understand why we do not get anywhere near this mythical 00 fleet fight performancei can understand that ccp would like to hide this information but scm represent us and demand some openness
not supported ccp is a private company with no obligation to share internal server logs
not supported breech of privacy on all fronts and accountsdeal with it or find something else to resolve it
one instance of the discussion is here but i couldnt support it in that form my explanation went on a while so ive started a new thread to explore thati couldnt support the other option not because theres no lag but because having 4 systems wouldnt work for those in the amarrminmatar fw zones  sure we have hot systems in terms of kills but fleet fights can happen in any one of 20 systems on any given day these dont have the blobtastic flavour of the caldarigallente areas but get more than 30 people fighting each other and lag really starts to show thankfully the lag bombs have mostly gone our way but that doesnt change the fact that were having issues at only 15 vs 15i suspect that there are 2 issues here  the first is that ccp seem to have woefully underestimated the resources needed for the fw areas indeed if the rumours ive heard are true then this would be the biggest understatement since mrs chamberlain turned to her husband and said you know neville i think that that mr hitler lol for odd censorship of that word might not be a very nice man certainly this new lagfest is a recent addition to our days without a commesurate change in how we fly or fight to account for it and as such should be investigatedthe second issue is one of ccp being hoisted by their pr petard for months now they have been trumpeting about their new stacklessio and suchlike  dazzling those of us without protection from jedi graph mind tricks with visions of a lagless client and yes the data are very compelling and were all suitably impressed by the jawdropping performance of jita but its made us all much more aware of when lag happens which is a shame but theres not a lot to be done about it until and maybe even when eve starts running on quantum servers there will be lag what we as players have to do is recognise which lag is unavoidable and which is not see point 1 abovethe solution what we need from ccp is really the following1 a full description of the resources assigned already to the fw war and how things like 00 load may affect this so that we have an idea of where were starting from2 a description of what realistically can be done to improve resources in all 8 fw regions and an acknowledgement that what works for the caldari  gallente may not work for the amarr  minmatardiscuss awayedit for link fixing
good lord a sensible post by jingoyes this would be rather nice i also agree that those of us in the amarrminmatar side of fw dont spend all day fighting in 24 systems and thus never need resources anywhere else in the bleaksdevoid regionsedit by the way your link doesnt appear to work
i support this
signedi like the idea but i would like to see it also signature based
not bad supported
heh good idea but id probably make 4 200 instead of 150 other than that your idea is pretty damn sound and could even spread gatecamps into more random systems instead of the same ol high sectolo sec choke points
but that is because with the current mechanics unless you tackle someone at a belt or have lots of webs with you there is no way you have the time to discuss ransom since there is no way to reliable make money from ransom nobody invests in getting a reputation for respecting ransom with some small exceptionsi think it would be nice to take control of a gate in lowsec and make money based on people passing through right now you only make money when you surprise someone on a jump in from the other side it would also be cool if you could charge a gate usage fee similar to a station docking fee if you are in control of a gate that way

this is a problem i encounter when mining in gangs with folks who arent disciplined about avoiding other peoples rockshaving some indication that a targetted module is active with no target would be nice
you dont even need other people fit a tractor and salvager to whatever ship youre running and you can salvage as you fight if youre not efficient enough to do this or invite a friend jackals like me will swoop in and pick on the corpses
why dont you read the ones that actually mention the work of the csm from november instead of complaining that the last two this january lack csmcontent
ok lets lookquarterly econ report this directly involves a major game change nosixth alliance tourny nopeevelopedia nice but can sit on the backburnerthings that we should get devblogs onnanos  done deal caldari  minmatar dreads being reworkedcitadel torpedos being reworkedtitans being reworkedsov warfare being reworkedas said beforefluff needs not be looked at the moment the basing of the game is what needs to be looked at
im starting to think that he doesnt want to
yes you could probably go on for days reading dev blogs that do not say anything about the csm so ill make it easy for you
i will give credit to the orca and weapon groupingbut in reality these werent major game changes yes they brought cool new things yes the orca is cool and all but its not a game play change and or huge impact to the game as the indies already had the rorqual which is better btw weapon grouping is nice and pretty handy and saves alot of keyboards being smashed now only f1 key is abused but still in the end no major game changes had been prevented by the csm as of date ie nano nerfyes i am butthurt had the nanonerf been prevented i would have faith in the program but till then the orca  weapon grouping is just fluff
the nano nerf was inevitable the csm could not change that

up
does anyone here actually know anything about explosives of course you dont just look at the amount of supports hereexplosives produce an amount of explosive force measured in figures like this ms metres per second and m3 of total explosive potential when a bomb explodes in a confined space its effect is amplified by the confined space eg expanding gasses rushing down hallway secondarily explosions in atmosphere have a concussive effect that is totally missing from an explosion in vacuumstealth bombers essentially perform the role of payload delivery beyond the range of their support fleetsuccessful deployment of bombers requires the cunning removal of interceptors such as the sacrifice of a squadron of us torpedo bombers to japanese zeros so that a second bomber force could sink the 4 japanese carriers present at the battle of midway eve only argument what other ships can cause damage after they are destroyed
so why not to give all missilebased weapons rockets missiles torpedoes bombs an ability to not disappear after its owner warped out or died or even used cloaking device it will be a good boost for sbs maybe the best possible
i slowly have the feeling ccp is tolerating them because it brings them money
i dont support this mainly because i dont like theese how to spot a macro miner instructions if i decide to orbit ice asteroids all day rejecting convos and ignoring local then i should be able to do that and not owe anyone an explanation for italso i dont get your inital problem you are angry because you dont get individual personal replys from the gms you send your petitions to  do you think it would help the banning of macro miners if a gm had to sit down 5 minutes to create a personal reply to each petition wether you got a personal reply or not ccp will bann the offending party if they have suitable evidence of them using macros if they cant find suitable evidence than you shouldnt arrogate that you could it may not have come to your mind yet but it is entirely possible that someone you petitioned was not banned for the reason that they were simple not guilty and that your assumptions on them were wrong
funny and i do like the idea of being able to throw a bookmark into local but not worth the effort of implementing
interesting idea only if pirates could make use of it either by being able to warp to the beacon or having the ability to use it setup a trap

i personally think it is bad game design that mission types are so randomly handed out in such a way that it frequently happens that people are locked out of the game for hours or even days because they repeatedly get a streak of missions they cannot or do not want to completeexamples of situations getting icegas cloud missions when not having the required skillsequipment getting a mining mission in general or that takes two hours to complete 15 hours before downtime getting combat missions when asking for couriermining missions getting vs faction missionsi just switched agents and got hit by an extremely bad streak of vsmissions from a l3 ministry of war agent my sweet privateer a million little pieces and another my sweet privateer i went to a soe agent next door and promptly got portal to war and intercept the saboteurs vs amarr i want to play eve and thus accepted the saboteur thing and my amarr standing went from 803 to 760 for destroying an amarr cruiser or two all kills within a 15 minute window standing hit 24 anyway after doing a few more missions im now stuck on missing reporters vs caldari over the past 48 hours i spent over 24 waiting for rejection timers to run outit is unacceptable and bad game design that people are being locked out of the game waiting for 4hour timers to expire with the introduction of the new missions with empyrean age things have only become worse as my sweet privateer and a million little pieces etc are now being extremely common missions to getnormally id say stick to courier missions but unfortunately not all corpsfactions have courrier agents soe does not have any l3l4 that are not innext to lowsecits simply unacceptable that people paying subscription fees are basically being told they cant play now and should come back in 4 hours repeatedlypossible fixes feel free to discuss less vs missions if your standing with the opposing faction is higher charismabased skills that reduce standing hits from kills overall reduction in standing hits from kills charismabased skills to reduce negative derrived standing hits reduction of certain mission types if the player has a history of turning them down reduce 4hour timer to something more reasonable like 30 minutes optout of certain mission types significantly reducing chances to get one at the cost of also decreasing overall payout for all other missions total overhaul of the way missions are granted please discuss
nobody tells you that you cant play you can just take the penalty of being picky about what you want to do or you can go and do something else theres plenty of things to do in eve so im not supporting this at all its a problem with the player not the mechanics solely
honestly i really dont see a major overhaul on mission running being necessarya slight adjustment on the percentages of getting various missions would help but my only major complaint is its prue and total torture to raise up your empire standing as opposed to faction standinghonestly if i kill an amarrian ship they get mad at me easily enough but minmatar should be happier just as muchthe effect it has on your standings should cancel out each other much like an accountants ledger credits and debitsseems to be quite heavily favoring the easily ed off type system but very hard to pleasenot to be confused with concord thats understandable but for cryin out loud its such a painperhaps if your concord sec rating should translate to an easier standings increase as it goes up over timeobviously pirates and those who grief arent likely to give a damn about mission running so it kinda makes sense
the gas harvesting is the only one where theres an issue as the skills required are specificfor example in lvl1 missions theres the occasional hacking or archaeology mission and in all of the ones that my friends and i have encountered the agent gives you a civilian codebreaker or civilian analyser which does not require the archaeology or hacking skills and is sufficient to do the missionis a civilian gas harvester that requires no skills too much to ask for the gas missionssame for a civilian ice harvester which is slower and worse than an ice harvester but can be fitted to other ships than barges and requires no skillsthe rest of your issues i do not see as a problem those are merely missions you do not want to do gasice harvesting missions are ones which you are not able to do
like always your posts are filled with complete bs the game is more than a single agent
this used to be the case standings going up while others went down but this was removed because it was exploitable people failing missions on purpose to boost the opposing faction standingciv gas cloud harvester is an idea but even with 3 normal gas cloud harvesters the higher level ones still take 12 hours of sitting idle to completegetting empire standing quicker for higher concord standing makes sense but is a bit unrelated the current issue is having to wait so long because there are many missions that have to be turned down which got a lot worse thanks to the new faction missions from empyrean ageindeed thats why i now have a mission log full of missions waiting in line to be turned down
you know you could be out running quests right now if you go back to wow heh  who would have thought that it would be ankh that i really got to say that to with such feeling eh no really that was fun was it good for you
if your not driving the car then who is and why are you in the back seat
there is a problem in the mechanism too a caldari mission runner was and i think is still capable of switching between several high quality level 4 agents in the motsu area so lessening the penalty for his refusals a player running for soe dont have that possibility a player running for the amarr gallente or minmatar factions generally dont have that possibility as they have less level 4 kill missions agents scattered over a wider area eve agents say 87 amarr 61 gallente and 61 minmatar against 118 caldari for some weird reason the best area to run for quafe is domain where you can find 3 high quality noncombat level 4 agents in a area of less than 6 jumps total the original agents distribution was done randomly but that created some weird distribution that still affect mission running players today the high number of caldari kill agents and the fact that they are mostly packed in a relatively small area together with some ship really well suited for that had generated the huge number of caldari characters and the caldari are only good for pve concept i dont subscribe most of the suggestion done by ankhesentapemkah but some reflecting about the problem should be made a new player could easily destroy his standing with one of the two empire sides in the first few months of playing before even realizing what he want to do and what he is doing to his staning
the missions with the civilian codebreaker analyzer and salvager are starting missions done to give new players an idea of what those modules do each string of missions can be done only once for character this make them very different from normal missions
personally i would like some free choice of missions alsoi think it should be more balanced thoughmaybe the rewards should reflect the missions picked up in stead so those not being worked became more valuable and gave higher rewards and those picked to often lost value when overworkedif atleast the type of mission could be selected somehowi do see there might be a balance shift issue and mission miningbut its better to give a good gaming experience and then find the balance solution afterwards imho
the 10part tutorials yes i know of thoseim not referring to those ones thoughthere are some lvl1 missions that also give out the civilian codebreaker or analyservitoc vector is one of them for minmitar uses the civilian codebreaker
the standings issue is one that is of interest to me however i can see the other problems as welli dont mind working to keep all my empire standings high but i hate having to just twiddle my thumbs and wait the whole npc mechanic completely barring you from 50 of high sec is ridiculous as it can lock you out of a lot of possibilities in the future with player run corpsedit i dont mind losing access to agents but i do mind permanently losing access to high sec space

i wonder if it would be possible to add a temporary distinguishing mark to just those bps that have been looked at during the current session wouldnt need to persist even across a dockingundocking but it would still make it much easier to keep track of which print you want to do something with
lies to change color you need just to change few numbers in reality it can be done in less then 5 minutes
i can already max out an entire station easily any increase and i can tie up a whole solar system myselfi support an increase but you need to find a way to stop people like me from being able to just soak up all the npc slots alone possibly make it affect only player owned slots or just increase build speed insteadalso already only a tiny fraction of the player base is needed to build for everyone increasing what we can do is likely to just drive down prices and actually reduce rather than increase our profit so the end result is probably that it is counterproductive
no because it will nerf newbies
make them require advanced manufacturelab ops level 5 this will make true industrialists  part timers putinovenandforgetandsellatlowerthanproductioncostcausedidnotdomyworkwhileiwaspvpinganything to crush those wannabeparttimers is fine by mebecasue t2fitted bs pilot  t1fitted bs pilotbut atm true industrialist  parttimers becasue it takes only 1 month to almost max industry out and be as competitiveso to those who think newbs goign to get overwhelmed by true industrialists how about when newbs get pawned by t2fitted pvpers unfair and you think its fair a 1 month old newb can compete with true industrialists
adv skill 5 takes 2732 days so will you train all your alts for a month will you pay 20 per alt to make an additional 5 jobs 6 jobs you want lol if you do then you should reap the reward and lol compete with others with enough money like you it all get even in the end and its not as if we can book a slot parttimers can still annoy the hell of you putinovenanforgettype of peopleoh and buildspeed is the skill that will destroy part timers and provide unfair advantages for your 11 manurnd slotscounterproductive yes if you sell in empire
i support this one
not supported i do think that local should be removed or at least allowed players that cant be seen in local
the lag get rediculously high even with 30 ppl in fw needs a boost
supported actually you could just put the whole of black rise the tamaoms pipes on a supernode there is usually only one big fight going on after allbut yes the amount of lag weve seen with very modest player amounts is ridiculous 30v30 is already totally unplayable to all involved and yes i take off brackets etc
100 supported please end the lagfest that is fw
signedmaybe we should all ask for node reinforcement every day just to be sure  like a rolling node reinforcementhedge our bets in case anything relatively large happens the following day
sat the other day in oms with 60 in local it was really ok no stutter no lag at all so i could not believe my eyes when the militiachat suddenly came alive about the horrendous lag in oms and calls for reinforced nodes being there for most of the night and not experiencing any lag at all i recommended to turn som effects off and promtly got told to stfunow i run premium on an antique rig so i strongly suspect that reinforcing a node will not help 90 of those who complain about lag but hey i know its easier to ask someone else to fix your problems
were you in combat or sat in station  if you were not even on the combat grid then i wouldnt expect you to notice much of a problemi dont have an antique rig and have all effects off and i still suffer the occasional desync module lag i can cope with to some degree as you know there is just a delay in activating but full desyncs make me cry
i was on the different gates most of the time in my example with much skirmishes and two full blown conflicts where the majority of the 60 in local started to shoot each other it was after that when most of the complaining began in militiachat fyi when real lag hits the server it is not only the grid that is affected but all systems on the same blade it becomes even impossible to move between them i have never seen that in fw
way back when the servers where laggy and things were very different ccp decided to limit market ordersthis was in theory a sound idea to create a specific type of player it did however end up creating a lot of our sufferings todayi am not trying to troll or turn the world upside down so bear with meas a result of many players strategies and short term thinking the concept passive assets is not very used this in turn is why establishing a basis for corp and player netvalues isnt at work muchwithout thinking in passive assets all over the board its hard to work a market with a limit of ordersspace is to big for the number of active market trading people unless this sees some kind of change we will never get a more flowing and high paced gamewhat i am basically saying is that economy in eve is pseudo static because market orders limit working hug passive assets this in case also makes the increments 001 bids an issue back when we had unlimited orders this was more rare because you could basically surround such bids with stacks of increasing or decreasing orders just like in rl reflecting your supply and demand so even though this is a sort of borring topic to most pilots i really think it should be brought up again
im sorry but i was under the impression the current limit for orders was quite hugethis your proposal doesnt sit rightcan i get a confirmation on the maximum limit of orders please
three hundred and five 305 at maximum skillsand if thats not enough for you youve got way too much free time on your hands
if 305 orders plus or minus isnt enough for you id say your not exactly the honest typesupport denieddoors that way
if you read the actual postthen you might understand the point and not jump to conclusions about me abusing the system or having to much timethe problem is the gaps between orders need to be removed in order to make prices more dynamic and in order to make passive assets investing an optionif these parts didnt make sense then you should ask about their meaning before asuming i am manipulating anythingpassive assets are the piles you havent been able to work yet those ordered at long ranges and that need shipping or parts you havent been able to get buyers for it could also simply be tradegoods you get at good prices to long standing ordersthese things are using the system it got nothing to do with abuse in order to work on that type of economic cycle you really need more ordersnotice the many pirates talking about trash loot this might not be trash on long investment but on short there is no market for itpre nerf i had more than 3000 active orders
its a matter of game mechanics but you obviously didnt bother to think that farif you want to play the market then go play the stock marketthe market in eve is already out of control pricing wise no thanks to macro miners and giving anyone that kind of power to buy and sell at the numbers you want is highly suspicious
i can understand why it could seem suspiciousit might sound like wanting to grab market control that is actually not the point its the exact opposite i would prefer the market get more liberated and gave more influence to the smaller skilled playersas i have tried to show in other posts the result of this would be orders on more items everywhere and more requirements in strategy from the traders the simple micro increments would not be enough anymore because traders would be able to place order stacks on the same item thus you would need to decide where to place your order pricewise and not just competition shift it by 001this would also lead to more smooth price curves on most items becaue competition would be more flowing and less minute to minute trades in short sellers and buyers would need to consider prices today and on the longer runs when trading this would not be a bad thing because prices would move towards a more realistic equilibrium
yes at the moment the way to duel in empire is very much like a childish game where people may ignore the rules and play by their own i would like to see something more serious that allows two players and no one else to freely engage in combat for sport no one can get support from other ships no fleet bonuses etc straight up one on one i do have to say i have never played any other mmos out there so i am not familiar with the characteristics of existing duel systems i would just like to see the ability to agree to a duel that doesnt involve me allowing a whole corporation to attack me alsoi totally agree with you but this duel system wouldnt eliminate this metaphorical bar situation when you go to low sec you can loose your ship even if you didnt look for a fight you may have just passed by the wrong people at the wrong place at the wrong time just like choosing to walk into the bar and it is totally up to you to travel there and take that risk or not i by no means am asking for that to be taken away from the game i am asking for a shred of control in one certain situation low sec allows anyone or any group to do what they want and i am all for it but i want to see some serious contenders go one on one in the boxing ring not a group of fools with shanks broken bottles and brass knuckles
this is not only for 1v1 actually this works for groups of friends who are not in the same corp and want to do a group pvp in high sec it is much much easier to just agree to a pvp flag for a period of time via an interface option rather than all bunching up and dropping cans and stealing from them especially helps people doing their own pvp tournaments and want to invite friends outside of corp to iti mean stealing from cans for 1v1 or group pvp in highsec is fine this is just trying to offer a more refined methodtrading cans for consensual high sec pvp is so 2003 we are improving and advancing eve with every patch this is no different in its purpose
vaal you seem opposed to my idea simply because wow also uses an interface option to allow for consensual pvp where pvp otherwise is not an option so do you also want to eliminate the option where people agree to steal from each others jetcan in space to then set a 15 min timer for a pvp fight in high sec how is the jetcantrading mechanic we currently have any better or mature sounding than the dreaded wowlike interface mechanic that would achieve the same end seriously what does wow have to do with this dude
well he wrote almost d
if it was the same as using jetcans why the heck would ccp waste time on such a mechanic when you can use jetcansa duel option similar to wow would suck in eve
skil point loss idea is terriblebounty idea while intresting is too easy to expoitremoving concord is very unlikely
only makes it more carebearish for those who want no real consequences for their actionsif you are so worried about all those terrible things simply dont be a criminal in empire however for others this may just add a bit of additional spice to the game
no one is forcing you to take any actual risk that part is completely up to you
good luck finding someone that wants to risk 3 months of sp to get loot thats not even worth your time compared to ratting or missioning
warning followed by temporary ban for a second offensive followed by a permanent ban for a thirdby ban i mean from the game not just the forums
perhaps the thread i linked is not the worst i am not normally overly sensitive to such issues i guess when there is so much of it in rl it is annoying to see it in game but most of all i truely believe it serves absolutely no positive purpose in the game therefore there can be no harm in ccp doing everything possible to stamp it out and i am not talking about players who happen to use terms that can be deemed offensive i am talking about those who specifically target players of other races  nationalities
allas a merc one thing that really gets me mad is neut repping alts engage one target outside a station and two neutral reppers start helping this sucks as you spot a wt work out how best to engage but everyone seems to have an endless amount of neutral reppers ready to start helping when the target is engagedi have no problem with logistics as they are very useful however being able to leave them in a nub corp waiting to help your war decced main is bs i propose making remote repping unless in the same corpalliance a concordable offence i cant engage neutral reppers till they start to help so why should player be able to use this lame arse tactici do my research engage one on one and two neuts step in to rep this is bs and should be outlawed i do expect to be flamed however this is my opinion ideascritismsupportexpansion of ideas welcome
shouldnt be necessary since you can legitimately attack the neutral reppers after they have began aiding your wartarget unless i am mistaken
oh the ironyyoure whining about neutral remote reps when your corp and alliance use them all the time and lets not forget the 231 odds logon traps and ubiquitous falcon alt perhaps you meant to post on a troll alt
if you can shoot them  and im pretty sure you can  i see no problem with the status quo
two solutions already existshoot them or bring falconproblem solved
id have to agree with the op firstly you cannot shoot the neutral repn ship in hi sec if you do ull be concorded secondly this practice has become rampant with griefer corpalliances in hi sec yes im in a carebear alliance but am willing to fight in a war dec but whats the point if youve no chance of winning when this tactic is employed this seriously needs to be looked at lastly it was the remote repn a pilot being shot at by the faction navy in faction warfare that was changed
i dont understand what the problem is if you cant shoot them until they help then shoot them when they start helping outis this such a hard thing to figure out sheesh
nope as said above ccp has no obligaton to provide internal logs
we knew that everybody knows that theyre regular old nodesbecause that high performance only happens on one of the few new hardware nodes if you manage to schedule the use of one for those fleet opsyou know one of those new machines that also runs jita on a permanent basis oh yes because several devblogs and news items is hiding it isnt it the rest of the hardware will be upgraded when ccp can afford toin case you dont know they have a debt about as big as two years worth of income and the value of the current hardware is quite impressive too so you cant exactly blame them for not doing anythingyeah sure they could go on a borrowing spree right now and buy better machines allround just so you would lag less leaving them with two and a half or even three years worth of debt but if you dont realize why thats not a good idea theres no point talking to you anymorebefore you complain next time at least try to do your homework on what youre complaining about
perhaps you could mount a new kind of module that converts the cargo hold for various tasks i have always thought that the cargo hold should suffer a capacity hit if used for mining except in mining dedicated vessels to represent equipment used inside the cargo hold that organises the carious minerals being harvestedthis same idea could be used here you mount a special module to your freighter freighter only modules as i assume there is some reason freighters cannot mount modules or huge industrial that allows the transport of assembled ships both rigged and standard at the loss of total capacity once there are people having private ambulation parties in cargo holds people are going to care what is in them
i have a proposal for a new skill under corp management that would allow for a reduction in pos fuel requirements per levelthe skill would be the same pricelevel and have the same prereqs as starbase defense and its effects would be 2 fuel savings per level to get to level 5 you would be looking at 3040 days training depending on attribute levelsthis would give fuel savings of approx 14000 isotopes 2600 heavy water and 4600 ozone per month the implementation could be the flaw in this who gives the bonus one solution could be to base it on the last person to fuel the posits got a few wrinkels that need to be sorted out please feel free to critise expand support or troll
have to support my own topic
in other words you want ur pos to be cheaper to run go get sovereingtyalso what will happen after thisless demand for ice products vs same supplymeaning ice products become even moreso cheapertherefore you want to nerf ice minerswrong choice
theres a slight flaw in your logic i was under the impression the pos doesnt answer to any particular one person and if this is a ceo thing then thats kinda uh unbalancedalthough im open to further discussion on the matter
one idea im kind of fond of is corporate director slots for things like this have a cfo whose skills affect corporate market orders a military director whose skills affect wardecs and a starbase manager whose skills affect fuelthat not being an example id thought of but it fits itd let you add more corp management skills without making ceo a black hole for six months of training time im not a huge fan of this proposal but if its to be implemented that would seem to be the way
agreed i always wondered why is it i have to do all this training just to allow  to take place in my corp when i can just as easily delegate said tasksskills to people who are going to do them anyway
if you spend your lp you are always left with a tiny bit of lp all the time i still have 667 lp with transtellar shipping from like 2 years agothis has to be somewhere in some database taking up some spacehow about an option of simply giving up and dropping lp or perhaps some minimal way of converting lp to isk for like 100isklp ratio or something just to completely rid yourself of that corps remaining lp that way it doesnt take up anymore space needlesslyeven if its 1kb for me thats 250megs of space for the rest of eve
id prefer the option of lp trading myself make lp a contractable item make a market for the stuff but if theres technical difficulties yeah a 100 isk per lp offer would be good too its just an annoyance at present
not a bad idea if love to get rid of those spare 1020 lps that i have at some corp ive not used for over 2 years in the grand scheme of things 250mb is a drop in the ocean compared to other things market transactions etc
when i read the topic i reacted with fantastic idea player corporations able to distribute lps to corp members and set up what they are redeemable for in a simply controlled list omg that is such an awesome idea i cant belive you thought of it oh thats right i thought of it man i am a genius really i amseriously ceo i really need those minerals nowcorp member yes sir i obey gets minsceo excellent work here have 2000 lp
taking up space somewhere in a databasedo you even know or understand how a database functionswait dont answer that you have no bloody idea half the time with over 90 of your ideas as it isbut as luck would have it even if your logic is totaly far out in left field beyond the fence and miles furthermore it is still a valid ideacant believe im saying thiscringessupportedow that hurt i think i need a medic medic
invention
this idea have my full support
i guess no one reads the news particularly about tech 3 comingno supportop is blind and shortsightedyou cant scrap something without allowing ccp to make changes to come
i came back to eve after a long brake to see what this fw stuff is like so far its been go out find someone to shoot but also find that lag monster as well i hear of battles with 10x the numbers we see and they are lag less but they plan those battles and get a server lined up ive also have herd of when fw first came out there where fleets of 100 going out and beating each other senseless with no lag now why cant we go back to that the less lag part im all for the fighting 
anything that helps reduce the lag that faction war players currently deal with would be a blessing last nights lag was epic it was laughable really to me because i just spent last weekend in the south where there was less lag with 1000 people in local than there was in this 60 ship fw fight last night ugh help
you can also tie in the ability for 00 outposts and conquered stations whose standing with this new faction can make it possible for those agents to move to your stationright now interbus live in stations that arent their own no reason why an eom agent or whatever could be moved into your outpostthe level and quality of the agent depends on corps standings who control the outpost furthermore i dont see why they couldnt do the same thing for interbus
work arounds already existi have 646 standings to gallente federation at the same time i have 65 standings to guristas piratesi have not run missions for guristas for over a year now but i have run missions for sisters of eve and fed navy for a whileeach faction assigns missions to fight certain pirate factions but not othersfor instance caldari assigns missions against predominately guristas bloods angels and sanshasbut almost never serpentis with the exception of the serpentis side in worlds collide gallente assigns missions against serpentis angels occasionally sanshas very rarely bloods and never guristas exception is half of worlds collidedone correctly there should be at least one pirate faction that does not have irreversably bad standings against you that said there probably should be an equivalent of a data center or some mechanic to repair more than 5 standings
low sec concord faction navymy idea above has this is mindyou see if you join fail warfare or are simply highly negative to the faction and you go to their space 05 systems are quite tankable 07 systems become hard to tank04 would spawn a concord spawn different then a 01obviously my idea extends all the way to 10 systems to replace the faction navies in cases where 10 pirates enter high secnot to mention even in 04 systems gatecamps would have the ability to destroy the concord spawns or lock them up so they dont even spawn on the gate
i generally dont camp gates rather i like to hunt for my targets however a fair number of my engagements occur at gateshowever i am going to play devils advocate for sec what you are proposing would actually ecourage bigger and more organized gate camps with more remote repping and sensor boostingeither that or organized gangs would have cloaked alts sitting 12 jumps up and down the route watching for traffic while the gang sits at a safespot withing a few thousand km off the gateeither way you suggesting things that does not do much to change the end result while hurting small gang and solo pvp on gates
what a superb tool to make low sec even more devastating and hostilelets say im a pirate i know theres some juicy targets in system i anchor one of those at all gates except 1 gatecamp the one while watching the others pwnedmining boost in low sec wont happen the minerals are quite plentiful now quite nice the problem is that the belts have absolutely 0 security meaning anyone and their grandma can come kill youwant to fix mining in low sec create actual security ive proposed a concord faction spawn similiar to the faction navy spawns nowbounty rats wont change or why goto 00 if you boost that you will deflate the economy epically my idea for that was low sec officer spawns 01 sec system have a remote of remote chance to get minor officers who drop medium officer modules and the inbetween officer mods for example medium nos officer currently we have some deadspace mods not much beyond tech 2 officer can be even moreso longer rangedtheres also no officer cap flux coils we can make those and have those come from low sec with appropriate balancing there would be quite a good incentive to go out to low sec to ratthose 2 ideas in of themselves would incentivise low sec to great degrees enough to generate quite a bit of ratting and potential for mining low sec would be fixed
generally im in favor of things that boost piracy and pvp but this one is a little bit overpowered not to mention it removes one of the key fundamental difference between low sec and 00 no there are better ways to improve low sec this is definitely not it
itt people who know what theyre doing people who dont and people who like to complain about something that isnt really a problem anyway
so i can understand a players impression that the csm has no effect from my personal experience i can tell you that impression would be very wrong that effect however canot be seen on a features in 15 minutes or the next ones free basis so lets talk about how the csm makes a difference and what the pilots of eve should consider when thinking about the value of the csm1 oversight the recent pos exploit is a perfect example of the value of the csm ccp gave the csm extremely detailed insight into the exploit and their actions after its discovery the csm has given large amounts of time with the ccp employees that analyzed and fixed the code as well as those that investigated the effect of the exploit the csm has not made any further disclosures as the information was given under nda and ccp has promised to release what the csm learned by the end of the month once that has happened the csm has been told we are free to discuss what we learnedthe bottom line is that the players have a huge benefit in having a a player run council that can verify that ccp is acting an appropriate manner when things like exploits occur2 feature feedback the recent meeting in iceland convinced me that the csm can have major influences on the things we all get to enjoy in eve everyone should understand that the csm feedback will take time to see in game eve is a huge piece of software and introducing changes is a complicated process so the realities of the software development lifecycle mean that new things will take time to make their way into the verse also remember the changes in code are not the only factors that come into play in determining when something gets out to the game these includerelated developments  features are usually grouped into related chuncks so for example a change in 00 sov mechanics is likely going to be done when all the related changes are readygame balance  some features have impact on game balance calculating effects and working on related changes to maintain balance is complicated and time consumingstoryline  eve has a rich storyline and some features are best grouped with important developments in the storylinelaws of physicssystem architecture  making eve work well is a huge challenge in terms of network infrastructure and hardware realities some ideas have impacts on performance and have to wait for fundemental changes in system architecture as ccp evolves the server architecture and discoveres new ways for optimization certain features become practicalfeature thunderdome  many ideas enter only one idea leaves  often there are large numbers of competing suggestions to address a single experience teams have to take time to review the alternatives sufficiently to understand the best choice that means sometimes the research and planning time can expand dramatically as the best alternatives are researched to determine which one finally makes it into eve3 real politics in a mmorpg  the csm is a unique experiement in virtual politics at the moment there really isnt much to point at about the csm to demonstrate this but i believe this will become an interesting part of the csm elections are going to become much more visible in the eve universe and i think we can expect the emergence of real political parties in eve in the future i know some folks would find this totally uninteresting but everyone should realize that this adds a game element that the players themselves can affect in a very real way4 external visibility  because of the csm eve has gained the attention of many outside organizations this is because the csm is a unique idea this attention grows the eve universe as more people become aware of eve and give it a try free advertisingmore to follow
the only unique aspect of the csm is that for the first time a business implemented a playerbased consultative commission in a mmorpg with great fanfare and that some customers are falling for thisvirtual democracy has existed since centuries under various shapes according to location culture and epoch going as far back as experiments in ancient greece and beyond every flavor of representative democracy naturally bears the seeds of hidden interests while the least manipulable form of democracy is based on direct democracy given that voters have the right both to oppose their leadership and to launch their own referendumswhy do you think that only a few nations  entities are functioning under direct democracy  anyone who doesnt understand can go back taking basic political science classesfact of the matter is that implementing a representative consultative body in a population where all members are de facto wired is the antithesis of democracy when all you need is an ingame consultative poll at logon on the issues at hand no useless discussions no hidden interests all numbers immediately at disposal after a poll is closedbut as i said i suspect that investing one day of a programmers time to come with a robust and simple poll solution able to hand out the most precise results  statistics isnt the first priority here because even the best polling system will not achieve 1 of the impact of the csm as it has been designed by ccpthe goal of decent polling systems is to synthesize as accurately as possible the opinions of a set of individuals and as such stands at the opposite of marketingdriven operations  pr stunts
you gravely underestimate the uproar when most polls seemingly would be ignored in a system like yours just because out of 250k subscribers a tiny minoroty actually can grasp game design and even fewer have facts or a good view of matters at handgreat way to turn eve into an unplayable version of hello kitty
yes please all of themespecialy a rogue drone dominix i love the infested dominix modelanyway my dream is a sentry drone bonused ship also the drone bays on drone ships could be enahnced so that each has at least 3xbandwidth capacity 
signed give us our missiles back
if we are going to have tracking problems similar to that of guns i think a bit more of a dmg boost is in order right now missiles are subpar in almost every way to laser and hybrid weapon systems in each comparitive class shooting at the same size ship
strongly supportedmost of the other interfaces in eve especially those related to fleetpvp have significant buffs over the years si should have similar improvements toomaybe on a basic level it should take the form similar to weapon grouping group a number of max run bpcs together and allow them to be loaded into a mobile lab after all bpcs for invention mostly have the same attributes anyway for all you know it may reduce server load
i support batch jobs with invention making multiple small bpcs building them out is always a pitasome love to the manufacturing modules on a pos would be good too
they are harvesting us for idea on how to improvethey made it a sticky in features and ideas but it went nowhere it seems no dev has even went back to the thread in ages well 4 months more like it but still
yus
save sb
i do i also know a bit about game design reality does not always equal fun for instance who cares if the spaceships in star wars make noises it makes up for a fun and cool experience so keep the c4 safely tucked in the wardrobe and think of what would be fun in eve instead
there are definite ways to verify 100  that people are using macros to mine sadly ccp doesnt care about that
what i think of macro minersfree marketmake macro spots so they go there and dont bother anyonelet them make their living having funplus if u havent think about it some chinese children or from other countries can have a very safe work environment farming gold instead of going to work at factories where they can get killed abused or maimedi support the macro minerslet the macro miners work
im in favor of such a mechanismnot exactly like this but similar only if it can be implemented without too much of a hazzle it is not worth as much time investment on part of the devs as the more important features many many many of them yet if it should happen to be included as a byproduct or as something the devs have thought of for some time anyway id be happy about the additional option
this is a really good idea
something needs to be done
supported its crazy that a ship set up specifically to lock fast and tackle struggles to achieve a lock against a ship of a larger class than itself before the target can get into warpthis isnt the point that a cruiser should be able to lock a cruiser before it can warp offthis is the fact that a properly set up frigate cant lock the same cruiser before it can warp off
supported
skills take time nothing elseif you want to invest money into skill training buy 5 implants if you already got 5 implants you have much more money than me and dont deserve my compassion short hell no
this suggestion is so wrong for so many reasons it is so wrongnot supported
no no no no
ah ha ha ha ha ha no
nej none het noany rich enough will get a large amount of sps without waiting as we waitedi will not play in eve with la2style character progress
i see this problem too and i even think it extends to a few more thingsthe range in which missions are given out its no problem in high sec as it is just a time sink to do a few jumps for the mission location but in low sec it is one of he real killers in mission profit gates are easily campable and such getting a mission 2 jumps away can inevitable lock you out of it because getting past a gatecamp is too troublesome just for a mission in most casesof course it is possible to work with it its higher risk for higher reward anyway and of course it is no must that a gate is camped but as missioning agents get known the gates around low sec agents woul surey be camped a lot in my opinion that is one reason that keeps a lot of pve players out of lowsec but thats a different topici like the hitorysolution an agent is in an ingame sense a living person why would he bother to offer you missions over and over again that you did never or rarely do and why if not to annoy you would he give you a mission where you fight your friends why would he think youd ruin your relationships just for a little moneyanother solution might be to give a player the possibility to chose a missions say the agent has 35 possible missions he can give you at once you complete one of them and it gets replaced the other 4 remain the same to reduce exploitment it is possible that all 5 missions come up bad anyway but the chances are reducedperhaps the mission choices are replaced every 4 hours or the agent has a global set of missions he can give out that replenishes every 4 hours too as he wants to have his missions completed anyway so not doing faction mission at all will just increase their chance of popping up until the 4 hours are over etc pp
i am quite split on this issue id support only the part where an agent should not give you missions which you dont have skills forthe 4 hour timers are a pita but they simply prevent people from chaining specific missions and are a necessary evil 
missions in general need an overhaul but the complaints in the op are just contrivedso then get them its good that one shipfitting isnt enough for all mining missions maybe kill missions can be made this way in the future yesthey dont take 2 hours to complete i dont believe even if they do do part of it until dt then finish it afteri actually partially agree with this at least with mining missionsthose missions are there for a reason no one elses fault but youre own that you insist on having huge standings with everyoneof your suggestions the ones to introduce new charisma based skills and the ones to revamp missions overall have merit
not necessarily the optionmy standing with gallente is 2 and it wont go any lower as long as i dont shoot them but i get ea and such all the timepossibility but moar skillsdoesnt fit tbhto which existi say that the certain faction missions which get declined constantly would become neutral ones relative to 4hr timer the problem is which ones exactly everyone is differenti say a more dynamic 10 minutes for level 1 20minutes for level 2 30mins for lvl 3 and 1hr for lvl 4swould be fine in my opinionthis is my main pointcurrently with the system you pseduorandomly get missions the next 10 missions are going to be what they are going to betheres no harm in giving us the next 10 missions we still decline 1 per every 4 hours but you can choose which ones you will dotherefore theres no downtime but you dont really get to cherry pick missions unless you have lots of downtimesure you can get 5 nice missions in those 10 but you will have 20 hours worth of downtime still to decline those others nothing changes
except taking penalty is far worse anyone who doesnt care about their standings for example already have gotten 99 with 2 factions will do this but declining and taking the penalty is just absurd otherwisethis behaviour only reinforces dodixie or motsu where you have multiple agents close together decline one get screwed move to the next agent do missions decline keep going you cant goto other places or else your next lvl 4 agent is too far offobviously another fix is to move level 4 agents around create 100 or more new lvl 4 agents around empire all high sec obviouslyabsurdyou have obviously never done a mission before downtime lol a few experienced players who know the exact average time it takes to do these missions actually get the opportunity to farm missions because of this the newbs on the otherhand are hurt so badlyabsurd its basically impossible to have high standings with all what we are trying to do is make it so we can do other things such as trading and not get shot at by faction navies
excellent idea player base going up we need more capacity to build supported
id rather have a skill that allows you to optimize slotsso say a new skill thats rank 12 or something is equivalent of a titan to industrialists that with it allows you to stack 2 jobs into the same slot to essentially build at the same timeobviously that idea needs to be balanced quite a bit probably at a cost of materials used theoretically though it could help free up slots and streamline production a bitin other words you get your new slots but at a cost if you use themfrankly as time goes by more people are going to be joining eve and those 5 day wait empire lines might become 25 days being able to get 5 jobs in at a time on a shorter line might be worth itincreasing the  of slots in your method however only pushes the factor of leading to longer lines
havent really searched around so there is a chance others have already requested thisthe map is probably the last part that gets attention when new stuff comes in weve had the same map layout and options and sadly issues since well almost since forever the map should really be improved its not a topic about i want it pink but about i want stuff that helpsavoidance listthis is a tricky option and usually people dont use it at least new people you your autopilot can avoid different system if you already have them on your list this is bullcrap because if i want to avoid amarr systems since i have low standings i  1  make the route and waste minutes fine tuning the list2  fly a noob ship when possibleits not a whine omg i lost me ship wtf haxored its a nice way of helping people plan effectively yes i know i can color the stars by sov but thats just wasting time since you have to manually edit routeadd systems to avoidance listbottom line  add more avoidance filters avoid systems with x deaths x players etcmultiple filterswhen planing a route or looking for a certain type of system i have the option to view different info ships in the last day traffic kills etc this is nice but as with every thing about eve something has to sucks and that is the lack of multiple filters i can only use one at a time i cant see the security rating  people poddedsov for example and this really sucks because it forces me to lose time and waste click region big solar mapyes i know i can see the map of the region by pressing f11 but i want to have full screen and be able to use the filters and do other stuff its not that hard to implement this since its already in the minimap dockablestackablemovable mapdont like to keep the map open if i need it first because i need to see whats going on in the game and second because ccp hasnt fixed the probe bubbletactical overlay problem yet although its so old it might even date to prebeta i want a map i can minimize or dockstack so i can see it and use it fast yes im crazy about my filtersmap route exportsavesharewould be nice to be able to save a route just like you do with places when you bookmark them it would also be nice to be able to share routes with corp mates just like you do with other stuff right click linking system bms solarsystem maptheres not much to change here since it doesnt offer that much info but there is one thing that bugs me its not really a problem but its annoying to have all the icons one on top of another an option to show only one or more types of bodies would be nice theres is an option to showremove info but theres none to remove the icon itself like removing the icons for planetsmy 2 isksedit  grammarsmall tweaks

i agree entirely i was wondering what was wrong with the map and you have hit the nail on the head
signedi really like the ideea of having avoidance filters like avoid all systems that had more then x shipdeaths in the last hour avoid systems sovreiged by x avoid systems that have had more then x jumps
i suppose what i should of said is that if you werent in combat then it might of been harder to detect any issues i have a question though do the blades have to be organised by locality i know it makes sense to have them organised like that but if thats the case then maybe fw is suffering because there are some highly populated neighbouring systems as oppose to 00 where next door may well be empty if the systems on the blades were balanced out a bit ie by average traffic as opposed to geography then it might reduce some problems
i really should have said node and not blade im not sure what the common practice is but i know several examples where surrounding systems got locked down due to a large fleet battle large in this sense is 300 pilots pre stackles io and eve64 where lots of reinforcements where held of from the battlefield next door unable to get within one or two systems it is quite possible that nodes need to have adjacent systems in them it seems to have been the way it worked previously afaiki think ive heard somewhere that they used to keep two nodes per blade in the server but dont take my word for itbut the fact remains that i have had a lag free experience in fw while people at the same time and place complain about lag im not saying that there could not or should not be any improvement but it certainly isnt as bad as many make it sound like the day i can no longer manually navigate my interceptor in 100 engagements is the day ill give my thumbs up in this thread
everytime i clone jump i have to log out and back in for the jump to work this has only been an issue since the last patch its just a pain
file a bug report about it
i just hit esc and then close window and that helps me
supported
i support this as i would like to give the few players who might really get a kick out of ferrying stuff around and selling it a chance to break up the market hubsedit that is if it wouldnt create undue lag but market servers should be easily separated from the servers used for navigation and combat in space
i would suspect any lag would be possible to solve just like they eventually managed to solve lag on combat i would also say that a delay on entry of a new order would be considered a feature imhoactually it would be extremely nice if the whole thing was simply solved by adding a whole new set of non instant orders to the market just like when non daytraders in rl order products from their bankers these then get stacked and an appropriate price is calculated the result would be a stacked average price a sort of order package where the volumes and prices would consist of maybe a mix of orders from the playersjust mentioning this because if lag would be a problem a compromising solution that also could add some new playability feature would not be half bad
if i destroyed a ship and killed a pod based on my numbers i would have a bounty of 350k iskthat is equal to ratting a couple cruisers if i did 10x the crimes and got a bounty of 35 million iskone triple bs spawn wouldpretty much wipe iti would just have to make sure that i didnt get podded in the meantimeso despite your concerns i believe that the rewards do indeed make up for any risk one just has to be careful and have done proper prior planning i suppose

that is very old and says only that they had 33m liabilities at the end of 2007 while the income in 2007 amounted to 37mits not a valid source for your claims therefore
they didnt have a huge influx in income just a steady growth the vast majority of income comes from eve subscribers and while the number has risen its not radically increased since 2007they got new hardware each year sometimes more than once a year they spent their fair share there and still arethey hired more people than they let go salaries and other development costs could only go up toothey were already on slim margins in 2007 barely 8 net profit out of all income compared to over 34 the year before and those numbers were not likely to get much better in 2008what other conclusions can you possibly draw than something similar to my previous ones

here is my iteron 5 carrying a nemesis thats assembled and named papermachethe method too which you go about doing it is obvious enough even though it is fairly difficult in a roundabout way alsoassembled ship in cargo
this will definitely allow people to freely move to new areas of operations otherwise you have to manually fly every ship and there is no need for thisalso you could purchase a fitted ship from contracts and then set up a courier contract and have your hot out of the oven  fully fitted new ship delivered straight to your door
you cannot assignassist logistic or ecm drones thus you will need both a lock sin has atrocious scan res and pull in your dps drones in order to use repping drones and heaven help you if you dropped sentries and moved an inch you would either have to abandon them or fly around manually getting within 1500 scoop range which by then your buddy will be deadthe truth is theyre all gank ships the widow is only useless if you make it useless prior to qr the widow had the highest gank while simultaneously having the highest tank 1150 dps 110k ehp and it was clearly the best blackops followed by the redeemer then sinpanther the widow lost alot with the missile formula change it very much relies on multiple target painters ie gang mates fitting them to even approach its eft dps numbers and the redeemer easily outclasses it obviously none of those fits include ecm ofc
drakeherschellthanks for the responses i like your ideas herschell especially the use of director slots to save the ceo training all the skills that fits in with rl corp structures why have a dog and bark yourself jason  who wouldnt want to run a pos cheaper with sov 1 you get a 20 saving with sov 4 its 30 mining ice isnt that profitable in high sec at 354 mil per man hour so the saving from my point of view would be minimal eg 1 hour a month 12 cycles for a med towerthe savings become exponential as the number of towers increases im sure some alliance logistics teams would love to have an extra 10 saving thus making a sov 4  40 savingas it stands you have fuel conservation skills for caps so why not have one for the pos

simple solution that can be implemented with any of the future patchesadd the following items to each loyalty store1 lp  100 isk2 lp  200 isk3 lp  300 isk5 lp  500 isk10 lp  1000 isk20 lp  2000 isk50 lp  5000 isk100 lp  10000 isk500 lp  50000 isk1000 lp  100000 isk5000 lp  500000 isk100 and multiples of 100 used as an example could be more could be lessdone if you like cut down some options to make it less my choice is based on common currency units for the sake of making it easy so that you dont have to take the 1 lp option n times to get rid of n lpi think addition of a set of standard items to all loyalty stores is not much work either it is not or the database is junk so any dev with any amount of time around half an hour could probably do it
cant see it being a problemset in all the lp stores 1lp gives you an item named 1lp which has a seeded buy order all over for 100isk item which also gives you the option of selling it yourself for more isklptrue thatapparently you arent a genius because you clearly have significant reading comprehension problemsyes and they do if you disbelieve my assertion prove it1lp to 1lp is enoughwhat they need to do is implement an easier way to get multiple transactions for lp so converting 100000 ammo to navy ammo isnt crazy then apply the same mechanic to the lp obviously
yeah nohere is a reasonable list of improvements to the ship class
just a friendly bump to bring it back into discussion
welcome back i tried but as you can see people just decided to accept my argument and went on their merry way

bump
i really dont understand your argument did you read it at all colonies are only for a sov 4 holding alliance to do that you have to put a lot of time and effort into the game it would be dumb if anyone could just establish a colony wherever they wanted even in high sec in that case the real world doesnt establish itself on the basis of evenly distributed resources if every country in the world had the same resources then it would definitely not be the war torn turmoil rich world in which we live eve should be the same way if colonies could be put up by joe blow where ever he wanted it would leave eve very much stale
signedits fun to play puzzles with modules on most ships but on a drone ship there are really none that are really fun

missiles are very gimped atmsupport
i support this petition
signedfor what did i spend monthes in skilling all that missile stuff when i now make the same damage like i did before i started skilling all that stuffno 90d gtcs missile nerf no ghosttraining whats next
you dont have a clue about explosive either a blast in a confined space is not amplified it is just directed to a smaller area thus achieveing more pressure per target area this is the whole magic behind armor piercing explosives they focus the blast energy into a tiny space which results in a great concentration of pressure and thus a larger effectanyway all missile type ships should cause damage after they are destroyed as missiles are autonomous devices once launched this would help to lessen the inherent dps penalty missiles get because they always hit

i agree that the anti frigate role is played by so many ships the sb doesnt bring anything unique to the table it used to in that it could insta pop the little buggers but eve has changed i think overall the change has been positive but the bomber needs to find its place i like the antibig ship role proposed because no other frigate can do that at range
a skillqueue would make me happy as i was definately ed as ccp removed ghosttraining
i would gladly respond to distress signals
as long as its free for all  supported
cool idea it would have to be lowsec only and low population only as it would be very easily abused homing in on distress signals could lead you straight into a trapresponding to a signal would be only for the daring not me
like most people here i will support it with the stipulation that anyone can warp to it however to make things interesting i would suggest that this feature be available only in low sec in high sec there are wars and criminal flagging and in 00 space there is no law and hence no such thing as piracy this option would be a very neat way to distinguish low sec from other parts of eve

this should be dealt with
i think this idea as any idea deserves to be thought outwondering why so many ppl were so berserk in their replies lolanyway if u have mor money or luck u can have better things and tats how things actually work in real life besides to pay for the skills then u either would have had to buy isks or do something to get those isks mine missions etc its not a bad idea and i might support it cause generally i favor more options and freedomso there should be option to spend time training buy the skill level or work on the skill to level it every ore u mine would give u more mining skill points

op replaces my most stupid eveo post bookmark 
some people really enjoy to run missions not to pvp mine or chase rats sitting in station and buying things can be extremely boring from time to time you should understand that not all players are like you some dont like to mine or pvppersonally i dont care about my negative standing with caldari and amarrbut there are those who care if they wish to prevent negative standing with those or others faction and are ready to receive reduced amounts of isk and lp why not allow them that this change will not harm anyone
i like how jason edwards disagrees with the entire thread but still checks the support box anyways and then posts with his alt like we wouldnt notice what a moronso are you also against gcc i dont see how you cannot play for four hours yet still able undock and do literally anything in the game still running missions is the most boring part of eve if you cannot run missions and you are freaking out you really should explore some more of what eve has to offer have you actually rejected a mission if you run level 4s you will not notice the standings drop from a rejected mission now and again i just got 0112 towards my faction for rejecting pot and kettle part2 oh noes 0112instead of being anal retentive on your standings just keep standings good enough so you can run missions going from 803 to 760 who gives a flying  if you can still run the missions a single level 4 will probably get you most of the way back to 803more missions should be versus factions because good lord that is what the eve story is all about dont you think the game should follow the story pick a side do missions for your favorite faction and deal with it like i have said before most other sided mmorpgs make you pick a side at start and you cannot switch you are given the freedom to pick a side or switch to keep standings if you want everything without any penalties or downsides at all then you should go play hello kitty online
as a dedicated mission runner i know the pain of waiting for a while until your 4hour timer ticks down however i dont see a problem with the mechanic as isive had to wait for a while as the timer ticked down numerous times missions are just one of the things you can do in this game when im waiting for my timer to finish i sell my rat droppings mine or any one of a number of other thingseve has many aspects to it and each has disadvantages and advantages i know missions need a good smack with a sledgehammer but i dont feel that this is one of the horrible things with them the devs have even stated that it was never intended to have positive standing with all 4 empire factions so the mechanic is workingsorry but i cannot support this thread
uh no it doesntwhich says one thing very clearly you dont know what the hell your talking abouttrust me i know were grinding status just to drop a pos
another expert2 on eve database that know it better than the devsread the sticky thread in the fi forum section before speaking it is linked some post above this
i bolded the important partnot worth the effort says who ccp who also say reworking the pos system is too much workwhy dont they go ahead and scrap the entire nonpvp elements of eve already if its too much work to redesign some of the worst errors they madeperhaps blueprints werent intended to be so important but they are now and it only will get worse with more playersproducerswith inventions bpcs are more important than before so youll often have a dozen of them floating aroundyes putting bpcs and pbos into separate containers does help a bit for a whilebut sooner or later something gets mixed up and then you sit for an hour clicking the damned blueprints to find out where the original hides
this is a good idea
better maps make me happy
democracy only works if you can vote both ways otherwise the extremist vote will always carry more weight because those who support something are more likely to voice their opinion anyway if those who dont cant even make that clear it just gets worse after all not all posts that are not supporters are objections more often it is just discussion on the topic even including those who have already supported the issue
an ongoing source of frustration for many players within the game is the current empire wardec mechanicwithout going into all the particular whines i would like to propose the following1 the wardec flags alliance  corp  individual players as enemies2 once decced each of the preceding elements is flagged both collectively and individually3 if an alliance has been decced and a corp within said alliance leaves said alliance during the period of hostilities the departing corp remains flagged for the entire duration of hostilities against its former alliance 4 if an alliance or a corp has been decced and an individual within said alliance or corp leaves said alliance or corp during the period of hostilities the departing individual remains flagged for the entire duration of hostilities against its former alliance or corp5 any group which takes in the retreating corp or individual then and based on providing aid and comfort is immediately flagged as a participant in the hostilities in the case where said players move to an npc corp they will simply remain individually flagged6 any neutral individuals that provide aid and comfort are themselves immediately flagged as participants in the hostilities this includes providing logistics materials or any service or support that could be considered as assisting in the war effortfor suppliers1 any trader that sells materials to a member of a warring party has themself given aid and comfort and are immediately flagged as a participant in the hostilities2 in order to make it possible for traders to not become unwillingly involved ccp should add a selectable option to sell orders denying a sale to any party currently under a declaration of war 3 certain traders may wish to supply both sides in such a case they will become flagged to both sides for the remainder of the hostilitiesthese changes should make the empire based war mechanic much more interestinglet me know of any outright problems issues or possible improvements
you where doing fine until you got to the suppliers bitnot supportedi get war deced and then i lose my ship i go buy a ship from shipmaker joe he gets flagged and then loses his freighter of billions of iskdoes that make sense to youstupid idea really stupid idea
ah but ship maker joe would have the option to not sell to youif he did chose to sell to you he would then of course face the consequences of his actionsi suppose that such a system could actually give empire wars some extra strategic possibilities locking down a corps means of supply and actually strangling them into submission would be a very real scenario
this would just create a cycle of war decd corps using alts to make purchases
the initial part of your argument ive been pushing for years persistant war flag per individual to stop the corpjumping carouselbut flagging a seller as hostile uhhhh no way in helllook at things as they are nowfrance sells war supplies to every middle eastern country attacking unnato forces in the region is france thus at war with their neighbors by defaultjoe shmoe goes down to the local hunters supply store and purchase a shotgun which he then takes and blows hank hunkstons head off is trader tom now under arrest because joe decided to use a legitmate legal purchase as a murder weaponnolets keep it that way ccp does not allow us to block individuals corps or alliances from seeing or purchasing our orders i dont suddenly want to find myself at war at no cost to anyone because some rube bought a single round of emp s

status markers are a good idea
cant honestly think of a reason why this isnt a good idea other than possible latency issues

we got enough crap on this board to put up with with you adding to it it just makes you an another moronthis is a place to discuss valid ideas to make eve better not talk about something to do with a sweater that has no valid context in this gamei have fun when i see constructive ideas discussed outnot when you spammers get your kicks for leaving filth and trash aroundgo post in crime and punishment they love that stuff over there
the interwebs is serious bidnessyou really need to relax man last time i check eve is a game and its about having fun since the council is now part of the game then that makes the assembly hall part of the metagaming content of eve and as a paying subscriber as long as my intent is to have fun and not cause disruptive activity then i am free to do as i pleaseyour view of how eve should be doesnt mesh with mine i dont want a sweater but fun isnt why your here is it cuz this is serious bidnessno one said you had to support it or even post you could have just let it fade away into the abyss sounds like your causing problems more than i am for failing to adhere to the simple rule of stfu

i wonder wats the point of restricting selling in real life ores ships or whateverlegal issuesppl spend already a bunch of their time playing eve so i think they should be free to be able to make real life money out of itand for those who use specialize macros or stuff to farm let them why notdo they mine all the roids available well make more roids or make infinite ore roids and let the market dictate prices of ore if ppl dont find it profitable to sell well they wont sell i guessi dont really understand the point of making it a violation to sell in real lifewhy not set a system like the game second life with an exchange and everything as far as i know in that game ppl spend hundred of thousands of real life dollars to buy a virtual game propertyso why not doing it herelet freedom rule

the reason people complain about pos wars so much is because things escalate and before you know it both sides are fueling hundreds of towers and are faced with the task of doing a lot of boring pos shooting if they want to keeptake sov it makes wars slow and indecisive and results in most combat being against inanimate structuresthe current system implemented by ccp is to only allow 5 towers to be anchored per alliance per system per day currently all this does is slow down the process my idea is that each additional sov claiming tower anchored in a system would lower the shield hp of every sov claiming tower  modules by 8 spamming 10 towers would result in each tower having a 50 shield hp penalty 15 towers would be a 69 penalty the nature of the penalty and the exact percentage dont have to be set in stone the important part is that there is a reason to stop the spamcounterspam at some point and start shooting each other
nope gonna tell you right now that health penalties are not gonna workdont know why but its lacking
this is stupid  it would put alliances claiming systems with many moons at a disadvantage because their towers have less hp
are you even familiar with how 00 works if you have 60 moons in a given station system youre probably only going to hold sov with 510 anyway because of fuel costs one modification would be that towers that have been anchored for several weeks are exempt from the penalty so preexisting towers you use to hold sov act like normal any spam from the invading force would be penalized as would your counter spam
psst its csm not cms
well victoria i totally agree a dueling mechanic doesnt need to be designed for 1 on 1 battles only i got a little wrapped up in the battles that i have witnessed and engaged in it wouldnt be the same when you flip cans you are opening the door to an unknown amount of people to fire at you freely with a dueling mechanic you could select exactly who you are inviting to a duel we would see people more players willing to engage in consensual combat if there was a system specifically designed for that purpose using the jetcan backdoor commonly ends up in players pulling their pants down bending over and inviting others to f them in the a ouch
no i have made many posts on why i do not like this mechanic perhaps you should read them or have you been too busy scrambling to find new assets after being booted from mmonce again the can aggro allows for people to dishonor a duel which makes the game overall better and more free than strict rules that cannot be broken the fact that you can steal cheat lie and break promises is the core of why eve is different from other mmorpgs if eve was about 1v1 ehonor battles we would have restrictions on who you could attack based on ship class or sp amount and other lame mechanics found in wow cloneswow isnt all bad they have some good mechanics but when you want a pvp restricting mechanic that you are blatantly copying from wow then i say gtfo if you want to duel without any risks play any other mmorpg on the marketi have gone over my arguments again and again if you refuse to do a simple courtesy as reading my ing posts then gtfo you are not having a discussion you are attempting to mock me quite unsuccessfully go back to the caldari militia and pretend you know anything about anything
exactly why a duelling mechanic would suck for eve
with everything else in eve you want to put this in placego figure1vs1 fights priority massive fleet battles priority normal 10100 pvp fightssorry guys lunch timemission running okay its time to make that a priority seriously who is ccp paying attention to these days
hes not trying to make eve about 1 vs 1 hes simply asking for an invite for sparringdueling it wouldnt remove can aggro it wouldnt change any of the mechanics save to add one extra method of fightingnowhere in his original post did he mention at all removing any of the current aggro mechanics so all your anger is kind of misdirected aggro between only two players via an invite interface shouldnt be that difficult to add into the game just give it a fee since from a roleplaying perspective youd be paying concord to stay out of it i dont really see any problem with it and seeing as there is an entire thread to make controlclick unselect ill support someone who wants a simple way to fight 1 on 1 without breaking changing or removing any of the current mechanicsif the op says otherwise i retract my support
its so obvious tat i really dont know why they dont have tat option
i think this is a viable idea that could be applied to low sec as it stands though there is not evough risk v reward in low sec as such it is too underpopulated to have people actually want to reside there minus the few antipie corps that patroll a mission hubwhy low sec well because it just seems like the right thing concord has no power there and it should belong to the player base willing to put in the time and effort some ideas that would probably ruin the eve economy doing so but motivates people into low secnew astroid types that when refined contain high end minerals they would not be abundant and refining them would not yield the same ammount of said minerals as the 00 equivilant but if it yields a decent profit per can say 20m then mining corps may be motivated to move to low sec and recruit a small gang of pvprs to protect themmove all lvl 4 missions to low sec but have them dispursed not all clustered around doing so would help populate the vastness of low sec also up the reward since there is now a greater risk also add in a seperate mission type geared twards fleets i know lvl 5s but they are fail i know its against carebear policiy to put yourself in danger but i dont believe you should be able to acumulate the sort of wealth that months of lvl 4 running empowers people to do with absoluteminus war decs safetyim sure other players can think of more motivators to go into low secsome issueswho finances the bounties will it be some npc mega corp or will the individual playercorpalliance have to have a slush fund for placing bountieswhat about the players corporation would they have a bounty placed on them also for harboring a criminal could one bad able reside in a nice fuzzy and warm corporation with a ceo that doesnt care about said actions because it does not affect him and his corpwhat if the agressor just flees across the galaxy easy make kill rights sellable to dedicated mercbounty hunters a whole new job opprotunity arrises in evewhy would i flip a can when i can just gank the miner easy he is now protected so a new form of griefing is formed blowing up cans to be a pain in the ass touching on the selling of kill rights though it really is not worth flying the galaxy to kill a player for a 5m bounty so the bounties would have to be increased say 100as for losing sp if you lose your pod thats rediculous plain and simple i cant think of a viable punishment at the moment but im sure someone can get creativejust a barebone idea it would be cool if some of you hard core players could elaborate on
to be quite blunt i totally agree and it isnt just in the forums it is also in the game people seem to think that eve is their soap box for social issues outside the game just because a persons primary launguage isnt english isnt a good reason to get stuck into them or because they dont fly the red white and blue or whatever from my point of view it shows them up as being too immature to be actually allowed to play the game with their parents permission which is probably quite shocking because some of them would be over 18
lol  define russiansrelax take deep breath then look at the 00 map most of the drone regions and a sizable portion of the southsouth east is controlled by explicitly russian alliances as in they either support russian as a second primary or exclusive language and recruit said speakers a large number of whom if you can believe it are of russian decent its called reality people stop hiding from it
i have reported posts that used terms like ragheads and towelheads before but not seen any action taken so yes i would support this
you mean shoot them if you havent been jammed by their 3 falcon alts i dont think falcons need nerfing by the way just people
make remote effects cause aggression give people a minute to kill the alts before they dock up
i have seen seperate merc corps using exactly that tactics on their wartargets if it supports its going to blink red if its going to blinik red its dead meat atleast if you can afford to hunt it down while in combat with your war targets
right here is all that needs to be changed because they are already flaged to you so you can shot at em the aggression counter is all that needs fixing
there is no point and just a loss of privacy for players and ccp
you wont see much in the logs maybe exept an error occured mssqlexe is not reacting anymore
eve is a game which is constantly updated with new shiny features for the playerbase to enjoy however inevitably some of these features come out of the box buggy and often not worth bothering with on the occasions when ccp promptly looks at the issues and fixes the bugs thats not a problemother times however the bugs are just left alone this seems to occur mostly with fixes that are not flashy  that is theyre small little quality of life things that annoy rather than cripple other times it is crippling but only hurts a limited segment of the playerbase such as the fw plex bugsleaving bugs alone because theyre uninteresting is simply frustrating and theres very little excuse for adding a bunch of new stuff every few months when little is done from a player perspective at least to improve the game elements that already existccp should rethink their attitude toward bug fixing it is just as important as development of new content and ccp should fix the stuff thats been broken for years before opening new cans of worms
i notice that the assembly hall is heavily congested also i notice that links to the councilors information pages is located under csm  resultsthis might be not so obvious for people to findi propose that in order to relieve congestion and rout discussion along organized threads that are in tune discussions between ccp and csm each councilor begins a thread that is made permanent which includes their core politics and platform agendas along with links to their homepages and other data relevant to their activitiesone thread for each councilor heavily moderated and edited and recreated when new issues are began and old old issues relegated to the archives the threads should be posted in order of the votes gained by each councilor i think that the amount of threads began here that are not relevant to the csm minutes is indicative of the lack of focus present in the assembly hall
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks
yeah right like these little forums arent already ignored by the vast majority of players not even speaking about the backyard csm stufffact of the matter is that under the current scheme ccp  csm have managed to sink from a 11 poll turnout down to 8 what represents a loss of over 25 voters in a single legislature if you are unable to draw conclusions be my guest youre welcome to continue on that course
exactly and again why are they ignored could it be that a vast majority of all posts are totally clueless and that those few who grasp game design seldom if ever have access to the grand picture this would not suddenly change just because you gave everybody a chance to vote
yeah you guys need to keep up to date on stuff next pach black ops can open covert cyno in jammed systems recon gang can take out cyno jammer remote rep black ops one of the best points of covert cyno is the covert transport ship run through sieged systems to restront your towers or even to retowerspam the system there are many uses for blackops now the only problem that i have is their cost i think that is the biggest hindrance of those ships people dont want to loose them because they cost so much if they dropped in price i think we would see them alot more
fixd no one cares fly a faster ship or use a tractor beam better yet maybe you should have your fights somewhere other than right outside a stationwhen i see people dueling outside a station i make it my personal mission to salvage and loot their wrecks just because it seems silly to me to fight in plain view of a lot of people who have no qualms about stealing your hard work

i havent fired a missile since they stopped doing aoe and they took heavys off of kestrelsthis still sucks thoughwhy dont we just make all the ships amarr and call it a day its only been overpowered forever and yet they do nothing if not boost their ships thanks ccp for making me train amarr to be able to reasonably compete with other players in both pvp and pve
supporti would be fine with the current damage reduction mechanics if all missiles did 33 more base dps than current so if you can web down and paint your target up you can devastate them but otherwise you will be fairing less than a turret user
check
seems like a startid agree with vuks points  some more things1 moon poses are completely industry based with light defenses and slow initial response times2 planet poses could be mini stations with only a ship hangar you can store a fited ship there in case defenses are needed with some reasonable limit on the hangar size only docking and hangar no other services3 once moon poses stop being relevant for sov make a pos overhaul as suggested in the dead horse thread 4 make npc rats spawn at industry poses and attack the installations if the pos kills the rat no bounty is payed and the wreck is also destroyed by the posi realy have no clue about other things my exposure to 00 was brief 
i would gladly drop a fake distress beacon in order to bait someone to my camp of friends in cloaked ravenssupported
please no distress signalim annoyed enough by people in the same system as me i dont need even more annoyanceif you are being attacked you can always fleet people in local and get them going to you
thats not even close to the same feature suggestedi love the idea of linking to location if this was any bookmark that could be linked like that and the distress was simply a quick emergency version of itif made right this might end up being the coolest feature ever added to eve imhoyou could then make bookmarks copy them send them by mail put them in cans use them as distress calls stack them in sets to fly formations or races in fields extremely many possibilities in this i dont just support it i demand it beg for itwish it
is good stuff will be fun for pirates and give antipirates another tool
this will end up being used most by spies in an alliance already in gang to give a warp in point on the fleet that theyre currently in yes it will give them away but it requires absolutely no roles or anything so is the easiest of spies to replacecaptain thunk
those spies can also drop fleet and join the enemy fleetgood idea btw everyone should be able to warp to it
having been in 00 for awhile now i do say that this would be fantasticfor pirates and ratters alike
firstly not supported in current incarnationonly way i would support something of this nature accelerated sp at a cost would be through temporary  attribute boosters which was something ccp considered long ago but decided not to implement
perhaps if you had a trainable implant say a hardwiring that could be programmed to give a specific skill each skill costing a varied isk lvlatm you have 1 3 5 hardwirings perhaps you could augment a chosen skill a bit like putting a script in that way you could buy a particular skill but it would be limited to one clone and one skill only the purpose is accelerated use of a shipmodules whatever but doesnt actually unbalance the current setupjust an idea
dont think this is a good idea you can buy characters with isk
no for the simple reasons1 one can not buy time2 one can buy isk for real life money
stupid question what is all this about short and sweet whats this conspiracy with the rat logs and how is it related to the pos bugexploiti told you it would be a stupid question
two totally separate incidents my input concerns viability of csm whom do they serve we the customer base or ccp one elected member asked me personally for my vote with a guarantee that he would not become a puppet of ccp the first time i see him in action he grabbed both ankles and spread the collective cheeks spewing company rhetoric  placations insults to intelligence in the event i was mistaken i injected my not so humble opinion hoping to find this body was indeed as advertised not just a gimic to date the csm are performing as predicted by protractors verbalizing the reality of the csm as justification for not becoming involved in the election processes
i wish i could provide another thumbs up just for the contents of this post the csm seem like stooges to me a token body puppets seemingly more concerned with the status and rubbing shouldersgetting drunk with ccp employees
alright i can see the problem there obviouslybut what about the logs and images that can be seen on the blog that contains your name rata i did a little digging there are images of wormholes etc what is this evidence of and how is this troubling its just a game mechanicrightyoull have to excuse my ignorance i dont frequent the forums

in your situation you probably want to run couriers so you can get storylines faster without long kill missions all you care about is faction standing so running a mission that shoots caldari who cares if you are planning setup a pos in minmatar space for your situation vs faction missions dont matter at all just keep running missions we are talking about standings just for mission running while you are talking about standings for a pos completely different topics
complete overhaulor at least repair the mechanics so we dont get the same mission twice in a rowmy proposalonce your standing with the corpagent reaches a limit you can chose a few options not against faction x not of type yetcbut  each option will cost you  the reward will be reduced accordinglyso for example lets say i have a corpstanding of 5 so i can chose not to run missions against the empiresi no longer get missions against those but my reward is reduced by 20less risk ruining standings  less rewardsimply outwaiting is a stupid mechanicoh btw  to the one suggesting one should simply learnbuy gas cloud harvesting ever looked at the prices even if mining missions payed five times as much i doubt it would be worth the effort
i support this being a game you shouldnt be forced to do things that simply isnt fun ie learning skills  i have no idea why but it seems a lot of eve players have a history of shunning fixes that will make the game less grindy and boring in a lot of aspects i like my games to be fun and dont feel the need to be punished for wanting it to be funedit one suggestion could be a generated list of here are the things weve got going on atm and you could pick a mission based on difficulty type and payout this would both make sense and we wouldnt have the somewhat awkward cancelfest simply a removal of the countdown would imply
no they are not wake up and smell the standingsstandings are standings are standingsthe pos requires faction standings just like any other particular areai dont know where you get off thinking they are not identical in any form or fashionthe only way to raise standings is to run missions which is exactly what this topic is about
forgetting that for ice you need a whole mining barge and seen the prices on gas cloud harvesters and did you know it takes 3 hours to mine a gas cloud with one harvesterseems youve never done them before as that doesnt work as the roid respawns and the mission wont complete until the roid is empty even if you have enough orethere are already mechanics in place that makes it impossible to have huge standings with everyone due to the fundamental mechanics behind standing changes that makes you lose more than you gain as you get higher upyes thats along the lines i envisioned it basing it on standing is a nice addition its like the real world where people that want to do dirty jobs get paid more than those that are picky
i was actually thinking about the same idea i would fully support an in game calendar
i raised this with zulupark at the last qa session but there was no further answer so ill bring it up herethe current tracking formula does not workfigure 1 represents in the simplest form using a megathron as the example target the problem with the current tracking formula which screws up closerange shipsfigure 2 represents how the tracking formula should work the target at half the range is twice the effective size and therefore should be easier to hitnow clearly we cant bin the complete formula and start over that is not what im proposing  ive already gone through three possible changes to the tracking equation that the game uses here to account for the size vs distance component that is missing either through modifying the 50 hit chance at very close ranges or through adding a signature radius multiplier at close rangesthis has been broken since castor but with 60 webs this is now causing huge issues for closerange ships ability to hit targets the proposed modifications would rectify that without scrapping the current tracking formularegardsgabriel karade
the one thing ive never understood is the tracking formula in certain conditions dosent make sensea 1400mm cannon 8 of them can hit a target rather hard at 80 clicksat 50 it starts hitting harderat 20 it cant hit worth crapyou could be at point blank range and still not hit crap and the target could be bigger than you area frigate makes sense maybe a cruiser maybe but if its obivous that you could be off by 5 to 10 degrees your still going to hit something but you dontany comments
i forgot to add my own thumbs upoops
anything that adds some realism to the game and fixes some of the issues at the same time is a beautiful thing
tried to get this through with that issue about blasters and other turret issues but it was voted outanyway supporting this a second time of course
adding slots to empire stations is a separate issue that needs to be looked at seriously with the influx of new playersat the very least perhaps a separate skill specialization for pos building researching that increased your slots per player should be looked at in a serious way by ccpthanks folks for mostly supporting the concept and the need so far

haha wtfso suddenly theres a huge number of traders who dont know about this option they undock to jita and 100 wartargets lock his freighteroh good idea great way to drive people away from the gameor lets say they switch over all trades and all trades automatically are set this waythe people like privateers who are at war constantly literally cant buy productsoh good idea great way to drive people away from the gamenot only that im a real pain in the iondrive i make my alt create a corp for 15 mil then for 100mil per year i can basically grief 1 corp in making it impossible for them to buy anything on the marketawesome
trade in eve is anonymous even contracts while they may have a name on them are still effectively anonymous because nobody actually looks at the name or cares if they do your proposal to criminalize trade would utterly ruin the entire eve market  youd have traders getting shot for no reason warriors who cant buy anything and even if you did want to open yourself up to doing it youll probably get hit with wardecs from major alliances even if youre willing to supply a 10man this is a horribly stupid idea the rest of its decent although hardly novel but your supplier rules are crazy
as a privateer im obliged to support this idea however its uttely insane and even im feeling sorry for all the marketeers whod fall foul of thiscaptain thunk
ummm lets seecheckgbtwowcheckyoure gay rightilliterate 
ignorance of the law is no excuse in such a harsh universe especiallycorps should probably concern themselves with proper infrastructures that can withstand wardecsi suppose that there needs to be consideration of your alt corp exploit any ideasill think about it
thank you for your support
first part is excellent this everyone would have to reactivate their old hauler alts from the privateers days trading with someone at war shouldnt be the same as declaring war on them which is what you are proposing punishment does not fit the crime
you know i have thought about this and do see a substantial upside for traders willing to be warprofiteers traders that willingly sell to wardecced individuals should be able to get a premium for their products because many risk averse traders would decline to put themselves in harms wayi could even imagine that some traders will load up a huge supply of commonly needed materials and setup shop in a convenient system to the party they are supportingmaybe an entirely new and highly profitable profession risky as it may in fact be
two possibilities1 those who are wardecced just use an alt to buy stuff2 traders only use accounts which never undock to sell stuff to wardecced peopleit doesnt make sense and it doesnt workabout the first part i am against any changes in wardeccing mechanism which does help the wardeccer but doesnt solve the other problem that wardeccing is just pay to grief and getting riskfree pvp wars should be started for a reason other than getting easy targets
using an alt would make that alt a war target using a trial account alt would give you the additional issue of not being able to use contracts and therefore not being able to give the goods purchased by the trial account to its maini suppose you could blowup your trial accounts ship and loot the goods that survive your choice i supposeas to the traders once they were wardecced anyone that dealt with them would themselves become flagged you can imagine the rest
take pity on the fool gentlemen particularly the ones who dont know how to readthis will never get support and your last response is proof of that
question instation direct trade and contractswhat happens
i really dont have the slightest clue what you are trying to say or what your post is supposed to mean considering the fact that i specifically gave the traders an out in my proposaldid you miss it
flagged i would hope
oh yeah clicking a stupid little button that says dont sell to war decced corpstell me oh holier than thou just how many corps are currently wardecced right nowyes lets wardec everyone to stop traders from selling ships and suppliesreal smart smart like a damn brick
get beat up today at schoolagain
you still havnt answered my questionhow many wardecs are currently active in eve on a weekly basisstart using your head before you start flapping your gums
many i would imaginehow many of those wars are actually won in any meaningful way
0 and 223 so farthis would be a horrible mechanic it wouldnt help strangle your opponent it would allow them to get a multitude of free allies get war deced hop in a shuttle and start buying a few pieces of ammo here and there all of a sudden your enemy has a couple of dozen corps gunning for them
way back when the pirate faction ships nightmare bhaalgorn etc all had dual sensor strengths for the ship eg nightmare had both gravimetric and radar sensor types i believe these should be brought back for these ships to increase their viability in the pvp scene yes they are grossly expensive and difficult to obtain however people still use them to fight and this should be one of their edges for their specialty
supporting my topic
agreed for there cost they should be harder to jam up than anything else hell maybe even extend to navy ships as they are navy ships and the navy would build some extra backups in there 2 supported d
what effect would this have would you have to jam both of them independently or would it just use the better of the two against any individual jammer it changes the effect of this change a lot
it would mean that the best way to jamm faction ship is to use multispec because racial jammer would always use weakest stat to roll diceconsidering the rarity of faction ships in pvp im all for it
i dont fit jammers myself  do most falcon pilots include a multispec or two if so it wouldnt seem to make much difference if not maybe itd be a decent buff
tbh i dont quite recall how they effected the jamming system when they were still on the ships i would assume you would have to roll against both sensor strengths to actually perform a jam on a the ship
i think but could be wrong that faction ships had the duel types around the same time that ew was stacking based ie you needed 12 points of jam to counter the targets 12 strenthso it prob made no difference at the time
i know this will likely draw a few harsh comments i will however ask the csm to discuss if nothing else the overall balance of the underlying factors of an mmo gameto get players motivated and have activities in a game you need the 3 base factors coveredsociologyplayers are motivated by doing stuff with other players this one eve has mostly down and only a few roleplay and player content issues can be added to the issue there is however a small point when it comes to motivation and goals these are often linked to an amasing of wealth or power the two often go hand in handeconomyeve economy is the best in the business no doubt about it it stems from the mere fact that most of the economy is player controled back when most of us logged on the financially inclined were quick to notice the potential of a game with standing buy and sell orders this is basically what drives the whole economic engine in eve the rest is basically accesibility to the relevant spawning of materials or currency note currency is actually just another commodity its just an common universal abstract mediator of goods tradedoh well the main point i want to make is that the reasons things can seem weird in eve economically is based in the fact that entertainment value has been preset to only entail shooting things in short since the action is what most crave this is where the motivational pull is placed this is understandable but it will become more and more of a problem in regards to eve being a virtual reality in real life the values might be in inaccessible and remote areas special plants oil relics etc the problem is out there its actually worth next to nothing and the end products are extremely expensive if at all obtainable what i am saying is simply if the big money isnt in high sec empire space then the mechanics are wrong example the raw oil get shipped to safer refineries and from there distributed further and further into the energy demanding and high populated areas this is how profits are made at each and every leg of the journeywe need some sort of demand on 00 goods from empire one way would be to make high sec pos demand lower standing or be only character standing based this way much more activities would need the material support from unsecure spaceall npc facilities should become dynamically changed by supply and demand this would either force players to find a lot more income or move into less populated areas of unsecure spaceimho the unsecure space is way to unsecure and trigger happy this is because the combat profession has it way to easy they need no more motivation than to grief this is mainly due to the lack of need for the other professions to stay alive and afloat in unsecure space they basically have to easy incomes once they know how to shoot stuffi would suggest totally nerfing pve incomes in unsecure space this way the needs of activities out there would enforce a change in behaviour even wars out there would decrease because the resource loss had to be calculated betterecologythe ecology is a term taken from generic mmo games mostly based in fantasy settings the thought is there must be a balance and control on how many dragons are in a world and how much food can actually be grown on a field in eve this factor somewhat goes back to economy since resources arent actually scarce only the work load demanded to get at iti know this is just a game and its actually the best one around i just wish people would try to think about all the stuff we are missing when the motivational tools are balanced wrongyou dont get rich in unsecure space you have fun or build up a powerbase opposed to empireyou dont have fun in empire you work to get status and influence
i am not sure exactly what point you are trying to express i make good isk and have lots of fun in 00 space i cant support nerfing 00 incomes and i fail to see how this would fix the problem i thnk youre trying to describe
the problem is motivation aside from the fun of risk and destructionincome in 00 should only be in assets the stuff should be demanded in high sec the stuff build should actually be build in highsec there is an inherent lack of logic that expensive ships and gear is build in 00  i could in part agree that to increase gameplay it should be in lower sec because npc rules the higher sec areasto many things are just a bit scewed and without really realizing the consequences
ok i understand what youre saying now and i dont agree you seem to be speaking of a personal lack of motivations and making assumptions that they apply to everyone i dont share your concerns and i dont find a lack of motivation and i find quite a bit of motivation beyond making things explode
ive read your post 5 times now and i still cant figure out what it is your wantingits like your saying you dont have any fun in high sec and your not making any money in 00is this one of those you want your cake and eat it to situations
uh aside from your emo diatribe about what you dont like about 00 or highsec do you have any actual concrete ideas or suggestionsno ok im going back to assembly hall where we spend all of our frakking time discussing the overall balance of the game
this thread is a bad thread
basically i am trying to point out some of the missing focus on features and metagamewe need motivational tools this is not possible with current economic balance we have no real incentive to have an overall salary system we have no working stocks and ownership system we have no price dynamics in npc facilities we have no motivation to change behaviour for something more immersivethere are to many related issues but it boils down to the underlying balance and placing of features adding that to the static prices it makes motivation a corps should get their gross income from work in empires that is directly related to what people are doing in 00 oil makes the world go around basically raw materials vs refined products a model closer to rl is what i am basically asking forand please hold the its a game comments because then go play something simpler eve is a virtual world in order for a virtual world to work it needs to have two main things immersion and incentives these two are not working optimally in eve as it is eve is in the transitional phase between dungeon and dragons and storyteller system the first is a step up from a boardgame and the latter is a roleplaying virtual life simulation you really dont want endless spawns of 4 swords of instant monster slaying you want a real experience that entails things that is part of real life you want to use the game to try things that would not be possible in your real life and thats not just slaying monsters its taking on charachter traits you dont use yourself everyday its having a life less ordinaryif this isnt what eve is about its just another grind machine like wow oh at least wow is massively more populated
do you have any specific suggestions or ideas the only actionable suggestion i saw in your posts was nerf pve incommes in unsecure space  cant support that one
i have several things in mind and i honestly hope and believe most of them will in some way become part of evenpc corps facilities needs to be supply and demand priced these has to be updated at least once a weekmarket orders should be increased skill wise to avoid all the problems stemming from this limitation00 should have an easier time ammasing raw materials but refinement should be extremely limited i know it is allready to some extend but the impact of this is not significant due to oppertunity cost blidnessthe problem w oppertunity cost blindness is basically that there arent enough traders and their order books are to small they cant invest long termwhen you cant invest long term you cant issue real ipo stocks because you have to use a lot of time assesing your netvalue and net profit this has been partially solved by the emms tool nowif you have passive assets to generate your profit you have steady income and can suport both a salary system and a weekly dividend paymentalso npc and player corps should have the tax working as a feature and game mechanic this income should be put aside in seperate wallet and decided by vote how much to pay out in dividends and how much to reinvest this data should be available to the public at least for corps that want to trade on the open scc exchangestocks should be traded on the sccexchange investing and pricing npc corps would be based on activities of these corps and their losses the easiest way was to use the tax and thus the noobs indirectly decide the best income corpsnpc corps should have a gm assigned to allow switching of npc corps and upon this granting a minor salary according to skills this in effect would be a weekly expenditure and get calculated from the dividendsall in all we could really use a look at novel and simple features that could increase the game immersion the above is just some options and only the beginningi havent touched upon fuels stations held by npcsnpc stations production of tradegoods and their interdependenciesetc
i see what your saying but i dont think you get that eve isnt intended to be workits seriously hard enough to determine the salary of employees in the real world so how do you expect people to do it online you cant be a lefty and base it on skill points alone because they could be a noob that bought their character or they could be a complete jerkoff who does nothing constructive and hacks everyone off you cant be a righty and base it on what you know because you could be missing the most valuable members of your corp simply because your a brit and they are aussiesi dont think eve is going to ever be intended to be a virtual world in that sense second life has virtually no boundries to advancement but eve most certainly does user created content is virtually nonexistant because in eve the restrictions and setting create a committed drive by like minded people to achieve an optimal operating efficiency that isnt present in the real world and it isnt present in second lifethe drive for efficiency is motivated by competition in earnings in both worlds but the limiting factor of only having 8 or so income options in eve doesnt allow much wiggle room compared to a virtual world where users create their own content and income streamseve cant exist as a virtual world and still maintain any semblance of equality tribes was a perfect example of how user content can adversely effect the user base the renegade servers became virtually closed to outsiders and new player competing on the servers stood no chance of competing or integrating into a clan that could provide them with renegade contentyou cant have an eve that makes sense and the aspects you propose the oversight necessary would make the manhattan project seem small
on salary it should be based only on skillpoints in relation to npc corps player corps naturally would assess a lot more and thus you have the competition and the motivation to leave npc corpeve is to some extend meant to be a virtual life at least thats what i heard from the ip presentation at the fanfest sure it will never be like real life and it should not be but is should be governed by similar motivational tools one of these being livelyhood income and social adaption compatibilityi am sure there are more income options in eve than you think and this will only increase in player content player control and metagame balancing gets an overhaulalmost all your real life skills can somehow be applied in eve eventually heck even farming once we get some sort of station production on npc corps build those cows farmboyif you want equality and fairness games arent the way to go there is always someone better and this should be reflected equality and fairness is something to wish for but not get or force upon people forced solidarity isnt really solidarity at all

thumbs down but since im upside down it turns out to be upvery good idea i find that when i return from afk people have still talked to me this would solve that
and maybe have the option for the client to manage it ie detects screensaver or idle timer
currently if you goto mapmy informationyou have a number of options that are nice for example my available agentsit shows you a nice map of available agents to youhow about an optionmy available jumpclones however not existing jumpclones but stations that could have a jumpclone installed to if you go there calculating even for corp standings and etc
not a bad idea itd probably be better through the jump clone menu than as a map layerespecially since that way you can go straight to the station but yeah it can work might be laggy but worth looking into also im getting scared this is like five consecutive jason edwards threads ive supported im hoping its because youve gotten bored of trolling not because youve gotten good at it but still
why not a list of jumpclones you have installed i could have used that several times nowanyway more information is good
when i start seeing you support his ideas i get scaredme reluctantly signsme quickly checks to see if hell froze over or notno offense jason but your track record for ideas is not exactly stellarkeep up the good work regardless
because the list of jumpclones you have installed is in ur charsheet
dear csmi think we are a few pen and paper players in evei would like to point out that there is an inherent flaw in philosophy in the game and development of itthe problem is what is the pride of eve the single shard worldwhen creating content or events you can not be fair and you can not let things be repeatetif you created a campaign like scenario and you want it to be remebered and motivate players to be more proactive you have to be unfairyou have to drop an early t2 print in the hands of someone to give them an advantage you have to be willing to risk messing up the powerbalancealso there is a solution to making this seem more fair make all content based on unique and highly complex and connected naturesalso be willing to shift things using things like npc corp standings and economy dont nerf thing but change them deliberatlya lot of gaming experience can be created using these rather simple content seed methodsjust my 2 iskits just kind of funny that the t2 mistake is historic while a lot of aurora work never even gets related inside corps post facto
are you actually proposing something or are you just playing your small fiddle
yes that ccp should not be to scared of being a bit unfair i would find it much more immersive with a new t20 incidence than some grind away solution catering to everyonefunny thing is that stuff has a way of finding its way into the right hands so be unfair make the events hard complex big or downright power distrubition meddlinggood gms arent sweet they are bad assoh and it would be cool with wandering jovians knowing they are wastly superior techwise it would be fun to see if players would observe or try to engage them their could be awesome but based on biological systems they decay over a few weeks of use this could make some interesting side effects
seriously drake youre the troll here and i would suggest you just stop now whilst the op is rather ridiculous in my opinion they do at least have the right to bring up this subject if it gets no support then itll just die away let that process take placecp as you so eloquently say is thataway
if you can name one valid reason for this thread to exist in this forum ill retract my reasonprovided this reason is for the benefit of eve online and how the game mechanics behaveyep thats what i thought
wtfthis post has nothing at all to do with eve online why in the world are you defending thislol
i rest my caseps and if any of you smart asses decide to bring up the fact eve is not mentioned you seriously need your head examined
then why in the world are you supporting the subject lol
then why in the world are you supporting the subject lolhell i didnt even support it and i posted it
apparently u didnt read my post very well or u dont know very much about other online gamessecond life is a hugely succesful game that trades their own virtual currency for real life onesits so succesful that government agencies actually buy online virtual properties there so ppl visit their online museums and stuff also banks and other commercial institutions buy property there one real estate lady managed to make 1 million real life dollars just selling dam virtual properties to pplso if tat game can b so hugely succesful so can evelet ppl buysell eve items in real life
rmt is already in this game you can buy ships characters implants etc with real money perfectly legally but ccp only has made it illegal to gain too much rl money with ingame farming
did you bother to use spell checking or are you just a kid banging away at the keyboardoh and this is eve online not second life
one of the main reasons for prohibiting rmt  liabilityif you assign a given value to ingame currency or thereby items they become a legislation nightmare in second life its alright as the game isnt really cruel like eve isif a player lost a titan to pvp he could sue the people who attacked him for destruction of private property likewise you would have to pay taxes on items in the game and you could list it as employment ad nauseumanother reason  intellectual propertysecond life is unique in that it allows people to have possessions of the items they create in game they do the coding for the items in the game language then that code becomes their copyrightin eve theres no coding if they gave you intellectual property rights on the items available in game they lose their rights to them it may seem like a control tactic but its well within their rights to do this and is probably a very wise decision given the type of game eve isif you have more dollars than sense and want to buy stuff in a game play second life or one of the other games that allow it if you want a game that requires some thought to play and master without giving the upper hand to those with more rl money play eve
there is sort of a way to buy things already by selling timecardsif you want things then sell timcards
i knew there was some legal issues behind tato well ill keep enjoying eve anyways
i agrea that smartbombs need a little loving but we must be careful not to kill off all small taclers and all drones while we are at it i allso think that micro2kmsmall3kmmed4km t2 smartbombs should have 1km extra range just like the large t2 smartbomb and the faction smartbombs should be tweaked accordingly btw has anyone actually ever used microsmall smartbombs as it isi have a small suggestion and i hope you guys like itnew shiptype tier2 destroyerdestroyer skill bonus 10 to smartbomb range 10 to smartbomb capacitor usepenalty 25 damage to nonracial smartbombsbonus 50 smartbomb rangeslots lowmedhigh  racial smartbombamarr526  empcaldari256  gravitongallente436  plasmaminmatar346  protonmaximum range for the destroyer with small t24km smartbombs would be 9km allso since the destroyer would never be able to fit a medium smartbomb it would be limited to less damage output than a regular tier1 detroyer but it would be a better tackler this is a ship that would be good in close combat but would be doomed in medlong range combat if range on microsmallmedium smartbombs isnt boosted then i think a 100 bonus to range would be needed for the shipi think this would actually benefit eve in many waysit would show that smartbombs are getting some lovingit would give the destroyer class a new tech1 ship that is long overdueit might be a counter to droneswarmsit might be a ship that would be useful to hunt down slow cloakersthe role of the ship would be twofold1 to assist in hunting down heavyslow cloakers2 to counter droneswarms3 chase off small tacklersdestroyer shiptype has historically been used in asw now in eve it could be acw anticloacker warfarethis ship would haveto be used carefully you dont want to kill friendly dronesshipssome additional thoughtsmight be cool to add a smartbomb that would maybe give small ammount of damage to all damage types and 50 range that could be useful to hunting down cloakersmake ecm burst modules a part of the smartbomb family or make the destroyer bonuses apply to them as well and then we suddenly have a destroyer that can be useful as a ew ship as well
have you tried catching a pod or frigate on a gate in lowsec its damn near impossible to catch a cruiser you have to have a ship small enough to have a high scan res but big enough to tank the gunsi guess the counter argument is in order is it right for pods frigates and cruisers to get away without any chance of being caught
theres always a chance in catching themits called interceptors
ive said for a long while its time smartbombs had their revision every other weapon system has i also like the idea of being able to use them in an indiscriminate mode its highly frustrating fighting in 00 and ending up just inside 5km of a gate thus unable to use the smartbomb
i heard somewere their changing the way poss work anyway summet like the ones that claim sovereignty are set up at planets and are only allowed to use guns and things like cyno jammerswhile the ones that dont claom it are set up on moons and they cant use guns but use things like moon miners
there goes the neighborhood
are you mad 
no  after all hulk is the top of the line exhumer same as covetor is the top of the line mining barge 
if you look at the statsit has 1 medium slotab vs mwd vs web vs scram whats the choice this seems pretty out in left field tbhshould have 2 mid slots in my opinionwhat say you
yes it shouldand while were at it the omen could use a little bit more powergrid and cpu as well
there is already a thread on this from last weekmy choice is aband also not to change the ship
ive been seeing a fair number of threads recently about ecm and its prompted me to do a bit of brainstorming one of the things ive noticed about ecm is that it leaves the targeted player with no recourse or action once jammed thats it the player can no longer do anything in the fight period which quite simply leads to a lot of frustrationthe primary goal of any ecm changes should be to allow the targeted player options to deal with being jammed without making the ecm or targeted player wholly uselesshere are my alternative suggestions on ecm mechanicsoverviewhud first and foremost the player has to know that he is being scrambled in a visual manner i suggest some kind of distortion effect as well as the normal jamming bar nothing too significant though it needs to be subtle and obvious at the same time enemies randomly appear blue friendlies randomly appear red and both randomly appear neutral or perhaps all ships become neutral speeddistanceangular velocityship typeetc are scrambled and output randomly so an enemy dominix might in reality be 5kms away but your overview says hes a typhoon 20kms away friendly and traveling away from you at 300ms with an angular velocity of 01211 the ship will still visually appear to be exactly where it is only the overview readouts are changed chat channels are disabled at random intervals the damage readout is scrambled making it impossible to know how much health you actually have left one minute your readout is saying youre at 70 hull and the next it says youre at 90 armor a small chance say 1 per level determined by the skill of the ecm pilot of a module on the targeted ship being randomly turned on or offoverheated etcecm modules turreted in order to hit a target with ecm the turrets need to be able to focus their jammers on it this form of ecm module is longrange include alternative ecm modules that have a shorter range than the turreted versions but utilize an area of effect say 30kms base like smartbombs they dont need to track their targets but they do need to be within area of effect range this closerange jamming effects all ships within the area of effect including neutrals but not including friendlies instead of just effecting the locked targets allow friendly ecm ships to counter this with their own closerange ecm modules overall ecm strength is compared whichever side has the strongest ecm within a given aoe is the side that wins outeccm modules targeting bonus against ecm ships that are disabling you reduce the effects of ecm so with an eccm module fitted you may still have problems with your overview but your damage readout will be finefleet jammed ships randomly show up blueneutralred to other players might be potentially exploitable for griefing jammed ships lose all fleet bonuses they might otherwise be receiving except direct stuff remote repairs etc
i just hope ambulation introduces a use for dancing girls and slaves
i half and half supportdont support thisi like the idea that a player should be able to visit a bar from across the eve cluster i do not agree that they should be a holoprojection that can walk around and interact with people or things as normal nevermind the mindboggling number of physical laws this would violatemy suggestionwhen connecting to a bar you are doing so through a terminaldisplay only either you show up on a screen or as a holoprojection on a table cue holostripper services no more no less viewpoints for you will be fixed or have a limited field of view since youre observing from a camera my biggest concern is that this will result in people aggregating in a handful of major bars instead of sticking with the bar at whatever station they happen to be inwere it up to me i would just leave it as ccps shown so far you can enter the bars in your station and thats it if you want to be in a bar in jita then youll have to fly over there to do so

lol thanks its not content management or wait a minute it sort of is
ya if you can overload a trader you have so many alts feeding it that you might as well train one of those alts to start doing the trading alsoi have 29 max trading and i have never hit my limit lol
im not an economist but if players didnt have a limitto their buysell orders couldnt a playercorpalliance start making single item buy orders at extreme lowball prices to artificially shift regional average calculations to manipulate the market
um no no change because currently you can do that with just 1 orderyou want to sell your vexors at 6mil but thatll look like its 20 above averageset 1 vexor at 100mil train your skills to make tax nearly nothing have an alt buy it  100mil average will then jump upwant to buy vexors at 4mil but thatll look like its 20 below averagefind a station in ur region that doesnt have any buy orders in range put up buy orders for 1 isk have alt sell them in that station drop goes the average
as jason points out manipulation is not something that is linked to the number of orders availableeven most normal daytrading is more than possible with a really low skill level and number of ordersthe only advantage really to the big order books is that you can invest long term and on an extreme number of items gamewise that would mean that everything would be tradable and most likely traded in regions as it is now even maxed out traders have to limit their traded items and if you also want to add pseudo automated features like moving prices then you have no chance of spreading out your businessthe advantages of many more orders in scc are many and not all is easy to predict atmi do however know that manipulation of averages would be easier to fixdonchian channels would be more usefull because many orders would mean many unique trades and thus a higher resolution of graph movementspseudo automation stacking orders of different volumes and prices would mean you could and would change your bid over time no matter when the orders filled in other words less time would be needed changing orders this would make order book changes less frequent and hopefully mean less updates with servers and thus less lag issuethe only problem would be to many orders showing at once there is a rather easy fix for this let the servers sort and stack these and maybe let skill level give access to viewing the composition of the stacks this would also add advantage to high skilled traders without leaving the lower skilled totally out of the loopthe number of stacks sorted into would be based on station quality and trade volume per day inside the stacks the orders would naturally sort by price and timeit would also be extremely nice if we could somehow have a tool for visualizing order ranges and price in a map to see the overlaps etcin my opinion we also should somehow get statistics on the names and corps of the traders post facto so we can see who has historically traded items at least the corps should be shown
the average price is the average price of trades not of orders go look at the buyorder prices of rare ships in unimportant regions  the top price for marauders is usually about 100 isk for example and theyre buying a thousand of them average is still several hundred million
if you are looking for a duel in new eden today you are pretty much waiving a flag to players that says gangbang me if you so wish sorry im not gonna put my pricey powerhouse ships on the line with that possibility we could duel in small ships and not be too pssed off if we get screwed over but thats not really all that appealing either if you wanna duel someone youre not going to bring some halfaUFFFDUFFFD ships to the fight i would have no qualms bringing out these ships to see how they fare against others if there wasnt a risk of rpe involved especially if there was a bet involved for the people against this argument i understand that they want the system to bet left open and have the risk factor involved but i strongly believe that this is preventing many people from having these battles all togetherwhy interfere with the quest for others to have these battles when you are free to catch anyone by surprise and take advantage of them in low sec isnt that part of the reason why we have these two main regions
you want risk free combatuse the test server ffs
did you even read what the op is saying ignition must have been a former wow player he doesnt read he just plays
waiting eagerly for the dev blogpatch notes
1x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic
my solution to this and other similar problemsif your in an npc corp you cant loot from salvage from take from a canwreck that you didnt createkill period it will pop up a warning that you have to be in a player corp to do those actions once in a player corp you can do everything you currently do except now the person your stealing from has the option to war dec your corpdoesnt break ccps intention that materials that require skill has no ownership provides some incentive for people to leave the npc corps although i think after a specified amount of skill they should be forced to leave but thats another topic provides a way for people being victimized by this to exact revenge
it feels crowded in places like jita but on the whole the universe is a big placeit would be great to see ccp put more into the game that intices new players like me out of empire and into zerozero
what use is the csm if it cant discuss specifics you just become another tool of ccp spouting great pr about how they are listening and being proactive about these kinds of things
if you had bothered to read the minutes you would note that ccp is going to be releasing a devblog by the end of this monthstart of february with most of the information we were givenonce that devblog is out we can discuss it
threads like this are great fun political espionage in eve dont give in issler goonswarm like all empires will fall into the sea one day make sure youre there to wave goodbye
 please read and think before quoting this  note the use of intelligent conversation below also note freedom of speech reread the above and then continuethats your opinion i guess and you did beginfair enough  windows does seem to kop the nastiest bugs or is in the press for it at least the point i wanted to make with this example is that it was an exploit that came in though a picture file  something which people do not associate with a security breach normally the point i was making was that sometimes an innocent or basic graphics object can present a security flaw hopefully i do not need to further connect this example to the topic in discussion hint the use of the word example above means that it is an example and not a direct comparison i am totally aware of the differences between this example and a winamp skineffectively yes this could be possible im not saying it has happened or will happen but simply that it could people often play down the concept of security and bugs because they beleive that it simply couldnt happen to them or think a winamp skin that hacks your pc thats sounds so crazy it could never ever happen it probably wouldnt but like i said it could do my other point was that it could make the game unfair if certain skins gave an advantage or disadvantage based upon speed of interaction or interfacei am also not saying that ccp shouldnt make an open gui for this reason merely speculating on why they may have chosen not toyeah i agree with thisfair pointsim not sure what youre saying here i think we have both made valid points im also not post
just to clarify spock is not an alt of mine hes actually my roommate and we were having a discussion about this and came across a snag involving implementing the itemtabbing idea in the assets window were not really sure how best to do it and were wondering if anyone had any ideasmy idea have the itemtabs carry over directly onto the assets window where you will have a series of tabs at the top representing the itemtabs you have in your inventory and the list of items beneath it will correspond only to those items in those tabshis idea change the assets window to look more like the market where you have the assets all the way on the left of the window much like the categories of items for sale and then the main item viewing screen would simply be like the item hangar with the tabs across the topboth of these fit quite nicely with the tabs but what do you guys think would be best now that this is all typed i actually think im leaning towards spocks idea but this would require revamping of the assets window let me know what you guys think
having an inventory that had sortable options and tabs just like the overview would be very niceit would be nice to be able to create specific columns showing relevant data like meta level and quick sellbuy price with the color coded good or bad option and the whole nine yardsi realize that its the overview that earned eve the excel in space moniker but your cargo hold items and ships need the excel in space design
heck yeahsigned
too much hassle especially for new players forgetting what went where just rent a corp hangar or use a station container its not like you will need tabs for every station where you have items
i am fresh out of clues buddy sorry
this is a change that would only benifit everyone  something i am hoping we see in the very near future
im all for it but some things come to mind that make it more than simplewhat hangar do you look into when using the corp hangar  members hangars does someone with the rights get to see all of your personal hangars or just the first one should that be configurable should players get a delivery hangar for this purpose i would assume marketcontract purchases as well just like a corp delivery hangarwhile it lasted damn those db lags the filter function on containers was nicethe partition idea is nice but there has to be some limit to nesting otherwise some fool is going to take 1000 of them and store everything down at the bottom 1000th level ive no idea what that would do to the dblag but it doesnt sound like a good ideai wouldnt mind having huge nonaudit log containers i second that suggestion as well station whatevers i dont think ive even looked at a personal log for one of them and would turn that off if i could i shuffle stuff around all the time and no password  no log  no locking would be nice for my personal hangarsif we are getting a revamp why not ask for more than 7 for personal and corp 16 would be a better start imo or 32 or better yet a configurable number up to 100 perhaps 10001099 for the api side note any adjustment in quantity also means working on the corp management screen as well as new ui screensright click menus for the player tabs
make it the cost double everytime its used starting at 25 million5010020040080016 bil etc etcuntil some kind of extreme cost for concord allowing a name change i do not supportif thats not viable try picking a good name from the beginning
i hate drones i forget them all the time in the belts and at gates they dont follow orders they get shot by npcpc alike its just a constant loss of isk i tend to leave my drone bay empty lately anyways there is a faction drone ship its called vexor navy issue but taking a closer look at the gila it might be worth reviewing its role can you say eaglemoa 
drones being able to be resynchronised due to loss of connection was discussed with ccp when the csm met in iceland the tldr which were in the summary minutes posted go read them was a way to reconnect to drones after disconnect will be looked at but various options need to be tested and analysed before anything can be implemented
definately
signed
signed and if not executed we know where to find you ccp p
the next step is of course to hack control of the enemy drones
that could be a very interesting step forward in electronic warfare
lets move this back to the front page again
supported long overdue for a revamp
your name says it allthe skill que isnt there to tell me what skills to train next i dont need evemon to do that for me smartassthe skillque is there because i cant always logon when im at a university doing things with my life just to change a skill so im not wasting skill training time which by the way we frakking pay foreven 1 extra skill would do the trick and would take little or no extra coding
d straight its about time when are we gonna see a real action about this also as aikita said please let us train skills in the order we want  no on doing some sort of sillly certificate system ploy stupid addition to the game anyways
got my vote
bump sounds interesting at least and i think it could prove to be fun
ccps new player retention plan1 remove skill training2 give everyone perfect characters 5 all around3 give everyone jovian battleships4 5 profit
if you want fast progress go this way as for the idea no
oops accidentally posted with my alt 
this is just wrong
this was my original postsince you found the blog you also found the interaction between myself and ccp gms documenting it all the problem is we played that game for minimum of 5 months was invited to play by the rats followed clues provided by them in the ships logs when we found the wormhole a particular device was required to stabilizesee tab on image of wormhole as i went through i went away for holiday and when i returned ccp had taken the logs out the clue to the last thing we needed to claim the prize and wormhole was taken out i petitioned ccp for a copy of the clue database or an indication of how close we had gotten to obtaining the prize the rest is selfexplanatorythe gm had us continue and report our findings to him as we went as documented we did everything asked we even took screenshots of items as we found them the other end of the wormhole screenshot of its destruction to prevent someone else claiming it in our stead while ccp debated how to deal with this we dont demand anything other than acknowledgment that we played the wormhole game if it truely was plexes prove it  let someone else you for example run these same plexes and lets compare dbs and screenshotsmy point why would they take the loot  drops  devices  etc if that game did not exist why has no one talked to those involved all of a sudden that game is coming 032009
continuation
i demand some pitchforks and torches and dont stop until ccp goes over every entry in their records and puts things right jesus
im pretty sure this issue is already closed and forgotten ccp knows that no matter what bad decisions they make if they ride out the storm for 2 months  they get away clean the player base is quick to forget
oops see this was already posted as local cache idea still seems like a good idea though  edited to add i wasnt looking at this from the scamming point of view just the convienience when i look at my own hangarim a horrible pack rat i suppose you could make the boundary only show up when your looking at stuff in your or your corps hangars seems overly complex though and might require difficult coding hrmmm i still want that boundary well we already have to set up overviews wherever we play why not assign color coded boundaries as an option also that way if you dont want to do it you dont have to but your stuff could be coded to your liking and only you view it that way everybody else still has to look at info to see if its an original or a copy
not sure of the details but ive never liked the tracking formula its always seemed incomplete
up
i support this however i didnt agree with your shrinking hypothesisi think that the current tracking system relies on you hitting a target point on a ship that is directly proportional to the signature radius this allows us to imagine all ships as being points ship velocity causes the points to move and increased distance translates to less deviation with increased distance when the ship is up close the relative movement of the target point is harder to align to as movement translates to larger deviationi am no expert on programming but i think we can appreciate that upgrading the tracking formula would require all calculations to take into account a more accurate shape of the ship and thus calculating hitsmisses might become far more demanding thus my support is for the idea but i raise questions about the practicality
they key word is effectively  as far as the tracking formula is concerned the angle subtended by a target remains the same at all ranges signature radius is a fixed number the only way that can happen if you half the distance is to half the arc lengthshrug its merely a way of illustrating the problem of size vs distance not being accounted for in a way you can think of the 0m bug being as a result of this problem it occurs because as far as the tracking formula is concerned at 0m your target is infinitesimally small you can never hit it
indeed  this is how it should worksupported
i support this proposal does this mean when you are at 0m range youll always hit
lets try to keep the key word realistic firstthe objects size should be a factor if your flying an interceptor around my malestrom and i lay into you with 8 1400mm cannons at point blank range do you really wana feel the full brunt of that strikeobviously unrealistic maybe youll get clipped every so often like 1 out of 50 shots  o pbut if your a battelcruiser the odds of nailing that ship should be far higher than a frigatethatis the key or one of them at least
im all for this fix but also this would make missiles explosion tracking even worse than gun trackingnot that guns arent already better for pvp than missiles in most instances
your entire idea is based on the false premise that tracking is supposed to equate to realitygame mechanics are not designed to simulate realityplease try redrafting your proposal to address a problem with game mechanics and not try to create a space simulator eve is so far from a realistic space simulator that we would need to bin the entire game to head in that direction
there are portions of the game that relate very much to reality and there are portions that dontwhat is wrong with adding bits and pieces of reality of it makes the game better
my idea as i stated in the op is based around the problem of closerange gun tracking specifically because of the aforementioned flaw closerange turrets are more heavily penalised at their optimal ranges compared to long range turrets closerange turret tracking cannot be significantly boosted because it would overpower them with longer range ammo so instead im posting ideas of how to attack the problem at very close ranges only now i think the change in webs was a good thing as it makes combat more fluid its actually possible to dive in and out of web range in frigates now im not proposing to go back to how it previously was with 90 webs but to fix the tracking formula so that close range ships particularly the bigger ones can function better at their optimal for autocannons and blasters we are talking sub5km here without removing frigates new found role in being able to close with the big ships
how are they more heavily penalised at their opperational rangehaving 4x better base tracking isnt enough 4x tracking is enough to take a 6 chance to hit up to a 84 chance to hit how much of a tracking advantage do you expect short range turrets to havehow would your proposed changes affect the usage of long range turrets at short range
i totally support this 11 slots sucks i want to be able to do more i dont want more characters to use to do what one should be able to do with invested time
this is a proposal to add some security changes to corporate science and industry jobs in addition to changes to the output and input location for a corporate jobin essence right now it is possible that if given builder rights any one person can cancel any one job there is no security break down allowing the installation of a job but requiring intervention for the completion of that job or at a very minimum only allowing the installer director or ceo to deliver the itemit is proposed that this be changed to only allow either the installer or a higher security level to deliver or cancel the science or industry jobin addition it is also requested that the inputoutput location possibilities for corporate jobs have added to them the personal hangars of corporate members meaning using say a locked down print in high security i can select my personal hangar as the source for mats and my personal hangar for the outputthis was brought up in the market discussion forum regarding a cooperative business plan between parties wanting to pool assets together but maintain singularity in actual operation of those assets you can find the discussion here

vigorous thumbs up for restricting cancel  delivery options and addition of personal hangar to both input and output of factory jobsthis is sorely neededwith current mechanics there is absolutely zero reason for industrialists to join player corps vs flying solo these mechanics would allow for newer players to provide value to established manufacturing organizations
youve seen concord pop a pod for aggression no rightyou did give me pause for thought however from the fact that now people would now be able to exploit this much like the lofty whereby they could blow up a cheap ship with a lot of ordinance of a friendly war target theyre working with and then work together to loot the other shipwrecks caused in the wake of the explosioni like it
horrible mechanic the above posters express most of the reasons why
1 wardec your trader alt 2 place him in jita 443 camp undock4 profit
lolcould be i actually think that if this mechanic was imposed you would be amazed by the vast majority of traders clicking the little checkbox in their wallet settings that says all sales to individuals currently under a declaration of war are strictly prohibited by the seller especially after a couple inadvertent lapses oh and 0 of 223 simply means that there are a lot of pussies playing this game
 not sure i get your meaning
lets get goonswarm to wardec everyone then sit back and watch what happens to the market
drake you do realize that you have an option in your autopilot settings that enables you to if at all possible avoid entering certain systems rightnow and please bear with me on this what if you had a similar type of mechanism in your wallet that allowed for a seller to avoid selling to certain individuals under certain specific conditionswhat do you say to a player that inadvertently failed to set his autopilot settings subsequently lost his ship to a losec gate camp and then petitioned the loss because he didnt mean to jump into losecget itoh and once again do you think that traders that in spite of the inherent riskiness of the proposition actually choose to sell to combatants wouldnt be in a somewhat better position to actually expect and receive a premium for their servicespossibly a new career as a warprofiteer
that would be epic the stuff of eve legend imo but i doubt it would in reality actually happen we can only hope
i give up this person is offically terminally stupid
so what you actually want is all traders to check the little box thus preventing certain corps and alliances that specialise in war deccing people from ever buying anything at a reasonable price again the irony is if youd have just said that youd probably get a lot more support lol captain thunk
why notnothing is stopping those corpsalliances from actually developing there own support system
looking at how well received this thread is theres no need to develop a support systemstill i like you youre a pretty funny guyhitme up ingame and we can negotiate your current war dec situation if its bothering you that much captain thunk
theres a big difference from blacklisting corps on the market as opposed to penalizing the whole damn universei dont have a problem with a blacklist provided its controlled by the vast populationonly draw back is people who are in the business of trading arent likely to give a damn as they are there to make money they dont care who blows away what
im at war
its in their interests that things do get blown up isnt it

this is an idea i had that could address a variety of issues and make the game world seem even more dynamic already one of the most awesome things about evethe idea is this that the true security status of a system 00 or empire be made dynamic but what would affect itratting when players kill npc pirates in a system they contribute to that systems security more ratters more secure higher sec status rats become more scarce conversely fewer ratters npc pirate factions start to gain control sec status goes down bigger rats show upmarket activity when players trade in a system concord sees that it is important to police said system if they dont concord doesnt really care what goes on thereplayer activity similar to market activity but this could be done for all activities  even docking up could make a extremely minute change to the systems sec statusplayer piracy and suicide ganking if many players kill each other in a system concord might decide that system is more work to police than it is worth the sec would go downthis could be implemented just like that or some more restrictions could be added such as the following00empire boundary the empires care more about soverign space so they might not change their borders so while the truesec decreased maybe even below 00 giving new meaning to the boundary of empire space the sec status hits and other hallmarks of lowsec would not disappear similarly 00 could not become lowsec only rats would change once the sec changed past 00highseclowsec this could also be made static similar to the aboveasteroids these might or might not change as truesec changedthe benefitsgame world becomes more dynamic this is mostly just because dynamic worlds are awesome but it might also have other benefitshurts farmers farm rats in the same system for too long those rats wont be quite as juicy moving around is more beneficial00 this gives alliances some benefits to policing their space not sure exactly what this would entail as im not personally experienced in 00feel free to post comments constructive criticism is appreciated more than thumbs up or down and sorry to mapmakers for proposing to mess with the mapsand remember this is just my 002 isk  no need to kill me if theres something i didnt think of
supporting ccp please at least get rid of the checkbox if you cant support in the op
very cool idea youve got going here it seems like it would be extremely hard to impliment and that there would be a lot more problems with this below the surface but i definatly would think that it would make eve more fun and with plenty of change
i like the principle and i think it could work well in 00 but if you start doing this in empire youll raise holy hell there a real meaning to the 0504 0403 and 0100 boundaries and its the sort of thing you cant really mess with too effectively what happens if you anchor a moon mining station in 03 space and then the sec status raises itself to 04 what happens if concord hq goes to 04 do empires suddenly uproot their guns and drop sovereignty claims if a 01 goes to 00 as i say its nifty but it seems a bit too fraught with issues to really be workable
i believe that the sec status he is referring to is the true sec not the status displayed it would still be a 00 system but because of all the ratting taking place the spawns get crappier as the true sec rises i could really only see this affecting spawns in a given systemregion like exploration sites and rats ill support it even if it will make the things i do to help support our corpalliance pvp harderedit as i reread the op more ideas if a high sec system is slow due to low trading little population no activity that would lower the true sec and affect the concord response time to any altercations as well it is still an 05 system but as nothing goes on there the true sec gets closer to 04 not ever reaching it though and if you gankget ganked concord responds slower as they dont have the presence nearby to respond quickly but as i type this i can quickly see probs with this that would require major mechanics changes so maybe not
supported
yeah i was trying to figure out how to fix it i think the best way might be to detach a systems shown sec from truesec  make shown sec fixed so concord penalties and pos anchorability dont change but make rats and roids change alternately doing it only in 00 would work
i support it hereon wont code it so minor issues are of no concern to me if ccp is fond of the concept of more dynamic space they will find their own way to do it this here is more about whether or not they should be poked about it
the choas factor is intriguing but would ruin high sec at bestalthough the status quo affect that plagues much of high sec would abruptly make life interestingim torn on the idea  o would make the game rather realistic
bad idea
dynamic standing is an excellent ideapersonally i think the standing system needs a bit of tweaking generally would like to be able to see npc to pc corp standings maybe just daily updates posted at downtimea small addition i think player corps standing towards concord and npc corps towards concord should make up a systems security rating this would maybe be the simplest way to implement all of the ideas you mentionif a system is populated by a number of npc station head quarters and player headquarters these should just be added together to give the total security rating of the systemfor this to work standing in corps should need to be calculated on a better weighted method i would think an easy solve would be to take membership time into the calculation so older corp members weighed higher in calculating corp standingjust my 001 isk
i dont claim to have a final polished idea as i said it could be done while locking which systems are highlownull sec or something in between
i support this idea it would make more sense that navy ships just have better strength but a ship that splits bonuses requirements and many times fittings should have split sensors also
edit to add support that sounds like it would actually make faction ships more useful in pvp compared to risk of loosing the thing
yes
npc corps exist despite a lot of hatred for them because people should be free to choose a player corp or not there are virtually no downsides to being in an npc corporation and ccp has kept it that way pos ownership is the only one i can think of and since npc corps intent is to serve casual players then owning a pos isnt something a casual player is going to do on hisher own casual players dont have alts casual players dont spend 20 hours a week on the game outside of that that player should have as much chance of success as i do its called a sand box for a reasonplayer content cant be balanced which is why it will never see the light of day in eve player control and interaction is the only sandbox part of the game and will remain so the second someone tells me that i needed to be on at such and such time one some day and i didnt so they are docking my pay they are going to get a face full of antimatter 99 of eve players will do the same sorry that kind of stupidity wont work in a game like eveeve should and most of the time is rock paper scissors not where the hell is my tps reports my salary vitality and social acceptance have been earned at the end of my 425si have no idea what the hell game you have been playing
well i certainly hope not not only do i disagree with the few ideas you finally suggested you took several posts to even bring them up your initial post was nearly 700 words 672 i think when i ran it through a counter for the lolz and there wasnt a single coherant idea proposed i dont just disagree with your economic simulator vision for eve i disagree with your sloppy haphazard method of proposing any of the seemingly limitless ideas you seem to have
since you have such eloquent arguments i asume the reason is you prefer the world mechanics turned a bit upside down that way you can be sure most things in eve dont transport into real life application and i have to point out that if eve keeps growing this will eventually become a bigger issue also it is rather unique that eve is the only semifunctional game economy due to the fact that players govern it almost 100 this is why it gets coverage in the financial times i am rather convinced this is worth building onspeaking from some experience in pen and paper and even in here it is a fact that good things arent always what the majority would wish for economy is a borring topic to most and thus have gotten a rather low priority at least feature and balance wiseif the above is so ridiculous it would be nice to have some arguments to shoot down my claim
heres my argument in my every day life i dont unhook from my jellyfilled pod sync up my attribute implants to choose what skill i have passively downloaded into my brain and then pop over to a corporation agent to pick up a deathdefying mission to take on 100 pirates in outerspace in a frakking space shipwhat part of this game has to translate to real lifeif i wanted everything to translate i wouldnt bother with eve again  my main problem with your post is your lack of organization post a thread about one thing youd propose changed instead of starting one with a vague 600 word diatribe with no discernable suggestions or issuesim all for waxing philisophical about how the game might encounter problems as it expands based on the current economical model im not for vague bumbling sloppy crap like this bumping viable useful idea threads to page 2 and giving them less exposureso theres my argument again either youre not reading not understanding or youre trollingedithere are a few of those threads i mentioned whether i support them or not123edited againi dont care if you see this or not im not giving you another free bump this topic is markec issue not discussion so your defense is null youre right you were derailed by yourself not me no one has signed in support and i doubt that was entirely my fault
i personally find it useless to suggest a specific idea unless its extremely simplethe topic i am touching upon is not even close to simple that is why i bring it up as a discussion and not as a specific ideai dont have the inside knowledge about statistics of player behaviour and the economyi can only see some of the effects of them indirectly this is the issue i am trying to have a discussion oni tend to see things a bit different as you might have noticed in one of the threads you linked to i not only supported the issue i pointed out how much more was in the idea then the short description of the original poster you might not approve of that style of posting but i hope that some of the elaborations there just might get some players attention that might otherwise find the suggestion simple and irrelevantif your sole reason for changing the tone of this post was to undermine the issue i have to admit you might have been successful
k i s sand so far no one knows what the hell your talking about because your issue got buried back there in the last 1000 wordsi still dont see your point other than ranting about npc corps is that it
yes pleaseand with afk timer not in local naturally
it would be extremely useful if players could apply some custom filters to their view of local chat at least on the client sidei can understand a standard format originating with the server but alphabetical is about the least useful of the many ways that the information could be presentedfor example why in a very busy system is a wartarget whose name begins with the letter z buried at the bottom of a long scroll list while a 2day old newbie character that i have absolutely no interest in but whose name begins with a sits right there at the topthe ability to sort by threat levelstandingscorpfleetalliance etc would allow the individual players to prioritize the information efficiently and logicallythank youreliq narsdep
sorry for starting a new thread but the primary thread is locked i was thinking about an alert level bar that is based on the systems security rating and responded to by the navy of the sovereignty and concord in extreme cases say the system is 4 but is 432 in actuality well thats 068 from the assumed 5 barrier even though thats not exactly correct lets call it that for simplicity sake that means there are 68 points in the meter an aggressive act is going to be almost immediately responded to but that response is scaled by the security rating of the system and the percentage of the meter that is full the initial response time could be something like 15th or 110th of the meter time or in this case anywhere from 136 to 68 seconds assign a point value to the aggressive act and assign a point value to destroying a players ship by another player that isnt participating in a concord sanctioned war if the system is very peaceful low or empty meter at the time of the act the response will be light however the aggressor should keep in mind that heshe could be faced with an unknown foe or foes this time you might get a battle cruiser but next time you might get webbed and jammed by frigates and set upon by cruisers this example not being that bad is fine unless that pilot you just ganked is looking for revenge destroying the security force adds to the alert bar which also effects the reaction time of the next wave of security forces if the act of aggression was 5 points you killed a cruiser that added another 5 points and then you killed 3 security frigates and a cruiser worth 2 and 4 points each respectively you have now added 20 points to the bar that only has 68 in it well you now have 48 seconds to get out of town try to dock or brace for another wave there would need to be a cool down timer before the points start to tick off that timer could literally the same timer as the response timer or maybe half that then a system will never stay truly maxed out but the time unless you fight endlessly may or may not tick away in seconds but slower to deter prairie dogging behavior that timer is also not player specific but affects the whole system so if you another pirate and a can flipper all trigger at the same time you might suddenly be in for a much bigger spawn than you were planning on and it getting there much sooner than you expected there could be a possibility of the security level reaching a type of critical mass in which youre denied docking rights gate access and possibly even concord response for extended periods of maxed out alert barsthese numbers are by no means exact but my concept is to create a middle ground area that effectively blends high sec and no sec while limiting the effectiveness of gate camping as a long term tactic and never providing any true deterrent for casual pirating and pvp this will stop major alliances from going into low sec from 0 and blasting every pos they come to without war decing those corps because eventually concord will respond to their assaultit doesnt require a change to sec status hits roid values agent locations agent rewards the bird flu or any other stuff that is hard as hell to balance just a new mechanic for a portion of space that under used and doesnt serve its intended purposethoughts
not likely to be supportedeven if your in a 4999999999999999999999999999999999999 sec system concords not going to show up or the faction navybecause its a black and white situationall your trying to do is blur the lines and while im in favor of more security it would disrupt the balance of the game too muchthe new 4 would be 3 and so forth
the situation being black and white is the problem blurring the lines is the point you are not effecting the security status of the system at alllow sec is so out of balance that few people make it a home so who cares if it disrupts the balance of low sec as it currently exists the riskreward of lowsec is the biggest screwup in the game since launch
your only moving them out one system furtherlowsec is just that low security you go there at your own perilyour not supposed to have the safety net of concord out there that was clearly establishedyou need to deal with the pirates in a different waythe idea of doing a concord player law enforcement would be one waya group of players who enforce the law as deputiesbut then how do you deal with briberythat is far better than rewriteing the rules on security statusdont get me wrong im all in favor of making low sec more viable but sorry to say i have to side with the pirates as it would just disrupt the mechanicsif we take an inch from them they are gonna want there mile and we dont need that now do we
maybe the explanation of my proposal isnt very clear to you it would be near impossible to get concord to show up unless your illegally sieging a pos gate camping a very busy gate andor farming the navy security force again concord intervention in this scenario would be near impossible to achieve in casual combateven then i said it would have to take a while for them to show up there is a response timer just like high sec but concord does not show up initially ever it will always be faction navy or some other security force not concord unless you do one of the things mentioned in the above post the alert bar effects low sec thats everything from 1 to 4999 rightin theory at least it effects every system not just 4 systems that was an exampleso pirates simply have more leeway with blowing things up the lower the security rating of the system is because there would be a much larger alert bar which would take longer to fill up which creates longer response times for reinforcementsyou are still there at your own risk you will still be engaged by targets and you can still be killed before even the pve help arriveswhat did i miss
illeagally doing something to make concord show up by whose definitionyours mine your talking about a dynamic world here one that isnt as cut and dry as it seemseven then its a below 5 which means there is no law enforcement other than logging actions takenyour bluring of the lines will change that 3 becomes the new 4and top that off with your it will be a while before they show up is a waste of timemost incidents will take place so damn quickly its a waste of time to even botherand sieging poss is not an illegal action unless its in a 5 or higher system and even there are conditions that have to be met in that casewere talking about lower than 5your solution is vague at best and needs a great deal of refinement and even if its a rather interesting idea not gonna happenyou need to keep it simple otherwise you get into the realm of changing a massive game mechanic that has been repeatedly debated all your going to do in the end is nerf the pirate gangs and as much as i hate im thats not a good idea
you realize those actions are already illegal right thats why you get a security standing penalty for doing them the world is that cut and dry thats why low sec is a no mans landall i am proposing is that a dynamic security system be used to deter persistent sustained aggressions and provide a security mechanism for low sec space that doesnt stop pirates from being pirates but does increase the population seeding of low sec due to a decrease in the risk vs reward of living there without trying to rebalance every roid agent mission and sentry gun in the entire security region
by your logic then a 501111111 system should allow me to shoot and pod you wo concord response i only have to tank gate gunscant have it one way and not the other p
no it wont it will still be 3 2 will still be 2 and 1 will still be 1 because the security status of the system is unaffected what about that dont you understandare you reading anything i post i have already said that the point is to deter constant aggression there by making systems safer because the more active pirates are the more active security is it only hurts pirates if they are stupid enough to let the bar fill up and stay filled up till concord arrives if they do that its their own fault they got blasted aside from that just like they decide what targets to attack and what targets to ignore they would also decide what systems to operate in based on the target environment and the level of the alert barthanks for parsing words then make it illegal there is no reason why low sec dwellers should have to compete with 0 dwellers on the same level with much crappier resources and an impossible to police area without using war dec mechanics considering they dont cost enough to really bother most corporations in the slightest much less the 0 corps and alliancesagain do you read anything i postits vague because you dont understand it something tells me you never will i am not going to keep explaining it because your busy trolling my post rather than reading what i said or adding anything constructive whatsoeverits amazingly simple other than the alert bar and its derivative system all the mechanics already exist in the game in fact the derivatives are already triggered in the game by security standing loss its in fact very very simpleplease if you dont comprehend it fine but stop ignoring my posts and stating generalities like philosophy is going to solve the low sec problem
where did i ever say this applies to anything other than systems between 499999 and 1the title is low sec
technicallypashanai system for example is true sec 045764 but it acts as a 05 system
your absolutely right which is why i saidif my memory serves me correct most systems that are low sec are significantly below the 5 mark and since the alert bar would be based on the differential between 5 and its security standing then no system would have a short barpashanai would only have a 54 point bar which means if the response time was 110th of the bar it would be 54 seconds for the initial spawn if you incurred 20pts worth of aggressive actions then the next spawn would not arrive for 34 seconds after you destroyed the first spawn aside from that nothing changes those point totals are only examples of how the system would work it would obviously need balancingits all mute since pashanai is not low sec but thats how it would work all it does is deter you from going on a rampage because response times get better spawns get tougher and if you really work at it concord will show up the only reason i say concord will show up is because if a 0 corp decides to gank small low sec corporate poss for lolz they should be forced to do it quickly i am not oppose to concord warning timer or anything like that just a system for limiting long lasting sustained aggression without stopping piracy
if thats your stance thats acceptable i fail to see how this stops pirating and turns it into high sec but to each his ownthanks for editing your post before i reported you
you are adding a high sec mechanic concord into low sec you are not adding in the full power of concord but it is the same mechanic taking a high sec mechanic and throwing it into low sec is the very definition of turning low sec into high sec low sec is not black and white if you want to travel through the system or dock then you have gate guns to help you if you want to explore around the system npcs will not help you this is a perfect gradual step away from npc protection and towards players policing the space they want to live in adding in carebear npc police into low sec would make low sec pointless low sec space is the fringe systems with no police adding in police would be against the whole point of low sec get it
since my other proposals regarding the bounty and wardec mechanics have been so well received by this community i feel compelled to offer yet another solution to an ageold at least as far as recent history is concerned issuethe blobi propose a change to gateportalbridge mechanics as followsdue to the incredible amounts of energy required to activate a gate or any other jump mechanism it seems to me that a realistic scenario could be implemented that better simulates such a colossal feat of energy managementi propose that these gatesportalsbridges have for lack of a better term a powerup timer of perhaps 5 seconds any longer may cause an inordinate amount of panty bunching i fearwhat this means is that for each activation of a gateportalbridge another activation is not possible for 5 secondsfor examplemultiple ships approach a gateportalbridge and activate the jump mechanism based on when the server receives the actual command it starts a queueship 1 jumps at tship 2 jumps at t  5ship 3 jumps at t  10etc etc etc it is inevitable that at certain gates long queues may form these pilots will patiently of course wait their turn to jumpi believe that such a mechanic will add a new dynamic to not only blob warfare but to other interesting activities pilots choose to engage in everyday in new edeni await your comments and concernsthank youeditoh and btw you are not to be considered jumping until you are in the 5 second jump window assigned by the server

this proposal aims to enhance a matter that many would agree is particularly important ccpplayer communicationthe exact target for this proposal petitionsthe problem as i see it the current petitioning system communicates very limited information there has been significant frustration and now possibly even learned helplessness with problems people see in the current petitioning system this has been much the case when players have interpreted there to be discrepancies in petition responsetime and results particularly where there have been server issuesin a nutshell make it possible for players to see a petition queue ie an anonymous list of active petitions with their datetime of submission arranged under each category at the head of every queue would be an anonymised devgm so players can see what resources are available to deal with the list petitions can have labels to indicate the number of replies between ccp staff and the players as well as what stage they are at i would like to discuss this with others to see what kind of levels could be proposed eg succeededfailedsome of the prosit is very simple and easy to applyplayers can see a quantitative figure for how busy the relevant petition queue is they will be aware of how fast the petitions ahead of them are dealt in the past people have complained that petitions of their foes can skip the queueplayers may appreciate the petition load that ccp facesplayers will have a neutral resource to refer to if there are rumours of petition bias players do not feel singled out if what they see as a strong case for ship reimbursement petition fails seeing that only a fraction do this is a minor bonusthe only con i could think ofit may open ccp to more criticism if players use these lists to interpret that ccp employees are not distributing their resources efficiently  giving too much or too little time to certain petitions is this really a con p
no support  bad idea ive had good responses to the few petitions i have submitted over the years i think this is probably because i sumbit few petitions and those have been valid issues look at some of the nonsense on this forum and try to imagine the amount of nonsense ccp recieves through petitions the last thing i want is a bunch of customers with to much time on thier hands trying to armchairquarterback the petition queue this would not improve service
interesting good points id be interested to know if there were other pilots whove unlike yourself had bad experiences to whom this would be the appropriate nepenthe
nope wont happenthats like painting a bullseye on ccp they get enough flak from us as it ismy only problem with the current system is the fact they tend to close the petitions without feedback or at least thats the impression i getseems a bit one sidedthe timing of responses is easy to explain a good enough of them are on the other side of the planet
hello alli live in east asia and have a real life that usually doesnt allow me to get home until about 7pm at the earliest sadly downtime starts at 8pm over here and as i need to go to bed around 1130 i cant really enjoy the benefits of the game during the weekdaysim not a programmer so i dont know the details of how it works but i was thinking that there could be a minor change in the scheduling of downtime is it possible to have it so that downtime is not always at the same time every day worldwide perhaps it could shift forward one hour every day or week so that people in one part of the world dont always get hit with downtime during prime playing time on weekday evenings and everyone has to share in the annoyance of the necessary downtimeccp if you want to expand your market in east asia you will be doing us a favor by making some compensation so that we can also sometimes enjoy the benefits of uninterupted play during the weekdays perhaps some quitdont join because of this issueps it would also be nice if you guys would finally implement a skill queue even one would be great

i am so tired of being screwed by 1 dude with 5 accounts running at once in combat it is so lame the folloing fixes should be madegreatly weaken the accuaracey of auto target auto shoot  in other words if you want to just lock on and shoot you either have to be far away firing at a slow large target or using small guns twich based movement and shooting i should be able to put both engines and turrets in manual mode it would probably work something like this arrow keys to move   to yaw   for spped the mouse controls gun reticule that can only move at the maximum tracking speed of the slowest online gun closer you are to the sweet spot the better your chance of hitting if i have a computer lock on the target my skills bounuses etc my chances of hitting are greatly improved but even without i still have a fighting chance of hitting especially is i am just damn good even if i am jammed in other words if you want to hit something and hard you will have to take personal control of the shipwith just this a person fighting five accounts that are controlled by just one person has a much better chance even if one of the accounts is a falcon which it ussually is to say nothing as adding a totally cool dimension to the game
firstly hell no never ever going to happensecondly the best way to limit people using several characters at once would be to limit it to two active subscriptions or something in anycase thumbs down
the orginal idea is terrible but the notion of limiting everyone to 2 active subscriptions is stupid why would ccp want limit their revenue especially in the current state of the world economy
im sorry thats my own failgrammar i meant to active clients ie you can have as many paid accounts and characters as you like yet only run two at once i know it will never fly i just thought id throw it out there again original idea is unsupportable
one big reason i play eve is that its a thinking game not a twitch game my good ol wrists arent compatible with ours of twitch gaming like they used to be i actually enjoy the low click need in this game and i only have one accountso in summaryplease visit your user settings to reenable images
its the game people if you loot salvage you incur the wrath if you think you are entitled to the salvage of the wrecks you are responsible for then take it you already are aggrod against the ships owner stealing their stuff cant get you any worse offthere is no reason why the game needs to tell you who came and looted your prize if you didnt stick around to keep it that is your problem eve laws dictate that the wreck belongs to the injured party anyone looting a wreck but the owner is breaking the law that doesnt mean the owner has to be interested in coming after you he may still be licking his wounds from the fight and is likely to be more peeved at the guy who blew him up than the guy who picked his boneswhy not act like a real salvager and make a deal to return the property to the owner if he is willing to pay the salvaging fee
oh my god its all a giant conspiracy and cover up they have created the csm to brainwash you into playing eve even though it might not be the perfect game they are all evil evillllll i tell youif you dont like the game go away if you want to change it there is a process there are no instant fixes 
supported
they have something like that for the assets window when your docked but its not as good as the corp hanger tabs 5 tabs would be cool and if you could name them would be even better
i would expect they would want cashy money for this service much like changing your character picture that is a devbalance team issue let them determine the specifics just give us the option
the caps are pretty crappy on the minmatar end not to mention over half of our other ships being pretty screwed up ive given up on the nag and have start to respec to amarr
 they havent resolved this yet
you forgot to mention how ugly they are
what do u mean thats the only thing they have going for them hel is sexy and didnt u hear everyone say thats what balanced the nag it is verticle after all
as far as alliance making improvements to different space perhaps we could add a static cap so to speak to how far it can be improved we could probably tie this to its truesec rating or some other systemedit wanted to support this topic
there is exactly 1 definite way to verify 100 that someone uses a macro and that is standing infront of his computerotherwise there is no way to verify 100 that someone uses a macro you might find symptoms that indicate someone mightbe using a macro and you might find serveral symptoms together but it could still be a human interaction
are you sure you didnt mix up my toon and aikitas her post is higher up and says nothing of the sort 
chatgris akita my bad sorryi agree with what chatgris said about letting us choose our own skills as opposed to following the certificates
only 22 pages keep it going
in relation to this idea do anyone know if its as simple to implement as i suspectthe info on location is already reachable for the warp to when ganging and using a bookmark the instanceinfo programming wise should be there and availablethe distress could simply be added like a kind of macro in chatsosthis would spawn a linkage in chat that you could warp to like it was a bookmarkin this opening for drag and drop any bookmark to any chatany techies able to elaborate
thisincidentally best idea this monthsupported
given that ccp already has a bookmark system and a system for linking to things in chat i would assume that it would be fairly simple to code i say this with a fairly extensive technical background re techies elaborating i envision a buttonshortcut that places an active link to your position in the active chat and the ability to drag a bookmark from your places to a chat sound reasonable as well
btw while i agree with the idea and everyone should be able to make them and everyone should be able to warp to them i also think it should be made clear who made the distress signal
if you had done your research properly you would know that ccp is about to release an extensive dev blog with the conclusion on this whole caseso its definitely not forgotten
the dev blog is ccps report to the community what of the csms investigative report of its conclusions or are you saying that your body did not conduct its own investigation but are relying on what ccp decides your investigations reveal before presentation to usfor my education concerning csm role  did the csm investigate or merely wait for notification of what to say to us if you did not what was your role  to placate or what exactly
it is not the csms role to investigate the innerworkings of ccp at all their role is to articulate the voice of the player basethey did thistransparency was asked for in the investigation conducted by ccp as only ccp has the ability to do so and we await the forthcoming results in the devblogthere is no need to call out the csm for something that they have no control over and rightly so they are the ambassadors of the player base chosen from the player base they do not recieve a salary from ccp or any compensation for that matter other than a free flight to iceland and what sounded like a night of moderate drinking and thus they have no grounds for conducting any sort of investigationif it is not good enough that ccp conduct the investigation and post the result of their finding which according to the eula they really dont even have to do then nothing will be i really dont see ccp outsourcing an exploit investigation to a small fraction of the player base that were banded together to represent the larger player basein short if youve lost your support in ccp theyre pretty much the end of the line in this regard they have the good grace to release what sounds to be a substantial report on the issue so why dont we just wait for that
this guy is entirely right if we were to actually get access to the logs in the first place ccp would have to terminate our accounts and then kill us after we saw them most likely its unreasonable to expect that the csm should make a report ccp has spend over a month working on this exploit now do you expect the csm to do that over an extended weekend where we had a busy schedule in the first place
i was not attempting to be snide but to ascertain what your roles were thank you for making it clear my expectation did not equal the reality my apologies to the panel  when the candidate explained what csm was it wasnt what you just said i was lead to believe you were there to assist the player base resolve our concerns an avenue to facilitate communication to achieve resolution that is mutually respectful my mistake
thank you for the clarification my mistaken understanding of their function in eve i was led to understand they were more
no problem there has been some confusion about our role due to an interview hellmar did with nyt where he suggested that the csm will be an oversight committee but thats not the case
read the article if not oversight what is the function of the csm since you do this can you tell me what csm really does
ideas change and morph to new things as they are put to the test the original idea was heavily influenced by the t20 incident etc however when they started working on the csm concept they seemed to have realized what they needed was to communicate with a group of people whom represent the playerbase
to be fair thats not the complete truthccp xhagen has been pushing for this idea for quite a while the current implementation is what he wanted it to be i assume the nyt article after the t20 incident was hellmar pushing forward the idea as well but with too much focus on csm as an oversightccp has been very open to our questions about the exploit so in a sense we are overseeing what they are doing but we have no direct oversight as such we are just representing the players
i still cant quite work out why a news update about the upcoming release of information was not published only a entry by the csm in the thread that only a portion of eve players read maybe thats just it though since its bad press if it makes the news pages right of course it will when they make the final statement but why stoke the fires with a few updates that leave the issue longer in players memories for all the good work that the csm may do i dont want to hear it from them  i want updates and assurance from ccp themselves in an official capacity this was a serious issue not just another we want our missile range back matter an update or two since the 19th dec even if it contained nothing more than we are still investigating this would have be welcome and taken only a minute or two to type up publish
the effort to write a new database for a game like this is not trivial do you want tech 3 ships or coloured borders on bpcs yes its a feature thats obviously lacking and yet its a huge headache to a lot of people but the amount of work involved far far exceeds the rewards of doing that work in a perfect world itd be done and wed be okay in this worldnot so much
i never doubted thatme personallycolored bpcsim dead serious i dont need new features i dont even know anything about if i can instead get a functioning system i am currently working withi suppose the same can be said about pos and the entire interface of eve and about a hundred other things as wellyou just have to define reward in the right way and anything wont be important enoughthe blueprint issue isnt going to solve itself if tech 3 adds another layer of blueprints its only going to be worse edit yes im somewhat bitter and angry about that every time i have to deal with blueprints im annoyed and seeing that like the entire pos system its not worth reworking it doesnt make me happy at all
yes please it is quite a pain to have to click on the info page for all the bpos and bpcs that i have so that i can separate them
im sympathetic to that but surely youre aware that youre in the minority on this the difference is pos changes affect gameplay directly bpc changes only affect the interface im a big believer in a solid interface and im willing to suggest putting more work into fixing it than most but even for me there are limits bpc changes are on the priority list somewhere but theyre below a lot of other things id be all for them taking the place of ambulation but thats not going to happen and most of the other announced features are probably ahead of the one you propose and rightfully so i get ui frustration but theres limits on what they can reasonably fix
i think i rarely agree with the majority still being the minority doesnt mean being always wrong otherwise id like to know when the earth got folded into a spherei somewhat resent the only but i get your pointas long as it is on a list that is good hopefully it doesnt get bumped down with every new shiny
i got better idea why do all items have to be in the shape of a square picture wisebpo  square picture like they are right nowbpc  circle picturewhy stop there ammo not blueprints but the actual charge could be trianglesim not a programmer or whatever but would it be really hard to introduce something like that
taking a neutron blaster vs a 425mm railgun for example the latter has 8x the base range for 22 of the tracking it gets worse when you consider real setups where for example a tracking computer pushes the long range weapon out to ranges still talking short range ammo here where you simply cannot miss another battleship plug in the base numbers into the tracking guide and you can see that even with a small 50 msec transversal hit chance drops to 80 at 2km and 40 at 1 km note this is for a weapon system with a base optimal range short range ammo of 36km shooting at a kmsized target you simply cannot miss another kmsized target at 1kmagain taking the base numbers for a 415mm railgun my proposed changes would boost its hit chance vs another battleship to 100 at 13 msec transversal at 14km 72 hit chance at 29 msec transversal at 3km and 51 hit chance at 48 msec transversal at 5km cf the current is 50 at those ranges at those transversals in short you are still stuffed if you fight a closerange battleship up close when you are fitted for long range
ah you are trying logic and maths dont expect much support anyway a quick fix would be to multiply the gun tracking speed by the effectivetrue signature ratio if effective  gun sig resnow a simple and fast way to determine the effective sig supported
haha well anyway ignoring the technical thread i created id say to my detractors who think im trying to create a realistic space sim that size vs distance is a pretty simple uncomplicated matter
as soon wrecking hits are removed this will have my support

your doing it wrongopperational range is optimal  12 falloffneutron blasters have 45x the tracking while 425mm railgun has 57x rangeadd antimatter ammo into the mix and the range advantage drops to 47xtry using your falloff range as intended
no it takes long enough as it is to get any research and invention done

after seeing a lot of threads about ecm vs eccm that look a lot like thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesi think its a good idea to give eccm a bonus to the ship using it in combat other than just reducing the effect of ecm as all the other systems like sbs and tcs doand the best suggestion i have seen is a reduction in sig radius and as ecm is a caldari ewar system and they favor missiles the system most effected by sig radius it fits with the story line
big thumbs up

supported but we know its not going to happen until ccp completely rewrites the entire rd system this in turn isnt going to happen unless most of the corp  pos mechanics are also rehashed its got to the point where attempting to make any changes would probably break the whole thing  most of the code was written several years ago
absolutely signed
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis is hardly a matter worth wasting on the csm funny or not this board is already cluttered enough
cis face or lack of is a part of eve as much as the shipsfor the sake of the game remove the face
supporting for the lulz
so instead of nerfing ecm strength or whatever how about some penalties for jamming someone like a side affect or somethinghere is some random thought ready to be flamed hard core these deal with ecm meta levelslock range  meta level 0  10 reduction in lock range as when you fit a ecm  spatial destabilizer i module so if its say the t2 varient it would only be a 4 hitsignature radius  same formula as abovehit points  same formula as abovenow i am not talking about massive hits maybe what i listed above is too much to those but slight hits to them to bring them more in line with the other race recons maybe all three or one or combination depending on what it isflame away
giving support to my own fail idea
technically ecm is overpower in comparisonsolution maybe each race should have an ecm dedicated ship as it is the most useful of the electronic warfare variety as youd think by now the other races would have adapted to something that is far superiormodify the blakbirdfalcon hull for each race it still looks blackbirdy but give it the bits that makes each race unique except for the fact they are all using the same ecm in this case
i was agreing then i lawled because i had the mini ecm bb in my head lol how funny would it look d
then caldari would lose out one of the few things that keeps it viable in pvp and the caldari would have no racial ewar ship
reading between the lines this is basically a call for a stealth boost to ganking industrials in highsecassuming you use this little checkbox as a seller if you choose to click it who exactly do you think will buy your ships and shiny modules if its not for the people who are involved in wars and conflicts and thus using and losing their equipment the people who check the box are basically going to be selling to the collectors the mission market i dont lose many ships at all in missions even though im stupid and lowsec and nullsec people who arguably are in the best position to look after themselves anyway the checkbox is therefore pretty much redundant its like selecting doom yourself to market failure from the picklist on placing your market orders youre forced to sell to people at war if you want to actually make a living its not going to be a new career path of selling to warmongersplus say im in a corp in an alliance and the alliance leader turns out to be a retard and we get wardecd by ooh i dont know repo or some other mercs currently my ceo can realise that the guys an idiot and going to brign nothing but trouble and pull the corp out of the alliance thus removing us from the hostilities after 24 hours if the beef was with us we can of course be redecd but in your proposal people who have nothing to do with the original beef didnt cause it didnt agree with it and wish it had never happened can continue to be decd for just the single price of the initial war i dont think i like that possibilityhowever if there is a requirement to provide formal surrender mechanism which went through concord whereby such corps could always formally surrender for a contract settlement isk items tasks performed whatever then i would give the first part of your idea more consideration as theres certainly room for improvement in the war mechanictldr  warring parties make up a huge chunk of the market choosing not to sell to them dooms you to market failure perpetual flagging of corps who leave alliance allows for griefing of uninvolved people who could be on your side in the argument if theres always a formal surrender option then this isnt so bad tldr the tldr meow
first very perceptive gratzi think your idea for surrender conditions definitely has merit but i disagree with letting traders of the hook especially considering their immoral support of such vicious crimes against humanityif a trader wished to be successful he could always be a warprofiteer though he should be prepared to accept the consequences of such an actionthe best part honestly is that hiding in a decproof npc corp would now be just a fading memory

would be really awesome if it gave the option to actually have high sec be able to decline and even get 00 to grow into a secure spaceget the whole thing a bit more greyyou would still have some systems that would always stay high but mixing it up really adds to the game experiencethis with wormholes would sort of end up like shaking the whole thing a bit kicking the beehive so to speak
can be easily exploited not supported
do want
um yeah duh 
ever heard of dysprosium basicly that makes the universe of eve going around 00 wars are about powerterritory and dispro moons and btw all of eve should be 00 instead of highsec its only needed for the protection of noobs
i would agree on this but there is more to eve than just the wars even though this is another of eves unique aspects the truly awesome pvp system its not all there is to this rather potentially complete simulation experiencewith current thinking there is a segregation between high and low sec space simply due to the imo misbalance of motivation
you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means
metagame is features and game created by players that is above and beyond the game enginestocks and ipo features are one example
what i personally enjoy about eve is that it does not directly provide the motivation motivation is supplied or not supplied by the individual pilots eve provides the box each of us will find or not find our muse within the box i suppose in that respect it is jut like life

unless were going for a fully moddable ui the local filters thread had a better solution to this problem
so in your opinion the risk vs reward value of low sec is acceptable despite 0 being more profitable and safer and high sec being more profitable and saferso low sec consists of stations and stargates everything else is 0 what your saying is the only way to be profitable in low sec is to be a pirate take overwhelming force with you in all your ventures and end up making less than you would in the perfect safety of high sec or less than you would by going to 0 cloaklog every time a pirate comes in the area play the station huggingpos shield hugging game or any other number of ridiculous things that already go on because those mechanics are broken andor necessary to maintain some semblance of safety in low sec my idea places people in low sec which places targets in low sec and doesnt stop piracy your just parsing words again as i have clearly stated the intent and purpose of my proposal the gate guns in low sec are the only ones that are half a deterrent and just like anything else all people do is tank them and keep gate camping at least my solution provides random spawns and that ever elusive dynamic content that games and gamers always look for if the gate gun solution was working it would have done so sometime in the last 4 years of jacking with them to deter the behaviorthe players cant police that space though if i go to low sec and kill every known pirate i come across i will be a pirate in a couple of days there is no policing of anything just reacting to constant jabbing or taking a security penalty pirates are free to traverse the area and pick and choose and the consequences of their actions are perfectly fine because thats part of being a pirate while being proactive and going after pirates is still something you get punished for just like pirates get punished thats real balanced play defense or elsethats your opinion and i respect that the fact that you could still run around and blow ships up without losing yours makes it vastly different then high sec but hey if what you want is a free for all zone then isnt that what 0 is supposed to be right now low sec is just as free for all as 0 its just got a crappier riskreward if you dont want to fix that then fine point taken get off my thread
in what way is my proposal irrational you may not agree with it but thats your businessyou really need to take a look at your communication methods and determine the validity of your statement
your point is dumb gtfo out of eve
thanks for your opinion
i love the people who say youre stupid for voicing an idea iqs must have dropped sharply while i wasnt paying attentionback to the op of this topici think its a bad idea let me try and explain why you are in essence expanding the sphere of control of both the faction navies and concord into areas of the galaxy where they do not currently have a presence it would be one thing if for example the minmatar government laid claim to a system built some stations and their navy started kicking the thrusters off any pirate ship in the vicinity its logical theyre protecting their interests and its very similar to the way actual governments protect their interests in the real worldbut just like you wont see the eu devoting martial resources to hunting down pirates off the coast of antartica why should the minmatar or anyone else care what happens in an area they have no influence read economic interests inthe question just gets stickier if its a system lodged between two empires  what if the system is right next to both a gallente system and a minmatar system who responds in that case or worse minmatar and amarrian space do you really want to get caught in the middle of two skirmish groups that are supposedly there to protect youin short the reason its a bad idea isnt because youre a moron or daft as some of the other people pointed out  thereby proving that if you dont have an argument an insult is the next best thingrather the reason its a bd idea is because 1 it unrealistically extends the control of factional security forces beyond their spheres of influence and 2 it would open a huge can of political worms in gamewhen you get right down to it lowsec isnt meant to be safe its meant to be a stepping stone from highsec to nullsec in the development path of a character its the place that teaches you how to go from working alone to working as part of an effective team it can be profitable  i woulad argue just as profitable as high sec if you learn the lessons it has to teach
this is a decent idea

while watching the alliance tournament replays on youtube i wondered how possible it would be to play these replays ingame not as just videos but fully 3d camera adjustable replays think of it as watching the fight as if you were on the fight gridmy only concern would be how large a replay file would be since it could be as simple as recording the commands each player gives hisher ship and running them like a macro i would believe it wouldnt take much considering eves bandwidth usei think it would be much better than the noncontrollable video on youtube  to be able to watch any recorded battle from any angle would just make watching great fights that much better
very interesting idea though its probably a whole lot more work than taking the video is that said if it can be done without requiring too many manhours id like to see it and i think a lot of other people would too ill give this a thumbsup if only to see what ccp has to say
i approveespecially when ambulation comes around and we can have cameras watch exotic dancers
depending on the success of eve going retail in march our universe may soon become very crowded it will matter most on the number of roof tops the retail box launches with and the number of saleshowever regardless of this and taking into account the vastly increased amount of internet advertising ccp is doing lately for eve i would say that ccp should seriously start to look at greatly expanding the number of systems in eve to say around double the current amount

why would a pirate organisation give you datacores when you go out and blow up its agents
it would not you need standing to get the datacores plenty of it for the good agents so to get datacores from the pirates a player would need to run missions for thembtw even if i get the 00 inventor frustration a more self contained 00 is not a good thing links to empire should be needed

i think that will kinda ruin the voting that took place in this threadas for this thread my guess it is is to hope ccp finally notices it and does recognize the problembasically their response has zero sense of satisfaction to itit can be translated intoeven though we dont recognize what youre talking about but when we do capital ships review we may look at it and when that might be we cant tell you

my guess is that if ccp actually accept macro mining it would be coz there is too few miners to support all the ships blowing up in this game with all the wars going on fw included there must be a massive demand for ships and then you have the modules and rigs in addition ofc macrominers will never be able to take away the living from a human miner anyway theres a fixed lowest price for ore it will never drop below this is set by insurance and maybe other mechanics too maybe the solution would be to make mining more an active effort for those who want more income from it say if you need to probe for more valuable ore wormholes maybe there will allways be a isk vs risk factor too and the only risk mining in highsec is a suicide runner
if you suspect afk activities why do not implement some kind of captcha for clients who recently created assets in game like ore npc loot or bounty isk make some sort of threshold value here so captcha wont interact with pvp pilots killing small npc gate spawnif as well local chat will be changed to delayed mode at least halfdelayed like player shows in chat list 12 min after jumping in not immediately that will stop a lot of 00 macro isk farmers just by other playersfor now local change allow scripts to warp out and cloak in fullauto mode

truth is independent of opinion in science correct in marketingwhich dont kid yourself is as big a part of the priority scheme as anything the line is a lot fuzzier ui is important but less important than gameplay i dont think either half of that statement is controversial i dont know for sure but its been requested often enough and has enough obvious utility that i cant imagine it not being on the list just as hard as it would be to introduce any of the other changes mentioned thus far in order to have different icons you need to have a way to distinguish them in the items database since no such way exists at present there is no way to make them distinguishable without running a blueprintspecific search like the blueprints tab in si does at present doing that every time you look at a hangar or a cargo hold would be laggy to say the least shape colour border whatever  it cant be done without either major lag or major work
at least to me gameplay is directly affected by the ui a good game can be ruined by a bad ui and a mediocre game can be more fun if the ui is good
id love to see this however i understand that there are some technical database issues that mean that the solution isnt as clear cut as wed like it to beas a suggestion though the primary difference between a bpo and a bpc is the number of runs with all bpos having infinate runs im not a database programmer so i have no idea if this would work but would it be possible for the icon for the blueprint to be called by comparing the values for both the item id and the number of runsie if itemidblueprint and runsinfinate then iconitemidbpo if itemidblueprint and runsinfinate then iconitemidbpc

blasters need a serious boost and this would be it
if you want to get nitpicky then yes but this is before taking into account any realistic setup as i said in my previous reply it does not make any sense missing another battleship 1km length from 1km away particularly when using a dedicated close range weapon that is the crux of my argumenti gave some examples from the basic tracking guide please feel free to have a play around and youll see that compared to the hit chance for long range weapons at their optimal short range weapons ie blasters and autocannons are hit by the lack of effective target size in the tracking formula now this wasnt a problem with 90 webs as everyone was stationary i repeat the web change was in my opinion a good one but closerange ships need some help that a simple tracking boost alone will not provide recall ship velocities in operational range went up by a factor 400 now that combat is more fluid at short ranges correcting for size vs distance is not intended to make eve more realistic if you follow through the technical thread i linked you would see that for realism you would go down a somewhat different route this is simply aimed at boosting closerange weapons without going back to anything within web range dies  with regards to large closerange guns frigates for example would still be completely untouched cruisers would still be able to mitigate some damage but you wouldnt want to go in solo vs a close rangebattleship for example battlecruisers and above would be taking nearly full damage except for large transversal velocities inside of 2km
he is using math but no logic as to why it should be tracking does not need changed to reduce the advantages that low tracking weapons have in the close range in short there is no reason to buff pulse lasers

couldnt have said it better than myself wait i did just not as eloquentlynicely said
you know in the march release im sure i read something about mysterious wormholes to other reagionsi actually think that empire space would be more interesting with a bit more traffic outside jita so long as the servers could hack it that is but ccp seem to know whats going on in that area
cant appear to find the finalised meeting minutes  they available yet
we got the ccp version today undergoing some minor tweaking so hopefully due later today
evil  im somewhat on the fence on your proposal and so is the playerbase it seems while you do have 54 supports you also have 135 replies in total of which about 20 are you bumping the thread and most of the rest against it basically a 5050 split after you take into account the people who also supported without a thumbs up convince more people to give it a thumbs up and ill consider backing it
i already gave my opinion in the thread i will also vote no for such suggestion should anybody from the csm pick it up
please add minmatar  balance to the issues list will write document when i get home
i havent had time to brush up the mission timer topic nor work out further details and integrate player feedback so i rather pass it till next meeting as the reactions have shown quite a few good suggestions but also a bit of criticism which i need to find a solution for
no
so constructive i guess if all else fails just disagree without reasoni will say i do like that quote about not being paranoid
1 i dont think its a bad idea per se i just dont think enough people think its a good idea for me to champion it which leads on to2 just because other people are willing to champion things with less support doesnt mean i will theres 7 other csms who may take up the cause with this amount of support lavista has already said no but at this point i wont if one of those csms brought the issue up for a vote then i would look at it like every other issue brought up and vote accordingly
its a good idea and here is a suggestionccp could give each character a certain code so even if you change the name of your character the buddy list and stuff will automaticly change it to the right name so you wount get any misleads in your buddy list allso if someone was to change that name how would it still exist as a charater when it doesnt belong to anyone djust my 2 cents for help towards the character name change
i was against this but after the arguments found here i am for this as long as the cost increases per name change and the name change is listed in the players information sheet somewhere viewable by everyonei dont see a whole lot of people doing this as it would mess with your killboard stats this would be a nice option for fcs that find themselves instaprimary or people named aaaa that always get insta primaried in fleet fights 
what is the magic number of supports before you champion an idea this thread has 142 posts and 57 supports i went through all 5 pages and lost count at around 50 posts made by people who already ticked support so it is more like 92 posts and 57 suports which is a very good numberthis topic is much more supported than factional warfare complex spawning that got three total replies or a useless change like adding dumb stripes to medalsso what you are saying is that this topic is more popular and supported by more players than lots of other topics but you do not wish to support it because you are too much of a  to take a side you represent the people of eve and talk to ccp for us if the people of eve support adding in elves to eve then that is what you bring up if you do not wish to listen to the people and champion the peoples ideas then gtfo out of the csm
i am glad people do not let this up it has been years and ccp pretty much ignored and swept it under the rug the pos as it is now needs to be reexamined and revamped honestly they cant screw it up the ccp that is they can no simply because it is so screwed up already that making it worse would be like going back to 2004 anyway all people who need this whatever their affiliation might be should contact the csm they have voted for and support the pos overhaul point them to these boards you know just in case they are too busy and forgot about the funny pos thing as ccp has called
i support this issue mainly because it should have been done like 1 year ago and ccp dropped the ball on this issue and sov in general
what about drone mods any news on this yet
the underlined bits are priceless so basically what you are telling us the players of eve many of whom voted for you is this dont rock the boat truly priceless you do not want to risk a relationship with ccp just listen to yourself for a second whom do you represent ccp or the players of eve this is truly an example of being too comfortable and now that you know you will not be going to the next csm you tell us the truth your relationship with ccp is more important to you than what your duties as the csm why would you even say such a thing why would you even come out and admit that csm has no ability whatsoever to represent the players because if we go by your statements csm does not want to risk it furthermore you are comparing a polite and pointed demands that people have been aiming at ccp regarding this issue to a behavior of a spoiled child you joking right this has been going on for years now over two years has passed and i have not seen one flame one troll from the community  the only reason you would say something like this is to reduce the validity of the need for the pos rewamp spoiled children really the developers did not even give csm a time of day on this issue they chose to call it a funny pos thing and all you are doing is reiterating the point that reduces a significant issue by renaming it thus proving all those people on forums who say that csm has no ability to do anything whatsoever they cant even garner respect from ccp to call an issue what it is a pos problem and resort to the diminutive and reductive lexical semantics of the funny pos thing lv i know you are not running for the next csm and you had my support for the two terms that you have served and i know ccp refusing you entry due to your age but i am afraid from the above statements your age does show you did not think things through before you posted and painted yourself into a corner i am afraid i do not know what you meant to say but what you did say was pretty much this ccp is a big daddy i want big daddy to love me and i want him to love me better so i will take the big daddys side even if it means going against other kids and it does not matter that the other kids are the ones who asked me to help them with the big daddy because he was not so nice to themthe pos has to become a priority to ccp it has been a huge drain on resources and just patching the code does not work if it is impossible to patch the code then ccp should start working on the new code what a concept i know and when the new code for pos is ready implement it csm should keep this alive for a simple fact that pos  as it is  affects pretty much everyone in the game and making it better more streamlined more user friendly more believable will only improve the game in the long run ccp is happy to spend their time on all sorts of things why not dedicate a small team to slowly trudge and make a pos better because i guess they do not have to deal with the pos garbage every day and it is easier to have a defective if working pos than to actually have a fully functional structure in place well i really hope csm would stop being ccps lap dog and show some backbone otherwise i would say the whole thing was an exercise in futility so far the important stuff csm has failed at it oh and it is nice to be back after a month away from eve
so what is it going to take to get some csm support on this issue
importableexportable block listits harrassing to block the same people 2 or 3 times or more   and theres just too many scammers so its harrassing to block them on every char   so it would be nice to be able to exportimport the block list fromto other charactersopinions 
as long as its easy to implement sure
first off an interesting article i am one of the people that see macro mining as a problem why well i see a big feature of eve is its player based economy when people are able to mine vast amounts with no limits they can create a monopoly over ore prices minerals etc monopolies are not allowed in most real life countries so i think in a game with a market based aspect their should be at least some measures to at least make them harder to pull off monopolies shaft people and most players get shafted by macro mining regardless of whether or not people have access to macro mining programs not all people will have the best resources to run a pc 23 hours a day with the client open playing on a family computer for example so what do they say i happen to be in group of people that use macro miners they usually pull up this comment from the link at the beginning of my replyso this is what i think would be a good first step see if we can get ccp to revise the eulathat way there will be at least some clarity of it being not okay if newer players are told that macro mining is okay by their friend and shown the current section 7 of the eula it probably wont help the problem sure its not going to get all macro miners bannedetchowever this might be a helpful first step in the right direction just for ideas sake heres the similar statement from the wow eulaeve online eula
so if you are truly macrohunting and someone reacts as you stated above calling you names etc would you apologize for the gank and reimburse him for his lost equipment insert laughter here you may apologize but the reimbursement would most likely be out of the question
if the queue comes in the form of certificates it would be like ccp laughing out loud in your faceit would prolly make me rage quit
as much as i hate to say itthis seems pretty accurate
the csm is the dummyhand at the bridge table i will not waste effort in here again fly safe
so what happened i have been gone a month and since then ccp did not even have pip come out to the public is csm pushing for the detailed information regarding what happened or what anyone knows what the deal is other than the polite noises from csm and ccp and has this become a dead issue as well simply because ccp knows if they keep quiet long enough we will just go away okie dokie
please just read the minutes it says clearly that by the end of januarystart of february a detailed devblog will be released
well gee whiz i had no idea that all you had to do in the csm was make ginormous posts about such important topics i have experience doing things like that too doncha know maybe i should use my abilities as a maverick to bring some fresh blood into the csm next time the election rolls around ive got some great ideas that can really change new eden around like banning that nasty pax amarria book and making podding illegal its too much like abortion dont forget to vote for me next time the election is hereoh and ankhewhateveryournameis you dont seem too popular id stop sounding so carebearish go and take a lesson from ronald reagan and maybe you can be a maverick like me
im encountering the same issues  ccp seem to want everyone to take sides so the prevalence of faction missions is much higher than it used to be but its not just the standing loss its the lack of bounties that i dont like plus many of the faction missions ive tried are insane smash the suppliers level 4 is the most difficult mission ive come across and even with a couple of buddies to help out we couldnt do itid like to see faction missions to only become available from certain agents say intelligence if someone chooses to do them thats fine i personally prefer missions with bounties as i dont usually bother to salvage some added flexibility in choosing missions would be welcome  wanting to do combat and getting courier or mining missions is very frustrating ccp should check their stats on which missions are being turned down the most oh and i hope that these new epic mission arcs arent all faction missions
i rejectno seriously missioning mechanics are generally fine except standing mechanics for 00 factions say you have been living in low sechi sec and you want to make a natural move on your career and go to 00 but you notice you have 10 standings for every pirate faction except mordus maybe who have like 1 level 4 agent which means missioning in 00 is pretty closed for you forever i think this is a bit of a real problem there if any
gas missionsyou show you know nothing about gas missions you are not allowed to use more than 1 harvester 425 bits of gas 1 bit every 30 seconds thats 2125 minutes or 3541666666 hours for a single mission that pays no better than a 90 minute mining mission if you use an industrial ship you can go non stop if you use a smaller ship you must add in drop offs at the local station and dont forget if you jet can it you can loose your can in 2 hours lots of funstarting any mission before down timemining missions being done partially before down time are a bad thing because at dt the mission resets and you have to start alllllllllllllllllllll overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrragents giving wrong mission typesthis is a personal pet peeve of mine im the corp industrialist i can l3 kill mission but id rather l4 mining missions why would an industrial agent mining or manufacturing need a kill mission doneundesired faction missionseve is a sand box why are you being so negative on someone elses sand box everyone has the right to play any way they choose within the rules and if having good faction with all factions is someones goal that is their choice i support the portion where an agent should give the missions that they are set to give and not other genre ie security agents should not give mining missions and mining agents should not give security missions ideamy suggestion on this would be to have perhaps scaling with your faction to the npc agents corp a list of missions the agent needs to get done examplerating  missions offered426384maybe even a ticker where you can accept all 4 missions or 1 or 2 i understand this is nothing easily implemented but it is something that would be beneficial in the future
on a slightly different tangentwhy is it that when i am accepting or finishing or refusing the mission i am told what i am saying vsing having a choicei do not enjoy telling my favorite agent yeah this sucked but heres your ore give me my iskoptions would be nice 1 yeah i got there first heres the ore how much isk were you able to squeeze out of them 2 meh it was okay i had some trouble but made it back with the goods3 horrible dont send me there again
no instead you are moving it to an anything within 1km diesit is supposed be nothing moving within 1km dies so as they say working as inteneded
as i stated in the other thread it provides a larger boost to those weapons designed for sub 5km range ie blasters and autocannons its perfectly logical for a closer target to be easier to hit
negative frigates class hulls will not be touched by this cruisers will still have a damage reduction particularly if using for example tracking disrupters battlecruisers and battleships however are far too large to miss at 1km rangedoes the 0m effect count as working as intended  probably not
fool the effects of tracking will still work as intended and making it difficult to hit targets that are moving fast and neartransversal velocity however the target should not effectively shrink because of the games in inability to understand how a firing arc actually needs to increase when the distance reducesin other words objects in the eve do not apaear to be bigger when you get closer to them instead thay effectively shrinking in size a typical school maths revision guide on our the behaviour of angles and perspective view will end the matter
tldr  how does i not hit 
imbalance is never logical
what imbalance 
he will eliminate the weakness of low tracking weapons at close range
original threadbackgroundnbsi and nrds are the two most common roe employed by sovholder alliances in evenot blue shoot it is often used because marshalling standings to badguys and protecting your assets and locals is hard with unidentified ships running aroundnot red dont shoot the another option available but its very difficult to punish the right bad apples and not shoot innocents its also a constant pain to adjust standings to small corps and even individual pilots who are abusing the sovholders nrds policynrds promotes alot of good things like trade freedom of movement and generally makes 00 more accessible to the broad public combined with rattingfarming contractsdeals and dockingrights it also generates income for the sovholders so why isnt it used moretwo major factors encourage nbsi over nrds as the easy way out 1 standings are hard to keep updated properly especially in large areas with alot of different neutral corps operating on a daily basis pirates and other unknown entities needs to be detected visually and hunted down manually and they can easily hide among true neutrals in a system 2 nrds means less targets to shoot at and increases the chance of hostile spies running around uncontested the goalto make the game more dynamic and increasing the level of interaction between playersbypopulating 00 by making it more accessiblegiving industrialists even very small corps a better chance to experience 00giving pirates and pvpers new fun challangesmaking sovholding alliances appear more like true powerful factions rather than greedy backscratcher corpsambitious maybe but keep reading
my suggestionintroduce new tools to encourage alliances and corps to choose a nrds like stance and open up their space for more playersthe toolsautomatic standings an alliance style secstatus with parameters set by the sovholders pilots and gangs who do bad stuff in the sov areas are flagged as red to the sovholders like in empire the thresholds are determined by the sovholders it could be anything from agressing neutrals or entering forbiddenoff limit systems stealing cargo or putting up too large market orders on specific items opening cynofields or being reported by sovholding personel with sufficient roles like security officers depending on the transgression it would result in different kinds of flags like temporary or permanent secstatusstandings loss in the end resulting in different responses from the pilots in the sovholding alliance fees and taxes different kinds of fees and taxes like gatefees jumpbridge fees and dockingfees ignoring a fee at a gate and jumping in anyway would result in a criminal flagging towards the sovholding corp tax on stationtrading depandant on the standing of the pilotcorpalliance markets market access controlled by the sovholders by dynamic taxes in relation to standings to prevent unrealistic hostile market action since the sovholders should be able to govern the market as they do their space licenses sellable licenses that are bound to the pilotcorpalliance receiving them a license could allow access to a certain system or systems dockingrights at certain stations rights to trade certain goods or items permission to shoot neuts or reds or blues whatever the sovholders allow within the sovholding alliance territory pos setup you name it licenses would be timelimited andor revokable at any time by the issuing alliance billboards and information anchorable billboards andor automatic messages transmitted to pilots in or entering sovheld systems for example explaining the rules and directing visitors different tools would be available at different sov levelsmy thoughtstools like the ones above would allow sovholding alliances to have both neutrals and pirates roaming around in their systems industrial players would have the chance to enjoy 00 while being protected by a sovholding alliance without the regular hassle of rent and obligations to pewpew for their masters pirates and evildoers would be rewarded with target rich environments and instead of being hunted by concord or lose empire secstatus they could get fun fights by real breathing playerssovholding alliances would be competing against eachother to provide the best service and securest space for the neuts and war between alliances would get alot more interesting since it encourages smaller fleets on disruption missions and the stakes are even higher than beforethis of course is all optional these are only tools to encourage a more breathing living 00 the regular nbsi stance would still be available even a mixed nbsi nrds stance could be chosen for different systems and areasthis could also integrated in whatever new sovsystem ccp has on the drawingboardit would not affect secstatus or dealings in empire or other areas of 00 and alliance and corp standings would overrule the parameters set by the sovholders 10 would always be 10edit oh the end
i think i see what your asking forit sounds like an overhaul to the standing system in generalwould a lot of what you ask for game mechanics wise not be solved if standing had some visibility improvements so you could change standings with corps players alliances and the options would be private personal public the private would be invisible to the receiver and no collateral impact the personal would only have impact on the receiver and not further up the public would have derivative impact all the way through the standing systemthe back and fourth of such a dynamic system would also make it possible to datamine and use infiltration as a method to enter player sov regions flying false flagswith something like this setup from players would have more meaning and would create more game while making things easier to govern out in sov spacei would expect something like that to ease the workload on a combat perspective but increase the interaction needs and trust relations governings morethis would also kick at player behaviour in an interesting waysigned because it kicks the beehive figuratively speaking
i see what youre going for as a member of an independent corp in 00 that is normally the neutral in the nbsi equation is a very enticing however i dont know despite the difficulties of being constantly hunted and shot at i truely enjoy 00 as the honest simple free alternative to the mess of standings and rules that exist in high and low sec its hard for me to endorse any idea that clouds the clarity of 00 even one that seems to benefit me
no need to worry most will still shoot you but it would be nice for the nrds people to have some more options
good read my friend
as i started reading this i had thoughts of oh great here it comes another stupid ideabut honestly im stunned this is a well thought out and very ambitous ideathe only draw back is takes a lot of effort to implement this systemyou have my thumb sirand best of luck getting supportsigned
this basically id imagine that most alliances wont use this but for the ones who do itd be seriously useful a surprisingly good and interesting idea
with the upcoming release of t3 and the previous patches i fear faction ships are becoming more and more irrelevant i would love to see a boost to their abilities as it would be a great shame to see these ships fade into obscurityi would like to propose changes to these ships so they remain viable in pvp one of these changes would be to the vindicator and its mwd bonus which is more than pointless i think it would be nice to see a boost to resistance dps and other areas to ensure people keep making videos with them for years to come
would it not be wiser to wait and see how t3 will be like and to observe which influence it will have before making wild assumptionswith the upcoming release of x insert anything vague and mostly unknown i fear that y insert anything unforeseeable will happen lets change y so that my fear will turn into someone elses nightmare 
yes i love it when people say kill tech 2 omg hax pos exploit tech 2 ftltech 3 is coming read the bloody news posts do the research good things coming this way dont put the cart before the horseyou just might be surprisedcomplain after you have something tangible to complain aboutdont always assume ccp is going to screw up they do a rather good job imho let im do itps not tying to come off as a hairy troll just a bit snippy this morning hehe need my quafe or something
t3 has nothing to do with it subbs faction ships need an overhaulpirate ships need more pgcpuprice needs to be substantial reduced especially on frigates t2 ships are cheaper and more effectivedramiel needs another turretguardian angel ships may need their bonuses changesfrigates need to not all be split weapon systems hookbill worm comet dramiel all suffer from thisalso it would be nice if nonfaction versions of the frigates were introduced and possibly pirate cruisersbss as they are some of the best models in the game say you buy the bpo through the lp store to make a tier 5 frigate racial frigate 5 but no supporting skills to bridge the t1t2 gap for the standard faction ships and tier 4 for the pirate racial frigate 4 for both races i think this would be the only way to ever make the cruor viable
problem is that ecm is all those ships have if you nerf ecm even a little bit they become like one volley bunching bags ecm ships have no mentionable ability to tank anything theyre slow and possess no real mentionable offensive capabilitieswhen you talk about nerfing ecm you could as well speak about nerfing ie webs or neuts also at least curse and rapier are wtfpwnage in very similar amount than falcon is and they can actually hurt people
well looking at contracting i thought about why logistics might be an issuewhy not try and increase the number of outstanding couriers allowedso in effect couriers cost say 110th of other contractsi think more courier missions would be made this way and more would go into hauling because filling the trucks would be more likely
editdidnt notice you where talking about missionsthey should pay much more and should be categorized in there own departmentnot forced upon someone doing a ton of combatnothing says haha when you get a shipping mission flying a battleship
are you talking about courier contracts or courier missions you seem to be discussing both please clarify
yes i was talking about contracts not missionsmore possible outstanding contracts could increase its usage
penalize overkill  reward fair playthe lack or decreasing frequency of small gang and small ship pvp is something bemoaned by many players and since there is a symptomatic relation between the reasons for the decline and the natural reaction to the very concept itself it can only be revitalized if there is an actual reason to do iti have thought about that for a while without any conclusions but then i had an idea which i want to shareone thing that motivates players apart from doing it just for the sake of doing it is profitprofit can be made in many ways of course and some ways are salvage and loot from your enemymy concept is to introduce the concept of dynamic circumstantial calculation into the makeup of both loot and salvage through the concept of overkillwhen a large ship blazes away its cannon are supposed to shred huge holes into the enemy smashing anything they hit apart and eventually blowing the enemy ship to pieces a battleship that destroys a frigate will likely not leave much of anything behind imagine what happens when you shoot a commuter car with a howitzer there will be little to nothing left to loot or salvage just an area littered with smoking pieceshowever if the same commuter car is effectively destroyed by small arms fire like a goon with machinegun there will be a lot left to be salvaged and lootedthe inclusion of such a mechanism might be a small part of the bigger picture of reducing overkill at least when the involved parties act with a sense of magnitudedestroying something using a smaller ship and smaller weapons should leave more behind to loot and salvageand i dont mean that the final blow should count ccp could probably add a max salvage value to all ships and have that value decrease in proportion to each hit like a hidden hp stat that is affected by the sheer magnitude of damage not by the added totaleven if it should fail to provide the necessary incentive for increased small ship use all by itself it may easily be a factor eventually and it will provide added reward for sportsmanshipthe same could and should be true for missions blasting enemies that are hopelessly outgunned and outclassed would result in less loot and salvage reward than doing missions in smaller ships where the mission provides an actual challenge and risknow you can rip it apart
i dont really see how this should help smaller gangs and maybe its just my impression but the most pvpers out there are doing it for the fun of it rather than for the loot or salvage
i like the motivational aspect of this postit goes to the core of what i believe is a balance flaw in eveyou point at salvage and loot tables and how they could be integrated better into the players activities i could not agree morethe most refined way to implement this would be to let the destruction of ships npc and player be the balncer of access to items and everything elsei am unsure if this to some extend is attempted to hardcodemy take would be that when a ship of any type is destroyed each item should be rolled for and its chance to survive be based on how many of that item is active in the entire universe its chance should also be compared to that items donchian avg and thus the combat of smaller ships would potentially be a price balancing activitysalvaging would be the same thing the different type of salvaged goods would be based on availability of the item and that items trading value so smaller ships spawned lower end salvaged goods and bigger ships the higher priced salvagefrom ccp side they should have a general idea of how much of the different items they prefer are in the world but the above type of system would end up rather self governing if the price and trade volumes was a factorthe precise mechanics would most likely need some tweaking but in the end it should become a powerfull and effective solution to the whole loot table problemsupported by principle
to me the most important thing about this is to both punish excessive use of force and to reward those who restrict their use of such forceif you want to capture something for its value you dont blow it to smithereens ccp themselves said that they consider elements of surgical warfare for future expansions and this could be part of thatin a certain way this would also address the issue some players have with empire afk mission runners it would be a lot less profitable to afk run missions in a passive tanked ship that fires away with brutally oversized warheads at small and medium targets on the other hand using drones would gain advantage as a tradeoff for the immensely increased risk of salvage ninjas through the fact that drones do their damage in small portions instead of huge strikesmaybe some day in the distant future we might even get different wreck models where a dominix destroyed by small guns looks like the original ship crossbred with a swiss cheese and the same ship destroyed by cruise missiles stealth bombs and extra large artillery looks more like the cloud of debrissupporting my own concept of course
i dig it
yes
i would love thisbut some issues would come ie you want to dock quickly cause a dude is pursuing you and the security code ruins your docking speed loland the annoying factor maybe asking for a code each 30 minutes and you can update it whenever you want so it doesnt come just when you are in a pvp fight for example it also needs to be placed on a not annoying part of screen and must be small
they have to change the sovereignty system first before they can go after macro ice miners 00 would collapse without themas for regular macro miners so much of the economy is based off of them that they might have to increase miningrefining yields to consider banning them
exactly make all the yields 2x and ban the macroers solved
where do you want these added
wrongthe prefix meta except when used by ccp UFFFD la metalevel refers to one level of description up thus metaknowledge is knowledge about knowledge metaconversation is a conversation about conversation and so on it derives from the greek prefix meaning after fun fact metaphysics is so called because aristotle wrote about it before writing after writing about physicsyou seem to be under the impression that meta refers to something simply outside the game in reality the metagame is the game that occurs about the game  alts spying balance issues etc no stocks and iposalso you suck at concise explanations of what you are trying to sayedit dammit goumindong beat me to it reading the whole thread before posting an exasperated and intentionally condescending reply ftw
he is more right than you are icarus much more right the prefix meta means beyond the metagame is the game within the game
let see if i can clear this up in a short and concise fashionmy use of the term metagame is on point this also in regards to ipo and stocks because as a feature ccp has added only a skeleton and the players have had to govern everything else somehow i am beginning to see a few advantages in thiswhen i am talking about balance issues and go in every direction its because the missing features are of an emergent nature it will shift things maybe a bit to fast and not in the intended direction what will happen if we get a working npc interbus hauling systemwe might all agree that the logistics are a bit of a pain but to easy solutions might nerf the game beyond repair that is why i want to ask for a debate on these issues my personal take is that the motivational tools are shifted poorly i find it strange that pointing this out brings such an oppositionwhat about the oil and refinery and energy consumption parallel is hard to understandif 00 is not operating in fashions akin to real life our intuitive behaviour will be wrongif bureaucracy and capitalism isnt mainly in secure high populated areas things are a bit askewed i know its just a game and entertainment should be king but bending this to be just a scifi space shooter is not the intention of the ccp as far as i am informed after watching the fanfest videos i am quite sure about this so i was posting to open discussionwho knows someone might have some extremely simple and great solutions to these thinseve is the best virtual world simualtor around these days because in here stuff actually matter and its not a casual game experience but a lasting and life demanding onethis simulation will improve if the mechanics of ressources are tweaked no matter if that is stuff manpower or currencyfix corp standing mechanismlet stocks be traded on scc marketmake more access levels to the api to customize allowed outside access audit of corpslet players rent npc stationsfix all npc facilities prices to react by supply and demandmake system standing dynamic and even to the point where players can have 00 made secure by pulling in concord push pull of securityhave maps updated about changes in sec rating nice colored ones to in effect show where the pvp swarms move aboutthings of high tech should be build in empire space to remove risks no shipyards in real life could survive placement in a warzone exception might exist in regards to warships considered secret projectsi hope these examples give an idea to what i am thinkingnb i am all for 00 space i just seriously think it should be for the excitement and not the long lasting economic powerplay because then eve will never get a good wealth distribution in its simulation
are you sure it isnt because you have no clue what youre trying to saythis is irrelevant to whether or not its game or metagame my point about your use of metagame was irrelevant to whether or not youre using it wrong
editscrew it i give up
there are a few threads about suggestions to some changes to missioningi would just ask if the following idea would not solve a few of these issuesreducing expiration penalty on standing to a rather low valueletting the cancellation of missions not yet accepted be governed by a skillso unskilled once every 4 hours level 1 1 every 3 hours lvl 2 1  2h etc and level 5 once every 30 minutesalso in addition to this letting mission runners be able to contact about mission offers remotely also based on a skill one similar to market rangea feature needed would be rightclicking the agent in people and places and set course the same way you can with an active agent when you dock at station and have an active missionsome balance tweaks might be needed afterward to clean up the increased work on missioningbut basically this would be offering options much along the lines of selecting missions
i think it is rather moot to discuss details of mission running at this time because as far as i have read ccp is doing a massive expansion of mission running we will have to see how that works out to see how changes would fit inthe ability do deny a mission remotely would be of help in any case thoughfew days ago i flew a mission in khanid then i headed back home to gallente space 24 jumps the very moment i arrived in my home station that cramparsed storyline agent in khanid decided that he wanted to offer me a storyline mission i had to make 24 jumps back and forth just to tell him to hide in a bush and frell himselfwhen agents can contact you via mail to make an offer it should be a polite option to deny them the same waywhen it comes to skills that decrease the time for turning down a mission i am completely against it it would be an economic desaster using 12 characters in a hub area that has multiple high level agents it would become far too easy to farm for the best missions farming missions is a serious issue because empire already makes it very easy to make loads of money if i could run twice as many angel extras and assaults it would roughly increase my net yield by 30 minimum a lot of impact for the kind of skill you are suggestingif you are picky about your missions be picky about it being picky is a personal disadvantage that has consequences when i say i do not eat chicken pork shrimp or veggies i lose a lot of options when faced with a preset buffet it is my decision though i should not complain when all i am left with is rice and potatoes or the time it takes to wait for the pizza delivery service

problem with blackops is that theyre way too overpriced to be used in pvp they lack scan resolution to tackle anything theyre bs size and now even more slower than they were if they were to be used in pvp they should be made useful for that instead of being funny big alliance boy toys being able to jump into cynojammed system is only useful for very limited number of blackops pilots mostly for funny ncgoongbc etc lolguys say hi for blobs whole jump drive in blackops is only needed for going around megacamps blackops is still a cloaking bs able to go through gates the problem is that fuel takes whole cargo space making it so that you cant really fit any fuel on board tbh oh and jump portal if you get someone to make a covert cyno for you it means the path is totally possible to make through with covopsrecon so why any need for cynoing in more if they just can flyi cry when i see threads like this
is someone going to take up the missile nerf complaint
sorry to post this here guys buti have an idea for ccp on this matter with the problem u quoted in your postccp could give each character a certain code so even if you change the name of your character the buddy list and stuff will automaticly change it to the right name so you wount get any misleads in your buddy list allso if someone was to change that name how would it still exist as a charater when it doesnt belong to anyone djust my 2 cents for help towards the character name change
