so what youre saying is that if i decided anyone who visits jita sucks and sit there all day handing out bounties thats not stupidif i decide that anyone who dares ask for or give help in a help channel sucks and hand out boutnies all day thats not stupidif i decide that all forum users are lame and start handing out bounties cause i saw their name on the forum thats not stupidif i decide that anyone who does not have bounty should get one and start posting bounties on anyone who does not have one thats not stupidwhy is that not stupidi could go on but i think you get the idea a single troll could have an impact on a multitude of players
hence this thread and my attempt to have an actual debate about the  thanks for the major on your post after i responded to it
to me itd be stupid what you believe is none of my business but ill still kill the people you placed a bounty on if its high enoughsee aboveagain your prerogative and i have personally done this from time to timeif you have the cash and think your reason is good enough go for iteverything is relativesubjectiveand if a single troll can stir up  and cause chaos mayhem andor a war by placing bounties everywhere excellent more players are interacting and in conflict with one another
your counter argument is reasonable and much appreciated i will give it some thought
hereyour reply implied exactly that and stated i was was incorrect because of that implication i meant contacting corps directly as thats how we do things right nowyes and your whole premiss is based on you deciding what is and isnt a good bounty from this premiss spawned the new contract system that you are now pushing its doesnt have much in the way of details so im asking about iti was you avoided answering that question it was directed at your new contract idea why would i know about how concord would interact in this system its your idea isnt it down to you to flesh it outwhat does it matter its not your place to decide that its not your place to dictate who can and cant do what with their own isk and the just because someone picks your ideas apart and asks questions you dont find easy to answer doesnt make them a troll that argument as well as avoiding answering question is a very weak stance to take you either have faith in what you are discussing or you dontdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
again incorrect i was referring to you not comprehending my multiple previous post talking about the mercs and the morph of the discussion of the threadyou only want extreme details so you can pick them apart for flaws without trying to be objective i am trying to be objective youre not im not going to nor could anyone come to a 100 viable solution without asking for input if you see a hole why not offer a suggestion failing that we know you hate my idea thats fine most people do good for youif you actually read the thread and this just proves that you didnt no more responses for you sorry you could clearly see that this was not my idea and i made it point to say so i merely liked the idea any refinement of details should be done as a combination of ideas from multiple players no one is going to get anywhere if people cant help others out with refining their ideas like i said it is impossible for a single person to come to something 100 viable without asking for and getting inputyou are just cause you are on the side of defending the existing system doesnt mean you arent deciding it is the responsibility of the player base hence this forumim just getting sick of answer things over and over and having to rephrase thing specifically so you can comprehend them how about before you click post you click preview and scroll through the thread just a thought or do i need to tell you how to use more than one tab in your browser and what browser to use and what a tab isthank you for your time believe it or not it is appreciated though you get no more of minewhy you proved to me you did not read the entire threadplease refer to post 27 and the following statementits your idea isnt it down to you to flesh it out
yes i am aware you had the suggestion from another player semantics youve added it to your idea pool the specific question related to concords involvement in that idea i would imagined a person with such a high intellect as yours would have some opinion on whether they would be excluded or not i guess you are right and comprehension of that intellect was somewhat lackingit still boils down the the same bad premiss which is what you have decided is and isnt a good reason for a bounty i personally dont give a sht why people do it it adds to the gamelet me ask you this although im sure youll avoid it alsowould you object to the placement of a bounty just out of random feelings of spitedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
spitepeople gave me a bounty for many reasons none because i am bad or was bad to them some thought my bounty to low so they helped it out others as a show of supporti doubt any isk in my bounty is spiteful nor did i commit any crimes to achieve itmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
that may be true but i do have reason to ask him that question it goes back to when we all had this discussion and im interested in his replydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
just out of common curtosy i will reply to you one last time unless you rather discusswhat do you think about concord intevention if the contract system was allowed to hirer killersdo you even support allowing the contract system to be used to place a bounty on someone which i have always wanted to see i think the contract system could use a few additions which i will post in the features  ideas section in the futurenot at all i just destroyed someone cyno frig just because i can they had plenty of time to runi have left my home constellation and now im exploring the more dangerous ares of eve in an attempt to better relate to the pirate playersimo the because i can bounties should not be part of the same system as the ones that get the top pirate players faces posted on billboards around the universealso if a person wants to become the top pirate in the universe i think they should have to earn it and wtf why can i put a bounty on myself if i had to complain about just one thing that would be it it doesnt allow the top pirate pilot to be on the most wanted list it allows the richest pirate to have his face plastered on the wanted boards if he so chooses
well if they would allow for skill respecialization it would atleast need serious consequencesfor example if you would like to unlearn skill like mining barge you would be refunded only 50 or even less of the skill points you spent learning on itthis would be only way i would maybe allow it
im by no means asking for local in null to be changedremoved to match wormhole space merely pointing out that the current mechanics are the root cause behind both afk cloaking and hot droppingso let me get this straight the conditions are so different because wormhole players actively keep their eyes open via probes and dscan rather than being lazy and relying on a mechanic that can be devalued  spoofed via afking have fits that are more appropriate for the situations ie not minmaxed pve fits are sufficiently organized sounds to me like wormhole players have the right idea then they know theyre not in a little happy safe farm zone
whats the risk in looking at the local list to determine who is in system and how many friends they have
to be honest this is a very silly idea boarder lining stupidwhat fights are you expecting in a highsec belt all this does it make it that much easier for gankers to find targets making it easier for them to get an easy killonce again another idea that only helps one part of the game but hurts the others mining is tough enough for the people that do it it pays little has a ton of risk and the miners dont need something like this to make it worst this will cause more miners to go switch to something else or worst unsub since they cant pay their plex fees if less miners are mining that means less ore to buy to build ships how i earn my isk which means less ships on the markets for pvpers stop trying to make mining worst and maybe submit some ideas that help make it a worthy profession again
i have run several low sec missions and i do agree they mosty suck the pay out isnt worth the risk but making trade routes go through low sec would never work the empires patrol those areas and they arent going to give them up anytime soon because that would be a loss of territory what low sec needs is a reason to be there fw has plexs that only show up in fw low sec it gives people a reason to be there giving some missions for pirate factions would be somthing that could bring people into low sec to run missions to get enough lp for that pirate hull but low sec as it is its not worth the risk when you can just run missions in high sec then buy the hulllow sec ore is a joke jaspet is pretty much worthless its huge comes in limited amounts and you can make more in the same time mining veld now if jaspet was the only ore that gave zydrine there would be a huge reason to go into low but you would have to take ore from null and everyone knows you cant touch anything in null sec because its end game blah blah blah etcunless ccp is willing to make changes low sec will always be pirate havens and ghost townsmaybe let alliances stick up sov beacons in low i know its a crazy idea but if you can claim the space your more likely to defend it fw low sec has tons of fights because people are fighting to hold on to it it means something to them
highsec is entirely selfsufficient its not a closed community because there are things it lacks and there are things it provides that other places lackwormhole space will never be a closed gate community because it will always provide tech 3 components to the rest of new eden dont get me wrong i dont think that wspace should have anything close to everything available i think there should be tons of juicy things that you cant get in wspace at all but that doesnt mean it should not be possible to subsist alone in wspace it is possible to subsist alone absolutely everywhere else why not wspace too
thats why there are static wormholes you cant cut yourself off that is what makes eve unique also not having to play with other people is sort of an eve online and star wars the old republic thing not very many other mmos allow that
please link dev blog where it says that empire space is getting refining nerf spread your fud elsewhere
no dev blog but there is much talk about equalizing empire because it has too many players and making too munch moneyeven ccp soundwave mentions in this interview he thinks are too good
the amount of money made in empire is not what this is aboutthis is about the fact that every part of new eden has some sort of ice except wormholes every part of new eden can close its self off and ignore the outside world except wormholes giving wormholes ice will not break the game it will not cause the massive power blocks to shift nor will it cause the all mighty jita to tremble giving wormholes ice allows players that live in a wormhole to exist there just a slight bit easier it is a small thing that would make the game alot more fun and go towards cooling tempers it lets wormhole dwellers provide their own fuel it gives non combat pilots in alliances something to do while they are inside the wormhole it gives more targets to shoot at for combat pilots in a wormhole you dont have to worry about the ice getting brought into empire to hurt the market since compression is terrible and we can only get 75 max yield from our refineries this idea doesnt hurt anyone but helps alot of people
i endorse the idea of adding our smart filters to the overview and allowing more contextual sorting if we get to work on the overview in the near future this would be the kind of thing i would want to do to improve iti also hope our new ship group icons will eventually make it into the overview allowing players to read instantly what type of ships are around them but first we need to make sure they are good enough in a feature that isnt as critical as the overivew so once we have released them in some way or form and evaluated their usefulness then i would want to see them used in the tactical overlay and the overiewccp arrow  director of user experience  eve online  ccparrow
the ship info panels could be helpful but not if they interrupt quick selection in the overview windowi think the icons for the shiptype we are seeing on the overview should be reworked the destroyer icon is too large and they are in general too vague to draw much frombuilding on a previous picture it would be nice if the icons depended on the hull size as they pretty much do currently but with the added bonus of looking fairly distinctive for each hull size my mockup isnt that great but it should be reasonable to illustrate how distinctive each icon on the overview for player ships should be
ccp arrow please look at this thing  supreme commander strategic iconsthis is a list of strategic icons in the rts supreme commanderthis is how it looks like ingame  zoomed out viewas you can see this is very easy to read any semicompetent player will notice where the blue defensive line is what the attacking forces units arejust imagine goonswarms tengus trapezoids supported by huginns diamonds scimitars squares and some interceptors acute isoceles triangles because theyre fastnow thats easy to read you can see what their interceptors are going how the logistics are placed and all that stuffyou can even use supreme commanders system for tech 12 differentiation add small white tabs under the strategic icons 0 for tech i 2 for tech ii 3 for tech iiidone
why should concord careas long as the rules are followed what reasons capsuleers have for hating one another is none of their concernthen it would be just like the old  get alt to accept a contract and have the alt kill you and remember that contracts are oneoff things they have no reoccurring function collect bounty and laugh at the person who placed a bounty on youprotip dont think too hard about it we certainly dont most of us put more effort into how we do things rather than why as ive said in previous posts its a mentality thing you either have the urge for destruction or you dont why you destroy is a drunken rationalization or afterthought at best we dont know him but im pretty sure if we dig through his history well find some reason why he had to be blown up why not like i said in my last post what reasons you or i perceive as stupid may not be for another person you simply dont know because you are not that person and your values are different from himher this very disagreement that we are having is literally proof of thatyour opinion that because i can bounties are not valid is merely that your opinion i am perfectly fine if people want bounty everyone for no reason some people just want to see the world burnas for earning infamy again there is no way you control that because its relativesubjective to the person why people hate a certain person may or may not be different from why other people hate another personmovies have been based on this hilarious stuff happens maybe you are bored and just want people to attack you maybe you hate yourself who knows
common courtesy i think the current system even if it requires a few tweaks is fine the tweaks are around the payout percentage and a few other small changes i can see the attraction somewhat of contract killing but the question related to concords interaction with an active contract yea i do know what i think on this what are your thoughtsso fine with them but not to be in the same system as ones you deem appropriate yea we understand that and we completely disagree with this bad premissplease refer to posts 17 26 37 39 46 48its by design and remains how it was before the change if someone wants to waste that much isk on themselves so be it it all adds to the game and promotes more player interaction why is that not a good thingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
how about read it to the end first removing local and replacing it by constellation chat you still have your intel and that somebody is in your constellation but you wont see how many and who is in your current systemso your intel channel become more valuable too because you can keep an eye at gates and report the guyfleetthis
i have seen this suggested many times it is a somewhat elegant and easy solution to introducemy only concerns are that i do feel we have a balance atm even if this balance is made through two imperfect mechanics off setting each other but balanced it is would the change from local to constellation tip the balance in favour of those cloaked if this is so then would we see an introduction of a cloak hunting system then placing the balance firmly in the other directioni know i may be over analysing it but i do see a snowball effect in the offingstill it is a nice simply change that could be madedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
another aspect blackops and covert cynos would become much more fun and become a lot more attractive you wouldnt know in which system they jumped into unless you tracked the covert ship through all gates and pinned it down to a specific system and whom they will attack but it might be too op as well i dont know certainly much more interesting and it would put the null back into the nullsec
i think the difference is that local is a two way street you see me i see you if we are both paying attention then any risk is equalcloaky what chancemoduleskill does the target say a miner have to defend himself aside from scooting to a pos or station what risk does the afk cloaker take in a safe spot as he leaves for work for the daymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ok so i consider eve online and what ccp is doing is a wonderful and great thing the idea of freedom and freemarket in the game is amazing there is one thing that bothers me though as we all know the world economy is not in the greatest of shape and the worlds monies are a bit shakey euro is bound to crash following the dollar so my question is if the currency on which ccp uses for subscriptions happens to fail what what is ccps

strike threei dont like you rolling your eyes at me when i was considerate enough to answer youthe rest of your post and any and all that come after this post from you in this thread will be ignored thank you i mean bite me
shame you couldnt argue with a decent and respectful attitude but then it seems bad ideas tend to come from those with bad mannersoh and i thought id leave this little quote for you in what can only be described as a redundant threadgood to know youre still reading my posts though destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
out of your last 2 posts i saw the line that i quoted with you rolling your eyes and the good to know youre still reading my post cause its at the bottom of the thread im not just ignoring you im making it a point not to read your posts in this thread as welldo i want to know what it says kinda am i gonna read it fnoill be starting a new thread in features and idea based on some of the things that came out this thread and link them when they are postedmags youre not allowed to click them you have to use the forums search feature
ok then we dont care to waste time making the same explainations all over again because you think youre a special snowflakeif you want us to put any time into considering your ideas then you should at minimum put similar effort into making sure that they havent already been looked at and into addressing objections raised at that time if you cant be bothered to do that why should we be bothered to spend any time on selfserving skillpoint reset proposal 218answer we wont
the target has the built in mechanics of cloaked players not physically being able to do anything to them while cloaked on their side they also have the fact that cloaky ships generally have weak tanks and or meager dpsthere may not be much or any risk for someone sitting afk cloaked  but theres no risk for someone sitting in a pos or outpost either and like someone afking in a posoutpost theres no reward
afk is fine cloaking is fine but dont make them invulnerable give me some way to find and kill them at some point lets make eve a bit more real you could hide in my home i may notice you broke in or hear you moving about chances are very high that eventually i will find you you will have time to do dirty deeds until then but when found i could turn the tablesspecial probles or ship fittings or even a time activated system wide scanner anchorable ill let someone smarter than me figure that outat its current state we need more risk for the system cloaker
this isnt aimed at the op as that focused on actual inactivity from the player bringing up a prompt of if you are afk which i guess is a reasonable thing im asking this more toward the general dislike of and demand for ways to counter cloaking i didnt want to start another afk cloak thread either people would hate mehow do you know they are a cloaked afk player is it that they dont reply in local or remain in system for hours and you cant scan them downbecause i fit into that catergory as an explorer i fly a cloakable ship turn local blink off as im exploring solo and spent most of my time using the scanning system but i cant fit a cyno and my usual explorer fit has little to no offensive and defencive capabilities i dont like the idea that while im focus on scanning down a site and sitting in a safe spot cloaked that someone can still find me and kill me went ive taken the steps to not being foundalso though im not sure it will still work after odyssey cant a covertops frigate still avoid you uncloaked at a safespot using the eccm method to counter probes
lets make the comparison a bit more real instead of somebody in your home you just have surveillance equipment in your home watching your every move i sincerely doubt you will ever notice that it is there and you wont find everything in nullsec at least you know somebody is there and watching you 
you make a good point in order to watch every move you would need a lot of camaras and a respectable amount of time to install them as a person very familiar with this type of activity its not easily done in great numbers undetected therefore setting up many cameras in someone elses home for evil intentions is rare and not everyone can do it in eve no skill is required to cloak up and hide even camaras can be found in time in eve a cloaky cant there needs to be a chance to counter it even if its slight let people cloak and camp its all good but dont make it risk free
why
im going to try and be polite because i simply cant control how hard i lold at your post you clearly didnt do any research on me i mine a lot way more then you for sure i mine in all areas of spaceunlike you i am not afraid of gankers and the like they are a part of eve if you dont like it get out of my beltsin no way does this help one side or the other this is strictly about emerging game play and a more realistic universe you make yourself sound like a winy childmining is 100 still a worthy profession you just cant be a wimp

missioning is probably one of the most done activities in eve afk mining doesnt count as an activity that a very large number of people do while i realize that most people on the csm have a primary focus on pvp null space issues and things like interface since a ton of people do missions and in an ideal world some missions could be a bridge to pvp in learning of fitting and tactics and such i would like the csm to ask the devs to start a levelacide planwhat is levelacidebasically going through missions one agent level at a time maybe agents and how they offer missions can be improved as well figure out what is good what needs worked on and if there are some new missions that can be added or some older missions that just need to be deleted maybe some small gang and fleet centered missions with lower requirements than incursions or pvp could be added if you dont have a fleet one could be given to you think solo queue but with eve playersnow why an eve solo queue mark rosewater correctly points out that in gaming people generally do what they are rewarded for doing even if they dont like it pve eve generally rewards players for solo activities the last mission in the soe arc is probably the only pve battle a player might ask for help with if he doesnt have a good ship if he does by then he can solo it now one can point to incursions but thats a ranked solo queue and there is a bit of a bar you have to be able to jump over think of incursions as bronze or silver teamqueueso we need a step before thatbasically we need to turn missions into unranked normals and solo queuefor lifetime soloers step one is just getting people working with others from time to time null alliances and even rvb need fresh blood well theres a lot of fresh blood thats busy missioning for iskhour id like to think that some of them could be turned into pvpers and nullies but the first thing that has to be done is get them to thinking that playing the game with others is both fun and rewardinglevelacide would be a great opportunity to add a venture frigate into group activities
by isd i assume you mean csm if so i konw that ripard teg and malcanis are both chomping at the bit to overhaul mission pve particularly in ways that make it into a sort of training ground for pvp fitting and flying they would be good people to contacti believe it was ripard who suggested far fewer npcs in exchange for their being tougher and having bigger bounties one obvious change would be to have npcs warp off if their in trouble so that pve ships have to fit scrams and long range pve ships have to bring a tackler are these the sort of changes youre thinking ofdo you have examples of missions youd consider good and missions you think need a serious goingover
no asking for a reexamination of missions mechanics is not asking too muchjust dont expect the world to change over nightm
well damn and i had such high hopes for tomorrow morning
around our milky way and most galaxies there are these groups of stars called globular clusters very dense groups of stars that orbit a galaxy at the center i say make some orbit new edennow an actual globular cluster might not do much for the game as they dont contain many planets and are made up of hydrogen and helium almost exclusively but that can be worked around since we dont know where new eden is in the universe we can bend the rules and make it so that globulars would contain planets and heavy elements as how they would work in new edens time as what happens in new eden isnt happening at the same time in the milky way and maybe the agestructurecompositions of orbiting clusters is different in this part and time of the universe why change our understanding of space to fit the game betterheres whydrive events in the back story a cluster was found above say amarr and minmatar space that is very profitable they could then go at it pushing developments and conflicts among the empiresmassive land or space grabs a cluster or two are above 00 space full of planets and resources all ripe for the taking and fighting over the battles of these clusters would push the 00 player corps to wars on a massive scale dust mercs would be called in to take over the new districts on the planets and defend them for dust new maps of districts under construction could be made adding more gameplay stylesnew stuff maybe a new materiel new substances not found in the galaxy is abundant in the globular cluster making a reason to go there and be profitable maybe ice is abundant and would lead to huge ice mining ops all this would be high risk and high rewardnew faction perhaps there were people colonizing the globular when the eve gate collapsed and they have been stuck cut off even more than everyone else was and could be using different kinds of weapons than the rest their railguns would look very differentnew structure youd have to get to the cluster by some form of giant star gate which would have to be built and they would be one way in one way outexploration if odyssey is all about exploration why not create brand new space to explore like with wormholes freshen the game up a bit maybe bring some old vets back to wage war in new space create new industry new skills and items and even ships to investigate the new star systemsi think have new territory to conquer and push the back story would do the game a lot of good i tried to explain it the best i could thanks for reading
lets not make this a long postelectronic attack frigates are in need of a little love if they were able to use the covert ops cloak they would be a handy edition to the blackops gangs which presently have to factor in large sums of fuel for recons it should be bombers and eaf maybe even hand them the new logistics bonuses from t1 frigs so they can be a multisuporting role within the covertopsblackops gangsgood idea or nochun tzu

i dont think we need another cloaking shipbut id support a change to the resists to bring them to the combat recon level of resists a better tank would merit the drop in speed you get when you go from the disruption frigate to the eaf and follow a pattern similar to combat frigates with their t2 counterpartsalso this thread should probably be in the features and ideas discussion forum where other paritallyformed ideas go instead of polluting the assembly hall
i will be following this thread as it seems a lot of good ideas are here i will make sure to put them to ccp burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
op dont take mag personally hes a logicfu master second only to tippa what you feel about a subject or game mechanic is more or less irrelevant to him if you cant back it up with good reasoning and if you argue with him in the realm of design intent in eve he will dig up various dev blogs and posts supporting his stance
i dunno why is there any risk in 00 nullsec is all about risk vs reward why should it be risky to mine there why should it be risky to gate camp there why should it be risky to rat there why own 00 space why doesnt everyone go there why make it so you can get huge rewards with no risk risk has a role in most parts of the game which for many makes it exciting if you or your alliance earned the station in the system for safety thats one thing someone at some point risked something to get it but getting free intel for no real risk or effort by cloakcamping should be changeda mining bot has a risk of being ganked in highsec while hes afk shouldnt a system camper in null
edit woops wrong thread correct reply to followthere is risk in cloaking you must travel into enemy space cloaky ships are fragile and lack firepower you are not capable of doing much by yourself other than gathering inteladditionally there is zero effort or risk in using local as an intel tool there is zero risk sitting in a pos or outpostwhy do you demand such one sided increases in risk which are disproportionate to the reward
i dont see how most players in nullsec are good with a ship that cant be found or killed yet can do so much damage almost everyone travels into enemy space at some point so thats not unusual risk for 00  it doesnt make it better if you can be one shotted by a miners drones if you cant be locked or found all im saying in adding risk is make them findable at least over time
but arent the cloaky ships bringing at least part of the risk to nullsec too if you make it smaller that would make the risks smaller tooso by your logic reducing the cloaky abilitiescapabilitiespossibilities should reduce all the rewards in nullsec too in order to keep the balance  i like thatat least that would be the next logical step
two weeks of no activity and it only reached the second page this section either has a low turn out or the first page threads are hot topics
dearest ccpmaybe its time to overhaul you skillpoint system1 it would be better if you make a sp generation mechanism after this skill points are spended via attributes that character have in his brain via coefficentsyou can get rid off skill queit was a great solution but today we should have some evolution changes2 nd it would be awesome if you can buy book remotly its future why we cant buy via inter golo dunno net a books or coursesit makes no sense pros no way of forgetting to switch skill learning your char becomes smth like wine more age more tasty you shouldnt get to high sec to buy books cons safer for users so no suicide ganks after books bad for piracy  no more missed learning hours bad for ccp

1 if you can store sp it allows you to put off what to train decisions until you develop a need for that skill this has a very negative impact by allowing people to store sp until the new fotm comes out and instatraining into it also if the sp gained is static but is only modified when being applied to a skill based on the current attributes you have you essentially eliminate the need for having attribute implants during 99 of your play time example i decide its time to train command ships 5 so i clone hop to my 5 implanted clone and then apply the sp and then clone hop away to do pvp the rest of the month 2 access to skillbooks is an important consideration for living away from empire nullsec wh space and having to make a trip to highsec to access these skillbooks adds risk to players that need them transported furthermore there is a portion of the market that thrives by making skillbooks accessible at market hubs and your change would undermine this viable market community
isnt this just dusts skill mechanic pasted into eve
absolutely right dersen didnt know where my mind was i wouldnt mind fewer but better enemies at least some of the time at least for solo stuff and maybe for a few missions it might be cool if they give you a system but force you scan down the target in addition to some other pvp like activities those are some of the changes i have in mindalso the fewer enemies dont just have to have bigger bounties if theres only two or three per mission maybe they could have more drops per ship like in pvp where a good chunk of the mods give or take survivethat said i think there needs to be a wider varity of missions a few horde mode security missions like we have now arent that bad as long as we have other options attack the pirate mining fleet maybe an easy defend mission of some sorts guard the asteroid belt for 10 minutes or something join a friendly npc fleet going after a small dreadnaught maybe some regions could have pirate hot spots like incursions but not to that level where youll get missions related to those piratesalso a few missions with alternative win or bonus money conditions wouldnt be badas for which ones need to be kept or which ones need a going over thats a good questionthanks for the reply mike i wont get my hopes too high as i know these things can take time
linna your ideas sent me off looking for more information
i spend a lot of my time mining and i have seen thinks change over the years but one thing has remained the same the t2 survey scanner has a max range of 2250 km and there is no way to change that with a full orca bonuse with max skills and implant the strip miners can be pushed out to 259 respectavley but there is no bonuse to the scanner and if a noob joins the fleet his t1 stipes get pumped out to 259 just like all the rest but he only has a 15km range on his t1 scanner why not have the range boost also apply to the scanneror give us faction scanners with a 30k range but dont screw us on a low drop rate like you have with all the other mining equipment
in response to my post in another thread this is more what i would have liked archaeology to be likeyou discover something and scan itwhich leads tousing science and industry skills to study it and narrow down other linked sitesso youfly there and discover more clueswhich then goes tomore exploration of new edens history landmarks and scenic vistasand so on and so on untilthe resulting data and notes from your search are turned over to interested agents corps or factions thus leading to rewards unique items lp standing knowledge or a feeling of accomplishment whatever seems fittingadded future featuresincarna lab to study discoveriesandcartography room to view results and plan your next movethanks to ccp bioware squareenix and relic for some of the artnot suggesting you change the existing idea or implement this just saying in an ideal world this is what i would have liked eve achaeology to be like though others have expressed a liking for the ideaarchaeology  planetary interactionconcept imageokay an idea for pi to link into my archaeology feature unlike the current pi which i think of as industrial this is for more science based structures so you start with an expedition command centre or ecc this serves the same purpose as the current command centre providing power cpu limited storage and a basic launch capability but players will be unable to place both types of commands on the same planet the ecc also counts toward your interplanetary consolidation skill limit this forces the player to choose between the somewhat certain income of industrial pi or the riskier but more rewarding exploration and science approachfrom the ecc you can deploy a survey drone over an adjustable area of the planet its purpose is to fly over the area and search for anomalies and potential excavation sites the actual working is similar to the current pi mining survey you planset the length of time the drone will be gone the longer the survey the wider the area covered you then place a pin at the central point of the area you wish to search any discoveries will be highlighted in the planet view and notifications will be sent to the discovery codex whether this happens during or only at the end of a survey is up for debate varying skills time of year sovereignty recent system activities current lore planets and their location within new eden affect the probability of a discoveryonce you have discovered something you send out the excavation crawler a land vehicle with a small team to pinpoint uncover and if possible return any relics data or clues to the ecc crawlers work similar to drones but with a smaller area of activity and a fixed time to complete their job which is decided by the type of anomaly or discoverywith both the drone and crawler overlapping areas of activity diminish productivity again similar to current pi miningadditional buildingsradio telescope UFFFD able to detect potential sites of interest in space and provide a rough location to the capsuleer increased numbers upgrades and skills narrow the results from whole regions to a few solar systems the player then needs to fly there and probe down what the telescope detectedcartography facility UFFFD refines the possible location results from analysing relics and data only works for certain types of discoveries does little on its own but building one provides a boost to the players analysis report accuracyrd facility UFFFD reduces the time needed to study relics and physical discoveries upgrading the facility increases the bonusdata processing facility UFFFD similar to the rd facility but works to reduce the time needed to study data and sensor readingsdata bandwidth UFFFD unlike current pi that uses transport links to move goods the exploration pi uses data links that carry a limited bandwidth players are able to upgrade this to match the increased data being send to and from facilitiesfinally it should go without saying that the lower the sec of a system the higher the chance of discovery but it can also affect the type of discovery empire system are move likely to provide relics and projects relating to those empires null and low sec have higher chances of pirate and discoveries based on eves wider lore and story wormholes and new systems reachable by player built stargates would have higher chances of truly unknown and mysterious encounter though wormholes do have a higher sleepertalocan discovery chancecartography 2nd concept as first is unclear
it would be great if this could be done to at least make the killmails accurate it should be done even when they are moved on grid anyway this wouldnt cause a performance issue would it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
jovians cant do anything because they are all extinct they ahd finally found a cure when labassistant tuxford pressed the big red button by mistake dooming them all to oblivion
this thread again
some of those features while probably being fun would be horrible and gamebreaking especially for newer players ive always thought the idea of a jovian encounter would be cool but invasion would hardly be the term especially if youre looking to work the lore into it seeing as how the jove are a dying and broken race the only way you could spin an encounter would be to either have the jove break into our space in search of a cure or you could have the jove realizing that their days are numbered open up their space to us to allow their technology to be claimed before theyre completely wiped outto the people claiming that the jove ships are vastly superior to ours yeah i suppose thats true in lorebut then again look at the gnosis hardly a death machine id say hahaall in all it would be cool to have some sort of encounter with the jove but i doubt well see it any time soon and if we do im almost positive its never going to be an invasion of sansha proportions
i approve this idea with all my heart and will try my best to push it to ccp burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
if you could fly the ship before you can after yeah rightwhat the hell is adding advanced spaceship command v to freighters and jump freighters about the flying boxes that go really slow and get routinely ganked by ships taking a fraction of the resources to make must be made more unbalanced by a pointless skillchange it back or make it iv at least or heres a thought have the skill do something so people want to train it what are the bonuses on my providence for advanced spaceship command oh thats right  nothing the fact noone trains a skill is not a reason to change perrequisites to v up from i betraying a design philosophy in the process thats rubbish either make the skill worth having or get rid of it entirelywhat would i do providence requirement 1 advanced spaceship command bonus 5 bonus to align time and 25 increase in shields armour and hull resists and hit points per levelark as above but 25 reduction in jump fuel costs you just made ice cost more throw us a bone hereand what is up with the command ship skill prerequisites to fly a vulture a shield command ship you need armored warfare v information warfare v skirmish warfare v as well as the one that actually matters huhcome on guys  dont put freighters right up there with carriers when people fly carriers they make more isk in nullsec for far less risk than they do in high hauling rubbish in a freighters live up to your design promises or stop making them
is this directed to ccp or csmburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
well said
so i was looking at this wh that led into 4dhst and tried to figure out what evil i could use it for a pretty cool idea struck methe ability to make wormholes stable imagine the possibilities alliances that have never before been able to interact with eacother due to the distance can suddenly become mortal enemies or important alliesso this is how i believe it could workyou find a wormhole in a 00 system that leads to another 00 system then you place a structure at both sides of the wormhole  wormhole stabilizer and the wormhole becomes permanent while the structures are up mass limits for the wh etc should still apply this could be a great strategic advantage for any alliance and can also be used to initiate an invasion in a region if the wormhole appears in a system no one really visits finding and destroying enemy wormhole routes could be very important and also protecting them i believe would be a very high priority as they can shorten extremely long distances to balance the wh stabilizers i think the reinforcement timers should only be a couple of hours so you really need to stay on top of things to protect your critical routesnote it should only be possible to place these stabilizer at wormholes leading from one 00 system to another
only if it can stabilize kspace connections wspace crowd does not want wh stabilizers burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
yes i wrote that as a note in the end 
so basicly you want better jump bridges out of alliance should it realy create a passage though a wormhole system or just a wh that connects 00 directly with 00the wormhole stabilisers should only be placeable by local sovereignity holders so both involved alliances have to agree on placing them otherwise you do not even have to get a cyno for a titan bridge but have a permanent bridge to your enemy eve is too fast already cause you can cross the universe very fast for me titan and other bridges should only be possible from one titan to an other so you have to put a little effort and risk in moving your troops fast
you should not be able to place stabilizers through a wormhole system that would be too gamechanging for the people that enjoy their life in the whs so only directly from 00 to 00  not 00 to lowsechighsec eitherand the whole point of this is to make it a bit more interesting with alliances that are very far from each other this could create a completely new playing field and interesting developments no the sov holders should not agree the whole point of this is to make it a bit more volatile and spicy  but having the wh stabilizers relatively weak is a form of balancing so you will have to make sure to defend themalso supercaps cannot enter wormholes this should not change a titan should never be able to enter a wormhole even if its stable or not
though id still like to have that brafree look back
solet me get this straightnot only do we have to go to the hassle of setting up dual character training one month at a time but it costs more to train an alt than it does a mainon a monthbymonth basis its the same price granted but normally you can buy chunks of time in advance which greatly reduces the cost but with dct you have to pay 20monthwhy is running an alt  a secondary character someone ill spend less time playing  more expensive than running a primary
a plex is a plex it costs the same no matter which character you use it on
i think it should enable you to login with 2 characters from the same account as well or theres not really much point s
you dont have to use it you can just use a second account if you want an alt you want to keep on trainingif you want an alt that you dont need to keep on training then its cheaper to have it on one of the 3 character slots that every account has alreadythis change is about adding value to those existing character slots not replacing the utility of multiple accounts
this does it have a limited and niche appeal yes are you forced to use it no could it be cheaper to get a second account yes at around 3 months per char should it be cheaper than standard pricing to use hell no the choice is simple either use it or dontdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
it is what it is invulnerability to gain rewards afking for rewards and effect is frowned upon in every other aspect of the game twist it mold it and paint it however you want it seems simple to me let them be found if they stay too long add another item to the game to do it helps the eve economy and adds a cool new aspect of pvp to the game
ok i have several issues with this firstly there is no reward they gain absolutely nothing they cannot prevent other players doing something they dont gain any isk or assets the reward is zero if you decide to interfere with yourself then that is on you if you consider that a reward to the cloakerafker then dont give them that reward simplesecondly i dont even see the point of the use of the term afk in these topics to highlight what i mean let me present two situationsthe classic afk cloaker sits in a safespot cloaked ship is completely stationaryplayer goes to walk the dog have dinner work whateverthe active cloakersits in a safespot cloaked ship is completely stationaryplayer sits at the computer the entire time chatting in corp etc chat channelsto everyone in the system these two players are exactly the same theyre not scanning or hunting theyre not even moving they cant be found etc the fact people keep harping on about afk would suggest that they do no wish to impede or punish the second  very much active  type of player except every single suggestion ever proposed would punish the second type of player despite the fact that hes active just not visibly so to the carebearsthis suggests to me that people are not in fact attempting to deal with an issue regarding afk players because they always suggest things that would hurt the second type of player tooso can we stop with the dishonesty this isnt about afk players this is about active players that you want defending from
most of the suggestions favorable to this idea of increasing cloaker risk simply push likely combat areas away from gates and stations if you assume that unknown situation  pilot avoidance by making these choke points a weaker choice for campers cloaked or noteven with the constellationonly local youre going to have the same issues as you do now  you dont know whats behind that gate or outside the station the only way to save yourself is with logic experience and a decent fitting if this is what you hope to avoid then the issue for you is gameplay itselfthis all just boils down to someone being upset that they arent good enough to avoid easy camping tactics which just equals poor ability why should eve reward people for being horrible at it
what resources do you propose for the ringswill they be like ice belts and mined out in a given periodmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
as sentinel zx pointed out to me here ccp fozzie said yesterday that ring mining isnt something being worked on anytime soon if everthat said id imagine completely new resources for the rings that tie into a new industry ideally stargate construction im sure existing minerals and ore are there but the ring harvester is looking for only certain types of resources something that exists in planetary rings only plus asteroids provide richer yields of those already available oresscientifically speaking they should contain moon minerals spread across the ring as a fine dust or micro asteroids but i wouldnt want ring mining to tread on any ones toes so a new resource works betterideally it would be something like the actinides and other radioactive elements and youd harvest the decay products eg thorium is collected to create radon gas which is then used in some way to aid the longrange jumping effects of stargates perhaps as a radioactive tracer between the two gates that maintains the connectionthere wouldnt be a limitless supply of the resources in rings but i would see them more like belts a fixed amount that is respawned after downtime do belts still work that way it certainly wouldnt be like the old ice mining more like the newer version yes but it would take a well run mining operation to deplete a ring within a dayi also imagine that mining the rings in high sec would require something like the starbase charters so that you need permission from the empires to do it low and null sec and wormholes would be free to mine and have greater quantities of resources
if you had attended fanfest and went to the ccp panel on their company growth and outlook for the future you would already know the answer but since you didnt some nice soul put it up on youtube right here
i would rather use the crappy system the japanese players are forced to use
laughing at this peer pressure pyramid scam seen a few people fall into it and doesnt look too good 
not being able to dock would be the best way to balancedhell let it even build capitals not super caps transporting the mats for it to build those massive of ships would actually be a rather fun logistical challenge if they are not all from mined material if you parked it right outside a station so freighters could undock and dump mats in it would leave it quite vulnerable to attack much tears best tearsif you want to further enhance mining game play give it a doomsday for a comet basically you can have comets be like ore sites where you have to warp in a super industrial to hit it with a drillray to brake it into pieces then others can mine the piecesof course like a titan it should have to sit there for 510 mins while using the mega drillray maybe you can even use the hacking mini game to cut it into pieces mehit wouldnt overhaul the boring mining problem but it would go a long way to help it
wowi love the idea of a trail of clues but this would be almost an epic arc that demands skills be trained as opposed to an ongoing repeatable process wouldnt itm
yeah i envisioned it as something that requires a little of everything to complete some projects can be completed within a day and some of the more epic tales and mysteries could be months and years but with the rewards scaling to match i also like the idea of small groups or solo players needing to drum up support and funding to pursue leads like a desperate scientist pleading that the next stage of his research will yield massive rewards for investors a solo player could do it but there are lots of skills new and old so it doesnt fit a tightly focused character build or specialised alts but is easier for corps and groups to complete with diverse skill setsi have been meaning to do a mockup of the discovery codex which would keep track of projects and also work as an ingame lore encyclopedia there is a section that shows the branches of a project that would look like the dust skill tree or the ship progress ui shown at this years fanfestyou can follow clues down one path and if you hit a deadend or something requiring skills that you dont have you can double back down the project tree and follow other clues and different leads in a corp or group these branching leads can be explored simultaneously and discoveries pooled to refine results and datareally it shouldnt be called archaeology but more investigations but i wanted it to focus on discovering the history of new eden and bring the lore into the game
removing the command processor module would reduce the effectiveness of ogb alts
well this one is super simple in the corp information tab there is a piece of information which relates to the corp member size i think that this piece of information should be expanded in order to include the total amount of members the amount of eve players and the amount of dust mercs this would allow the populations of both games to see if the player corporation is mainly an eve based corporation a dust based corporation or if they have a mix of both venix
considering some of us have been playing for a long long time with the ability to only train one character adding an option that requires a plex to use at least placates my bittervet rage at ccp making the game easier by allowing people to have more dudes quicklybe thankful they even put the feature in
well said gunslinger these threads always seem to be thinly veiled attempts at nerfing all cloakers using the afk people are bad mkay excusefor all the talk of generating risk it all boils down to making nulsec even safer so the zerobears can ratminewhatever under the complete safety of locals all seeing eyejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

so yesterday i was doing my thing on the forums and spotted this posttldr some mercs from dust were trying to get in contact with eve players who might be interested in their services however they apparently had to create an account on eve trial from the looks of it and then post on the newbie section in the hopes that someone would notice the postis it just me or does this seem pretty stupid specifically the fact that this is supposed to be the eve universe containing both dust and eve with integrated chat channels ingame yet we cant directly post on each others forumsthe solution im advocating is simple create a section on the dust forums where we can post and vice versa a liason section if you will enhanced communication between the two games means more cooperation which means the links that bind us get used more often especially going forward when the cooperation or lack of it between the two games might build or destroy empiresthis is lowhanging fruit that should be relatively simple to do i would think and could have a decent payoff
theyre already in our communication channels ingame this seems like a pretty obvious change to make
this seems like a lowcost nobrainer idea to increase involvement between the 2 games
good idea 1
ive passed this suggestion on to the cpm
also supporting this greater cooperation between dust  eve players at some basic level is a must i think as dust players get more organised  as they have proven they can do anyway  and look to impact eve
as long as its a section and not a full forum merge 1
confirmedjust as a starship pilot probably doesnt have much interest in giving feedback on domination mode in dust i doubt the groundpounders would have much interest in missions  complexes in eve unless they played both games of course but then the issues moot

ok warp effect nice but i realy mis the simple loading system done or undocking station done thouse whear best part of long trips now is am i undocking do i have to wait for anmation to jump sigh so hear it is petion to all feal the same way please sine to bring back loading bar or a less glamer quick loading thank for support
i rather like the new system with two exceptionsit would be nice if the undocking animation was a little more obvious there are red lights flashing but theyre hardly noticable unless youre looking for them and i dont want to put that much effort into determine whether im undocking or not i wish the game wouldnt take control of my camera when i arrive in a new system theres not really a reason for it to point anywhere i understand why it does when you begin the jump but the ending doesnt make sense
i have been playing eve for a few years now and i had come to enjoy eve but lately i have come to have some issues with the updates1 the amount of updates and patches that are done i knew eve as one of the few games that did these things twice a year but now it seems every 23 months there is something new i am having to wait to get patched i understand emergencies those you cant help at all or if there is a major glitch but there is so much more going on lately2 i dont play for the graphics but almost every update for about 2 years now has had more graphic changes than substance changes for example the new graphics when you jump through a system gate it lags down my computer greatly and that is on low graphics its painful to deal with or the scan sites i dont scan i dont care to see more things popping up on the screen and from the people i have spoken to who do scan they like to do scanning to find they dont want half the work done for them3 this is a game that you cant really multitask in you have to pick a path to go down with everything i personally was working on the drake to have heavy missiles and all of that but then less than a year ago everything changed on the drake and heavy missiles leaving me with 25 years of training that i couldnt use and i was back to using frigates and i still havent recovered then as i look through what ships i can use i come to only two options heavy assaults or cruise missiles on any of the ships 4 there is so much that needs to be fixed in the substance field like everything to do with corporations and alliances is a mess under the corporation tab and the issues with poses is a nightmare things have gotten better with dust but its still not great but instead of seeing improvements on the substance we see more shiny objects and flashing lights that do nothing but hurt my computer and its ability to run the gamewhat happened to the versatility of this game what happened to the understanding what happened to the substancei used to love this game but now at this point i feel like i am being cheated out of my money for the service i am paying for
so you are complaining that the game changes and grows that its graphics improve with age and animations are addedwhat are you askin for that ccp stop changing the game or that they roll back to the good old daysm
please reread i think you missed what i was pointing out i clearly posted somethings i would like to see change and the things i am unhappy with
i dont personally see a list of complaints that the game is growing but i do see complaints regarding a constant barrage of unnecessary changes in light of many very needed onesan example player owned stations pos  these really need a lot of granulation worked into themand yes  it would be nice if we could focus on the multitude of issues and ignore the graphics advances for a little while while some of them are neatlooking  i would much prefer the ability to turn each and every one of them off
thank you chitsa jason for your help
if youre paying through plex yes if youre paying through account management a years worth of dct is considerably more expensive than a primary characterno i dont have to use it but id like to and whether or not i use it has no bearing on whether or not i can critique the implementation of it im glad theyve added utility to the three character slots but that doesnt change the fact that its not what it could be  for players and for ccpive never understood the argument of its something so dont complain if you get paid below minimum wage are you happy with the situationsee above being forced or not doesnt enter the equationim not arguing for it to be cheaper than standard pricing im saying its less than a primary character for well over the cost of a primary character why is buying a second account both better and cheaper than dctsee above this is never a valid response im not arguing the feature shouldnt exist im not saying im unhappy it does im saying the implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired and theres no reason it shouldnt be much better than it is
dct isnt intended for people to train their character for a year if you want to do that youre far better off doing it on a seperate account for a variety of reasons in addition to costits literally meant as a minor flexibility option for people who want a limited alt with a couple of million sp i know that youre desperately trying to avoid understanding this because you want 1 account to offer the same utility we get from 3 accounts now but thats the truth of itstop thinking of dct as in any way competing with alt accounts it doesnt its intended for use profiles that arent suited at all to multiple accounts if you want an alt and youre thinking man just having a second account would be way better for what i want this alt for then dct isnt intended for that kind of alt because theres already an option that does what you wantthe rest of your argument boils down to i want ccp to give me more for lessdct is as it is deal with it
the parts you snipped answered the restdoes it have a limited and niche appeal yescould it be cheaper to get a second account yes at around 3 months per chardestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i also wonder why therers no limitation to the cloaking modules as you can run it forever but i do support this seems to make sense to me
gunslinger actually failed to mention the third type of passive cloaker cloaky eyesears in wspace sometimes one has to sit cloaked off a wormhole or starbase for hours to set up a trap act as a picket for incoming hostiles or because the inhabitants of your static are trying to bore you to death with their posspinning
i hope im posting this in the right forum and the csm council will take this seriously given the potential gravity of the situation the problem is as stated in the topic and ccp appears to be completely ignoring the issue major antivirus software vendors have started flagging the in game browser as an identity theft risk because its based on a highly vulnerable version of google chrome from 2009theres been a thread on reddit about it a months old and similar years old threads on the eve issues and bug reporting forum as well as posts ive contributed to
considering that malicious advertisements malads inside legit pagessites are a thing this should be a higher priority furthermore considering that ddos attacks seem to be a part of the shady side of the eve metagame already to go with rmt  botting it is not a far leap to more insidious attack methods
current skill system mechanics are fine it allows you to try out modules and ships with enough time so that the next time you train your next better skills youll be up to the challenge with your next bigger ship contrary to other silly stupid wowcodbf3 games as you can use the best frigging gun in the world and be rambohere it doesnt work that way it needs timeand lots of it to become better with your ship and equipement use that time efficientlynot supported
it was just a thought
i agree

this is what i read here
can we have an option to turn off gate jump animations please it gives me a headache
hay guys thank you so much for your posts i would just be so glad if ccp thinking on it a lot more if they done this sort the warp animations and station undocking to sort out station loading may be put in a cut sean showing you undocking and as for the jump effect keep it but removed the bit wear the cramer spins around after you enter system
i would pay to resculpt all six of my characters for more boobagephysics
oh god the guy in the top left looks like hes ready to get down but hes not taking his goggles off lold
so to clarify my point of viewmulticlient  its allowed by ccp and its fine by memultibox software  i dont like it but its allowed by ccptranslaterepeat keyboardmouse commands to multiple clients  this is absolutely shameful  i dont care what other games or ccp think about iti will never embrace it   
i do not at all want to be given more for less what i am is unsure as to why ccp expects me to be happy giving more to receive lessmy question is why there is no reason dct cant be everything multiple accounts is minus the ability to actually fly both characters at onceand deal with it isnt an appropriate response to anything should people have dealt with it rather than turn ccp around with the jita riots and the mass exodus of subscribers eve is decidedly better for that for people wanting the situation to improve dct can be more than it is and there doesnt seem to be a good reason why it isnt alreadyif im mistaken i apologize but your position seems to be this is the current state and any change is bad no matter what the quality of the current state is or what the change would be towardyou say dct isnt meant to be the equal of multiple accounts but why what at all would it take away from if they were more equal
its all very simple this system works well for a very few and limited situations it in no way is meant to replace second accounts and at no point do ccp suggest it does its purely to train alts without having to start a second account and then transfer that char its financial viability only last for 3 months per char then at that point a second account would be cheaperwhy on earth should they be concerned with whether you are happy or not when the system is as described and you are not being forced to use it i could understand this argument if they had removed the option to have a second account but they haventso the choice remains firmly in your hands use it or dont use itthe list once more for clarificationdoes it have a limited and niche appeal yesare you forced to use it nocould it be cheaper to get a second account yes at around 3 months per charshould it be cheaper than standard pricing to use hell nodestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i am not averse to making changes to cloaking but the above argument is weak unless you want to also apply it to active hardeners and damage control and the likemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
when a cloak is active it shuts down all module activation then there is the sensor recalibration time as well as the fact you cannot target anyone whilst cloakedthe none covert versions also stop your ship warping as well as affect ship speedsif they are not limitations then what aredestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
it has been interesting playing since odyssey and watching for the impacts of the heralded rebalancing of ice ore and moon goowhat is my verdictutter total and complete failure whythese changes were obviously designed to encourage players to explore more and to play in nullsec these changes could make you very rich as a miner in nullsec  on paperactually all of these changes fail to address one single basic point of the reality of nullsecthe mapthe current map in eve has a number of critical choke points in it both into lowsec into nullsec and jump routes needed to access entire regions in nullsec and guess what  those choke points are all closed to explorers indeed some are closed to everyone who isnt a plex billionaire who paid for admission to the inner circle of the two or three mega corps that control the critical access points like pandemic leigon goons etcso until the map is changed nullsec will remain dead and empty to far to go to hard to live there impossible to export things to hgihsec to sell so all the changes in one word add up to  failfix the map or stop pretending that things like make ice scarcer do more than making botters make more isk fasterhow should the map be changed highsec empire incursions each player faction should be able to place sbus and attack nullsec systems  if claimed and retained for 7 days the nulls system should change to empire space with a dev assigned security rating if null sec mega corps keep null empty and they have been and clearly indend to continue that then enough already add highsec patches in nullsec with jump gates to the core systems
im not really going to even address most of the rest of your post it smacks of insular empire dweller the sort who thinks that every gate into nullsec is bubblecamped 247 and so on and besides im one of those evil goons the major factions controlling everything and apparently sells access to our space thats news to me i wonder where my cut is and thus you wouldnt believe me anywayso well cut straight to your ideasure but it goes both ways if highsec factions can invade nullsec then it goes both ways  nullsec can invade highsec e i should also point out that all of the perks of nullsec that you clearly desire but are not bold enough to join a group and claim are tied to security status and would thus vanish if your idea came to fruition so uh what would be the point of this again you wouldnt be playing in nullsec mining dark glitter and arkonor to your hearts content while your personal tower sucks down dysprosium youd be playing in highsec competing with a million other miners for ice belts that vanish in twenty minutes and cursing yourself for thinking this would get you what you want
i agree this needs to be given a much higher priority by ccp by ccp knowing of this vulnerability they are morally and professionally obligated to fix itin my opinion keeping the igb secure and patched is much more important then content evencsm please bring this to light to ccp and support our safetysigned
to the council of stellar managementif you read the eve online odyssey feedback thread you will see that there is many anger and frustration with some specific contents of the new expansion odyssey i expect you the members of the council of stellar management for which i have voted that you bring these points to attention before ccp and urge them to state solutions especially the comments of some players including myself to get motion sickness or simulation sickness through the new effects and camera movements especially on long travelsbest regardsaya shinomiya

hii think some little changes might help i am not sure should be tested i think it is more the combination of camera movement and effects also the succession of warp travel and jump i do not think it is wise to fob the players with things they can do at home to avoid the problem instead of ingame improvements my suggestions in this matter removing of the camera shaking while entering and leaving warp travel until ccp found the possibilitiy to actual let the ship shaking and not the camera drones this would be indeed a difference the perspective would be fix while the ship on it is shaking now it is conversely i think this is one point that causes the sickness removing of the camera swing before the jump effect it is very aggressive camera movement jumping from gate to gate needs only a few seconds if you travel through many systems you see this swing in combaination with the jumping effect in quick succession and if we are serious our ships do not fly direct through the event horizon of the gate they disappear and appear around the gate we can see it so this camera swing to create the illusion that the ship is moving through the gate is in my eyes expendable for the purpose of let player feel better while playing making the jump animation or future animations like this less aggressive and flashing and more smooth many player are annoyed but the jump effect after a few jumps they cannot watch it any longer including myself i think it is because the whole animation is very aggressive first this camera swing than this flashing speed animation and at the end this distortion effect and this many times when you travel through many systems the problem with the effects in my eyes is that ccp puts to much effort in this show effect everything must be coollooking and bombastical but very often they forget the user friendlinessmany games have possibilities to break up sequences and cut scenes through pushing esc i do not know whether this is possible for eve online but in this way player who are annoyed by the effect after a while can simply break it up maybe than seeing a loading bar i do not know i am not familiar with the technical issuesmany player including myself blame ccp of not implanting options so player can decide how they want to use the game mechanics eg the new scanner i do not understand why it is so hard to give the option of automatic scan and manual scan now it scans after every jump after leaving a station or the warp same whith the effects ccp forcing us sometimes to things instead of letting the player decide how to use and customize them this is one of the main source of the anger and frustration i think they want back the old position of the undock buttom damned let they player decide where they want to put this damn thing sorrybest regardsediti realized that you can at least turn off camera shaking in the settings
i have a quick quip to say about the idea is that there should be certain restrictions to which forms a duster can and cannot post on segregation is needed in just about almost all areas as the two games subjects are entirely different and i am quite sure you guys will be rather tired of people posting about nerf lasers buff havs and nerf duvolle all day long also we have free accounts so alt bad posting is quite possible to get entirely out of hand i mean features and ideas a section as a cpm have to comb though quite often would easily get drowned out when something eve side gets screwy or something starts complaining why there is no day cycles in dust and someone mistakes it for eve and bad replies there is no such thing as day cycles in space i would like to see the forums merged i would not like to see the issues that may arise from itdust 514s cpm 1 iron wolf saber eve mail me about dust 514 issues
agreed there are some sections of each games forum where a player from the other game will have nothing useful to say so keep those sections separate
in a recent interview ccp fozzie said that ring mining isnt something currently being worked on and may never be while fozzie could have been misinformed or not part of that particular area of development it does concern me as it is an area and a feature i was looking forward to and am intrigued by im not demanding it or asking for it to be the next thing in eve but it is something i would one day love to see come to the systems of new edenso if people still want it please show your support here and hopefully the csm can let ccp know its still something the players of eve wantsource  ccp fozzie interview the particular statement im refering to is at 4345 minutes into the interviewthank you
i would like to see the current asteroid belts simply be placed in a ring formation around the sun with about a dozen fields available maybe put some empty roids in the background to complete the picture of a ring of asteroids this would be in line with their latest concept of changing the spacescapean expansion later they could possibly change some other things such as making only veldspar and scordite commonly available and making the more valuable asteroids available in a similar manner as ice fields like if you mine out the plagioclase ore anomaly which is in a random spot somewhere along the ring of asteroids then it would respawn some time later in another spot of the asteroid ring or even another systems asteroid ring imo they should also somewhat randomize the systems where ice spawnsthese seem like fairly minimal effort changes that could open the field for something larger that i cant think of right now mostly i just think it would be nicemore immersiveless silly than the current asteroid fieldsedit i should add that only the first paragraph is really the bit that i expectwant when thinking of ring mining right now the other stuff is just me rambling theres of course also the thing for the rings around some planets which is what people might mean when talking about ring mining
not bad1 ill askm
it takes about 3 months to train a decent mining alt that is 3 plex for dct to set up a new account i will cost 1 plex to start the account 3 plex for training time and 2 plex to transfer the character over to the main accountlets total that updct 3 plexsecond account 6 plex
ccp havent explained their commercial reasons but id guess they go something like this1 plex gives you 30 days account time  30 days skilling1 ccp offer additional incentives to the price of starting a new account because once you have a character on a new account you have a very strong incentive to keep maintaining that account if you dont you lose access to the character no such consideration applies to secondary characters on your main account so theres no good reason to offer extra pricing incentives from ccps point of view2 simplicity dct maintains the list price of plex and the cost is simple to understand and simple for ccp to implement given that they explicity dont want dct to directly compete with multiple accounts the effort of adding in the spectrum of pricing incentives is high and the reward is negative from their point of view think of it as the difference in the permonth price you pay for watching 1 pay per view event compared to subscribing to the sports channel for a whole year the 1y sub is far cheaper per unit time because your total spend is higher and youre very likely to renew in terms of cost of delivery and administration it doesnt cost the cable company any more than the ppv but its way better in terms of revenue to lock you in for a year but if you just want to watch a single game then its better for you to pay 20 for 1 evening than 600 for 365 days even though youre paying more than 10x the perday price of a subanyway thats all im going to say on the matter you can either accept that reasoning or rant about it some more but it wont change anything
so you want the ability to create more highsec space why not spread out more in to the multitude of highsec systems that are almost always empty if anything we need less highsec
how do two gigantic belts encircling a star make it easier for gankers to find you over the current beaconed belt positions cruell nightmare and ccp soundwave arent saying there should only be two mining spots in a system in fact they are saying the oppisite that belts should be spread across systems in terms of au rather than kmalso im not sure what kind of high sec mning you are doing that pays little and involves a ton of risk though if youre not paying a sub and only play with plex that might explain it
warfare in highsec whether concord sanctioned or not involves the destruction of enemy assets and the destruction of the enemys will to fight most of us in high are in high because we dont want to fight anyway so theres no will to fight to break you null seccers and your lets all kill high seccers mentality
sounds pretty reasonable one question though what would happen to the existing mining barges would they be rendered obsolete
no definitely not the two types of mining would be completely separate from each other except for some shared skills ships from one simply cant perform the tasks of the other for instance the ring harvester would have no turret points and cannot fit strip miners it is dependent on its unique mining drones for harvesting the idea is to add a new type of mining not to replace an existing one
could be interesting way to do things for those of us fancying a little interaction while mining that isnt just changing target
this is a proposal to allow the game to systematically removeanull corporations that are inactive especially those which have been inactive for very long periods of time in order to free up corp names and associated tickersimo ccp should always express favourability toward active players rather than treating them as equals to the hundreds of thousands of 30 day alt accounts and 1 man dead corps
allow noctis into all sites that have an acceleration gate to salvage i have seen several new players that tried to get into accel gate sites but it wouldnt allow the noctis thru it would however allow t3 cruisers to use the gate there is no reason why a noctis shouldnt be able to use any accel gate in the game its sole purpose in the game is to salvage and ccp is not allowing it to be used fully as it should be
only one more before we break the rule for pyramid quoting also no
no
proposalenergy discharge elutriation i should be changed from 20 to 25 cap reduction for laser turrets and the t2 variant from 25 to 30as a few might have seen there was a very big discussion about the changes to the amarr hulls losing her cap bonus with the current odyssey expansion while i like the changes there actually is a reasonable concern of performance lose with some platforms especially for newer players as you think back of your early days we mostly did ccc and recharger stacking improving cap recharge to a point where the hole setup runs forever or long enough for your needs however many amarr hulls actually perform noticeably better with the cap if you use discharge rigs instead of cccs since the massive reduction in weapon capacitor use especially with high damage ammo is better than what you can stack up with cap recharge modsif you just use 12 rig slots and 12 lowmed slots the problem with t1 guns is actually big surprise that they dont need so much cap and therefore new players cant really take advantage of discharge riggingactually they even got nerfed with the general cap reduction of lasers with a improvement of the discharge rigs even newer players with t1 guns get a noticeable improvement if they want to reduce slots for cap spend to a minimum to get a better overall performance out of hulls like the new apoc or navy omen in pveapocalypse new setup 1heat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iiarmor em hardener iilarge armor repairer iitracking computer ii optimal range scripttracking computer ii optimal range scriptcap recharger iiexperimental 100mn afterburner imega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i imperial navy multifrequency llarge capacitor control circuit ilarge capacitor control circuit ilarge capacitor control circuit ihammerhead ii x5hobgoblin ii x5with all 5 the setup runsab off repper on4m 35s with multi7m 32s with xray25m 33s with standardwith all 3 cccs removed and replaced with 2 of the current t1 discharger rigs it looks like this3m 56s with multi4m 50s with xray5m 56s with standardif you replace them 2 t2 discharge rigswhile t1 would be as effective after the change you get4m 20s with multi5m 16s with xray6m 26s with standardif you now look at the numbers with the new 30 valuei took triple t1 discharge rigs with 2 of the new t2 discharge rigs it looks like this4m 37s with multi5m 37s with xray6m 59s with standardas you can see with the extra 5 discharge rigs would be a lot better option for younger players than they are now giving you nearly the same performance with multi frequency crystals as if you use ccc stacking keep in mind that a fitting like this also frees a rig slotthat can be spend on cap range tank etc and with lower levels in controlled burst and cap skills the discharge rigs are even better once you look at t2 guns and t2 ammo dischargers are actually become the preferable option compared to cccs since your guns use a lot more cap and you will utilize scorch and conflag a lot more than standard crystals so you spend nearly 100 of your time with crystals that favour discharge riggingto summarize new players can start to utilize discharge rigs earlier by getting more comparable results compared to ccc stacking at least for multi frequency crystals even with t1 guns it softens the blow for newer people starting with a bs for l4 since both laser options dont got a cap bonusand the abaddon takes noticeable more damage now requiring noticeable more cap to rep it up as i tested it out after the patch it did feel a bit less stable overall if you can call a 3m 10s setup stable old cap booster setups on the apoc need less changes for older players overall runtime of the hulls gets slightly improved not really enough to drop a cap mod but new players will notice itfor pvp the change would obviously make some fleet setups run a bit longer with the same amount of cap charges but the biggest improvement would be better runtime for nano kitting setups making the rigs a more useful option compared to other popular energy rigging choicesoptimal tracking damage rof while the power grid penalty is a hard one on active tanking setups the higher bonus might actually convince some people to use them
personally dont think 5 is enough to make a dent most of the pure laser boats that remain have had their cap bonus removed with few corresponding increases in cap  but ill big it up nonetheless since every little bit countswatched the odd gameplayslashinterview with fozzie and he has the right idea but is at a loss as to how to achieve it  he knows that blanket cap increases will lead to neuting and other madness ex old apoc but acknowledges that lasers are off as it were and suggested that one thing hed like to explore was to make them heinously unstable but with stellar performance comparatively  alternative is to continue down the path of watering them down with capfitting decreases and placing them squarely in between autos and blasters yawn
well it is not intended to be the all end fix to amarr and laser problems however i think it is a step in the right direction i made this after a lot of discussion here on the german forums and ingame about the matter it isnt even the case that i got big issues with the changes atm i even feel they are great if i look at the navy apoc now but i do realize other people play a bit differently and might not agree with me for that matteri played around with a few ideas and adjusting discharge rigs a bit seamed to be the most sensible solution it gives newer players the useful option to use discharge fittings early on and reduces the issues many people got with her bs after the change to more manageable levels if i look at my navy apoc1xt1 and 1xt2 discharge rig it improves cap life from 35 to 4 minutes with conflag and 45 to 5 with multi frequency so it is quite a noticeable improvement and it does scale very good for lower skill levelsi am also a bit concerned what will happen with lasers and amarr in a more complex makeover time will tell i guess
switch out the cap recharger for a cap booster dont permarun the repper problem solved
sounds like a great idea just please dont merge i dont want to be reading troll posts from dustie alts as well
i was just thinking when and if the devs were ever to look at missioning maybe we could get some missions that use the hacking system that was just addedexample we need you to go hack a serpentis comm satellite we found if you succeed at hacking without getting noticed you get some bonus reward of some sort if you fail the hacking game the mission can still be completed but you have to fight through a few level appropriate npcs and youd loose the bonus rewardanother thing that could be pvp like is to attack a pirate mining fleet youd have to go in pop some mining vessels and get out before escorts arrive to get the bonusi also think it would be nice when if you kill a mission complete npc or too many npcs for those that have more than one or two foes half of the enemies give or take would flee so if my domi pops 3 battleships and 5 bcs some of the other ones think twice about hanging around
saying that ring mining is not currently in the cards is not the same as saying that significant revamps to moon mining arent in the cards after technetium alchemy was introduced fozzie promised more changes in the future and here we are in odyssey and with the odyssey devblog fozzie said that lets seesourcepersonally my opinion has always been that the concept of ring mining was a rough idea wrapping up several necessary design criteria for any moon mining revamp but that the specifics were open for interpretation
first thank you for replying i know the csm sometimes cant or wont comment on certain issues but it is nice when they dosecondly im not entirely sure why you have assumed that ring mining must be in someway linked to moon mining and tech ii production if im missing a post announcement or dev blog then please let me knowmy purpose was simply to show player support for the activity of ring mining as another branch of mining and not for its larger implications on production poss or anything else i saw it as an alternative activity to mining belts and clouds and something for miners to do not all miners can or want to maintain and manage a pos or its production chain also with the trend of moving certain items out of npc hands and making them player created comes a potential need for new minerals ores or resources that ring mining could provide without stepping into the area of tech ii productionfinally not aimed at mynnna but general readers when i say ring mining its important to understand i mean planetary rings and not rings of asteroids that would be belt mining and is an entirely different debatethank you
i actually like the idea of the all roids being in a true ring around the sun something that would make life more interesting for miners is to have them look almost the same and be generically named until you run a scanner on them or try to refine them this would make the scanner a useful tool instead of hanger clutter i dont know of any miners who use one these days due them only telling you how much is left in that particular roid the nameless convention could be carried almost all the way to refining stage and have a few useless materials thrown in too to mix it up you dont want the useless stuff fit a scanner so that you can avoid mining it in the first place what do you think
soundwaves initial comments at last fanfest talked about putting moon minerals in the ringsand in response to the op mining in general badly needs a revamp and expansion whether that specifically involves ring mining or some other new types of mining is of lesser importance
ah thank you ive watched some of this years fanfest but not all would this be the game design  balancing tears  laughter part

well played sirjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
 but in all seriousness im not sure why you quoted those two things in particulardont suppose you could humor me and spell it out for me
oh my new ideas regarding cloakingoh waitdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i dont recall saying my ideas were original either
the horse is dead you can stop beating it nowdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
thats what they said about learning skills
no actually they wanted them removed ccp just took their time in doing it destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
im usually on the side of not making eve easier or on the side of making life a living hell for the weakbut yeah no this is not a good idea
ccp also wants to do something about cloaking and local and that entire bloody intel spectrumi did not expect this thread to garner support mainly because it a makes cloaking better which scares the people who hate afk cloaking and b it makes it possible to detect cloakers which scares the people who love afk cloaking its a balanced solution that pisses off both camps my proposal is basically remove local combined with allow cloakers to be probed its far more balanced than either solution on its own but that doesnt matter because people are self absorbed and dont like compromisedo you remember what it was that actually got learning skills fixed it was a person in authority basically getting sick of seeing all the topics and then going up to somebody and saying hey you fix it now because im paying you the problem is not resources the problem is not designs the problem is not convincing ccp that its an issue that needs dealing with the problem is priority this entire clusterfuck could be fixed in the next patch if somebody in authority mandated it but nobody in authority is mandating it so it isnt getting dealt withi made this thread for two reasons 1 query public response to compromise which went about as well as i expected and 2 to contribute to the growing pool of complaints so that maybe somebody in authority will stumble across the thread and get pissed enough to actually finally say the word to get this stupid thing dealt withhonestly i dont care what ccp does to cloaking because i know whatever it is itll be better thought out and more balanced than anything most people on this forum could proposei just want to see it get done
youll have to provide me with the wide spectrum of information that relates to ccp wanting to do something about cloaking something thats on a par with the learning skill debate i doubt you can but we shall seethey do want the intel separated from local and i agree this has been long talked about i would also agree this is on a par with the learning skill debatebut now we get to the crux of the matter this thread is really all about afk cloakers you have an axe to grind we get it oh my do we get it but these ideas have been talked to death the complaints regarding cloaking have been going on for years mostly from those too ignorant of the actual mechanics at play or that believe they should have almost perfect safety in nullthis thread will not garner any more or less support than others have on the same subject but i see thats not your point here the point is simply to keep flooding the forum with such threads and hope that by mere weight and repetitiveness youll force ccp into actiondestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
the extent of it is a couple of mutters at fanfast panels mostly its not as explicit as afk cloaking is bad so much as a noncommital cloaking is something we want to take a look atthing is intel and stealth are implicitly intertwined you cant cleanly separate themyour presumptions are understandable but highly inaccurate im concerned with cloaking as a whole stealth in eve poorly implemented and i take issue with it the reason you think this is about afk cloaking is because it would be physically impossible to make a thread about cloaking and have it not touch on afk cloaking in some way shape manner or form i do believe my implementation would fix afk cloaking but thats not why i pieced it togetheri probably wouldve made an intelrelated proposal but a im not qualified to do it because my knowledge on intel gathering is disparate at best and b such a proposal would necessitate widespread changes and people are generally bad at thinking holistically if you write a list of a dozen interconnected changes people will take one or two of those changes isolate them and then tell you why your idea sucks whilst ignoring how those two changes interact with the other tenaccurate if inelegant i do believe my ideas have merit on their own im not just here to spam but thats part of the bigger picture
crude if funny suggestions like this make me happyi am not saying i endorse them but i like seeing themyou have a rough fight fire with fire approach which might be practical if it did not force everyone to be cloaked in order to be safethat describes how some people play in wormholes although i have no doubt there are exceptionsoh and even in wormholes they cant find each other when cloaked which would make null into a rather odd place to livefascinatingupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
could you elaborate on this
while recommending an old home remedy is all well and good for a temporary fix to alleviate discomfort it does nothing to address the root issue at hand the fact is that for some players who had no issues plaing this game previously it has now begun to affect their physical health and that is a very bad thingwhats the suggestion for those of us who have reported migraines triggered from this effect im afraid ginger isnt going to cut it in this case ive been trying to look away or cover the screen with another window but if im jumping into a potentially hostile environment the delay in awareness of my surroundings could potentially be the difference between virtual life and death it puts myself and similarly affected players at a disadvantagethe response in the feedback thread has been loud and clear on this and many other problems with the new expansion i would echo the request that you members of the csm as our representatives pressure ccp to address these issues at the very least we need some communication from ccp that they recognize that there are problems and are willing to listen as so far they have been silent on the subject
what do you do when the fight finds you with expensive assets in highsec it becomes a very logical place for war and aggression the mentality of the victim not withstanding
dock up and play the markets or switch to an alt until the deccers get bored i think that what benteen was pointing out is that a lot of people who are playing in highsec are trying to avoid pvp situations as its just not their thing and they wont be willing to indulge the pvpers at all no matter what you cant break someones willingness to fight if their first instinct is to avoid that conflict in the first place

actually no somebody i know for yearshe is not to bad at pushing l4 times got a lot of issues with this strategy on his new navy apoc because it only runs as long as my setup with the difference that he needs to permarun his cap booster while i relay on cap recharge and cap use reduction with 2 rig slots and a low slot mod more spend on cap stuffas a second note i never run cap booster setupsi tried they are terrible and think they are bad for pve especially on amarr hulls
i ran a cap booster setup for ages  had no problems with it there is no reason that you have to run a repper permanently for l4s  thats where most of your cap is going if your friend claims that he has to permarun the cap booster he is either a also permarunning his repper because hes too lazy to pay attention to it b has really really bad cap related skills for the fit  needs to sort that out or c is lying even with average cap related skills the cap booster setup lets you drop the cap rigs to pickup more damage or better rep capability
im pretty sure he didnt permarun the repper and his problem is actually exactly that he didnt fit a single cap related module except the cap booster on the apoc like he did before the patch with the cap bonus change the apoc is down to 14 volleys with multi frequency or 12 with conflagration per 800er cap charge if you add some repping and constant capacitor drains like hardeners and tcs this means about 2 cap charges per minuteafter ammo and a container for spare crystals you look at around 2324 charges what translates into a runtime of 115 and 12 minutes what isnt enough for some l4 while his problem will not change without him changing rigs coming a bit out of his comfort zone for tank and dropping his t2 rof rig i think he might be ok if he uses a single 30 discharge rig it isnt a bad idea if we keep it nice and simple for people with her old cap booster setups a setup that doesnt need one needs 1 med 1 low 2 rigs and a setup that gains a bit more efficiency if you use one needs 1 rig 1 med slot i think that should be a viable ratio to anybody
i think youre right in terms of rigs in general need improving which fozzie has said he will look at doingbut i think on a general setup you shouldnt need cap rigs on a ship to get decent cap it should only really be for cap stable fitsor for mwd kiting shiptech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
amarr hulls with cap bonuses have a very similar runtime as hybrid hulls since apparently nobody liked cap bonuses ccp changed them for some weapon related bonuses as explained in the amarr bs balancing thread dropping the cap bonus is just switching around some modulesrigs on high sp fittings this is also the reason why i dont have issues with itdischarge rigs provide weapon cap use bonuses similar to the old ones on the hulls and are a better option than ccc stacking on high sp levels where you can burn a lot of cap with lasers and hulls without a cap bonus like explained before the scaling makes them more effective with less slots investedbetter run time with high damage ammo less with low cap ammo because of the same scaling principals newer players with t1 weapons cant utilize this fitting feature properly and will lose performance without the cap bonus on the hulls in many cases to address this i made this proposal as a positive side effect i hope people can be similar happy as i am with the new apoc and navy apoc in pve
you are more forgiving than most problem is that once upon a time the cap bonuses were warranted as lasers were awesome and the ships were more than competitive with only one bonus  now after umpteen boosts to the three other systems laser are barely on par even with twin weapon bonuses and those now have the cap issue on top of the comparatively weak weaponsit is my hope that ccp eventually decides on restoring the awesome to lasers cap be damned amarr has been a gangfleet race from the getgo lol midslots  so making the top performers dependent on outside assistance when operating at their peak is perfectly in tune with my idea of amarr  as long as there are some solo options available i am good with most hulls needing serious sacrifices outside of the group
i am well aware that cap bonuses where intended as damage bonusesand actually where pretty solid that where build into lasers already and served as restriction for other hulls to not fit lasers because lasers where simply better a lot got changed over the years with other weapon systems and hulls gallente hulls are no longer fitting starvedstill utterly terrible at point blank compared to pre qr abilitys minmtar hulls with acs actually do some dps at range and caldari are the new medium range kings with the cm update in my opinion by dropping the cap bonuses adding speed range and tracking to the hulls rise tries to bring lasers back to a point where they can not just compete but dominate other options in fleet pvpthe new navy apoc is a awesome example for that if you can handle fitting and capacitor restrictions even for solo and small gang the hulls look a lot more competitive nownavy omen can kite like a zealot geddon is a very useful addition and the new apoc can be played like a nano pest with super high rangeif you look at the old designs with only the cap bonus most used off racial weapons not because lasers where bad but because the extra fitting and cap saving could be used to build massive tanks and provide overall better performance in pure ehpdps fights with the new approach of giving out weapon bonuses instead of cap bonuses rise tries to amplify the advantage of laser fittings on the hulls making them hit harder further and better than other ships in her classwhile the change to discharger rigs doesnt look like much it will suddenly help a lot of new players and pure pve players to get back to the point they where before odyssey and make the process of changing old habits for amarr players less harsh since i am sure rise wants to drop even more cap bonuses on other hulls this isnt bad in my opinion as long as you have the ability to chose between a cap hungry minmax setup or something that can be made fairly cap stable with a few adjustments in the riggingmedlow slot department not just for high sp players but every amarr player
definitely my hopes

i dont appreciate having my side of a discussion being called a rant much like i dont like being told to deal with it or be told your argument boils down to strawman xi had hoped for a more grownup attitude it disappoints me that you are one of the faces representing our communitythat said my responses to your points1  as a consumer of the product i dont agree that we as a community should so ardently defend ccps methods of obtaining our cash but obviously im not opposed to seeing a company make moneythat ccp has a monetary reason for the current setup doesnt change the fact that its unfriendly to users this is basically my point dct costs more than a second account while offering the user less that it makes sense from ccps point of view doesnt change that it doesnt make much sense from a subscribers point of view2  your second point seems very similar to the first ccp makes more money this way the ppv analogy works so far as an account is concerned but i dont see the comparison when applied to dct i want to run a second character constantly year after year on the same account as my primary where are the points of comparison with ppv therei want to be locked in for a year continuing your analogy im being charged a years worth of evenings at the perevening charge as opposed to the peryear which id prefer
then you should be running a second account
you seemed to suggest cloaked vessels would be undetectable when cloaked except by other cloaked vesselstherefore to defend against cloaked hostiles it would be needed to have cloaked vessels standing guardthe balance point to this must deal with the absence of local at least regarding cloaked vesselsi would suggest something differentfor local
okay having read the response and thought about it i think the suggestions in the op are too much it gives too much to the cloaked ship i think there should be a small chance to see the cloaked ship wihtout a new mechanice scan probes etc and that could be something like keeping cloaks and the jump cloak as they are nowbasicallyyou wont show in local until you deactivate your jump cloakyou will be removed from local once you activate your own cloaking device if you have onegiven the two above you at least be visible for a very short amount of time jumping in and out of a systemthus if the pilot ratting in a system is not paying attention his risk factor just went up if he went afk even while at a pos his risk factor just went up and so forthat the same time i also like the idea that the cloaked ship cannot view local as well now he has to use dscan and warp aroundie work for his inteland in addition a way of finding cloaked ships in system should be introduced be it with scan probes a module whatever thus if a guy is ratting and warps to a pos to go take a leak and is nervous somebody may have come in system and is waiting to do bad things to himUFFFD then hell have to rescan the system just as the cloaker no longer gets quicky intel without some risk neither does the ratternikks suggestions cover most of this iirc the op is moving somewhat in that direction but is not comprehensive enough and imo gives too much to cloaksnote that with the above the idea of afk cloaking is pointless even without some way of finding the cloaked vessel since you dont show up in local you cant have any impact adding in a way to detect cloaked ships will introduce risk to afk cloaking as well further discouraging it at least for long periods of time
highsec cap restriction will be an issueplanting either low or npc null pocket with station into every sov null area as staging ground would be a good idea of course not if youre null farmer terrified of neuts but good for eve as a whole
before you even comment on my corpalliance i lived in wormholes for years and before that was a lowsechighsec minerfact is outside of obviously stupid pipes like hed most entracnes tofrom nulllowhigh are completely empty because no one wants to guard the entrance to a pipe thats not in the optimal route to a trade hub because people rarely take that routenot only that but 90 of the time if your in a cloak or fastwarp capable ship nullsec dwellers will ignore you because you pose very little threat and the timeeffort required to try and bring you out to be killed would be better spent maintaining the daily orderroutinefact is nulllow is and always will be accessible to people of any skill so long as they learn what ships are capable of what covops ship gets more or less freeroam of nullsec if you know how to fit it and fly it properlyhonestly the only real issue nullsec has is power projection which promotes megaempires since a single fleet can go anywhere very fast and it actually becomes quicker the more shipspilots you have which is the opposite of what should happen
this would have to work both ways and it wouldnt end up like youre expecting you would have a horde of newbies and carebears against organized alliances that make their living killing people highsec would cease to exist whether or not this is a good thing is a subject of some debate in the meantime if you really want to get into null go to providence one of the few nrds pockets of null and only one jump out of highsec as long as you dont shoot anyone or steal wrecks youll do fine
ill tell you what form up two hundred guys grab some sbus and head to vfk i see youre in a player corp so you wont have any trouble anchoring them that way you dont remove absolutely everything that makes null worth being in and dont just ad extra highsec for people to ignorelet us know what happens you seem to think itll be easy to do so go on and do it
i enjoy perhaps i should say enjoyed the hackingarcheology changes post june 4th up until odyssey 104this most recent change to scatter containers seems to go against the idea that the solo hacker should be able to get about 12 the containers the spread speed in addition to the opposing vectors means i barely have time to get 13 of them if im lucky let alone if i take the moment to try to read the labels in addition i now have to get closer than 2000m to the dataarcheology container before i kill the core if i plan on getting any significant portion of the loot being in hostile space the only defense i have on my covops frig is to cloak this range difference puts me at an even more significant disadvantage even when im under the cloak perimeter i still cannot get 12 the cans of course i havent tried randomly clicking on the closest cansin its current iteration i can not believe that this scattering dynamic keeps the solo hackerarcheologist anywhere close to the preexpansion income level let alone anywhere close to june 5th9thmy thoughts as to steer this away from a flame postperhaps the containers could scatter from a single random point in the quadrant the player is hacking from seeing it in print it seems like that was the way it was beforeperhaps fewer containers could appear without labels with mixedrandomized contentsperhaps increasing the range of the looting beam to help mitigate some of the difficulty due to the newwider spread perhaps the cans could last a little longer and keep the new spread spawningperhaps the cans could spawn in clusters of type so we could concentrate on a specific type chasing then down so to speak to limit the overall types of loot a single player could receive from a single spawn containeridk im frustrated after spending a few hours searching under populated nullsec for datarelic sites and the first one i come across being unable to loot any significant portion of the cans i did learn something today there dont seem to be any datarelic sites in drone space i personally would love to see the kind of drone relics i might be able to come across and a massive drone communications network might produce some strangeinteresting lootlil
not sure it has been brought up before butwould it be possible to ask ccp to change the universe and solar system map screens to windows that can be resized and moved instead of taking over the entire screen everything else in eve appears to be a window that can be opened and closed or minimized except the map

i like this idea i also like the idea that anyone can click on itbut i think those that click on it should get a portion of the treasure and the partial value each character receives should be less than the value received if a single character collected it the collection range of these loot spawns would have to be modified proportionally to the mining turrets lil

i am 100 ok with that if you can push jita to 00 by taking and holding the surrounding areas perimeter to 04 etc after all all null has low around it then good for youof course to do so youd need to take all the planets as well using dustbunnies but hey thats what they are for right that said if you nullify jita dont be surprised if the caldari empire decides to take it back as the husband of one of our corpies very accurately commented in teamspeak he does not even play evespace is infinite why are there choke points at all
obviously stupid pipes  precisely my point there are too many of these at the moment try living in drone regions when you are not blue to anyone in the inner reigons for cyno routes it is simply too far to be worth the bother  the rats are rubbish the lack of loot means no free meta 4 parts for pvp expendable ships the additional jump distance adds a horrid overhead to all your exports in short the map makes that entire reigon dead and yes i have lived there and until recently so did my mains alliance we left because the map makes it economically better to be in highsec than that reigon  even with the mining changes we didnt want to leave but our members were losing isk badly  due to the map thats crapinitially all ccp needs to do is to look at where people play in nullsec and very importantly where they do not play nearly all of nullsec is empty much is not even claimed whole reigons are dead you can go a dozen jumps before you find someone and they simply flee to their mining pos yay ccpbased on pure player numbers this game is absolutely highsec based so if we want highsec players to go to nullsec we need to stop making it so damn hard to live out there a few npc stations in highsec islands to act as trade hubs and the surrounding 4 or 5 lowsec systems to act as cyno points would spice things up and be consistent with the lore of the game tired of the endless war with gallente the caldari empire in a bold move attacked system xxxxxx this morning  if not stopped they will add the system to their empire in 7 days and sure there should be a couple billion isk sbu that is freely attackable by anyone without concord response that you can drop back into highsec  which if successfully deployed and defended for a week drops the security of the system by 01 nullify jita in a month or two go for it  if you can
been there done that what happens in null to independent alliances is this1 set up goes great everyone has heap of fun2 lots of activity in system 10 to 25 players in local all day3 random neuts come in people start losing ships but enjoy the pvp4 fleets of t2 ships come in typically cynnabals falcons and talos losses increase as t1 ships  new players get slaughtered5 player numbers in system fall6 afk cloaky campers move in typically cloaky tengu etc7 miner ship losses increase8 all mining ceases due to cloakies industry index falls badly9 miners return to highsec because they cant mine any more and are losing isk badly10 ratters return to highsec because their miner friends have all left11 insufficient player numbers active in system to justify the sov bills12 exit from nullsecthat is typically what happens the twist is someone like pandemic legion flips from blue protector providing top cover from sov invasion to standover extortionist that simply accelerates 12 because 3 to 11 is still happening anywaywe can see ccps attempts to change the above by other actions namely the rumours of changes to cloaking and the massive nerf to t3 cruisers currently in the works to me the t3 changes are really unnecessary the issue in nullsec derives from the map and access issues not from how powerful or not a single cloaked ship happens to be without highsec islands out there in the raggedy edge independent alliances will inevitably be forced back to highsec seen it over and over and over  and because holding sov does not require anyone to actually play in a system nothing will change imagine if you lost sov if you did not maintain military 3 or industry 1 every 7 days especially with the cloaky camper mechanicsso yes nullsec is dead and empty but for pos on moons extracting goo for mega corps has been that way for years now i dont want to see that continue for the next decade time to change the map and really spice things up
npc 00 exists you know
keeping this bumped 1 from me  btw love the idea belt rats could now spawn at different parts of the belt at planets we i really dont see a downside except for having to reseed it but it would be worth it
i agree with this when i use the star map i typically minimize the map control window which contains the only button that can get you out of the map to lazy to look for keyboard shortcut for map then i have to hunt for where on the neocom the control window put itself to exit the map the star map should be a window
if i leave the game for a month or two why should i lose my corpif one of the many military players goes on deployment and lets their account lapse why should they lose their corpif i go inactive and all my stuff is removed where is the incentive to come back
if you leave for a month or two wouldnt others in your corp be there do defend your stationif you are a solo corp then what right do you have to occupy and hold a moon from active playersi understand the sacrifice that the armed forces and others undertake and sympathize with the difficulties of a persistent game universe vis a vis real life commitments if you know you are going to be away then you have time to park assets where they will be safe or let others know about leavingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

svetlana id like to drive passengers around in my carmalcanis buy a bus its a better system for thatsvetlana but i already have a car and id like to use my car and theres no reason i shouldnt be able tomalcanis nope buy the bus
actually your analogy should be more like thissvetlana i am renting a car and i would like to drive myself and a passenger out of statemalcanisyes you can do that but driving out of state with another passenger could work out to be more expensive than hiring another car depending on how long youre gonesvetlanabut its my hire car why should it be more expensivemalcanis actually its ccps car and those are the rules but you can hire another car for that passenger and it could work out cheaper again depending on how long youre gonesvetlanano no no i want to use this car its not fairmalcanisbut i hate analogies like this because they are ridiculousdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
 magsim not saying thats not the case  obviously it is im saying its ridiculous and it should be changed
your argument boils down to cost as you expect it to be cheaper sorry but no thats not the point of this mechanic as has been explained time and againthis mechanic works out cheaper for short runsa second account works out cheaper for the long runuse it for either or dont use it at all the choice is yoursdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
if everywhere was 00 there wouldnt be any hisec00 choke points i for one am tired of empire eve is suposed to be a cold and ruthless enviroment were the survivors battle it out over limited resources after the wormhole to the rest of spaceearth collapsedconcord should only be in the main starting systems joining a faction upon leaving should be built into the end of the tutorials which makes you an automatic enermy of concord for joining a factionhisec should become factional warfare systems lowsec should become null the longer the cancer of eve that hisec is remains the more broken the game becomeschun
sowhy would it take a week to annex vfk for an empire but two months to annex jita for a nullsec group should be the same both ways of course highsec doesnt actually have the organisation to conquer anythingas for your npc highsec islands with safe cyno places thats what npc nullsec is for adding in areas of highsec smack in the middle of whats supposed to be dangerous space with the sole intent of making it safer kind of defeats the entire purpose of nullsecand just because you got shafted by some droneland slumlord doesnt mean the whole of nullsec should be redesigned to suit you personally
then why is there no rational distribution of npc nullsec to ensure access to remote systems even by your logic which i dont agree with the map is really badly made leading to dead and empty regionsthe problem with nullsec is not that it is far away or hard to live in it is that massive regions of nulllsec it is so utterly dead that there is nothing to do for pvpers it is unhealthy for any corp to have miners in null and pvpers in lowsec because there is simply not enough pvp to be found in nullsecnearly all the small gang pvp in the game is currently in lowsec whole major alliances have withdrawn from nullsec to low because other than moons yea thats watching paint dry laugh a minute spreadsheet fun unless you have a good protecated war with someone null is just boring and its boring because there are too few people who actually play thereso dont call me a highsec carebear or try to guess reasons for my post my reason for posting is i am concerned about the health of the game and of the success of the odyssey patch being undermined by the legacy map issues space should not be full of choke points and capital fleets should take a lot longer to move than they currently do so that there is actual strategy in this game againeve used to be a better pvp game it got dumbed down by instantalwayskill typhoon builds for ganking iterons and pay to win dreadnaught fleets things need to change because currently if one of the majors lose rather than a rejuvenation of nullsec we are much more likely to see only the odd moon extraction pos out there with not a single pvp target for entire reigonsthere were once wars that had been going on for years but lets be honest about the state of nullsec  many of the old pvp alliances have simply quit the game now there are members of the r64 cartel and while they occasionally fight over who gets to have which moons once that fighting is done they will be back to logging in their highsec ganker alts and lowsec pvp alts because there is simply nothing to do in null any more until the next war which may take a year or two to happen
id be fine with it taking longer for highsec empires to take null i ould also be fine with nullsec alliances that have sov 4 being able to declare for one of the empires and have thier system convert to a caldari empire 05 which they could then upgrade the sov on to 10  such a system should keep thier ihub and rat spawns but the station would be npc owned unless the sov got knocked back down to 00 againbottom line bad maps in ffa pvp mmos harm the game by falsely skewing the population to play in certain areas places further away need better resources to justify the cost of getting there and back where as in eve distance traveled has a jump fuel cost instead we have areas in eve that are a long way away but which are badly inferior to other closer areas of the game it is no wonder such areas are dead and empty  presenting nothing more than wasted game server resources and lost opportunities fix the map  more fun pvp dont like my proposed solution make a better proposal but make no mistake this games growth continues to be sluggish and in my view a key culprit is nullsec is the map particularly in combination with other archaic and poorly designed mechanics noone fights a war to take a station any more  they just drop caps and youre done no need to ever play there not good enough for going into the second decade
highsec should only be 0810 systems and concord response time should increase to at least 30 seconds also move incursions and l4 missions out of highsec

i apologize and stand correctednames are a constant frustration in a lot of games once taken never released so you wind up with alternate spellingsbut even they start to run out after a whileso how long is too long how long is not long enough more importantly how can we differentiate between corps that will never ever resurrect and the ones that are just on a breakmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
well that sounds like an occasion for a new mechanicsure implement a timer for inactive corps send warning eve mails and eventually emails that a corp has been active long enough that the name is about to be released back into the pool and any items in the corp hangar will be deposited in the ceos hangar in the corresponding stationare you going on deployment for two years reserve your corp name for say 2 12 to 3 years make it something that can be done on the eve gate so you can update it from a laptop in afghanistan if necessary once the reservation is up the timer starts again soldiers frequently reup for tours because they cant bear the thought that theyre abandoning their teammates so this has to be able to be done multiple timesthat should take care of 99 of cases in the unlikely event that the departure is abrupt say an eve player is kidnapped and resurfaces two years later to find their corp and assets gone the petitioni should say support ticketmechanic is probably sufficient to the taskso require an active response and a set amount of time to reserve the name and ticker and it should be possible to release corp names and tickers back into the available pool

the new autopilot route path on user screen gives up many new opportunities for navigation and one click information but not give enough information about the systems which we must passour proposal is after setting of the autopilot if on the way there are systems which belong to the alliancecorporation with which we are in war or to a factions with which pilotcorporation have negative standing they start to flash or some other kind of indication in autopilot route path on user screenargumentsone of the most important things when we traveling is timely information about the absence or presence of the enemy and entering into the hostile territorythe addition of such information will be available to the pilot before he actually entered the enemys system or jump into the system where will be shooted by the policeit would prevent a lot of accidents in empire and make travel in lownull sec more safer and enjoyable
rationalize for me why that information should be displayed on the autopilot information instead of through the myriad of other tools ingame and out that supply all that information for pilots who are smart enough to check for such thingsie rationalize to me why we need handholding measures to prevent dumb when dumb can be prevented easily
adding some kind of notification before you jump in the system owned by faction to which you have negative standing like when you step through the gate from a high security to a system with low security to notify players that the next system is a system in which you will be attacked by police because of your negative standings with faction owner of this spaceargumentsvery long ago passed the time when the empire was safe and peaceful place to live and travel between 30 jumps was considered as a far away in todays dynamic times such option is a necessity once such a notice exist when you jump from high security to low security it should be append for this case also the danger for the pilot is the same and leads to a risk of loss your ship
do you not think that a criminal should himself take the responsibility to know where he is not welcome rather than asking the game to hold your handjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

this is how i would do it start slow make sure the change wont upset anyone even if its not as effective as a purge start with player names then move on to corp namesremove the names of characters who meet the following conditions1 trial account only2 account not active for more than 4 yearsso the only names cleared would be trial accounts that havent been played for 4 years while its going to produce fewer names than a deeper purge i bet it would free up thousands how many trial accounts were set up and not played in eves first 6 years once we get to removing unused corp names i would say 5 years any corp that hasnt had a char log in for 5 years gets recycled when someone from that corp logs in they need to pick a new name but everything else remains
disagreewhen ccp announced odyssey i made alt and corp with that namethey are both innactive but still my favoritelets kill inactive corps then characters remove inactive agents then inactive stargatesi see many systems are not used for weeks  remove them also
ill see the troll above and raise him one unused starbriidges will last forever it is the wear and tear on the busy ones yoo need to worry about after a certain number of cycles they will go down for maintenancethe idea of trial names being first on the block makes sense you love your name put a ring on itmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
exactly what it says on the tin you should be able to push a button to simply orbit a target based on your current distance from it if youre 5369 meters away from the target you start orbiting it at a distance of 5369 meters also you should be able to set current distance as the default orbit distancein addition a fall into orbit option would also be nice basically keep flying in your current direction until youre flying perpendicular to the target at which point you begin orbiting at that distance if youre flying away from the target this option simply causes you to orbit at your current distance you should be able to set this as a default orbit distance too
there may be an issue with high ranges due mostly to the grid system eve runs but i do see your pointiirc in the past i was able to set 400 as an orbit range but had to be within 150 to do it its been a while so my memory may be playing tricksi like the fall into orbit idea but wonder if it would also be affected by the grid systemdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i think orbit distance has a hard limit anyway 50km if youre further than that you just orbit at maximum distance or have the option disabled entirely
you can currently orbit at current range via the rightclick menu if you are closer than 100 km to the object its just not easily accessible if youre in a tense situation combat for exampleit would be nice to have better control over options like this

saturday bump
something i noticed about the current overviews crucibleretribution is that there are conflicting filters that are somewhat confusing and also lots of filters not listed in the options for instance i made an overview filter setting and selected all hostile npcs to show in it selecting all categories listed of those npcs but not a single npc ship showed at first i had to right click every kind as i encountered them and select add to overview this is because the categories in the filter settings only included general types like asteroid pirates or mission pirates but the actual pirates were set up by ship size and faction ie asteroid sansha battleshipso i spent two whole expansions adding ships to my overview and am probably not done yet i dont want to have to go through that again so please make all options available in the settings menus and if there are overlapping settings setting one on or off should toggle the others it applies to ie setting asteroid pirates on should turn asteroid sansha battleship on
do you have any idea of a time scale for any of thiseven to state that it is intended to be done within the next year would at least give us all something to look forward toonce again i would like to thank all those who have come up with such excellent proposals to improve the overviews
please at least fix the refining efficiency but it would be nice to have larger cargo bay in the medium intensive hauling 2 million m3 of unrefined ore out of a wormhole is silly
i hope it picks up more steam
it should its a good idea
its in the topic cargo scanner should not show profession can lootshowing the loot makes explorers skip the majority of containers just cherry picking the ones with pos module blueprints this is not exploration or an interesting treasure hunt this is just spam scanning and zipping between systems the optimal way to explore is to skip 90 of cans based on cargo scan and only do the minigame when you spot a shinyplease push the subject and make ccp nerf cargo scanner it is simply hateful to soon assume all sites scanned by previous visitors its taking the element of surprise out of hacking and archaeology and its just dull if cargo scanner did not show the contents exploration as profession would be much more balanced right now a tryhard player will trump ten roleplaying haxplorers by just spam scanning instead of hacking the sites in a slow manner
if you want another bad analogy to bring to the ccp table cargo scanning profession cans is the equivalent of cargo scanning ded complex gate to see the overseer loot
one of the things everyone always focuses on when they talk about eve is how players shape the universe from building empires to massive playerdriven economieswith this in mind why dont we have stock markets ingame a feature that would allow a corporation to create and sell shares in an open and transparent way much like any item you can find on the market it would allow individuals and groups looking to earn cash a way to invest in corporations that have ambition but lack the funds they requirehow would you prevent scams one might ask the short answer is you cant  there will always be front companies out there looking to milk investors for their own profits but i think overall this would be a good addition to the game bringing more forumbased deals out into the public eye for everyone to interact withthis really has been on a lot of peoples bucket list for the last decade
why is that in the launcher i can confirm my login info by hitting enter but to actually launch the game i have to grab my mouse and click a button why cant i just enter my password and hit enter twice to launch the game or better yet remove the entire useless launch game button all together surely when i enter my password and hit enter in the game launcher it means i want to play the game why does it need double confirmationare you absolutely 100 certain you want to start this gamecome on ccp
how about no both of those maps have various functions that require the probedscanfilter window to properly use which necessitates a large window to actually seeinteract with the tools there is no reason to make it a resizable window since at any size except for maxscreen it would be illegible unless your playing on a freakin tvthe fact that you are too lazy to press a single button that is always in the same spot whichever spot you choose to put it cause neocom is customizable ya know or for heavens sake a single hotkey doesnt mean ccp needs to make huge ui changesits a single button get over it
huh i didnt actually realize this but yeah explicitly id like to see it as a single button or at least an option for default orbital distance the menu just makes it kind of awkward i dont think it updates after youve opened the menu either so if youre moving fast it can actually get thrown off by a bit its one of those things that needs actual pushbuttongetthing control at least thats how i feel thank you for pointing it out though
ill donate lp to your cause when you can make your cause not full of douchebags that make me want to gouge out my eyesgood luck

lets not have this idea die a quiet death we need to get the tug class into evekeep posting your ideas and feedback so the csm has something solid to take to ccp for considerationsince ive been looking at incursions recently ive found the logistics of moving a battleship and a logistics hull impossible to do without resorting to contracts or by using a support alt to move the required gear there should be an easier way of moving rigged ships without resorting to the contract system it would also greatly assist with the movement of gear if you join a new corp
some feedback from ccp would be nicei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
well i think we need new refin system on poswe want whatsee pos never refine or that it is just harder and slowermaybe reduce the cpu  powergrid to see refinery stacker would be a good ideathis does not make the rafinage easier but simply affordable because now with the ratio we have think refine by pos is just stupidbut if we could refinent full stacker that it would make real pos industrial of refineidk can we have the dev device
i agree ban isboxer it is an artificial effect on gameplay which brings no benefit to the playerbase at large and discourages cooperation and interaction between players
devs have said for a long time that afk cloaking is not good gameplay maybe someday theyll do something about it
option b agreed bump
this idea has been suggested before numerous timesin spite of this it has never been implementedthis is dumbso ill throw in my support
well at least before you used to be able to just restart your client and reselect a character this behaviour is gone and now i have to shut down the client and open the launcher again etcan option that would close the client and just put a new client back up on character selection would be awesome
so i was going through the tutorial on combat and i pulled up the angular velocity i thinki noted that if you are going to fast your gun cant track the targetso then i adjusted so that my guns could track and found myself staring at the numbers for almost the whole fightwhich got me thinking about a color change if your guns cant tracki think it would be cool if you could set up your overview to change colors of your target if your guns cant track themit could be something as simple as a client side optiontype in the number you dont want to exceed and if it does change the color of the target modified as others have pointed out perhaps a better option would be a colored ring around each turretor just a dot or lightfor guns it could depict angular velocity and for missiles it could depict rangethat way can see at a glance if what you are shooting at is in range or missinggreen for in range or your guns can track the target and red for out of rangeyou could even add in a yellow for marginalif you want more info you can use the overview
dislike dont dumb the game down people should learn how to read the numbers
today i lost alot of isk because i canceled a order that i made by mistake if you modify an order then you get the brokers fee back but you dont when you cancel it i can understand the brokers fee if you sell the item you have on the marked but not if you cancel it then you should get the fee backi think you should have a look at the brokers fee since in this way its just another isk sink that dont make any sencebest regards dragunov skywolf
totally agree was just thinking this today
exactly and as for expensive assets i have very little and would usually just jump onto my alts anyway although occasionally i do like to head out into lowsec and nullsec for a break but its rare
great ideai would add some type of shielding native to the ship say radiationsimilar to the missions that give environmental damagefly a rifter into one of these rings and it could go pop pretty quickinstead of the charters i think that a faction or concord standing would be requirednot sure of the 10 drones i can see the 5 of coursealternately you could create an asteroid tractor beamhave a drone tag the rock and tractor it inthat would be competitive just like salvaging
interesting idea but i think it should be handled a different way the current mining mechanic is being messed with in ice mining now which means that the ore side of it will be also tweaked soon enough ccp can never leave things alone always have to nerf things for the sake of new ideas seems to always be the ccp idea of the dayperhaps using your idea with a pos mechanic would be a better reason to do it not to have it as an individual level item but something that should be at the corp level and does not have to be done at the alliance level something that requires teamwork
why so hostile a large tv doesnt add resolution by the way in most cases you lose resolution using a tvwhat makes you think that changing over the maps screen to a window is a huge ui change perhaps it is something fairly simple that they just havent got around to changing yetall i am asking is for the csm to bring up the question apparently ccp have been updating the rest of the ui and i wanted them to add this to the list if possiblebutton placement shouldnt really change on a conversion to a windowwhat will change for those that choose to use one account and multiple screens is the ability to move that map off to one sideeverything else about eve that i have seen so far is that you can have multiple windows open and can do lots of things at the same timeright up to the point of trying to probe or look at the map then you are stuck with just that screen it doesnt make any sense
i would make that 1 year for trial accounts personally if someone hasnt logged in to their trial account for more than a year then too damn bad this isnt about being nice its about meting out some fairness a trial is a free thing to activate and is designed for people to get a feel for the game if they havent logged in their trial toon for a year then chances are it was either an alt or the game failed to captivate that playeri didnt activate my trial character for 2 years after his creation date and to be honest that if my toon had been blasted i might have been better off  i had totally forgotten how to play the game redoing the tutorials would have saved me a lot of time and heartache whether or not i would have been able to get this name back is kind of irrelevant who actually remembers some trial account from 2 years ago
in the beginning for those that have been around long enough the only way to live out in null was out of a pos i have lived in deep null before ie 50 jumps from anywhere and refined using poss it wasnt fun then and certainly isnt fun nowthen along came outpost building and poss were completely forgotten about for the most partyes we want the whole refining arrays updated are there many ways to do it yeswhy dont we refine from a pos1 there is always an outpost nearby in null2 refining loses 25 off the top3 we have the rorqual to compress raw ore to transport4 poss have never been near the top of the dev love listthere are many things that need to be updated on pos refining my op lists a few updates to what might be possibleif you want to make it really better then completely remove the time  refining loss caps eg make it instant  skillstanding based  just like it is everywhere else leave a pgcpu req since it is a pos mod that has to be onlined just like the manufacturing modules are nowhrolt ceo live free die proud

would you like to provide support for your argument or just spout your opinionartificial effect on gameplay false the game is being playedno benefit to the playerbase false multiboxers contribute to the game and ingame economy equally to that of non isoboxermultiboxersdiscourages interaction between playerscooperation false isboxer allows multiaccount owners to use their accounts plain and simple if a player chooses to play by themselves or with people it would be the same using isoboxer or not
because of this thread i went and got isboxer to play with it  or rented it for a better word cause its subscription basedseriously if you can set up the sucker to manage 10 accounts the level of work involved is still a loti have seen on youtube players running 6 battleships to do missions but it still means they are paying 6x as much plex and yes i can understand making isk faster but six times faster if you can do that amount of work pretty sure you deserve the resultsright now one dedicated exploration toon running null sites should make more iskhour then someone isboxing anoms at least when you have to plex all the accounts to keep em running
1 i vote for this
supported its a pain on the fundement to switch characters
never stop believing
because your ship is composed of mechanical and electronic components that are designed to work and thinking for you the autopilot is part of the ai of your ship set to replace the pilot when neededonce the autopilot can distinguish systems with high security and low security and inform you for them why can not to make it for the sovereignty of the system and to whom it belongs provided that in both cases it is a one and same game mechanicsfrankly i doubt that when you setup your autopilot to travel from jita to amarr you use social networks or through the myriad of other tools ingame and outand again thick underlinewe are talking about improving the performance of a ai component of your star ship not for the player skills and intelligent UFFFDwelcome i am aura your electronic assistantUFFFDUFFFD
so youre basically asking for ccp to implement a bot to do your playing for you while youre afk no
it is not dumbing down the game if the player has to input the thresholdit is simply a visual que nothing moreat the very least it will make people aware
learn to add transversal to your overview like everybody else
huh that is why i posted to begin withi found the the way the game depicts transverse rather inefficient and thought that having a color change change of the very same numbers would help rather then staring at a decimal point for the entire fighti am beginning to understand why people call this game spreadsheets onlineit is not that the game has lots of number crunching but that the players actually enjoy looking at them instead of the ships
youre not entirely correct this idea of displaying combat relevant information outside the overview in an easily accessable and visual way isnt a new one it has been requested before and most players would propably welcome such changes since it would involve looking at the main view screen instead of staring at numbers in the overview the entire fight there is just a section of the playerbase that defends the old way of doing things no matter how bad or stupid that way actually is so dont get discouraged by it just make your case the best you can address any constructive criticisms and hope your idea gets added to ccps thingstodo list
the changes to industry and exploration that came with odyssey were good in many ways null sec now has much more industrial capacity although we have yet to see a significant increase in the activities that capacity can support industrialists have been given more means to function in null sec but have yet to be given a motive to move these players will no be forced out of high sec they need to see something that makes them want to go despite the added risk many will never leave high sec but the bigger that incentive is the more will go even weeks after odyssey i still have not seen any justification for the move from gav sites to anomalies why it just does not make sense let us consider some points  there will now be more targets for ganker as everyone knows ganker prefer targeting players that can not shoot back like miners now all those miners hiding in the grav sites will be sitting duck targets for gankers no there will not the miners that were sitting in those hidden belts before were only there because they could mitigate the risk they were only vulnerable to ships with probe launchers or cunning gankers that would set up traps as both of those are rather rare the risk level was acceptable now that the tools to mitigate that risk have been taken away those miners that were hard to find before will not even be there now they will not be sitting ducks just waiting for a ganker to stumble upon them like a rat in a belt they will move to somewhere that they do not have to rely on luck for survival  players who never bothered with exploration before now have a mechanic drawing attention to it exploration will become much more common yes this is true odyssey will encourage many who have never tried exploration before to give it a try but what does this have to do with grav sites changing grav sites to anomalies does nothing to improve this moving ice fields to anomalies was a nice change they were static belts before not grav sites this would have made them slightly harder to find for those that do not know how to activate their ship scanner however considering that is automated now ice fields are basically exactly the same effort to find as they were before you just click on the list of scanned sited rather than the overview not a big deal at all but a step towards eliminating the over view entirely which i understand is a goal eventually however why include grav sites in this it would have made sense to move all static belts to anomalies to get them off the overview but grav sites and static belts are very different things while this was a good change for ice belts it was very bad for grav sites why eliminate grav sites make all the static belts aonamlies like the ice fields but leave the grav sites as they were grav sites offered improved iskhr to the miners over the static belts available in the same system but at the cost of being harder to find you needed the skills and equipment to finbd them to get that improved iskhr now they are as easy to find as static belts  imbalance 1 grav sites offered increased income for those willing to put in the extra effort now they are available to anyone via the new active scanner why is that not what static belts are for if this is the way the game is heading then just remove all static belts and add more ore anomalies and all mining can be done in anomalies it makes no sense to offer the higher value belts at zero effort required to find them  imbalance 2 grav sites outside of high sec offered a extra layer of security considering that mining ships are sitting ducks with no way of defending themselves they need all the protection they can get when operating in dangerous space with the protection of the grav sites mining ships were only really threatened by other ships with the means to scan them down through the use of dscan you would see the probes and have plenty of notice to warp to safety before the potential gankers arived provided you were paying attention not semi afk to some this seemed to be excessively safe yet mining in these sites in low sec and npc null sec was still very uncommon why while the threat to miners is not just while they are mining they are slow travellers and they still nedd to get the ore to a station once it is mined low sec and npc null sec where still to dangerous to be worth the risk even with that added safety of the grav sites yet this layer of safety was removed making mining even more dangerous in these areas than before now any ship can see the ore anomaly within seconds of jumping into the system and the miner will not get any warning on dscan via scanning probes that there is an incoming threat where a miner could once mine with the only real threat being hostile probers now every ship that jumps into the system is an immediate threat this is not a slight increase in risk but an astronomical increase in risk to an activity that was already such a high risk almost nobody did it  imbalance 3 mining deep inside alliance territory has always been fairly safe with good intel channels you know about gankers while they are several jumps out you rarely see a neutral let alone a hostile in the system you are mining in and there are always roaming defense fleets in the area that will jump on any incoming ganker fleet before they get to the miners the added level of safety provided by the grav site was not really needed here but was still nice to have yet even in these systems where mining seems to be even safer than in high sec many of the miners have been on the forums complaining about cloaked campers disrupting operations a single cloaked frigate could render all that safety void so the risks here is still high removing a layer of safety here makes the situation worse  imbalance 4
with all the great changes to odyssey this change of grav sites to anomalies has done nothing but remove content for many players i consider myself a freelance minerindustrialist in eve i am not affiliated will any null sec alliance or power block i did spend over 2 years in sov null however i did not appreciate having someone else dictate to me how to spend by limited play time in eve it seemed every time in logged in there was some sort of cta or defense fleet that was mandatory anyone online join when there was a mining op all ore was expected to be given to the alliance coffers i know not all null sec alliances are like this but try doing your own thing during a cta and see happens ctas are a necessary evil in sov null the space you enjoy playing in needs to be defended if you do not help with the defense then you can gtfo i have no issue with that it is as it should be my problem is why should i be forced into a large alliance in order to enjoy soloable content up until odyssey null sec mining was possible for me to do it was a high risk activity but i made more iskhr than in high sec and i enjoyed the extra risk and challenge but i was very dependent on the safety of hidden grav sites to make that possible there was almost always neuts in the systems i mined in i was not in secured sov space but i could do it and it was fun for me for me and other like me odyssey dispite its great other features was not an expansion for me it was removal of content i get the vision of moving to anomalies i think the move of ice belts to anomalies was great the reduction of ice supply is a different matter entirely but the move to anomalies was nice i would have been happy if all static belts were moved to anomalies even the static grav sites spawned by upgraded sov could have been moved to anomalies many null sec players insist this change does not really affect them due to other tools they have for protection but why remove grav sites completely why remove existing content at least leave the randomly spawned grav sites as they were or add new ones my proposal is not to change what has been done but only to restore the random grav sites even just to low sec and npc null these areas need some feature to attract miners that no other system has give them good concentrations of high end null sec ores mining is just not done in these systems while it will go on relatively unchanged in sov null and high sec give us mining content for these more dangerous areas give us back some new grav sites with ore compositions that will make them worth the effort to scan down and worth the risk to go into low sec and npc null to mine them these are the most dangerous areas of eve for industrial players make it worth the effort to operate there
i support the op on this issue because it is sorely being abused after 10 years of playing this game off and on not once did i receive a bounty until last weekare those who have bounties bad players no i never assumed that i have always had a live and let live policy towards other playstyles it is only natural though that others should respect other playstyles as well otherwise the game ceases to be a sandbox i say that because a sandbox allows for all styles not only one themeparks do that bsi have a positive security status and am not even a combat pilot yet i receieved bounties for defending other players in chat who were being trolled by a group of players that were clearly getting their kicks at the expense of others and instigating arguments of course its against the rules to name names so i will leave it at that the main point is unless a person has a negative security status and has been flagged by a corp as a criminal feature that should be added if a former corp member commits a crime then it should not be so easy to harass noncombat pilots without cause or mere words in chat with bounties
so a sandbox is only a sandbox when it follows your rules sorry but no it means even though you are able to use whatever mechanics the game gives you to succeed then others can use the same or other mechanics of the game to try and thwart you the game only ceases to be a sandbox when you place the restriction on it that you ask for then it would become a theme parkhow exactly does placing a bounty on you abuse the  what relevance does your sec status have to the placement of that bountyalso how does you having a bounty constitute harassment does it now mean you cannot undock does it suddenly stop you using the market or mine or whatever you do within eveeve is pvp centric if you understood this then you would see why all players should be open to a bounty placement i can certainly see why you got onedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

okay this isnt a rant about scammers themselves we already know 99 of eve hates themheres the other issues ccp is intentionally ignoringthey spam the crap out of jita local means its practically useless unless you spend the first 10mins of the day blocking themill bet a lot of them are using macros if ccp wasnt so busy on a witch hunt for rmt traders they might noticepeople hate spammers outside of eve why cccp things we should tolerate them in local is beyond me it just makes a lot of people madjita is full all the time means ccp has to dedicate a server to jita and means people line up outside the gates because ccp cant figure out how to make a working queue system for people trying to jump in or log in maybe they should hire more decent database programmersjita contracts have gotten to the point that no one trusts them anymore so its very hard to try to sell legit as no one trusts your contractblock the spammers in jita local simple rule you cant post the same line more then 3x per hour and ban anyone using a macro
tell us some more about your obviously vast server and database expertise not to mention your experience with game designblock the spammers in the suggestions forums simple rule you cant post the same ideas as fifty other people and ban anyone using an alt
you had my support until this stupid stupid stupidly obvious stupid typomistype
not supportedthere is no point in adding features to the autopilot that a few moments thought and research make unnecessary
try looking at the angular velocity column instead since thats the number that your guns tracking is compared again not the traversal velocityme id suggest ccp change the color of that column and only that column when the targets angular velocity is too high for your guns
every time i look at my overview i see a transversal column problem solved
i like the idea of a visual cue that is not a number telling me when my guns are having trouble tracking we have enough numbers to look at range speed managing drones i think everybody who is complaining would like to go to a textbased eve lets give them an undumbeddown ascii client
i propose that when a ship warps onto your grid it does not display in the overview until you close and reopen the overviewwhat you think that is a totally stupid idea ok how about thiswhen a new anomaly or signature spawns it is immediately displayed in the scanner window just like a ship warping onto grid is immediately displayed in the overview
the fact that you spend long enough to get bad standings with a faction and dont realize it shows how attentive of a player you are to start with meaning unless bells and whistles pop out of your computer and wave a giant neon banner saying dont go there youd prolly ignore it and go in anyways
you are a criminal to the gallente if you are going to wreck your standing then be aware enough to pay attention to where you are flying there should be no need for the game to automaticly stop your ship and warn you take some responsibility for your actionssaying that i agree with your autopilot suggestion manually requesting to avoid gallente space when setting up an autopilot route would seem to me that you were actively doing something about the issue didnt explain myself very well there but im sure me point comes across still on the first coffee of the dayjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the danger is not of the same degree in lowsec we pod you as well if your slow npcs dontnot supported
if i were your broker and you wanted an order cancelled id charge you its still work i had to do even if you dont make a profit from it
is a tool which can be used for good or for evil your suggestion removes the support for the evil element of the game burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
sandbox means people can set their own goals not that they should be prevented from doing things that seem stupid to you if a player decides for his own reasons that he wants to discourage people or encourage them depending on your point of view from going to jita by bountying everyone who jumps in then thats up to himor he may have other motivations which make sense to himperhaps hes trying to sabotage the by giving everyone a bounty thus preventing those with larger bounties from standing outperhaps he wants to encourage pvp in hisecperhaps he wants to reduce traffic through jita to promote other trade hubsperhaps hes just enjoying himself with a bit of dadaist randomnessthe point is hes playing the game his way

and what if a ship is using a split weapon system or enemy traversal is still at a point where hitting is possible but very unlikelyif i am using both guns and missiles which one is used to determine my ability to hit what if they are a a very low transversal but at a range where the guns are unable to hit properly would such a system apply to a droneboat and if so would transversal be calculated by the position of the ship or the released drones if the latter how do we display thatthe problems in implementing this are significant while a simple green if enemy angular velocity  tracking of single weapon system might be possible it would be a rather halfassed way to go about it when so many other factors go into calculating ability to hittldr barring some very low priority unified ui system to better show and compare all stats of an enemy moving vessel to your currently fitted weapon systems suddenly appearing from nowhere i think you are out of luckthat and ability to eyeball the movement of an enemy is an important skill to learn manually especially for pvp when you may not have time for a lot of paying attention to the overview
as you say and i said the overview is not the best way to see things hense my posti did modify my original post to account for different guns or missilesi have no idea what you are talking about for drones so far all i have had to do with those is tell them who to shoot or just take a shot at something and they go there merry wayas far as gun range that is the first thing i had to look ati didnt start worrying about tracking until i started the whole orbit of death thingif someone can stay out of range it doesnt really matter about tracking and range is depicited all over the place so i am not sure what you are talking about there

as a long term null sec miner i agree with all of this the fact that a ganker enters a system and can warp to the site in less time than it takes an orca to get up to speed and warp out makes mining in grav sites more dangerous than belt mining i agree with all the other changes that have taken place the fact that we can now get enough trit to actually build cap ships without importing massive amounts is a wonder

i think the complain here is not that we not get enough money out of exploration which is the case since odyssey but ok i will get over itsomhow the problem is that we cant get all containers and that it feels realy realy bad to loose those containers that u just wone from the mini game to make it feel better they could just reduce the number of containers so that u could grap them all of cause that would destroy the 2 person exploring idea but in the end exploration was always a solo activity and ccp should not make the solo expirience feel bad just because they want to make it a coop activity they should find a way to make it fun for both options
how much would the price of carbon have to increase for it to be worth grabbing
yes and no if all the loot was worth something then yes but currently the loot is 80 low value salvage if i only get half the containers and a 8 mil decryptor goes poof what happens to the seeding algorithm does it add it to the next container to keep the average value the same or reseed it in a another place with option a where it is gone the value of that item may well increase many would stockpile then crack the core but not loot driving up the priceswith option b whee it is reseeded elsewhere you will have a whole constellation  region of people beating the hacking game and not scooping any loot to force it all into one system because it must drop to keep its value the samei really hope the drop rates are not in anyway determined by the market value ingame that would be too easy to price fixthere are better ways to make exploration a coop activity  2 normal cans and a dual can that needs to be hacked by two people time out on the hack module so you need to wait 35 mutes to start again  so you take turns  system cores that cannot be cracked with one player alonethen again who wouldnt fly the power of two anyways

i am proposing that ccp changes the way corp mails are setup now and request that they return to the way it was done a few years back in so much as when a new player joins the corp they will receive the corp posts previously sent after a short waiting periodi will detail a short scenario below after having some success in recruiting a couple of noob members i sent out a few corp mails with details and handy hints on how things work in eve which is helpful for a char who is a few hoursdaysweeks in to the gamei was then lucky enough to recruit another few new members a few days later but found that they were not receiving the mails i previously sent out and therefore had to resend each new player all the information individually or i resend the previous mails to everyone whenever a new member joins the corppreviously with the eve corp mail system a new member within a corporation would automatically receive all corp mails after a short waiting period for me this would seem an ideal situation for getting information to each corp member efficientlymany people would argue that all this will do is create a massive backlog of mails which are unnecessary and in the most part i would agree who wants to see a dozen wat or lolz clogging up the mailing system if the corp ceodirectors are too lazy to delete the spamto mitigate this a also recommend a system were the ceodirectors can lock the mails they wish to keep and after a defined period of time say 7 days all the nonlocked mails will be deleted as a ceo of a corporation i would find this solution to be a much more efficient way to disseminate information to my members without having to worry to much about deleting all the spam

yea after a few other threads concerning this issue and rereading the eula everyone likes to post the relevant bits it dawned on me that comparing remote access websites and programs to access information isnt bannable by itselftake for instance that market botter that did get banned using that information he used the same software but 1 more and that additional software got him in troublesoo taking experience of what has happened to people and the written code of ccp dont use programs that interact with the clientinterfacethis post has been signed by murk paradox and no other accounts alternate or otherwise any other post claiming to be this holders is subject to being banned at the discretion of the gm team as it would violate the tos in regards to impersonation signed murk paradox in triplicate
UFFFDyes its an macro program  macro definition  a single userdefined command that is part of an application and executes a series of commands in this case the command is replicated in all clientsUFFFDyou are wrong UFFFDdefinition of macro  a single computer instruction that stands for a sequence of operationsUFFFD
i hope you meant to say it doesnt do that because isoboxer does not modify the client and isoboxer does not let you automate anything
this is really what i want1
this would be really nice

there are a few issues with shares that need to be addressed obviously the existing system is broken in a number of ways but some groups are using it to lock down bpos either a new set of shares needs to be created or the old system needs to go away my choice would be remove the old system and change bpo lock down as part of a general overhaul of corp roles and associated permissionswhat features should these stocks havewe should be able to pay and collect dividendsthere needs to be a way to do forced buy backs or perhaps shares have a specific duration from the initial offering at which time they are all forced buy back this makes shares some what bond like or simply expireit would be nice if the market interface for stocks was not region specificthey should show some historical data price history our familiar market chart dividend history top 10 share holders how widely held how many different players own shares in this corp number of shares outstanding total number of sharesare all these features needed no but they would be nice and if they are not considered at the initial design they may never get implementedmy best guess is we wont see a stock market until we see corp roles redone
the game already has a system like this however the system really hasnt been used that often nor in the manner that youre talking about since it hasnt been iteratedexpanded on in yearsid love to see someone at ccp take up the mantle on this and give the community ways to invest in corporations forprofit and scam the hell out of people like a realworld corporation would a lot of what needs to be fixed with the current system however relies on some revamps to the corporation system before i would even consider saying go ahead this looks fun
it should be done how often do you click the wrong damn ammo when switching ammos i do it more often than id like i think a radial menu for it would be amazing do eet
just my two cents herei would strongly oppose any meddling with wh mass limitations that is one characteristic that makes whspace uniquegiven the latest changes since summer 2012 players can see that eve is changing from a very complex and skill intense game to a game where one can do a lot more things at the beginning without the need to specialize in a certain tradethe fun of gaming is suffering from that eve does not need more of the occasional wowwot players it needs people who continously play that game there the game mechanics need to stay balancedunfortunately ccp has no clue at all how balancing game mechanics works the changes they implement are way to big metaphorically balancing by ccp is done with a slegdhammer instead of a clockworkers screwdriver00 space is fine as long as a resident will be able to go ratting pi ing and so on people in 00 can easily make billions within days no not rat botting just a few anos and prontoso 00 residents were always rich enough to afford jfs to get their stuff to jita and come back with other needful things especially tritaniumnow with ore content changes even that might change why 00 had already had the best income abilitiesbecause some csms have strong interests in making 00 even more attractivewhs are sometimes used by 00 corpsalliances to ship stuff into hisec what a perversion if wh entries could be intentionally manipulated and perpetualized by playersif that changed wh space would become a 00 appendix no thanksand yes 1 for this petitionpos need a revamp surely access management and individual storage possibilitiesbut as we all have our experiences with ccp any change that will get eve closer to wow is going to happen sooner or laterunfortunately ccp do not realize that wow is dying and therefore cannot not seriously be a role model to be copied
just for the record i am very concerned that wspace not be turned into any kind of 00 replica wspace provides an irreplaceable ecology for highend smallgroup gameplay and i will resolutely oppose any change which i perceive to be potentially damaging to that ecologyspecifically including an overhasty emotiondriven nerf to t3s
been doing some tinkering with the item images from the eve data dump and came up with some revised item icons to be more informative to the user wheck me out  tinypic linkmost notable changes hereempire navy tags are more clearly identified like pirate tags currently areammodrones will clearly show primarysecondary damage type inflictedstar base charters fuel blocks and the like will clearly be identifiablethis could be done in a relatively short time period and would add even more informational functionality to current icons

i find totally shameful a real eve player defending this augmented type of gameplayits really sad
whats more shameful is people posting with obviously no idea on the subject they talk about then proceed to berate players based on this poor knowledge that is sadlets be clear here a plex cannot exist without being created with rl monies this means ccp get money for every plex used isboxer does not automate it duplicates you do not gain items at a more accelerated rate with isboxer than you would do under normal game play if you go afk at any time whilst doing anything with isboxer you stop doing it in the game at the same time you would without it installed destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yes lets be clear a plex cannot exist without being created with rl monies this means ccp get money for every plex usedfrom the person that actually paid for it  isboxer does not automate it duplicates duplication or replication is still an augmented type of gameplay and totally shameful for a real eve player to defend it  you do not gain items at a more accelerated rate with isboxer than you would do under normal game play yes you do  if you go afk at any time whilst doing anything with isboxer you stop doing it in the game at the same time you would without it installed it doesnt matter if you go afk or not its still gives you an unfair advantage against the players that dont use it but you are right whats more shameful is people posting with obviously no idea on the subject they talk about
what relevance does it have regarding who paid for the plex the whole point of the plex system is so its tradeable with ingame currency the whole point is ccp gets paid they may have traded isk for it but that still didnt come for freeim have a feeling you think the minerals you mine yourself are also free heres a clue they are notits duplication which is already a part of the eve ui why shouldnt i defend it please show me proof that you gain items at a more accelerated rate than normal game play im sure ccp would also like to see thisof course its relevant regarding going afk you claim this is automation if indeed it was then it would continue to work after its not automation hence why it stops they have to be at the pc in order for it to work thats the only way they gain items and thats why its fair in my book and ccps i am right it is shameful some not having a clue they like to include emotions and feelings as well as talk of rmt and bots its all rather saddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ellen1 make a different thread if you have a problem with plex2 it is not augmented and you are shameful for harassing anyone with an opinion not your own3 prove it for fcuks sake please prove to me and everyone here that isoboxer lets you gain at an augmented rate i would love to see you prove this with facts you know maybe you even trying to use isoboxer and realizing it is nothing you make it out to be4 prove it because anyone who has actually used isoboxer knows you are full of it5 the winner but you are right whats more shameful is people posting with obviously no idea on the subject they talk about nice ill take 5 as you admitting defeat since you are the one here posting without logic facts or any legitimate information you argue only on misinformed opinions and are too stubborn to actually commit yourself to a second of research on an issuetake a look here maybe this will help you for now you are just terrible
what relevance does it have regarding who paid for the plex its very relevant if no player spent rl money on plex ccp would not receive money from this system nor players would be able to buy the plex with ingame iskthey may have traded isk for it but that still didnt come for freeim have a feeling you think the minerals you mine yourself are also free heres a clue they are notactually they are like shooting npcs mining creates a value out from the environment to that player in both cases the player spent time in those activities but it was his time ccp didnt receive any real money from that player if he paid the plex with ingame isk its duplication which is already a part of the eve uiits absolutely not part of the eve ui to duplicate commands to other game clients why shouldnt i defend iti have no idea whatsoever why anyone should defend such augmented type of gameplay please show me proof that you gain items at a more accelerated rate than normal game play im sure ccp would also like to see thisby automatically synchronizing the fire trough multiple clients a isboxer is more efficient than any human fleet and thats exactly the point for using this program otherwise no one would use it they have to be at the pc in order for it to work it doesnt matter if you go afk or not its still gives you an unfair advantage against the players that dont use it
im not even sure you know what you are arguing about now regarding the plex they use a plex ccp gets money the more plexes that are used the more money ccp gets its that simple its completely irrelevant who first buys the plex it still gets used and ccp still get paidno they are not free isk and mineral have a cost everything in eve has a cost im not simply referring to rl monies but its a cost all the sameas far as if he paid with a plex is concerned ccp got paid for that plex a plex cannot exist without ccp getting rl money for it end ofoh and minerals are not an isk fauceti didnt say other clients i said duplication is a part of the eve uithats because you simply have no ideabut efficiency isnt acceleration its simply efficiency a single account pvp group that is efficient at pvp still uses normal game play to gain things not accelerated simply more efficiently gainedyou do know what accelerated means in this context dont youoh and its duplication not automationit does matter regarding going afk because you claim automation the fact everything stops pours scorn on your claimdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

hexor vhave you had enough food yet 
i concur with the sentiments in this threadin the few weeks i have played eo i have thought it was me i just kept thinking how could i be so blind and was somewhat determined to prove it to myself on every log off that i will surely find the button that would enable me to switch between same account charactersi finally gave up on my most current switch and hit google for the remedy and here i amso to the point really this most simple action isnt even in the game i read these posts and then went on other sites too waiting for some punchline or having someone tell me how stupid i am for not spotting the method to perform this action i just cant believe there is not an option to do this switch i also cant think of a reason to not offer this conveniencegranted there may be bigger issues to address in a large game and this is still just a game after all but this little omission from what i see as a quality game is just odd to mebizarrem
the work in the real world because there is a level of trust incorporated in things like the sec without that there would be nothing to stop traders from becoming traitors eve does not have anything like that and so scams abound from ponzi schemes to simple margin trade scams unless you can propose some tools to allow a person to make a careful investment that actually is monitoredguaranteed then the concept will die at birth i dont mean make it totally safe scams still do happen in the real world but there should be some safety nets and stock concordm
this is why you have a lot of data like i mention in post three of this threadcould also link stocks to alliances and not corps as alliances are a lot less disposible than corps
ahhh thank you lykouleonthe bulletin board was not available when i took a break from eve and although i saw it when i returned i mistakenly thought it was for something else again thank you very much it was a great help
i rarely click the wrong ammo when switching because i can easily read what ammo im switching to
josef i dont think youll get an answer from developers not because ccp devs are haughty but because i think they rarely browse the forumafter all these months since this thread has been created it seems only ccp arrow knows about it
they view it a lot more than you see them respond if you ask for a blue response to a valid question there is a good chance youll get one
ok this seems like a totally superficial or inconsequential request but i really think it has some merit i also think it is very easy to implement thus not taking a lot of development time out of more important things right now all ships that are previewed via the info picture are shown in a bland caldari star background regardless of race origin or lore moreover the way lighting is currently applied in conjunction with the dark top and bottom background leaves parts of the ships too dark for previewing at many angles my suggestion is to improve upon the previewing feature by adding different backgrounds when spinning a ship according to their raceorigin like the static pictures they have moreover if the lighting source stays fixed on the camera center and the background is devoid of completely black regions all parts of any ship would be readily visible from all angles one might think that such a change would serve no purpose at all other than a graphical nocontent tidbit but i really believe that it can help young players to get more excited in the game and it would also provide a mild but measurable incentive for players to train and strive for more ship hulls i think that the fact a past removal of hangar ship spinning resulted in a lot of rage strengthens my argument thank you for your time c

the ossogur gate in amamake is a constellation gate from hed to ortner after the odyssey expansion on june 4th the jump range on this gate has increased by over 50 its not even a regional gate the jump range is literally 35km from the center of the gate no confirmation yet on if this is a bug or intentional feature but it would be please reduce it back to the original jump range dont buff the carebears they need a reason to be afraid of lowsec
definitely think this is a great idea i just started playing again and have to characters on the same account having to completely quit out of the game and then relaunch it is quite vexxing
i have been thinking a lot about this and want to see some more input i am glad to see at least one member of the csm is on board i had an idea in line with what ccp did with the ice belts but modified systems with a large amount of current belts would contain the largest ore ring placed appropriately for the solar system between a larger planet orbit and the sun or beyond the most distant orbital body such as our own solar system belt heresystems with little to no belts would scale accordinglyfor example i remember when i was a young rookie and starting to figure out how to mine and warp to different belts was interesting but lost its allure once i discovered that belts could be  or where depleted even before i got there for rookie systems i feel this would benefit new players in both terms of mechanics and social i have often spent time in new pilots systems to find that there are a half dozen or so pilots spread out in every belt that hasnt been depleted i feel that this detracts from their initial experience especially if they choose to go down the industrial path and having them all in one could also push them into the realm of pvpthoughts
supported
not supportedthere are many more pressing worthwhile and frankly more interesting calls on time and resources than this
i fully agree yet a change like this does not require any meaningful amount of time orand resources the starscapes are already there you just have to assign a background id to each ship when the preview screen loads or even better assign a background according to the maincolor db attribute so that you dont have to make db entries for any ship
these do not effect your raw standings which is the stat i believe fw membership is based on as i recall although i maybe wrong they were put in place mainly to allow quicker access to higher level agents and to make it possible to access hostile faction space and do business even with a very low standing levelafraid youll just have to do what everyone else does in your situation and grind missions to repair your standings or just go pirate i found the change very liberating as you dont need to care about standings sec status or lack of targets
dearest ccp maybe it would be great idea to add a ship its history of use to know who was his manufacturer where it was built and it series number maybe it would be great if we can see who used it before i think eve need more logs 
whyif different manufacturers produced different quality hulls or if you had to service and maintain your hulls as an owner i could see a point in this as neither of these cases apply i see no point in wasting resources and effort on this
only if i can turn it off on both ships i produce and ships i buyalso the same arguments about database clutter that come up every single time this is suggested

go away from eve with your unicornic rainbow colors eve is a dark spaceship game and multicolor madness doesnt suit to the dark style of its interfaceits a complex game just learn shiptypes you reminded me of someone who wanted an indicator or smth like that which would let him know if someones actively searching for him in the system all of this is pointless except quick filter box for typing pointless  because it can be done with existing filters and tabs maybe not very easily but eve is not about easiness its about using your brain instead of having everything ready under your hand i know because i use it to  almost  full extent 5 tabs several thematic filters in each tab it can cover everything you need and comfortably enough if it cant  then youre doing it wrongps didnt read the whole topic

whyodyssey made pvp in highsec easier not harder so much so that i have known whole alliances to play more world of warcraft since odyssey than eve  because ccp essentially destroyed their nullsec gameplay then dumbed down highsec pvp at the same time to utterly favor players in greifer corpsthat is a spectacular own goalas for the tears must flow  no what we see is a massive design effort from ccp to try to increase the playerbase but dumb decisions like making ore sites instant appear to everyone rather than having to be scanned down combined with a total inability to use nullsec pvp defences like bounce bubbles and ecm burst in highsec making pvp dead easy in highsec 1 war deck everyone you see mining ice or good ores2 use a neutral scout to warp to ice belts ore belts to check for targets3 jump in instant warp to target4 kill target you can warp an interceptor to them faster than they can go to warp unless they use a bot  ie the anti bot changes have now favored botters and cheats 5 repeat no scanning ever required nowthats not pvp thats slaughtering highsec players and guess what they get upset then they leave the game been seeing it this past couple of weeks all over the placecan i have your stuff sure it wont help you anyway  unless you have capitals you are now irrelevant in eve in nullsec and if you play in highsec it is only a matter of time until you are greifed out of the game that is why eve is continuing to underperform in player retention  the changes made to make exploration easier have really only aided the veteran greifers who didnt need any more help anywaygo look at the rise and fall of darkfall 10 the wolf will always devour all the sheep in a game like this one  that ccp spends millions getting more sheep does not mean eve will live forever only that ccp is on borrowed time because the game that gives the sheep the equivalent gameplay but with the security they long for will steal most of their paying customers without carebears there is noone buying plex to sell to you nullsec empires dont pay their subs with real cash after all  that is what moon goo is for  but ccp cant pay their staff with moon goo so guess what  either ccp needs to make more radical changes dumbing down the game yet again or they need to watch their game slowly but surely lose market shareso dont attack me for proposing that the real issue ccp faces for nullsec is the crap map and bad resource distribution drone reigons are a pathetic joke and space is infinite so should not have jump route choke points the way it does currently fix the map improve protection for independent alliances holding sov in nullsec or watch the game slowly but surely lose to the imitators who seek to topple eve from dominance in the space empire game niche

i have emboldened and underlined the relevant keywords note that neither of the words refer to anything more than your relationship with a single personnow get the  out
three points 1 when a corp wishes to join fw they need to have corp standings above some threshold in order to join the corps standings are based on the average standings of all members that actually have standings to the npc corp diplomacy and connections do not matter in these cases i would assume when joining the fw npc corp it too also uses your base standings and not your skillmodified standings 2 access to agents use modified standings this is the primary purpose of the diplomacy and connections skill as it allows you to access level 24 agents more quickly which are more lucrative for many reasons this is why malcanis is somewhat right higher standings  higher agents  greater mission and lp rewards 3 the social skill which gives a 5 bonus per level to npc agent corporation and faction standing increase is what you need to train and then you need to go run some missions for the empire you wish to join realize you only get faction standing increases from storyline missions and you have to run 16 regular missions to get 1 storyline mission also newbie career agents give out a singleoffer series of missions that act as a storyline mission and boost faction standings too
nb if you dont want to run the epic arc missionswhich are buggy and often very hard but which yield massive faction standing increases but you can only run them once per characterthen run distribution missions for an agent of the faction you want to build standings for the payouts are crap but the missions are really fast and you can accept several at once with a moderately sized hauler which means that you get storyline missions at a really fast clip if you plan it welland a fast clip even if you dont also you get to know a small part of space like the back of your hand
first of all thanks for liking the idea to add the quick filter boxnow i have to say that i completely  totally  absolutely disagree with your point of view when you say that eve is not about easiness well in fact you are right its unfortunately how it currently is and i think thats a problem eve shouldnt be only aimed at hardcore 4x pro gamers the number of eve players could even increase if the game was more accessible to the majority of people it makes no sense to keep a feature in the game that frustrates players and i think the overview is one of themof course you can customize the overview using the 5 available tabs etc but frankly setting it up is a nightmarethe more userfriendlyness ccp devs will add to the game i am not saying ccp should add wizards or automation systems to play instead of players the more players will enjoy their daily dip in the eve universefrustration  no fun  players unhappyuserfriendly uis  actions quickly executed  faster reactions during battles  players happy
i think eve must remain an island pun was not intended  in mmo gaming which would be oriented mostly to dedicated players and by all means avoid casualization its much more interesting to play withagainst mature 2560 yo space scifi fans instead of youngstersi cant approve lowering of entry barrier eve can be improved by making it more comfortable but avoiding casualization has highest possible priorityi think it should be done this way if you simplify something or make more comfortable  be certain to add some complexity to the same area and deepen itquick growth of popularity means even more quick increase of average stupidityas it was said by some wise man to improve yourself you need to play against stronger opponentsyou  on the contrary  want to invite weaker players that will make you degrade as wellif overview settings and filters frustrate you it means you havent mastered it decently i have nothing against current overview only against its lagsnot at all you really do it once and while you do it you improve your understanding of game mechanics in general after that 1st manual setup you just improve and polish it from time to time until it reaches some optimal state which covers all your needsquantity kills quality especially when you try to increase quantity too quickly eve still has the potential to gain more players without loss of quality and depth but its a relatively slow process which needs a lot more content and diversity like multigenre development
your analogy involving the hammer is incorrect the reason is because anything and everything these days has warning labels on them stating specifically as to how you are to use or not use the item to avoid lawsuit i was also told by gm morticia that the current uses of the is not overly liked so i would not automatically assume ccp agrees with the common abuse of the just because they added flexibility to it

a lot of people seem to fall into the trap of thinking that providing ease of access is a slippery slope to making gameplay easier its not fact of the matter is that no matter how much ease of access you add the only way to make scrubs play better in comparison to vets is to remove gameplay options and force everyone into a smaller range of gameplay styles anything that increases the options players have will invariably work to the net gameplay advantage of expert and veteran players and anything that does not affect the options but makes them more accessible will generally draw more players with less skill making the skill of the veterans and experts more apparent in comparisonworld of warcraft is a testament to this trend and has demonstrated exactly what will happen when you remove gamplay options as well as what will happen when you make everything more accessible when at first they made gameplay more accessible it brought in a wealth of scrubs but the vets and experts remained solidly on topthe gap between the bottom and the top increased but when blizzard took away gameplay options the gap between the top and the bottom grew steadily smalleri bring this up because i believe it is relevant to this discussion more overview options that do not add info but help to sort the info you already have and make it easier to process are a good thing do not confuse this with things that add info to the overview thats not supposed to be there no matter how clear it is what everyones ship type is at a glance you will never be able to tell what someones fit is beyond an educated guess without using a ship scanner
i dont care about staying on top or in the middle or whereveri do care about average skill and intellect of players youve read my previous post inattentively stronger opponents  more interesting opponents noobs can become strong if you dont lower entrance barrier and dont dumb down the game but if you do lower it newlycoming average players will be weaker and more stupid than current average playersif you still dont understand what i mean imagine current minimum of eve players intellect and skill from all playerbase  lowering entrance barrier will decrease that minimumplayers must learn shiptypes  its just realistic that you need to learn if you want to reach something a noob doesnt need to know all shiptypes but after some time when he improves his skill and knowledge of the mechanics he will get to know every shiptype gradually thats just normaleve is a wonderful game and a wonderful sandbox mostly because it doesnt take your hand to lead you through everything  it introduces some basic things to you but you have to learn deeper details by yourself with your own brains through your own experience you casualizators want to break that parteves interface should become a bit more comfortable but the game itself should not become more accessible  its accessible enough eve only needs more content and more genres plus more and more depth diversity to it
i can live with that i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
reporting that both my goggles and the are working as intended
faction warfare complexes are a broken mechanic plexers fly empty ships warp core stabilized ships cloaking ships and have almost zero risk in exchange for the loyalty points they are earning they can do this with dayold characters there is no way for another player whether it is a pirate or an opposing faction to stop the plexer as they can just warp from complex to complex in a single system running each one down a little until they end up back where they started my assertion is that players who are actively taking part in capturing a complex and fly in ships capable of defending the complex should be rewarded more than players who risk almost nothingempty ships are relatively easy to catch though there is ample warning and time to escape warp core stabilized ships can be killed with a large alpha or multiple points but often they will warp off cloaking ships can be found with enough effort i am not arguing that there is no counter but the effort in comparison to the risk is herculeanive spoken with people taking advantage of the brokenness they admit it is broken and there is no risk i often see new characters sometimes created that day who are in faction warfare plexing  these are never brand new players they are veterans taking advantage of a broken systemfaction warfare complex timers should roll back when not actively being run down by a faction warfare pilot i dont want this to be bogged down by specifics so i wont indicate at what rate the timers should roll back but i expect it should be at least at the same rate they are captured and possibly vary depending on the occupant of the complexfull disclosure i am a pirate who often preys on plexers most of the time i am solo and often times i am not the victor this is not a proposal to assure i gather more killmails
proposal change killmail generations to show ships involved in fights playing important role but not acting directly on the enemyhello everyone 0for the first reason to write this postin current pilots flying ships like logistic bonus ceptor ewar often are not present in killmails because in most battles they have more important priorities than shoot primarybut most of pilots want to have kills as result we often can find unneeded civilian guns on scimitar or combat drones on oneirossuggestion partas a player i think it will be good to change killmail generation mechanicsand add to current condition if interacted to the killed ship in any hostile manner and was in the same system another additional rule and if was in the same fleet with pilot landed the final blow and was in the same system expected resultshuge number of players will get more fun pilots of ships not focused on destruction of enemy ships will not worry about way to get in killmail and can focus on more useful activities also cloaky falcons and spot bonus will appear in killmailsthanks
i probably dont care much about this as i enjoy myself even without killmailsbut i would definitely support a proposal that added gang links to the killmail and maybe i could care enough to add logistics repairing any ship that was on the killmailedit an edit just to note that there are modifications for some popular killboard software that allow players to add themselves or the fc to add them which work quite well
we already discussed this argument ingame and my opinion was 20130627 063310  steelworks ii  i have kb i can add manually pilots to fights but 1 its not api verified 2 its does not count on pilot stats 3 its alot of manual work and im lazy and human can miss something
ocen nado pliz
i definitely support this idea at least for logidictors or may be for the whole fleet which will be in overviewsystem at the boom moment  and itll be really awesome to see ingame related kills with convenient timeline and achievements such as top damage most final blows etc and may be smth like most damage repaired for logi most targets tackled for dics most targets jammed  most dancers in cargo top looter and so on
killmails are and have historically been low on ccps featurestoaddstuffto list its unlikely youll see this picked upregardless if being on the killmail is so important to you fly a ship that gets on it otherwise be satisfied you played your part vov
i agree that the rorqual could use a compression buff to your points2 no refining at a pos yes compression no  not unless its removed as a rorqual feature1 updating rorqual compressiona ore hold increase by 50b local compression slots should be limited by a players manufacturing abilities  11 slots total  max skillsc compression time should be decreased but not more than 25a b  c work handin hand most producers that i know only utilize 10 slots but 10 slots in conjunction with a modest ore hold increase and a modest reduction in compression time would be a huge buff to the rorqualin regards to ice and ore for that matter the overall compression sizes should be similiar and you should be able to support the same number of ice miners as ore miners i havent compressed onthefly in some time for any ops larger than 10 people but the rorqual pilot should be able to compress for a goodsized op  i would say for 20 people 2 squads  rorqualother rorqual changes that are needing to be made add another highslot or two  for tractors or gang links there are only 3 real gang links used  mining laser cycle time range and shield resists  two capital tractors and your industrial siege removing the drone bonus as has been said im indifferent to since a caught rorqual is a dead rorqual jump range  a slight increase would be nice more than a dread less than a carrier no additional modules needed scanner bonuses  remove this from the orca too and add it as a mining barge or exhumer bonus per levelthere are other changes  tweaks that could help this but these are higher on the list that others imohrolt ceo live free die proud
reading through the many pages of this thread i recall supporting this idea before though it may have been over in fi rather than here some of the ideas tossed about in the later discussion have me wondering if were still talking about a tug or more on the lines of a ferryone poster mentioned it has a highsec civilian carrier which i would see more as a ferry rather than a tug which would be a single small ship consisting of a large engine tractor and command deck for moving anywhere from 1 to 3 large shipseither way though im in support

well there is a easy fix set the yield of breaking down compressed ores to 100can keep the normal ore processing at 75 but if you want 100 youll have to buildflyoperate a rorqualso basically it causes your first major build to be a rorqual then subsequent builds become somewhat easier as you can compress your ore then reprocess it in the refinery to get the 100that should be the easiest fix include if compressed reprocess 100
1i support this also not because i want more killmails but because this broken mechanic leads to dissatisfying gameplay my rough estimate is a full 12 to 23 of plexers warp offcloakotherwise avoid conflict now sometimes this is justified but man
max butched is almost exclusively a logistics pilot for pl in january he managed to get on almost 800 kills from his logisheres the thing you used to not aggro in your logi because you could simply dock up or jump a gate after repping and get away thats no longer the caseyour logistics ships can get on mails if they want to theyre choosing not to by simply not packing combat dronesthe process is simple fit combat drones launch drones and assign them to a dps ship every target he aggros will then get attacked by your drones placing you on the mailyour repping power is barely diminished at all and you achieve what you want without having ccp do any coding at all aka wasting time on something thats easy for you as a player to achieve
its works only in part of different situationslook at thisenemy fleet       5080km       our nagas    5060km    our logiin this case drone control range is just not enough
bringing this up again because we could really use some csm pressure on this issue i would ask that you reference the thread here and in that thread ccp sisyphus post herebasically ccp has admitted that there is an issue and their chosen course of action is to slowly work on optimizing the jump animation and then testing it to see if it improves the situation im afraid that this slow and incremental effort is unacceptable the game is causing physical pain and discomfort for a portion of its paying customers this has been live for over three weeks before that it was reported repeatedly on the test server there has been plenty of time to address this this is not some minor bug causing a little inconvenience it is a health issue and should be taken seriously as such this needs an immediate fix even if only a temporary one while they continue their optimization efforts in the meantime though something needs to be done and no eta yet is not an acceptable optionso how about it csm whether you like th animation or not can you support the players you are supposed to represent and apply some pressure to ccp to try to get us a quick solution on this it doesnt have to be pretty it doesnt have to be complete it doesnt have to be permanent but we need some relief from this problem and we need it asap
well this idea was original posted in fi and with the responses and support it received there i felt it best to bring it here to attempt to bring it into the eyes of the csm or ccp so far weve had a reply from one member of the csm in support of it and as long as it continues to garner support i plan on keeping the idea alive i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
guys you may want to troll but tbh jita has become just a joke you will be blocking people for everi mean its a little depressing that the game is based on obvious scamming the stories of heists make eve not some really poor scamming spam its makes the game look pretty trashy tbhsomething does need to be done  remove local anyone 
ignore jita local problem solved

thiscircle of life the new player will eventually become the old timer once he figures things out in game a bit and it will all work out sort of like a long term life insurance policy that you maintain to the end someone will collect it
ive used isboxer to mine ice in the past which i no longer do after update it was effective and stable i can vouch for its use its only 50 a yeari used the isk to buy cooler ships characters etc i tried to use it on missions which i actually play and enjoy and i just uninstalled it as it was just too much work and too much clicking i tested how quickly i got the mission done with 4 ships and it was maybe a minute faster then with just my two box normi think eve in general is a multiaccount game and everyone has accepted it or at least understands it isboxer made it easy to control those accountsi completely get the idea that it may seem unfair and it is imo if youre looking for a good pvp matchup which everyone in here shot down meanies my arena idea  you are not going to ever find it in eve and ive accepted it
i agree and the mechanics seem to be there in that a logi does get a cut of bounties so the system seems to be in place to recognize effortmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
 ccp sisyphus we did take it to them they did hear us out and they are working on it but if you expect it to be something they can fix over night then    noif you are looking for them to go back to the way it was well he pretty well answered that o
i think a fine solution would be to give an option to disable the auto rotation of the cam or allow us to control the cam during the jump sequence and also showing our ship during the jump and applying the gate cloak just before landing in system the reason i say show the ship during the jump sequence is due to a technique that figure skaters use while performing spins is to focus on a point this would allow us to focus on our ships i personally do not have an issue with the jump in its current form and would be sad to see any changes to it but i sympathize with my fellow spaceship pilots and will not be telling them to htfu this time even though i really really want tooUFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFD     UFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFDUFFFD UFFFD UFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFD UFFFD UFFFD UFFFDUFFFD UFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD

my response to ccps position not good enoughthey had feedback on the test servertheyve had almost four weeks livethey even had their own devs reporting the problemand their respons is well get to it eventuallythis has gone on too long already ccps neglect and indifference to the early reports is no excuse for this delay ccp needs to understand the term stopgap measure and implement something until they can put in the fix that they wanteverything ccp has said indicates that they are simply unwilling to fix this sooner because they dont want to remove their new art asset and want to take their time to try to optimize it in some unsubstantiated hope that they can do so in a way that will remove all ill effects whle still preserving the animation by insisting on this unneeded delay they are putting the importance of their pretty animation above the physical well being of their customers and frankly that is more sickening than the jump sequence will ever be
its usually better not to have your ancillary armor rep automatically reloadunfortunately it keeps defaulting to that it would be nice if it remembered my preference regarding auto reload like it does for my orbit default and keep at range defaultor just have it default to not autoreloadmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
anything to lessen this game being a mad clickfest
first off i apologize if my english is not that good i have a lot to say and it will be difficult for me to find the right words so that everyone can understand what i am talking abouti believe that many manufacturers and business guys would love to have their ui to be less clicky and easier to keep track on everythingi am not asking for a complete overhaul just yet but i would propose to make at least some little adjustments to the ui that might help in the meantimeat first  sellbuy ordersmanufacturers always have a lot of marked orders running and according to their production line they often have to set up the same amounts over and over againhere it would be nice to have the marked quickbar improved so that one can save previous buy orders amounts of minerals to buy range of the stationssystems ect  this way one would be able to just go to the marked quickbar  click on the previous buy order  adjust the price and click the ok buttonit would of course be awesome to be able to set up and save entire shopping lists and use those as buy orders fexa dominix needsx amount of tritx amount of mexallon ectsave the order and be able to re  use it whenever neededthat said i wanna point out that i currently use the awesome isk per hour 3rd party program by zifrian thanks zifrian for making this awesome tool
1one of the first things i noticed when coming back was the lack of jukebox made my insides sad
i can manipulate the jukebox while shooting and being shot at i cant do what you said while managing combat or other tricky maneuvers
op are you suggesting any solutions to this alleged problem that you are bringing up
confirming that eve is dying because there is spam in one easilyignored chat channel
i would just quit altogether to be honest i pumped around UFFFD250 into this game before i started paying with isk bought plex many years ago that is more than i have ever spent on any game in my life and i will not pay any more for it so i pay with in game money to play ccp still get paid there real money and everyone is happy
then hell get addicted to the game his rl will go down the toilet and hell become one of those 1337 vets who funds their gaming with plex but bum around in real life then the circle will be complete
why is this thread still alivehave a pretty picture
killmails dont matter hope this helps
posting to support the op this terrible change has been too long unaddressed by ccp i love this game but if it will make me sick to my stomach too often i will stop playing and no one will get my stuffs ccp there are off buttons for ship explosions missile effects turret effects etc immersion does not seem to be harmed by those so upleaseu give us a persisting off button for the jump gate and autoscan visuals
of course op gets my support i have because of the gate animation unsub my 3 accounts my main ends here on 2  7thi can only then hope ccp making U200BU200Ban on  off option at some pointsooner rather than later so i can return
i agree that would be a good change for this module1but i have to say im still far from convinced its any good to begin with when compared to the shield variety destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
sure i guess but data sheets carbon hydrogen batteries and electronic partsjust a waste of time i like the puzzle change to the mini professions but the scattering thing just kills it for me lets face it bring a friend is a fail scheme the mini professions were never much of a social thingseemingly more suited for the lone explorer type the scattering cans ruined that and the paltry reward makes for a total waste of time for one let alone two or threei would like to see the scattering cans done away withthe rest of the changes i can live with and slightly enjoy
