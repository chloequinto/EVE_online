good point
annoying isnt it 9 sansha standings and i cannot get any useful module from lp store i need to pay much more for ship bpc than you can get one in jitabecause of the well balanced burner missions lp is less worth than soe

i said it years ago that corps should get charged a tax to stay open if they run out of funding they close and any characters get booted to npc corpsif an entire corporation goes afk for 12 months and noone keeps the wallet full then how can they complain it becomes a game mechanic that selfregulates the idea of troll characters taking up names or permaafks who are never coming back
their present position could probably be summarised aspeople still use this important feature despite its many crippling flaws so we wont touch itlike dust values still being present in the game despite the dust game itself being literally deadand so many other problems
fozzie rise australian guyits time the following need addressing rocket launchers blasters railguns lasers armour reppers shield boosters and assault frigatesrocket launchers these modules are ridiculous they have almost no variation in fitting but still suffer under the tiered system the faction variants are too expensive and dont bring enough to the tableblastersrailguns in particular the small sizes ignoring the many variations of each caliber these could be made in to something like small compact electron blaster 1 small electron blaster 2 small enduring ion blaster 1 small ion blaster 2 small scoped neutron blaster 1 small neutron blaster 2 and you tie the fittings much closer so that the choice between the calibers is less significant it achieves two things in presenting better validated choice between calibers as the tech2 version is just an improved variant of the meta and secondly it lets you cut some of the pgcpu off of ships that otherwise abuse this extra generosity to fit oversized modules they really dont need rinse and repeat for all turret typesarmour reppers these were brought up years ago theyre stupidly designed as they are cut back to ancillary meta 0 compact and enduring variants and then tech 2 faction variants either boast better cap efficiency or better boost amount like shield boosters but not both or lower fittingquicker cycle time  but not bothshield boosters scrap the current system and rebuild from the ground up with a linear scaling of performance vs fitting im still very mad at ytterbium for how he led the previous attempt in 2012 shield boosters are in the same boat rockets are theyre just a joke and clear cut case of bad designassault frigates these will heal with better and more practical module choices at present their greatest enemies come from within not without they have periodically very poor base stats and its not helped by the total crapshoot of modules theyre bonused for and have to fit
currently there is no way to my knowledge where a player can find out who to contact devwise about specific issue in one area if there is it needs to be significantly more visible we have bug reports we have player go betweens ala csm we have forums but there is no place to find out who is on what teams at ccp to tell them an issue from watching fanfest there seems to be a lot of confusion about talking about the wrong topic to the wrong team so why not fix thatthe ideaone page that puts some faces and dev names to areas of expertise would do wonders for getting the right info to the right people and when things are not clear where they go the current csm could be on there as well the key to all of this is contact info reliable easy to use contact info a click this link and it opens a text field kind of contact info having easy access to this page from the community site would be huge having it under the support drop down would clear a lot up why is there no place where we can get a short description of what a team generally is in charge of not specifically as that is what the csm summit is for and some key people that act as the face of that team have a short description that actually differentiates the teams from one another the emphasis being on what makes them different having 78 teams that just say game design is no good having one group say citadel balance stats and another that says citadel contracts though would be amazing for example having something say gm not good having something say what a gm actually does good there are team names and dev names for a reason why not make them visible it is easy to find info on people who do things like ship balance sov rework graphics although this is a recent one for the easy category what about other areas who would we talk to i tried to find out who to talk to about pricing and marketing and had an easier time finding people on linkdin than through any ccp resources this is really badwe have the forums but they are not the best medium for everything
hello csms ccpers and capsuleersthe title says it all im missing the red fireworks the color of love and warsince its introduction fireworks allowing capsuleers to leave from time to time their usual routine and having fun a non violent way but also since then it feels like an unfinished project without one of the primary colorsis this essential for eve certainly not its a nice to have like many other things but im pretty sure that many would be pleasantly surprised if their xmas gifts this year would contain some of these and not only minmatar who have to celebrate with coal fireworks a slap in the face of all minmatarthanks for reading
rule number one of software development dont let your customers send direct messages to your developers your devs end up spending more time responding to messages than actually developing thats why you have support teams to filter the incoming information and make sure it gets to the right placei wouldnt mind a little bios page on the devs  that would be fun but unless youre actively working with one to root out an issue you dont need a way to contact them directly and you are actively working with them i expect theyd give you one theneve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
i am sorry if this is not clear i am not saying directly to the devs i am saying contact info for the correct people to talk to about the issue i dont know how many times that i have seen a communityartrandom dev say oh hey that is not my area when you ask whose is it there is no response or it is very vague have the devs up there so people know for things like fanfest but no contact info just ccp randomname and a picture under their given team then a team description sorry if this was not 100 clear
well if you think you have a bug submit a bug report if its some other support type issue either submit a petition or email support supporteveonlinecomif its more community related then theres usually a community manager but im not sure who that is anymoreim not sure what youre really asking for these communication paths already existeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
this pretty much standard practice in any industryone issue is that there could be one dev working 5 teams but one project another dev working in one team but with many projects or another dev being retasked to different teams and projects based on an as needed basismoreover devs will start to insulate themselves from a community once it reaches a certain size this is because the amount of inane requests ideas or even threats from players will begin to mount necessitating filtering mechanisms to weed out the general rabblein other words go through the correct channels like everyone else
when you buy items now you have no real way to know who produced it even if you look at your wallet history and see who you bought it from what if all player made products had a way for us to identify who produced it this way different alliances can tax imports from different producers and prop up local production with favorable taxes it can also allow for more interesting market pvp it can also stand to give producers a bit of pride seeing how they corner a particular marketedit nvm posting elsewhere for most exposure
being a noob and new player i say no thanksi want to work for my skills and isk not be hand feed them work as in training times this lets you learn the gameand respect the older players for there commitment if i wanted a game that was easy i would play skyrimi personalty find the opportunities pop up annoying and now just keep turning it off the f12 help missions are better as they seem to show you more on playing optionsdont be afraid to fail be afraid to not try  jorym

i totally agree with everything you said jack i also disagree with what the op has said it isnt suicide ganking that is the problem nor does ccp support suicide ganking suicide ganking is a clever loop hole or exploit that players have found and ccp is yet to discover possible solution too that wouldnt disrupt the game play of their player base or stop the mentality behind a sand box game that anything can happeni remember when i first started playing a friend told me that when you undock from station you consent to pvp also i remember them telling me that only fly what you can afford to loose two major rules that all players that have been playing eve usually live bymind you when i first started playing when i logged in the game had something like 100000 or more players online some times during peak times i would get put into a queue and have to wait 5 to 30 seconds to actually get into the game now when i log in the most i see is maybe 24000 or 26000 never really seen over 30000 players online i dont know if this is due to banning of bots or other things however i would like to point out this video back in 2012 before the war dec changes
mineral prices returned to their historical levels because ccp removed gun mining from the drone regions and then improved 00 mining quite a bit leading to an oversupply of high ends nothing to do with wardecs
and to some extent changes in refining of mission loot why mine minerals when you could run missions get the loot get isk and get loyalty points and improve your standings then refine the loot for the minerals if you also do industrial stuff
i doubt anyone was running combat missions primarily to get the minerals from the loot but yeah the byproduct was a nontrivial source of supply something around 10 iirc but the drone region output was immense i recall it peaking at something over half of total mineral productionmeanwhile wardecs used to be far more prevalent than they are if anyone genuinely believes that hisec wardecs are a primary driver in mineral prices i have some discounted mining permits for the hale constellation they may be interested in
you are correct drone alloys used to be the major contributor to minerals prior to their removal in what 2012 2013 which is what initially drove the prices of minerals up just as the need for materials in the construction of citadels is driving the need for pi and minerals which is why i talked about the 3 to 4isk per unit and the next jump which was 5 to 6isk per unitas for wars decs being more prevalent now then they were in the past i disagree in the past we had more players online then we do now also corps were restricted to a maximum of 3 war decs now that has changed we have corps with 99 and alliances 99 i wouldnt say it was turning hi sec into low or null being that they would have to dec just about everyone for that statement to be true i would however say that war is and has become easier for people to get into which i might add is both good and badgood in the since that it creates more conflict which destroys more things and creates a need to rebuild what was destroyedbad in the since that most of the wars that im seeing are from bored pvpers looking for a war targets their ceos trying to appease that and deccing anyone they see or find that could potentially give them a target to shoot atthe good does cause prices to go up being that the need to build what has been destroyed will always drive demand and the bad usually comes from pvp corps deccing industrial carebears that want nothing to do with fighting and would gladly pay to keep from being shot at the fact that you would offer mining permits only proves my point
tldr  allowing 99 wars is  extreme  at the current cost  risk of the whole thing defenders should be allowed an option to bribe the cops just like the attackers have in order to create a gang war in the first place terms used loosely of coursecorrection most highsec wars are from pvpers looking for lowcost lowrisk kills because they want to get into fights but they cant justify the financial burden of losing ships to an opponent whos even remotely willing to fight them with something resembling skillthe hardcoded war mechanics are fundamentally usable only in highsec at this time the reasons to declare a legitimate read not out of boredom war through these mechanics include but are not limited to keeping your null enemies supply lines from working and eliminating competitionccp will need to revisit the war system soontm enough and decide whether the lesser infliction against the sandbox and by extension their subscription numbers is to permit the current model supporting unhindered wars where the risk is mainly on the part of the defenders with only a mild cost to most attackers  or whether enabling a mechanic where the attackers assume some form of liability andor risk by virtue of creating a war declaration would be the superior choice overallthe suggestion of permitting a defender to pay some amount to removenegate a wardec has roughly as much merit as what amounts to bribing the cops to look the other way when you want to start a gang war in public this is the current system clearly maybe the other guy would like the opportunity to also pay off the cops to stop that business from happening eh itd certainly be a ton less difficult to implement than for example some suggestions covering things like putting up a collateral as an attacker in case you dont achieve your own arbitrarilyspecified goals eg im gonna put up 500m as a bet against blowing up 500m of your ships as a form of risk and it certaily makes more sense than some of those other sets of junk ideas
ccp seems to completely okay with although mass decs do have meta problems they have one benefit of being a giant isk sink proooojection i love it when people revert to this sorta opinionated insult generally it means you have no idea whats going evident conveniently by the next paragraph if you are war with another entity gate guns in lowsec will not engage you so no not just highsec is a wardec useful ask pl they just decced goonswarm who are currently residing in sarren wonder why wars need to be tweak yeah they havent been touched in a long while just like sov ccp will need to change the game at some point to keep it interesting your idea only benefits the strong and well established which they can do already by paying the current mercenaries a protection fee it worked for two years for peddictorate no merc could dec them with out the other 7 drop in to defend before the ceos lack of social skills got the better of him anyways you want to keep newbies from be farmed your idea is not going to work brave goons pl ivy dead terrorist any of the big alliance are going to still be a stupid high amount to dec and the newbies are going to be penniless deletetheweak
well once again i will point to my thought of the war bond to illustrate the core problem for this experiment we will need to postulate that there is a mechanic to define winning a war you cantake your pick or even imagine that there are multiple ways eg kd structures survivingbeing destroyed activity whateversuppose that on the formation of a corporation or alliance in addition to the normal registration fee concord requested that the ceo deposit a war bond of equal or greater size a bond which can be increased later at any timeshould any other entity wish to declare war against that corp or alliance they will have to match the war bond held on deposit the winner of the war is awarded the losers bondthis would give the defending entity an element of choice in the kind of conflict they wish to engage in if the bond of malcs minimal tax mission corp is 5m isk that may send a message that i dont care about the corp at all if wardecced i will just abandon it and form another on the other hand it might also communicate that id love to have a wardec because mmtx are also bored and welcome fights in essence anyone with a ship to undock 5000000 isk to risk can try their chances but they should not have high expectations of the campaignon the other hand lets say that malcaniss massive industrial machine mmid puts up a 500b bond anyone looking at that bond will realise that they have to put up half a trillion isk to have a go they might well infer that mmid has very sustantial assets in hisec that they want to protect and in any case there is a very large prize to be gained for winning a war with them if mmid can afford a bond of that size they can presumably afford to pay defenders and might well have srsbsns allies in short any war declared on mmid will be almost certainly be a serious effort by a group willing to play for large stakes who will expect to get one or more significant fights out of the campaign
thats a nice suggestion malcanis but how many of the new players can afford a multi billion isk war bond to kind of protect themselvesthe current war dec system is rubbish it allows pvpers to impose their play style on others that cant go wellwhat would they do if because of some game mechanics the only thing they suddenly can do is mining they would leave tooyes eve isnt a birthday party for children its evil it is and has to be dangerous everywhere but that within well defined borders if someone wants a total war there is plenty of space in low and null sec for itwhat has to be changed no war declarations without avoidable reasons a reason can be a suspect timer on a corp member the costs for a defender to end a war has to be lower than for the agressor to declare it otherwise its a simple mechanic to financially ruin the defender declaring war on a 5 man corp has to be more expensiveless rewarding than for a 500 man corp which very likely has more resources to defend themself unequal fights in high sec where the aggressor has much more dpshp as the victim shouldnt be rewarded with loot
the word correction means an adjustment to whats there its not like saying yeah youre wrong and heres the holy truth to consider further what pvp corp is actually afraid of lowsec gate guns come on you know better
malcanisi enjoy the whole concept of a war bond it would be similar to setting the price for someone to send you a message only now its a defenders bet that says you wont be able to win a war against me i would like to see some more detail into this concept like for example what would be the conditions for winning said war against a defender are those conditions set by a general game mechanic or by the defender is there a way for the attacker to end the war with out losses and the defender to retain their bond how does surrendering work in this case how does allies coming in to help the defender workjust a few questions if you have more to add to your idea please feel free to do so i like that idea as much as i like mine with the whole bribing the cops so to speak as a few have suggested it asone thing though in regards to aelavaine i agree with most of what is needed to be changed except for the fact about the costs for a defender to end war has to be lower the whole point of war is to ruin the other corp you are attacking it could be equal i suppose for the attacker and defender meaning that the cost to end the war from the defenders side  the bribe could be 50mil just like the initial cost of a war dec was 50mil with the option to pay more to prevent a dec for a week
its not a proposal its a thought experiment designed to illustrate the problem with war decs in the first place war deccers generally dont like the idea beause it allows industrial corps to spend isk to protect themselves the defending corps generally dont like it because it allows them to protect themselves by spending iskthe experiment therefore illustrates the motivations behind both sides in general hisec war deccers are in it for low commitment easy kill farming with any profit being something of a bonus so a system that requires them to commit isk and which also allows the defender any agency in determining the terms of conflict is not popular with themlikewise the defenders in general dont want nonconsensual pvp at all and they want ccp to just stop it see the post directly after the one i made above for example so to them the warbond is a regressive step that they see as one more way of putting the responsibility for defending their ships and assets on them rather than on concordin short the issue with wardecs is that they are nonconsensual pvp in a way that for example a war between two 00 alliances isnt the 00 guys may complain about blobs or coalitions or cloaky camping or whatever but thats just tactics theyre not complaining about the concept of another entity shooting at them at all wardecs on the other hand typically involve a defender who doesnt want to engage in combat pvp at all how can you reconcile that desire with the desire for other players to play a ffa pvp game the war bond addresses the figleaf justifications that both sides put up deccers constantly complain that defenders can just quite their corps and reform another risking nothing and losing nothing but a name defenders complain that they have no way to use their playstyle to protect themselves and that the wardeccers commit nothing and take no real risksand yet when offered a mechanism that addresses these complaints neither of them like it in true eve style each want the other to do all the adaptingone might query whether its a sensible idea for new players to be raising their flag and forming crops that they cant defend but such a corp could just post the minimum bond of 1m isk iirc thats the cost of forming a corp and be in almost exactly the same situation they are in the current setup with the sole difference that their level of commitment to their corp is now public
nephthank you very much for showing support for this proposaldmc
thats true
it is also bravo sierra if you want a corp that is war deccing other corps to face risk then it is up to the players that are decced to impose it on them that is the only source of risk in the game generally speaking players imposing risk on each other the implicit argument here is that ccp should impose the risk somehow
im sorry but what game are we playing eve or ccc cute cuddly crittersthe very premise of the game is that you can impose your play style on others if you choose to be helpless and ineffectualthat is your choice
my suggestion is to be able to obtain factional passport after acquiring enough standing with specific faction in order to have passage to there space so more players can enjoy using capital ships in high sec on missions and whatever they enjoying of doing except in engaging in wars also developing high sec missions oriented for capital ships
i happen to be a cute cuddly carebear but i also agree that it would be nice to see the deccers have a bit more skin in the game whether it be a modification of malcanis idea or steves warsturcture concept that has been floated beforeshould hisec be safe hell no but that should apply to those who make wardecs as wellmore skinmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i would refer you to this posti think the real problem is a fundamental difference in the philosophy while we can point out as malcanis does that hs war deccing is to farm easy kills and one could argue is ratherlow class or something along those lines the other side those getting decced have a philosophy when it comes to the game that is 180 degrees at odds with the philosophy of the gamethat is always going to be a problem for these players any measure short of making hs perfectly safe is just not good enough it is why we have the just one more nerf phenomena ccp nerfs and nerfs and nerfs and yet we hear the same complaints over in the afk cloaking thread despite a nerf to cynos via a nerf to jump range and fatigue people are stillstillwhining about cynosand we wont get into the issue that in many cases these are people who make bad decisions in game repeatedly

hey guys i think the indy guys need some love with some new shiny stuff now the pvp guys are geting there new faction supers and stuff i think we deserve something along the same linesas it stands the biggestbest thing an indy can aim for is a rorqual or a jump freighter would it not bee cool to see an serpentis procurer or something along thos line s i know this is unlikely but us indys need a higher goal to reach for ourselves
mining barges and exhumers are already faction ships theyre all designed and the bps made available by ore as are the noctis the primae and i believe the orcait kight be fun to see pirate blockade runners just for lore reasons but aside from that what real niche would they fill in the gameeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
where is this item obtainable in game source
just skins would be an awesome start  schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
what would the purpose be for these there are skins for industrials though theyre not pirate
interesting thought op while you have your answer already that indy ships already have faction ships in the form of mining mining command primae and noctis what other indy ships could be available for use pirate faction blockaid runners are a good starthowever are we looking for more industrial minded capital ships or more industrial minded sub capitalsccp could always put more work into various aspects of the game however they need to have incentive as well as legitimate reasons for that workartificially creating a niche by creating a faction ship doesnt work to well good example would be the primae which is a pi industrial is well the same model as the noctisfirst thing to do is develop a reason be sides stating that its needed need is not want and stating that something is needed with out proof of that need is generally a want not a needmost industrial pilots want some love which is why ccp is in no hurry to implement major or even minor changes to the industrial aspect of the game they will make changes as they see the need for ships they have worked to create suddenly come up short and have no real value again i point to the primae while its a good looking ship its still basically worthless being that in one update that ccp made with industrial shipsso while most industrial pilots want love ccp will not give it unless there truely is a need that will warrent them spending time and money on ithonestly i would enjoy seeing some love for industrial pilots they are the back bone of the game what is needed is a road warrior mindset when it comes to industrial shipsif you watch main stream scifi you see that the industrial ships cargo ships mining ships etc all have the same problem they are weakly defended with little to no armor and little to no speed which is why pirates are so eager to attack them and take what is in their holds if we look back at naval history of the world you will see that pirates lost just about as much as they got it was really the privateers not the pirates that made piracy profitable being that privateers were backed by the crown french spanish or english and had a port to sell the goods they plundered from ships that were armed but not armed as well as a ship they were given by a naval power in fact most traditional pirates would be sailing roughly the same ship class as the ship they are attacking privateers on the other hand were granted ships of war to attack merchant vesselswhich brings me back to scifi shows and the road warrior mentality scifi shows such as firefly startrek alien star wars and several others portray industrial ships in general as lumbering behemoths with little to no armor and little to no offensive armament where small swift raiders can attack and take control of it is really no different than current eve mechanics granted that adds spice to the game being that now as an industrial pilot you need to seek out help from a combat pilot to defend you however if we take on a road warrior mentality youll see the advent of the qshipfor those of you that are not familiar with the term qship allow me to enlighten you a qship also known as a qboat or decoy vessel is a special service ship or mystery ships that were heavily armed merchant ships designed to lure submarines to the surface in order to destroy them during world war ii qship are used in several scifi books such as david webers honor harrington seriesccp is always talking about wanting more conflict and generating more wars well alright then ladies and gents i give you the qshipfor industrial ships it could be a t3 or t2 variant more than likely t3 with changes that could be made to it much like the t3 cruiser subsystems might even be able to use the same subsystems however special role bonus would be something a long the lines of appears as equivalent class of ship on scannersso if you have say the minmatar version it would look like a mammoth on overview and dscan until you check ship and see that it isnt a mammoth at allfor freighters it would be a bit different it would more than likely be a t2 variant with limited changes save for the fact that the hold would have to be a lot smaller than a traditional freighter talking like 100000m3 base giving 3 or 4 high slots to the freighter 4 or 5 mid slots and 3 to 4 low slots and 2 rig slots giving you the ability to fit battleship weapons or other fitting to make it more of a problem for pirates in essence a freighter sized block aid runner however it would have the same role bonus as previously mentioned industrial shipsin the end you would end up with a ship that could dish out as much as it could take and in some cases the pvper would be flying this ship to lure other pvpers into a fight talk about crazy conflict generation
dear alleve update shows us eve will get bulk fitting with the following descriptionso very nice for people in the pvp arenas of physical combatbut the tools supporting the eve economy used by enablers do not growsee the trend here when they announced bigger corp  alliances due to their existing skills i also tried to get this point across i hope someone will pick up on it nowfrom rubicon 13 statement by ccp fozziemy suggestion to get enablers better trade skills for market and logistics too then in the citadel expansion traders are faced with a higher tax in npc stations to promote citadel markets i can follow that reasoning but when you choose to market the masses in an npc station and you are a station trader you have to eat the taxes each time you want to resupply  replenish an order due to the following facts you work up standings with a char for a faction  race that char has 305 orders mass working a multitude of products say 6 slots a product in jita as example leaves you with just 50 products if you want to work bulk long time markets with high turnover volumes where you want to secure hedges or make bets you have to work with a certain stock in market and work within the limited room given in a char or you have to start multiple alts but still when relisting product you have to pay taxes over and over please give us the means to decently replenish our orderssuggested skill when you update an order you should however pay taxes over the added amount of product also since you edit the order the timer should renew to the original timer of the order it being 1 day or 3 months with the arguments of ccp with growing empires would it be unreasonable to give some love to the enablers that work within the eve economy to give them the tools that support this bigger game ccp keeps talking about just like ccp does for the people supplying the physical means in gamethx for reading schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron

think about it the serpentis only stole one ship did they buy their new capitals or do they have an industrial wing hiding in the depths of space researching and building these new ships the pirate factions have to have a significant industrial wing to support the amount of ships their factions lose daily it just makes sense that they are also using the same ships the miners use i would bet that they have boosting orcas and rorquals too it would be awesome if we found a pocket of asteroids with a small pirate faction mining fleet mining them for us to destroy make it happen ccp make it happen skins at least
are there seriously any points in a region that are over fourty jumps from another and even if there are are there enough to warrant training a skill to 5
no there is not afaik but i do recall someone working out that the largest number of jumps from point a to point b anywhere in the eve universe is 60 i tried to find the post where this was worked out but my googlefoo failed methe range modifiers on market orders are fine imoand market orders are okish but a bump in them would also not go unwelcomecontracts however definitely need looking int  but i am praying that the contract system is due for an overhaul as well so we shall see

i honestly dont think this is necessary and it devalues the effort required to maintain a proper trading operation 300 orders is a lot of orders in fact the tycoon skill is the most best bang for your buck skill in the game because each market order has essentially no limit on your iskhour but of course market competition helps keep it down a bitif everyone had double the orders the only real result you would see that it takes double effort to make the same isk under the assumption that everyone makes full use of their orders which they do not furthermore having too many orders discourages interactions with orders despite tax hikes  why buy an item for 202 million when it costs you 20 million to buy it and you wait a little longer a smart trader will tell you to use the 200k pricier order because time is money but idiots with high trading skills are living proof that people dont do that or maybe there are a bunch of braindead botters in jita wouldnt surprise me with how fierce the competition is sometimeswait what why dont you just pay the 100isk broker fee for adjusting the price by a cent this completely resets the timer there is a distinct tradeoff between larger orders and smaller orders due to this exactly if youre not making money then your strategy is bad to make best use of your order slots you should do something like thisassume some item has a median buy of 17 mil and a median sell of 22 mil list 100 units at 23 mil for 90 days when there are only a few units left lower the price to 22 or lower depending on volume this resets the timer again but you dont care about that since the order is going to get filled soon list 100 units at 23 mil for 90 days from your stockpiles which you probably replenished somehow taxes are there for a reason if you want a tax break go sit in the right citadels or make backdoor deals as a hardcore trader i can tell you that these changes that have happened are all really good except for no contracts in citadels which pretty much cancels out all the good stuff ive been saying about citadels because i cant pay others to do stuff for me in citadelsnow this this is just plain old entitlement you want to be rewarded for enabling trade you think ccp should do it because its their game youre playing the wrong mmo my friend you want to be rewarded for enabling trade you find a forking decent trade route or come up with a great strategy or supply goods to a group that didnt know it needed them its up to you in the sandbox not the devs to make things go smoothly or not

i dont mind paying to change taxes i dont want to pay taxes on goods i already put on the market if the 90 days are over and i want to put up my stock again i have to pay taxes again on the same order if i add stuff to the order it should be taxed and the broker fee is ok too i just want the stuff that is in market to stay there for sale now if i want to top up an order i have to cancel it put in more stuff then relist and repay taxes i want to be rewarded as someone who is part of the eve community the entitlement you are reading into it is the fact that 90 of the resources are diverted to pvp related issues while issues in contracts are here since 2003 and simply never fixed schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
yep long overdue things like dragndrop of destinations into courier contracts and more control over the completion period for courier contracts are sorely needed 24h is a ridiculously long time period to have as the minimum
i recently ran across a player who needed help with one of the career agent missions introduction to cosmic signatures and since i happened to be in his area decided id scoot on over to lend him a hand with itin the course of my actions while helping him i discovered what i felt would be some very good options to fix the mission to make it more noob friendly i feel that these ideas can even be extended to other career agent missions to make them all less apt to confuse our future fellow membersthis particular career agent was one of the minmatar agents in couster systemwhen first given the mission the player is told to head to the site and contact the agent on grid for further detailsthis first mission window should include details to inform a player unfamiliar with encounter sites to undock right click in space etcnext up landing on gridthere is both an acceleration gate  an agent in space first problem the agent is not interactable he should be interactable to inform the player to make use of the acceleration gate after all this may be the first mission the player has come across that uses onejust to double check i made use of the gate to warp into the second room at this point there is a pop up window by defualt to explain to the player how to continue and i presume from such in the following rooms as well this message was well detailed enough to not need further work and i presumed from this that the following ones would be all right tooplease feel free to add your own thoughts and experiences with helping noobs
i know its the first day of this release so some of you havent had a chance to check on things yet were any of the csm in the testing lots of good things in the release but the major bad thing has once again stolen the show the station docking animation is a problem for a number of players for different reasons will the csm be able to speak on this in the forums
titans are currently the only ships capable of fitting a jump portal generator able to bridge subcaps of any size or type i propose that ccp introduce a new capital hull class could even be an industrial capital that is capable of using a jump portal generator but has little to no self defense only larger fleet hanger fuel and ship maintenance bays making it the ideal ship for the nomadic people name suggestions errant wayfarer vagrant gypsy
dont worry we play the game as much as you and are aware of it we echoed calls for it to be toggled onoff in a menu when it hit sisi personally however i quite enjoy it with regards to the other changes we were able to give feedback on scope network earlier in the term and the balancing changes w regards to capitals were heavily discussed internally
when it comes at actual testing were just like regular players we get access when it shows up on sisi i personally have had no issues with the docking animation ive since heard it can cause some people issues with motion sickness but thats a specific subset of people and people outside that subset dont have any problems with it so it can be hard to identify that it may be a problem i looked at it from the perspective of does it slow anything down and i didnt see it doing that so i didnt consider it a problem
