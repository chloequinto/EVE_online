youre blatantly ignoring that were talking about a specific ship class frigates and not everything altogether remember this is comparative cost is a factor dont believe me i highly doubt you or anyone has 20 dramiels lying around for pure casual pvp why cause they are expensive on the frigate scale you never hear anyone say to a noob go get yourself 20 drams and learn to pvp in it its always a t1 frig that people will learn or do casual pvp in cause its a throw away drams or any pirate faction are notsupercaps are a whole other issue which is unrelated to this there i bolded the part you again seemed to ignore or you just have selective reading or poor reading comprehension insults aside this was part of the discussion per the thread i read like 5 months ago id link it but i just dont have time to search for it it was a very good read your issue with this was discussed thus i said per locked aggressor it would prevent such a lame tactic as you described now unless you favor 100  1 odds or mindless fleet warfare of just whoever has the greater numbers this is a great solution i personally prefer small gang warfare i find it avoids just bloblagpray  winlose warfare if this were solved i might actually be interested in 00 space because then i might actually feel like i was contributing tactically and not just another sheep in laser toting numbers

actually on the faction frigate scale theyre cheaper than both the cruor and daredevil last time i checked and about on par with the succubus and worm oh and guess what  the dram is better than all of themto anyone else who isnt a noob and is actually capable of piloting a dramiel to a reasonable standard that cost really isnt a big deal im not even particularly rich and its not a problem to me so basically your argument boils down tothe dramiel is fine because it takes slightly longer for them to be easily affordable than other frigatescost also becomes much less of an issue when you barely lose them and with a competant pilot in it its quite hard to die in one of those thingsof course all of this is irrelevant because of the simple fact that there shouldnt be a clear best in any ship size its a simple question really if you have the skills and the isk to fly the dramiel  why use any other frig2 weeks training big whoop easy enough to acquire if you honestly think dramiels are expensive how about running something better than level 2 missionsnope theyre an excellent example of how cost doesnt matter to peopleeasily worked around pathetically easily in fact if you cant figure out how thats your problemboth abusable if you take 5 seconds to think about it
kill the tier system if the tier system went away and more ships were useful it would expand content in this game tremendouslyfix hybrids theyre patheticgive balance to active repping ships those with resist bonuses can rep and buffer tank but the active rep ships cant maybe give the active rep ships a bonus to received remote reps as well

the eos has 3 main problems that make it ineffective in modern eve warfare1 its a blaster boat that wishes it was a drone boat right now the eoss bonuses are split between blasters and drones you have a huge drone bay but without a damage bonus the dps from drones alone is rather pathetic forcing you to get in close with blasters whose shortcomings have been perhaps over discussed however by changing the hybrid damage bonus to a drone hpdamage bonus you help out the eos by allowing it to fit projectiles instead of hybrids without sacrificing damage also because projectiles use no cap it makes the ship more cap stable which is key for an effective active tank 2 its an active tank in the era of passive tanks this is an issue that effects all gallente ships and im not going to get into it here 3 information warfare links are virtually uselessthe only decent warfare link in the bunch is electronic superiority but even then its a niche player honestly when does a gang ever have more than 1020 ew other than thatrecon operation isnt worth the fitting costsensor integrity is nice but doesnt go far enough to fix these i suggest moving the range bonus from recon operation onto the electronic superiority warfare link give a scan resolution bonus to the sensor integrity warfare link and in place of the recon operation warfare link add another which boosts tracking and falloff these fixes would at least make the eos useful though still weak for a command ship and if you give it the myrmidon hull in addition then i just might keep flying my eos after i finish training for a slepnir
so again you coviniently ignore my valid point and didnt answer my question i highly doubt you have 20 drams or hell i doubt you have more drams than your favorite t1 frig or af despite your nitpicking of faction frigs cost my experience in bring a daredevil up against a dram  they run away or die so how exactly is the dram better just speed havent flown a cruor but id imagine the same fate with a quick power drain and its speed is gone bye bye dram btw i stated a kings plural of the frig class yes there should be or youre telling me everyone should just fly rifters how boring im also in favor of removing the tier system of frigs and giving them all nice niches to a more level t1 playing fieldtwo weeks training for dram to what buckle the seatbelt lol nevermind the support skills right and of course ur banter that they arent lost as often is that per use or in general of course this depends on the skill of a pilot just like any other ship but drams get killed quite often some more than others supercaps are different as they pertain more to the effect of alliance farms not the average individual your drivel about lvl 2 missioning pls weak saucefinally your pathetic workaround are you actually suggesting a fleet would dedicate a neutral sqaud to agress them with say 1 lasor each to beat the system assuming this is your easy undeclared route thats indeed pathetic and absurd i would then suggest that sig lowering was per aggressing module vs just per aggressing ship an easy solution again if ur workaround was diferent pls postabove all this bickering this is an idea wo the set mechanics ofcourse there would have to be tweeks and checks vs crap workarounds if u had another method workaround why not post ur backing instead of being childish afterall the idea is to promote more tactical engagements and dog fights vs blob warfare are you actually against this and by all means if you have a better solution against blob fighting post your brilliance our goal is a better eve by expanding on ideas to solve legitimate problems many believe blob fighting is dampening sig radius per aggressor was a creative solution if ofcourse developed correctly so how would you fix the issue
nope but i could if i wanted theyre not exactly expensive for anyone with an average incomeyou really are a tool its 2 weeks to get the relevent frigate skills up plus the same support youd use for any other ship in the game the point being its hardly demanding on time compared to other frigs but the performance is vastly higherregarding the rest of this trash of a paragraph of course a daredevil could beat a dramiel 1v1 but the daredevil costs even more and has serious disadvantages the dramiel doesnt the point being the dram may lose some 1v1 fights but with a competant pilot it wont get into those fights in the first place its too good all round and thankfully ccp are aware of this so i look forward to it getting a good hard nerfing personally im in favour of reducing the speed to interceptor levels andor removing a mid privately owned supercarriers do exist in higher numbers than youd think 15 billion  fittings isnt much of deterrant thereits not that far fetched if you think about it throw a few civilian guns onto a friendly scimitar and youll have a logistics with the sig radius of a frigate once again the point being any antiblob system that involves bottlenecking via targetingaggression will be abused in some way by those determined enough youre not going to solve blobbing until greater numbers ceases to be an advantage and how likely do you think that is of ever happeningyoud need either way more aoe weapons in game or one of those empyrean age trailer doomsday weapons neither of which would be a sensible thing to add
well like you said ccp is taking care of it my school of thought for a ship that is higher cost and availsble to everyone provides equal opportunity honestly whatever they do to it wont matter to me as i see it as its the same for everyone i particularly loathe certain whines when it comes to tactics vs a legitamate issue such as hybrids and probably the gallente i prefer finding game solutions to tactical issues like ecm rr and that bit apparently the dram goes beyond a tactical issue for most oh well so be it15 bill does seem rather cheap for such a monster despite a needed nerf would you think that with the alliance economy giants multiplying the costs would help reduce their overabundance plus as i understand it ccp have thought about a new mothership  a docking capital of course in the distant futureits a shame that people feel so deflated on the issue of blobbing that doesnt mean that a viable solution cant be implemented logically or more dramatically as it is a major issue nontheless guess well have to count on the forward thinkers at ccp to make those command decisions rather than bother to debate trolls in a forum over why it needs to be vs how to do it peace
in order1 boost gallente2 nerf the dramiel3 revamp ecm get rid of the current terrible mechanic4 get rid of the tier system
make it cheaper to produce t2  t1 items in 00 and watc hthe industialisation flow ofc people will be producing stuff in 00 and ship up to high sec but alot of it will also be dumped on 00 markets it fits nicly within the risk vs reward line to do this it should be easy and cheap to produce items that means no posses but station buffs make if affordable and worth it to upgarde stations pos manufacturing in 00 makes it insta un attractive cause u need to sell alot to gain back the pos costs
give better base refining rates in null not worsegive better turnaround on factory and lab operations 30 fasterreduce the material cost of outpost factories 30 across the board
i think this is implicit to the original suggestion improved capabilities for industrialization which also provides objectives for small gang raids into sovereign territory 00 powers deploy their nullsec industrial widgets which increase mining yields or ratting bountiues or production efficiency or whatever above and beyond what is currently possible in either empire or 00 which encourages the current highsec carebear types to venture out into 00 rather than all clustering around jita and motsu as they do now roaming hostiles can then attack these widgets and loot them to gain some sort of reward of their own if the owners dont show up and defend
this is a reasonable idea it would turn provi into a giant gold mine though but it ate the nerf bat hard in the anom change so life goes on
yes absolutely its the other side to this which needs to be done to encourage thisalso outposts should need fieldfarm products to remain active or theyll decay into progressively less usable states when captured you should need to spend a few days establishing your fieldfarms to get them up and running and theyll be typespecific and not much use elsewhere hitting the farms repeatedly could cripple an alliances ability to use a stations services

i think a better idea is to have hybrids web what they hitmaybe 5 for each turret or even increase the speed of the ship they are on by 5 per turret
i really like malcanis proposal i think along with the ammo change blasters would also need a mild range increase that way the tracking would not need to be boosted to the point where frigates are under constant threat anywhere near the blaster boatit would make them relatively useful
i like pretty interesting idea which might make hybrids both useful and unique
sounds like a reasonable idea to me and ive never been keen on lasers and hybrids following the same kind of range schema
anything is better than thisccp hate gallente
but thats precisely it 13 per ship for ca 15 ships and youre already at max i had a lot of loadouts for my ships ranging from interesting fits people posted in channel to corp preferred fits to fits from trusted friends etcso yeah supported 1
signed with capitals in the past this was a good and useful feature now turned bad and completely useless yes it had its bugs and the code needed some fixing love those niggles are still there though theres no way i can pick 50 of my 150 locally saved fitting i use them all more or less equally and exportedimported over my accounts many of us with more than 1 pc already knew what to copy between them and we still have to do that for other stuff bookmark folders for one its also a smart thing to do for backups as things sometimes break its a good idea on paper one that probably sounded cool to a dev in a meeting but where the 50 limit came from is anyones guess but it makes a very minor difference and has a very minor actual positive impact for a few a major negative impact for others
a weird comment have you understood the issue or thought it through to refit a ship using the feature usually took me 25 seconds with no second thoughts or errors didnt pick the wrong stuff with same icons by mistake theres no way even you can do that faster this isnt some minor bug that needs fixing it was a working feature that got deliberately nerfed into a useless state for many the old code still exists somewhere it takes 1030 mins to restore if time is the problem i would guess a few hours coding and a few days testing if they want to make it really right and has they found the time to do this in the first place do it right
giving an option is always good means that i dont have to suspend my accounts until i have the money to afford a new pc as it is at the moment the load times will make pvp and ship switching etc unbearable never mind how the poor missioners  traders are feelingso yep im pro choice

hmm i dont really see the point perhaps it is to remove those half trained skillsjust train them to full and it is your experience if you trained in industry you cant just erase it it is part of your history i wouldnt mind if ccp implemented this but i wont support your proposal because there are better things to work on
just stating the obviousbut wouldnt ccp want plex to be more expensiveas a side note vanity items are hitting the market in isk as well initial prices will be through the roof but as vanity items become more widespread on the market over time they will decrease in price you see most sensible people will see item b want it and sell their item a to get the isk for it literally people will through the market or their friends trade off vanity itemsgradually reducing the amount of aur and thus plex involved it wont ever completely remove aur and plex of course  if you looked at any other mmos recently youll know people are more than willing to just spend real money to get nifty vanity items
not this againaur is needed to stabilize the market people there are too many plex ingame ccp needs a way to get them out and stabilize their amount on the marketand plex will rise one way or another its too easy to farm isk and too many people prefer to play for free and buy their time via plex of course plex will rise it always has
i dont see any point in disconnecting it when you can simply trade items plex prices will go up and people will leave plex prices have already gone up no doubt people have already decided to quit
aur was introduced to cull plexall those vanity items only have the purpose to reduce the amount of plex in circulationasking for them to become available in alternate ways boggles the mind its contrary to the very reason they were put in in the first place
i dont support microtransactions so i wont support a different way of implementing them either
what would probably be a better idea are systems that contain limited population sites  for lack of better terms battlegrounds or arenas i hate to relate to wow but what youre proposing would really only work in such a system as queueing for an area that only you and a select individual or group can be presentwe also have this thing called canlooting in hisec ever tried it works like a charm believe it or notif youre mad that solo fights in lowsec and nullsec are virtually impossiblewelcome to lowsec and nullsec thats the point bring friends because you can bet they willhigh security is named so for many reasonsone such reason which applies directly to your idea is that solo or group combat can be carried out without fear of intervention if youre referring to the fact looting a can aggros the corp i proposed the idea once that cans could be triggered as personal  meaning they didnt aggro the corp  for this specific purpose or simply integrating a challenge function for individuals and fleetsalias challenges sveti accept fight  321 aggrod without killright for who loses ship is destructiblealias fleet challenges svetisvetis fleet boss or fc accepts fight  321 aggrod without killrights when you lose a ship all ships destructiblea player loses his aggression right but can still be killed if he flees the battle ie gets 1 au away or some such from nearest enemy aggression rights are canceled upon one fleet losing all of its registered combatants sounds simply on paper implementing would be tough but there is your safe version of a controlled battlewhich in my opinion has no place in eve considering there is no safe in eve even the marketplace can  you
you dont really get this eve concept do you
i have only one thing to sayplease visit your user settings to reenable images
ive never used these little buggers and i too thought you could  should be able to do this
considering skills are never useless just not used no more importantly just train the skills you need a new player will not make two months worth of wrong skillshell make two months worth of skills that are the profession he doesnt like or too spread out both are fixable with time and not that muchtime it takes an indy pilot to go into combat about one week  ta da youre in that frigate ready to get rollingtime it takes a trader to go into mining about one week  ta da youre in a cruiser miningtime it takes combat to go into trading you guessed it one week  ta da youre station trading with 30 buy ordersso noob mistakes really arent a good reason for skill remaps in any form at all considering it takes little to no time to pursue a new field in fact the same applies to veteran characters  they can switch fields at any time by simply getting the skills and starting as for recharacterizing  changing skills is what that is and you just proposed it there has yet to be any solid reason for a remap except i want to be something else now again  skills arent useless you just trained something you no longer want thats how you learn eve  by finding what you enjoy i started as a miner and stuck to it foreverthen realized i had more fun killing the competition than actually mining thus i now operate as defense for our mining operation it took me all of a week to change that mining barge to a wellarmed frigate now battlecruiser
it is just from time to time i want to get rid of those skills i didnt need in 5 years of playing eve i never fired a hybrid gun and i know i never will considering the sp loss could even be 50 people wont do it to recharacterize i guess
insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different resultsalbert einstein
no result yet
so you think that the titans should have aoe dd tracking enough to hit ab frigs be able to deploy fighters and jump without cynos  i mean look at the price tagin case you didnt get it isk has never and will never be relevant in balancinggenos were the first to mass abuse the angel ships as far as i know and also the first group with multiple pilots labelling them as broken after the fw crowd had screamed foul  take a moment to think about thatit would be the same as high ranking members of nc drf and goons spearheading the campaign to nerf supercarriers and jumpbridges
sorry if im out of the loop but let me get this straightif i am fighting a guy and a neutral character reps the repper goes red and i can shootas long as i can shoot the healer then i am good and dont support this threadi thought the problem was that the neutral repper would stay neutral and be unable to be attacked legallymal
i agree its a problem but i personally do not have a good idea to fix it and this idea is insane ive thought about this so much it makes my head hurt and im not sure theres a better way to make it then it is now the first idea that crossed my mind that also has obvious issues is to modify this idea to instead of only corpalliances can rep each other make it so it only applies when part of a war the first response to this that comes to mind is hey what if someone decs me and i dont even want to be in the war now i cant be repped in a multitude of situations that nerf many other forms of play other than the wardec and fighting in highsec so first idea i came up with epic failhopefully this is a bit more helpful than omfg u suck for saying rr is not teh win always and stop trying to stop me from using an unattackable until used shipthere is definately a big problem with how it works but you should probably make sure your situation makes sense and does not nerf other parts of the game before posting to the boards with it a really good fix that would actually work would only receive negative critasim in the form of omg u suck because it would be from people that use questionable tactics i see plenty of legitamite gripes with what this would do to the game and i can think of at least a handful myself to sum it up back to the drawing board i cant support this idea as it is currently written
you are correct in that the moment a neutral rrr starts repping your opposing force he becomes red flashy and you can attack himthe gripe that some have is a obviously you cant tell who is a neutral rr toon in system unless u faced them before b they can sit on your face if they want if they havent yet aided your opposition and theres not much u can do about it c rring anyone does not give you a 60 sec aggression counter thus they can dock or jump gate immediately because they are not attacking anyone d at the end of their rring they only get a 15 min aggression flag to the corp or person they aided againstrr is a force multiplier much like ecm they are aids to those that dont have pure numbers and quite frankly are neccessary as optional tactics to keep from a stagnant game of greatest blob wins mentality of course some people strictly view numbers as the trump tactic that should always win they stomp their feet and throw a tantrum because a mixed force of 6 spanked a pure dps force of 15 because the smaller force was smart enough to bring the right equipment history tells us in many cases where superior strategy and execution defeats greater numbers ive been on both sides of this battle after getting my butt handed to me by a smarter force i learned quickly how to both employ and counter these tactics i became a smarter pilot no force is impervious you just need the right tools a good plan and disciplined execution
in this case i would support making it so that rreppers could not dock or jump gate until a cooldown period is completeotherwise this is just like bringing friends to a street fight it might be a bit underhanded but it certainly doesnt need to be eliminated this is really the same thing as an ambush scenario in real life you never know what river boat will have bad intentions remember the uss cole i support realistic tactics in evemal

no seriously brainless gibberish perhaps you were just drunk and ed off caused by falcon have you reread this again when ur sober its terriblechance based jamming as they have it is actually very brilliant and very fair for such an ewar item theres mods to boost or defend against it pure and simple math and percentageall you wanna be wheel inventors are obvioysly wanting to tailor it or get rid of it because it impacts you adversely the cry of its annoying is like someone whining that damage is annoying because it hurts their ship to the point they explode and makes them useless or tracking disruptor making their gunship useless well no sht sherlock its part of the great variety of eve in messing with ur opponent the world you whiners want is stagnant and pathetic this isnt just point and shoot if thats all you want dust 514 is coming soon and you can get the hell out of the pod

lol just lol nice topic
i too support making eve an idiotfest where the most powerful weapon is simply crashing mwd frigates into anyone stupid enough to undock something larger producing the realistic result of everyone involved being reduced to spaceconfetti210kinda amusing but this troll has been done too many times
this would never work in eve too many people too many lag not enough control way too big titanson the other hand more adequate collisions could be nice not a fan of whole bumping thing
agreed the current proposal is a nogo damage collisions  failbut bumping should take into account mass so that a frigate bumping into a freighter should barely move it if at allps i think that the current bump effect is actually explained by the autocollision avoidance computer redirecting the path of both ships which is the reason why bumping happens this should be modified though so that only an object of comparable mass would bump your ship

atm the mechanic to gain sec status after you do some naughty things in lowsec is rather odd you have couple of options to repair it either in missions provided you have not dropped too low ninja or proper ratting in 00 or ratting in lowsec which is really not very effective waythis thread sums up the current mechanic nicelyonly difference i noticed is that the timer seems to be 10 minutes nowthe 00 and lowsec ways are not as much badly affected by the current mechanic quite the contrary in 00 you can gain sec status rather fast because every system got his separate sec status gain timer so running thru 56 systems and killing the most juiciest rats you can get nice boost if you are lazy to go round and round the systems or they are populated just wait in safe or cloaked and kill another ship after you gain sec statusmissions are another storyfirst issue is that not all mission rats give the sec status increase i dont expect killing some gallente ships will but for example eom ships should give increase pirate factions like angels sansha blood raiders generally give the sec status increase but not in all missions for example killing angels give sec status in angels extravaganza but it does not in worlds collide featuring angels and sansha sansha does not give increase as wellsecond issue is that if you do the missions normally the security status increase is pretty random as you usually kill targets that threaten you first tackling frigs and then proceed to the kill bigger stuff like battleships which give nice sec status increase iam not exactly sure how the timer works here sometimes it resets when you kill the battleship meaning that you effectively lose the time between killing the first ship and the battleship sometimes you just get the small increase from frig sometimes you dont get anything if you run the mission for the sole purpose of increasing your security status you can imagine this is pretty frustratingthe best way is to get mission after mission and when you get one that you are sure is giving the sec status and there are decent rats you can proceed get in kill one battleship get out or tank them for next 10 minutes repeat till there are no battleships left good thing is that the mission respawns after downtime so you can do it again i guess few have patience to try to get another good mission and repeat this process more than once a daynow what i proposeremove the timer and decrease the boost from individual rats but make every killed rat count so the rate of security status gain will be about the same as with previous mechanic sec status payout can be grouped like the bounty payout also fix the missions and rats that do not give sec status increase in fact every npc ship that have bounty should also give sec status increasewhat will it achieveif people opt to increase their sec status in missions they will be able to actually do the missions instead of just waiting for some timer as a by product they can earn more isk in bounties and mission payouts and maybe even having fun instead being stuck in one mission for days i am aware that it might hurt the rate of sec status gain when people chain couple of 00 systems and run around although iam not sure if that was an intended feature of the current systemmy reasonsiam playing this game for quite a while and i got involved in lot of different things it offers this is why i like it and i do not want to restrict myself out of empire space because of my current rather casual pirating activities there is crime and i accept the punishment but in case that the timer was not directly intended as the punishment but rather mechanic that was at hand when they introduced the sec status please do something about it afaik this mechanic is here possibly from the first days of eve
i actually like this idea i think it could work well into incursions and things like that it should be up to the mayor or whatever you want to call him to organise responses to incursions also it could tie into the new agent system with a better mayor able to encourage more mission agents to move into an area or maybe some kind of special mobile agents that just go to the best managed systems also they mayor would be responsible for maintinance of stations and stargates in empire and maybe have some stations andor gates disabled unless they are kept in a decent statemaybe you could get certain systems that are safe from this kind of inteference such as jita amarr rens etc so instead of having it by region you could do it by constalation with the empires taking control over the core systemsobviously this idea needs to be properly thrashed out and geared towards the noobs but i think it would be really fun for new players to get into
it would be nice if they used these forums ccp set up for csm that way players could actually interact with their representatives instead of listening to a canned audio clip and telling people they must be available at a certain time to ask their short question so you can give your political sound bite isnt really interaction thinking that players are going to chase down everyones blog and radio show is unrealistic plus they will just be repeating what they said in different media in different places there is something to be said for a centralized information outlet instead of telling players to search the internet
the truth gets out in the end
well in this case it certainly hasnt been locked well to quote a the wll used phrase security through obscurity is no security at all if people already have the source code and can make exploits why not open it up to everyone else who can find the exploits and report them to ccp before they have a chance to be used
give small gangs rewarding objectivesthere is nothing a small group of people can do that a larger group of people cant do betterfaster in eve your 30 man gang can not and should not be able to beat a similarly equipped 50 person groupthis will hold true for any goal or objective that does not have an arbitrary cap on the number of people involvedencourage gang on gang warfaresimilarly if two groups are fighting they will strive to bring more ships and reduce losses this will only break down if there is some sort of arbitrary x number vs x number mechanic if this sounds familiar you probably play wow with instanced pvp with x amount of people on each teamenable small gangs promotesic a response from other alliancesthey can and do most commonly form up lets go kill them to get them out of our space or get safe and dont die im not sure what other kind of response you had in mindconclusionthis is how eve much akin to reality worksentire form is babies
get safe and dont die or do not go to ab123 its camped is not the desired response the lets go kill em is what people are after if the defense fleet is largergood its an effective defense fleet there is a chance for kills on both sides note that a defense fleet is not always the main alliance fleet
the longest communication weve had from him since he was elected and its about his crap sums up the disaster that is the current csm
personally i dont think so and 15bil is iirc just the cost of the hull the fit usually runs into several more billion isk that doesnt seem to deter many people then you look at how much more a titan costs and those are still being built and lost in huge quantities it just seems when you get to that kind of scale money ceases to be an issueagreed trouble is safety in numbers is something that appeals to most people on a very fundamental level and again there needs to be some significant disadvantage to having numbers which at the moment there isnt

i do see an advantage for everyone to get a real money drain ccp get money and we get updatesif i knew that it would stop at this and we will always be able to get aurum for plexs i would say yes but sadly this quote from here made me wondermy fear is that they will do this for now and in a few months when we get used to this they will cut out the plex to make this real money onlyagain i do think ccp should get some kind of money drain and this is a great idea if i knew they wouldent be greedy and take it one steep furthertldr no
no
cosmetic onlyi like bis barbie in space i love to accessorize go to an ingame mall decorate my captains quarters with shiny wall art and such and what not beyond that im not in favor of it
whats this doing way back on page 9anyway another similar thread popped up name change with harsh conditions it has a few interesting points namely the one time only thing some decent comments heres a proposed ammendmentwhat do you guys think
i support it but i also have to snicker at all you folks who thought that calling yourself l33t names like spendingyourchilesupport was a good idea to begin with
all name changes should forever list in your bio the list of previously held names so people who change their name often will still have a record of who they were named previouslythere should be a 10 or 20 realworld fee so that only serious people would want to change their namemy name i pronounce jim luke but when i created this character i was using the french spelling unfortunately people still pronounce it jim luck id love to be able to change my spelling just once lol
with an aka ok it would complement well with incarna
i dont agree name changing is a metagame feature and as such should cost metagame currency not game currency otherwise those who have more isk can change the name more often etc besides we dont want a new isk sink that has nothing to do with the economy in the game it should cost dollarseuro
hmm but if i were forced to use cash then id just balance it out by paying for my account the next x months via plex purchased with iski think the fact that name changes are even considered metagame by some users is the greatest hurdle here  although its something common in the world around us and with the restrictions being considered it not only makes it cost ineffective to be used nefariously but reputation aspects are preserved via aka and the mass email idea presented somewhere why it wasnt included originally is baffling to me
i like it a few more things to be worked out 7km13 on blasters still seems long for example
blasters already have massive ammo clips so maybe just increase the capacity of railguns somewhat
just skimmed through the topic but what about t2 ammo if you want range with blasters you use null which is always more range than what you propose here talking about null anyway fixing that will go along way towards fixing blasters effectively 25 range boosts while amarrminnie get almost 50 range boosts
give us our local fittings back
i agree with this as well i undderstand the server load but there should be an option to save to local disk as wellsave for corpsave for personal localsave for personal server
i agree with ryan27996 that we should have the three options of for corp personalserver and personalhard drive
this is what was promised by the incursion 14 patch notes and im all for itccp has yet to respond to why they did not deliver as documented linky to my request for info the csm why is it that ccp completely removed the ability to save fittings locallynow we are forced to maintain our libraries of fittings in a 3rd party application or not at all talk about one step forward and three steps back
i reached the 50 limit almost immediately anyone who experiments a lot with how they use their ships andor flies many different types will quickly reach their limitthe number of allowed local fittings should ideally be unlimited  the only reason i can see for a limit is the lack of screen space in the gui to list them all
you still have to load the cq environment when you dock for the duration the ui is unresponsive ie cant click on anything cant undock because you cant click on anything cant use the market because you cant click on anything cant transfer cargo to station because you cant click on anything etc
denying readwrite access to part of the game files is going to backfire on you down the track when the patcher failsid prefer the game to be written properly in the first place
mission bookmarks
then we are on the same page i cant however agree with removing range penalties on all ammo types especially for railguns if you arent compensating damagetracking for something else it simply makes the characteristic unbalanced railguns have far too large of an optimal range for this to work within the limitations of the other weapon platforms changing between different ranges of ammo types is one of the few tactical advantages you have in combat that require perception and theyre also integral to many of eves pvp mechanics ranged ammo dictates how close you need to be from target if you can kite them safely or if you need to get within neut  point  web range to gank them fastest abs and mwds would also be used less for maintaining particular distances and more for nanosniper gangs that kite in a huge window of optimal effectiveness
so the point youre implying is that posting in internet spaceships forums is for unimportant people and you post this in an internet spaceships forumim fairly sure applying the term pubbie in eve is pretty laughable you running raids or something broneed a hug i love you bro

seems like a lot of work for a arena type of mechanic what is the overall point to have honorable 1v1 fights as you wander the universe accumulating your honor abuse 1 me and my duel partner are in a fleet and warp to a mission or other location where someone npcgroup of players might be hostile to us after we arrive together we engage your device and they cant do anything to us except smartbomb or bomb us we can sbbomb them as we are fit to do so just need to stay in your devices rangeif the point is honor you can get that on sisi more or less any other reason makes no real sense as single combat doesnt win anything real in eve it wont stop an invasion wont win you space etc so no real point to making this a modulemechanic i could also toss in something about trying to make an mmo a single player game i understand the desire to do things on your own but the game is mmo where if you have friends you get them to help it just makes sense to have help and puts you at a disadvantage to go it alone just for the sake of going it alone
interesting idea but terrible mechanic using a modulewhy does everyone always think that the best way to solve problem x is by using a new module or deus ex machina geez louise the only way play balance can be achieved while at the same time encouraging a new play dynamic is through the tried and true method of capitalism and economic rewardgive some economic incentive for solo victories post solo challenges and honor points straight up isk or maybe something more storyline and cooler new npc corps like new eden vigilantes battlenet sports or the the imperial gladiators consul have these npc corps run missions by way of players posting challenges and have others answer them have tournaments in the game where championship ladders can be made all matches will take place in designated systems players can choose to make the match private or public publicized location or secret depending on whether they want to risk a griefer just getting involved with the fightwinners of the fights get isk or maybe even better lp with the gladiator corps soon it will be so fun to be high ranking in a gladiator corp that most aspiring newbie pvpers will join them just for training everyone winsthe only solutions are economic solutions
ccp should sell this game to blizzard
i propose simple ui change intended to modestly increase pilot sa on the battlefieldproblem it is difficult to tell which direction ships are moving when zoomed out and how fast they are going this is especially problematic when fighting in anything other than a 1v1solution add a visible arrow 1 pixel thick through the center of each ship from aft to bow the arrow size should scale based on zoom such that it is always easily visible the length of the arrow should abstractly indicate the velocity of the ship longer if the ship is moving fast shorter if it slow disappear if the ship is stoppedbonus feature allow user to turn the arrows on and offdownsides the only possible downside i can think of is that it will give pilots more sa than they currently have but since thats the problem im looking to solve here i dont see it as a downside unless of course someone manages to pop me and this was the difference in such a case this idea would be terrible and id go whine on the forums about itupsides this is likely the best idea in eve everwouldnt add any server overhead as the client should already have all the info it needs to render the arrowit could be very low point count therefore shouldnt affect frame rates in a measurable amountwouldnt take the art dept long to come up with a single arrow modeldid i mention how awesome this would bedid i fail or amidoinitrite
engine trails used to accomplish much the same thingbut u are doin it rite i suggest that it be part of the tactical overview
have seen this suggested several times before once by me hahaany way should ccp take notice of your post instead of the threadnought several pages over ill give you a thumbs upedit gah forgot the necessary clicky clicky of the support box sigh
yea odd you cant do this always thought soa few random ships might need their excess drone bay space trimmed to stop them being boosted in missions butminor issue
grouping guns seemed to work so why not group drones into squadrons a super carrier puts out 20 drones that the server has to track instead put them into grouped squadrons it probably reduce their lag on the server a ton and i really dont see a down side to this
the difference is that unlike turrets drones can be interacted with in space you can shoot them ewar them etc which makes for weirdness and balance issues if you group them for example if the squadron is a single entity with 5x the hitpoints its much harder to reduce incoming dps by killing off drones since theyll still be doing full damage even when 4 out of the 5 would normally be deadturret grouping was a nobrainer since it had virtually no knockon effects on balance it was a simple lag reduction method drones arent so simple
or at certain intervals of lost health it looses dps
per ccp its not working as intended
per my ass one throwaway statement by ccp does not a definitive comment make
we will see in time 
i dont really get unprobeable and tend to assume you either do not know how to use scan probes or havent trained the skills but ill address this comment anywayuse your dscan its really very simple if you have any idea howwarp to a celestial and align to the sun stop ship drop 1 core scanner probe and 4 combat probes and cloak up if you have itneed it alternatively you can sit at the sun and look at a celestial which will give you better dscan coverage but your reference to the solar map will be harder to definehit solar system map drop your core scanner probe on the sun with 32 au and 4 combat probes in a diamond covering the system with 32 au overlapping coverage cycle your probes and drop the mapmax dscan range and hit 360 degree radius then cycle the dscan see what pops upcheck your probe results for anomalies and note their location with relation to your ship and the sun using the solar system map and moving back to ship viewrotate your view not your ship as its your directional reference point towards the anomalies that have ships in general area and decrease the dscan radius to 30 degrees if those ships are available from your location pinpoint which anomalies the ships are in this way then fly to the anomaly with the unprobeableprobeable shipif its a mag or something then just scan that down and fly to it problem solvedif the ship is just sitting in a safe spot then just scan it down im pretty sure if i can scan down a drone you can scan down an uncloaked loki
you seem to underestimate my ability to find ships fast using direct scanner  probes andor purely direct scanner the comment you quoted actually told i dont believe its possible to find ship using just directional scanner within 15 minutes yes i know how but also i know how much time it takes even for person whos extremely experienced at italso you seem to miss understanding of how current scan system works no you cant probe down unprobeable loki at a safe spot
not supportedpirate scum is doing their lowlife mission invading too much already as it is if people are willing to fit mods to be unprobable then thats their prerogative you have mods and skills to probe people out others have mods and skills to defend themselves against thatand thats how it should be
translated im a whiny pirate who cant stand that my potential victims found a way to defend themselves boohoo please ccp fix it for meyou are doing the exact same thing as carebears asking ccp to put a stop to highsec suicide ganking but then in reverse shame on you and all your followers
thats his point
so why the heck would you want to do this  to recharacterize or just to keep your skill list clean are you ocd
it would be nice to be able to put those few sps into something i really want to train and didnt do because of n00bism anyway i am risingson and who tf are you
look sooner or later probably later youre going to need to retrain them as there are a finite amount of skills plus you might need to use them someday you might as well keep them now and just move on and what about the noobs who make the mistake of thinking they want to unlearn something and then realise that that was their mistake and whine and whine about getting their skills back
well i will survive if i cant do this but it would be nice to play around imo and this is a game after all well true that young players could unlearn things they would need later but this could be countered by an exponential sp gainback percentage or it is only available after you learned an unlearning skill which needs things a noob cant or wont train at the beginning whatever i am sure there would be a good solution for this even a solution guys that do not like the basic idea of this would use then 
precisely and in every game there are rules that everyone plays by so changing a rule for the benefit of a few ocd enhanced gerbils makes no sense
gerbils ftw and you talk  man
why thank you
 this while im all for a bunch of freed up sp the reality is that current skills deemed useless by noobs might actually be prerequisites for something they do want later on
following on with the general theme dramiels are not overpowered because1 a coercer will kill them  yes a cheap destroyer2 a daredevil will them been in both situations above

hello as a new player i see that there are a lot of npc corporations you can work for do missions i find annoying everytime i take a mission undock and always need to right click search for mission name then for encounter line then follow that line and finally tap warp to line not to mention sometimes you slip of that line and need to repeat the whole procedure again so lets count if u are in a mission system you need to do three clickswhy not to make a separate space with missions name and button for straight warp as we have system information space in uiits the same with with mission info window but in a good way glad there is mission system placed as a link so you can set it as destination imagine you always would need to write down destination f10 search for it then make the click and finally close starmapimho just unneeded clicks your opinion always welcome thanks
people and places  places tab  agent missions
again three clicks and unwanted table header with search field buttons to cover more of beatifull eve nebulas when only one line is needed nah thanks
um you need two clicks one right click to open the menu and one left click to select warpand if 2 clicks is too much go play something else
ccp has said they plan on making bookmarks visible in the overview so this should solve that problem that brings it down to 2 very accessible clicks lets wait for that fix that should do it
what else is there to play ive watched wow and even hko you torture your mouse compared to this game sarcasm with a bit of honest questioning
neutral rring is an old topic the only way to correct this truely is to give them the same gcc as the ship in combat they are repping makes the game much more playable because until then they can just dock and undock at leisure im not against neutral rrs im against no combat timer for any rrer repping a ship thats flagged
just as the title says incarna and all of its features cq and other related stuff should be made optionalthat is all you may now trollflame at will
it was already stated that it will be optional
lol and where exactly was it statedlog into sisi they instaled what looks like full incarna build with new floating ui etcthe only thing optional in there is that you dont have to wait for cq to load to use station services  station loads as fast as its used too hangar screen is covered with loading bitmap nice one to be honest but old station ui is responsisve when cq fully load you get bitmap removed and can also use cq content
you already have them its called minmatar frigates skillbook any proposal such as this which without much justification or research advocates changing something that could catastrophically change the play balance of the mechanics of combat in the game is usually a badideatm
at least you are being pragmatic about this proposals lack of substance which is a good thingid like to ask why though is it such a bad thing that the gallente dont have a long range weapon i am giving you the benefit of the doubt here assuming the arguements to support this are truewhy must all races be exactly the same if gallente ships are indeed so gimped then i would expect to see nobody fly them yet that isnt the truth i see race differences is what adds color and realism to the universe of eve i think this arguement that all races need equivalent weapons as an arguement to make all jeans the same solid blue color it will make them lose their characteristic imperfections that make each one individuali mean if you give into this arguement then soon you will have people complaining that the minmatar freighter is the weakest in armor and needs to be buffed vs the other races frieghters etc etc not supported

are there any news on the csm may 2011 meetingi know it takes time to write them down properly but could we maybe see some of the notes maybeplease djust some kind of update would be nice o
two step posted on failheap yesterday that they where aprox halfway done with the transcriptions i give it another two weeks
this
this idea has been defeated unless you can think of a solid counterarguemnt to the posts belowi think we can all agree that ecm is out of tune with the rest of ew it has been modified nerfed etc so far from its original form that i think this chimera needs to be put down in the ensuing vacuum i propose this illcontrived madness remotedirectedvectoredprojected  damage shieldingdeflectiontransfer module name under development itll be a scripted mid module whichdefensive script the module raises an additional defense for a ship one targeted ship per active module within a certain range formations in which a percentage of the incoming damage will be directed to the user of the module to the limits of the module users shields andor armor somehow while the rest continues to the attackers intended victimoffensive script restricted to a shorter range 20km max skills a percent of incoming shield andor armor somehow damage taken by the modules user is discharged to targeted ships one targeted ship per active module no additional defensive valuethere would be the usual stacking penalties and with maxed out skills and multiple modules two or three or a limit of one per target im thinking the transferred damage should be no more than 25 the moduules duration would also have to be long enough to discourage quick swapping of scripts the presence of these two scripts is intended to slightly lower the kill it with fire shooting priority currently given to ecm and logistics since there could be consequences while being more fulfilling to utilize i am worried that it could be a buff for spider tanking what to do about multiple ships using the module on the same ship defensive script rats is this even a new idea please give me your constructive thoughts
considering you get the client source code every time you download the client its no surprise how it gets leakedrumors of server code being leaked have been popping up but no confirmation on it yet at least nothing suitable
problem with that is the source code comes with a warning that if you even look at it they might bansuesend a hitman to kill you we need an open policy on this so people can look at it without risking their accounts
hii have major issues with the way eves market works currently it is stupid this is because there are rules and mechanics in place whicha create slow price discoveryb drains liquidity and thus ends up making pilots pay a higher spread the difference between the highest buyer and lowest seller than is necessaryc do not promote a good gameplay to elaborate trading especially station trading is something which benefits the players of eve because it creates liquidity for players who need to dump or buy large quantities to an extent this is already happening but trading is so boring the spreads on many items which have high turnover are still over 10 unacceptably highso i have the following propositionsmarket punishes adding liquidity brokers fee is paid by the lister of the order and not by the taker it should be the other way around or no way at all there is an incentive not to list an order this means that everyone who may want to buy at a certain level may rather wait for liquidity to come to them in the form of a listed order instead of providing liquidity by listing an order at that price themselves if its not obvious how this causes a liquidity drain feel free to commentthe market should be an auction all real life commodities markets function like auctions this means that if i have a bid in the market at 50 and somebody throws a limit order at 40 into the market i will still get filled at 50 in eve i get the stuff for 40 while i am the highest bidder this is just stupid markets function best when they work like an auction for some reason a market order which means sell to the highest bidders or buy from the lowest sellers is also impossible in eve you have to manually select which price you want to sell or buy at to execute at the most attractive price in continuation of the previous point one should be able to give a list price and a maximum price in which you will automatically outbid your competition by 001isk until you can outbid no more to prevent manipulation one could put in a delay timer so that when you are outbid you do not immediately outbid the higher bid this way it will become less transparent to your competition what your maximum bid is which is good for everyone if its not obvious how this will lead to faster price discovery please let me know ill explain further
yes
one trillion docking fee
and when they are ganked on the undock every single time by the sov holders what do you think theyll do
play station games like they do in high sec
these accessories should be player made like everything else in eve imhoit is a lack of vision from ccp to add microtransactions to eve it is just a short term money grab nothing more nothing lessthis will be ccps cu now lets just hope they dont pull an nge soon afterand to know they were doing so well with 364875 active paying subscriptions in march 2011i predict that if they would release incarna with everything player made subs would rise by at least 200k in 1 year that is once player owned shops and everything is implemented there is currently no alternative to swgprecunge eve could fill that gap if ccp would not be so shortsighted
i have a couple of characters whose names i have grown tired of and i would love to have the option to change them i agree that namechanges need to be limited even oncealifetime would be an improvement
people who would want to buy isk for usd are going to do it anyway name changing is not going to make too much of a difference in that market i dont like the idea of somebody saving up isk to pay for a name change name changing cannot affect the economic worth of any item in the game its akin to the current fee charged for moving characters between accounts
well if money is that tight for you then you would probably buy plex anyway 
no thanks
now now lets not make assumptions about people  actually my personal views are against any sort of outside currency affecting the game but that would be a major thread derail that id only be willing to argue elsewhereback on topic while i do appreciate your taking the time to reply cybergh0st could you please elaborate as to why i think it would prove educational for the both of us
so basically you are whining because you cant kill 300 supercaps with 1000 characters with 1 milion sp each mmos have allways been like that those who aquire enough wealth and xp are marching over the noobs supercaps require a vast ammount of wealth and xp to have and to hold them and an equal ammunt of ingame experience  just look al all yours and nc noobs that lost them in sanctums pos jbs and other embarrassing placeswhat you ignore in the whole nc war is that the antinc fleets didnt come only with supercaps  their subcap fleets  our fleets  already wiped the floor with yours in most battle before bringing out the supers in fact there was never ever any super only battle from drf and friends we just had well balanced fleets while you didnt and mow you cry you didnt even have the guts of jumping into our fleets supercap blobbed or not500 including supercaps vs 900 subcaps  whatever supercaps you caould have gathered  and you didnt even try its not supers broken  its your alliances as far as dropping lonly supers in lowsec just take a look at rooks  kings tactics  theres a lot you can learn from them
the day eve can be compared directly with the massconsumer products out there is the day i and most vets i reckon bugger off problem with supers is that they require abnormally high numbers or supers to counter which is contrary to all other areas of eve  there is no trick or gimmick that allows you to bamboozle a 50 sc swarmwe had all the theorycrafting in the presc buff discussions think it took 101 dreadsscs to kill the damn things and that is before factoring in rrremove ewar immunity  solves practically all issues solologistics lowsec ganks swarm rr etc with scs without making them pos ornaments
wrong 2 timeseve has more to do with other mmos than you would like to admit there are some differences but as a concept its still a mmo50 scs wo support will die from an organised fleet of 500 bses and if you calculate means that they sces arent cost effective to use ofc noone uses 50 scs wo support thats why they seem invincible buy why do you think noone uses 50 scs wo support btw you have never used a sc in lag have you  just pulling out fighters might take anywahere from 10 to 20 minutes and that in low lag so no scs arent very good against bses
sure it is an mmo but you are comparing it directly to the genre as a whole a genre which has all but expunged nonplayground themes name the mass market mmo where a relative noob has a snowballs chance in hell of besting an oldtimer through skilldecisions name the mass market mmo where a majority of items are made solely by participants name the mass market mmo where an early weapon is not automatically obsoleted by all subsequent weapons in eve terms ship classes etc etc ad nauseumand yes of course you can defeat scs by blobbing the snot out of them big whoop does that mean that should be the yardstick of balancing thoughif so all of eve should be revamped to fit this new paradigm i am sure eve will be much better off with just 23 large entities vying for control  people who dont want that can just go back to wow or whatever childish game they came from right
so its perfectly acceptable to say release a ship that costs 1 trillion isk can one shot any ship every 60 seconds and has 5 billion ehp so it needs 1000 supers to kill it or 50000 sub caps to kill it i mean if i manage to buy it i sure as hell deserve to be invincible right and what if an alliance manages to buy 100 of them its bad game design to have the only counter to a ship type being the same shyp type in bigger nrsyou can not counter a 300 man supercap fleet because the servers do not allow it
even with the dd its only a 5000 dps push with the 10 minute timer and that is assuming that you are shooting at a target that can take the 3 mil damage everytime dd is only weapon in the game that deals overkill damage really or at least measurable overkill 1000 wasted damage points
you wholly missed one of the points wich is supers arent invincible shure blobs of them are hard to fight but that is tue and was true for any ship out there they are currently on top of food chainso yes its hard to fight a blob of them but not harder than fighting a blob of anything that would be any blob of whatever is there on top one of the things that attract people in this games atr the massive fights take any of the points you mentioned in previous posts and you will find it in a certain way implemented in other mmos except the massive fights on this no other comes any colser this is a predsposition to blobon the other side one thing that trully is common to all mmos is that an older player has advantage to newer players supers are hard to come by and thats what its all about if they would be that easy everyone would get one and end of storry but for the ammount of effort to get one they are not opeveryone whines about the fact that if some alliances would not have had the ammount of supers they would not won the battles they did fact is if we nerf the supers those alloances would have still won noone denies that and if they do the killboards show the storry but making supers useless once again wont fix anythingtldrblobs of enough anything will allways winsmall ammounth of supers  ex lowsec learn to deal with them  look at rooks  kings
noone fitted sc costs 8000 the price of one fitted battleshipit takes about 2 years to get a char ready to use one properly an then you have to keep one acc acting as an exclusive alt or holding alt there is no insurancecynojammers can be protected with supers caps and subcaps against subcaps alone so doesnt matters how many supers one enemy can gather rl skills and tactics are still the big factorthe only thing that should be adjusted imo is the logofskyselfdestruct mechanics when agressed ofc make the timers related to the mass of the ships from frigs to titansany other adjustment should be done with carriers and dreads they should be more relevant in a supercap fight
i have a dream dream where carriers and scs send their fighters away from themselves while they sit and do what carriers do lead their fighters from wherever they are hidinga dream where this is countered by convops working together to pinpoint their location and by sbs that bomb them with something that brings their bombers in frontline to grinding halt or simply denies reloading from themi know its nonsense but thats how id like to see them done but mans got a right to dream amiriterandom giberish beside i do think theres a problem and this might be the fix or this might be too much or not enough but doing something is better than not doing anything and weve tried that before

finally someone on the thread who is asking the right questions even though on the surface the proposal sounds both interesting and plausible to me the real question to ask is why people think there is a problem here gallente are supposed to be drone heavy caldari missles amarr lasers min projectiles unless you think that current overall game balance in ships for the entire race is skewed then there is no point balancing just the gun typesoverall the most important play balance is thisif hybrids get a  without associated  somewherethen gallentecaldariwhich makes it unfair unless you also buff out amarr and minmatar somehow for simplicity sake lets say that means buffing out lasers and projectilesit makes no sense to equalize out just the guns which are only 12 of a racial weapon mixas for the megathron oh well there are plenty of odd ship hulls in every race which just arent too popular due to their specialization its a futile exercise to try to make every ship equal to its racial opponents and to do so would be to take away the characteristics which make each race unique and the tactics they employ different
the problem is that rails and blasters flat out suck in comparison to other races weapons and drones are currently not an adequate increase in dps to compensate for this let alone that most other hulls can use drones nearly just as effectivelyi doubt wed see so many threads about fix gallente if the problem was just in our heads
if they are supposed to be droneheavy then why do the majority of the gallente ships have hybrid bonuses and only a few actually have drone bonuses the fall back is drones simply because of the gallente ships the drone boats are the only ones that have a functional niche saying gallente have drones so hybrids dont need work is ignoring 70 of the gallente ships and 20 of the caldari ships that are hybrid bonus heavy
dont be so dumb matar amarr already op compared to hybrid shipsand only half of gall is drone oriented and only half of caldari is missile so you are a total fail pls uninstallbtw if matar is projectile then take away their speed agility and scan res
supporting this hated cq from the first second i logged onto sisi i have absolutely no interest at all in stuff that hasnt got a purpose sure it might be great in a year or three when stuff is actually added but for now theres absolutely no reason at all to force the players to use this unresponsive pos to do their normal instation activitiesalot of us were used to rightclick on ship when in station to access drones and other simular hangars aswell as double clicking to get the cargo holdi very often run 34 clients on tq where 3 often are docked at the same time this i cannot do at all on sisi now since running 2 clients with cq apparently requires some kind of supercomputercq should be optional
as i was just saying i just played bis barbie in space for the first time on sisi and im experiencing no problem with it whatsofrakkinever runs smooth as silk and what are the silly naysayers on about with this being resource hungry bloody cq loads in highest quality in less than 2 seconds has full and correct lighting and everything works flawlessly except for one tiny error when undockingmessage undockwithapparelargs im sure thats extremely minor though and speaking of undocking you can click undock at every moment when in cq and you will automatically undock so what is all the bull about with people claiming they need to walk 30 seconds to get to their shipnope im now more than ever convinced that this is eves future and that it should be kept a mandatory upgrade long live bis
enjoy the free game time with your plex and continue to try and skew the game to your liking im sure it will definitely help eve in the long run not this expansion is a small stepping stone for players to completely walk in stations  let me guess you want this to become optional too once it arrives
i wouldnt mind if cq were optional at all eb had station walking and i always dreaded docking because the game play slowed down badly when i first started playing eve i tried to get out of my pod while in station because i had assumed that id have to walk around to get stuff but i later realized how much faster it was to do everything from your pod
signthis is definately something that should be optional to load either from esc menu or another undock button cept this one would be unpodwhy because it makes no sense that you would go trough the pains of having two clients for so long and then suddenly forget everyone who plays with obsolete hardware  multilogs when its crap that doesnt even affect gameplay to the extent that new graphics did and by this i mean fights became more resourceintense et ceterawhy would someone not agree with the point if you want cq enable them from esc or click that 1 button not that hard and if you dont you still get quick station load via not pressing the button or just unselecting from esc menui cant even imagine the pain of having to load cq on an old laptop 35 times in a 5 minute period while hauling cans or doing something other equally tedious not to mention some of us like to run other games on background while 20 heroic reds sit outside a station prefenably in caps cq will only make eve use more resources on background and thus disable for example my ability to run resourcehogs like da2  eveoso yeah lets please have it as optional

shouldnt have been removed i am in support of bringing it back
there has to be an increase in 00 space as only the drone region has been opened up since the great nothern war and yet the player base has went from 10k to 40k in that same period i second mr starks idea
im not sure thats the case ccp has opened up a lot of new space with the wormhole mechanic and i think that has yet to be fully exploited by larger alliances so theres amazing oppotunities for smaller alliances to build up inside wormholes and then come out when the time is right and put a real dent in the more established alliances i accept they cant build supercaps there but they can make a huge ammount of isk and for reletively little risk newer alliances should try to explore more and be more creative rather than whinging about percieved lack of space possibly ccp should increase resources available in wormholes that would even things out a bit
at least its not cleavland
i support this space isnt ment to end it goes on and on and onscorpionidae
i would add that they should make deklein the connecting region to this vast amount of new space
why not the ability in null sec for the territorial claimant to be able to install gatestation guns with the ability of opposing forces to destroy said gunswhy not the ability in null sec for the territorial claimant to be able to hire a concord type npc entity not as powerful and pay a monthly price to secure the space without losing the quality of the system with the ability of opposing forces to overcome system security and claim the systemor whatever i dont know just rambling thoughtsedit it just seems to me that the ability of an alliance or coalition to actually build their own empire space would add to the game
if you just want 1 vs 1 fights go play on singularity
away with your fair fighting i want no such thingseriously tho why would you want to fight with honour its much more fun to lurk around in a sb bridge in and make someone butthurt
if you end up in a fair fight youre doing something very wrong
i dont see why notbut only as part of the tactical overlay
associating it with the tactical overlay seems like a great ideai know this idea sounds a lot like the engine trails but the shortcoming of the engine trails is they are tied to your zoom level therefore when you zoom way out you can no longer get a feel for direction and velocity as the trails disappear into the pixel of the ship and bracket
first 10 to guess the year ccp change hybrids get 50 milfirst 5 to guess the month and year get 200 milfirst 2 to guess the exact date get 500 milfrom my hybrids awareness campaign fund
2012 summer patchid say winter but meh thatd be too soonoh and right after that happens world ends thats how much they buff em
i am going to guess never considering if they did ever change it it will be a far cry from what everyone thinks it should beso i winpay me
2014 june 24thi am gona wait a long time for those 500 mil 
24th december 2012or alternatively when a large bunch of people go to fanfest with the exclusive intention of making the issue impossible to ignore
2012 june 7th
may 14th 2012
itll be the week before the servers close down for good
yes  should be possible
it only makes sense having said that how many people have to support an idea before ccp will even comment on or acknowledge the idea ive seen so many great ideas on here and some with lots of support and yet no acknowledgement whatsoever from ccp i mean were comingup with great ideas on how to improve the game doing their jobs for them and nothingthis should be implemented already
problem s as a singleentity imagine ifyou hit it with a gun that would usually 1sho a drone you would damage beyond that to where you would take out hp equivalent to 2 drones when usually you would ony take down one making drones pretty much useless when the oppponent does more damage per shot
easy enough to code it so the max incoming damage doesnt exceed the life of one drone
soo then i target the stack and heal them and miracle happens the drones that where dead are now back p
make is so that once an intervaldamagehealth is lost it cant be regained
then what about ships like the ishkur that have backup drones they shouldnt lose their drone dps until 60 of their drones are dead
use backup drones like normal and dont include them in already made squadrons automaticly their situations is in almost every scenario initially totally different from the drones already in space so it would only create problmes if you tried to include them in an existing squadron that wouldnt mean you couldnt add them to an existing squadron already in space but it would mean they have to fly to the squadron location before they get added otherwise they would function just like they do now you would see the squadron status and the individual drone statuses separately like you see for every individual drone nowthe purpose of the feature is to just reduce lag and as a side benefit you could propably make focus fire work properly since only a single drone behavior is used for all drones so they couldnt go off to attack targets individually anymore just like weapon grouping if you dont want to use this feature for whatever reason you dont have to
to be honest i like the idea for caps afterall to make fighters or fighterbobmers effective theyd have to fly in a formation anyway plus itd be just that much cooler to look ati cant agree with normal drones whatsoever to most extent
care to clarify what makes a loki unprobeable i have scanned down a warrior i drone that someone left sitting in a deadspace pocket which had since expired bookmarked it and warped in and picked it up i find it hard to believe that a loki without a cloak could be unprobeable considering there are no modules or implants which are designed to defeat scan probes and sure as hek they dont have that small of a sig radius even with the implants
loki has base sig rad of 150m too right a few conjunctive ladar eccm scanning array is would do it
the part youre missing is that i need to fit all those eccm mods at the expensive of something useful i could have fitted instead so my ship already cant reach its full dpstank potential just because pirates exist who invade missionsfor every offence eve should and does offer a defence you probe i defend thats as balanced as it gets its ridiculous that ccp should hardwire it so offenders can always win
hell noridiculous just for you maybeby fitting eccms you lose tank you dont need overtank for l4s and with eccms tank is still sufficient so you can keep all the rigors and bcss if you wish this already has been discussed in this or linked topic please check
just saying hell no doesnt make it any less balancedwhat should be enough to fit to survive is irrelevant the issue is that i already need to sacrifice dearly just to defend myself from being scanned down that sacrifice alone is the balance between you fitting mods to scan and me chosing to fit mods to defend against such scan and since ccp always favors the aggressor as it is i already need to fit more mods to defend myself than you need to fit to scan meso whats next youre gonna petition to do away with warp stabilizers because god forbid someone might outfit your points on him
your arguments are countered by the fact that such ships are keeping iskhour efficiency it is irrelevant for you but not for me  remember still the same offensive capabilities and tank enough for l4s and ridiculous price of eccm mods if making ship unscannable would cost 2 bils  noone would whine herewarpstabs can be countered by additional pointsbubble unscannable setup cannot be countered by additional probesprobers so no theyre not going to be next
a single ship can only fit so many eccm mods whereas you can bring an entire swarm of probers so its entirely reasonable theres a ceiling above which you cannot go  and that said ceiling be lower than what a single ship can defend againstsee bringing more points at a gate is fair you then simply outpoint the ship youre attacking matter of superior numbers but with scanning its different its basically  to stay in the same terminology  like putting un uncounterable point on the entire system from many aus away wheres the equity in that if that werent counterable youd always win which is of course what you want people should not be able to defend themselves against a scandownseriously if ccp is going to rig the game in such a manner that pirates always win then i will seriously need to rethink whether eve is still worth playing and no you cant have my stuff
i cant bringcan you answer why its differentexactly people should defend themselves using a bit more interesting ways from gameplays perspectiveif youll leave when ccp makes each and every ship probeable  i wont cry
already did explain the difference being that you can do a system wide scan from a huge distance with absolutely no risk or danger to yourself whatsoeveri could say the exact same thing in reverse people should be able to attack others using a bit more interesting ways than just doing a system wide scan from afar and jumping on defenseless missioners not fitted for pvpof course you wont lets just hope ccp has the calm of mind to think it thru properly and wont give in to every pirates petition for more powerrrrand if its unprobeable t3s that do boosting youre upset about ccp could simply make it so you cannot fit any eccm mod next to warfare link mods andor command processors problem solved but even there whats the harm really you fleet them the enemy does again perfect balance
if you undock you should be also probeable in sensible time we could also have honor system or something if we have unprobeable ships
in the name of play balance there should be no invulnerable setups no absolutes no insurmountable tactic that is unbeatableif the system allows for these situations then the system is broken and needs fixingin these bad play balance situations i am reminded of the starcraft zerg rush before blizzard fixed it by taking the number of starting larvae around a zerg hachery from 4 to 3 all zerg players cried foul but the truth of the matter is that without the change zerg players employing the zergling rush tactic was unbeatable i support this
exactly being scanned down should not be an insurmountable tactic that is unbeatable people should be able to defend themselves against it in the name of play balance please dont give pirates an i always win buttonedit to this i would like to add the rationale probing down is essentialy a form of ecm for every ecm there should exist the possibility of eccm simple as thatdrones can be scanned down because they cannot defend themselves to ecm  which is fine players however can fit eccm mods on their ships what people are proposing is an unbeatable form of ecm that should not happen
i like your example also i like how you blatantly missed that even with full meds of eccms you still can be jammed lol
i love it  just adds another great option to the eve universe
wait so if you are moving playersand the ferry gets gankedyeah that would be cool
the people who owne bpos are makeing all the money the people tryin to invent and sell fo a peoffit  total waist of time  you might as well just give your money away your spending all this time and isk to invent a t2 bpc and when its all said and done your makeing isk when you want to see isk for all your hard work  i dont know about you people but when i got to work in the real world i dont want to be handed a bill for my hard work  thats what inventions feal like  i do all the training 6 months to a year and still going i buy all the stuff countless missions to get the bpo i do all the me and pe wow that takes a long time  now that 2 years of my real life is gone i have 3 or 4 t2 bpcs and all they can do is make 1 ship or what have you wtf so i try aging  go thrue all the steps above minunulls the training the bpc im about to try has 15 runs on it  thats max for this coppy to have  once its done 1 run sale is 900k total envested 3 years well over a billion in closing bpos vs inventions nurff the t2 bpos or make inventions cost less and produce more 
oh look this thread again
i think around 95 of market t2 goods is made trough invention if you are not profiting you are doing something very wrongt2 bpos are literally few i would guess less than 20 per item and there are many hundreds of players running invention while with few inventions slots each while t2 bpo owner can produce using one slot at a time
laziness is a secret ingredient that goes into failure but its only kept a secret from the person who fails robert half
i miss back in the day when you could choose your skills in the character creation now im stuck with another characterthat has mining skill but is training for pvp id like to be able to retract the mining skills and apply them to a pvp skill since it the mining skill was thrown in my skill pool at creationedit clarification
 qftim a gallente pilot and im damn proud of my choice sure i had to spend time training other races to be overall more effective in eve but when i got in my first abbadon t2 drake etc i felt a sense of accomplishmentsuddenly making a once in a lifetime reset would have diminished that greatly and its just flat out for lazy people who arent willing to admit maybe i wont use this skill in awhile oh well time to keep improving myself
how to nerf the supers easy lets make like a scarrier have around like 10mill max eph and a titan around 20mill max they are not ment to be cost effective and reducing the eph to around a third of what they had will make them more vunerableno ship class in the game should only be able to be countered by more of it no matter how much it costsalso an easy way to fix dreads would be to change siege so that you can move for 5 minutes but you get alot more dps basically dreads lose tracking penalty so they can do full dps to the supers but they also lose tank bonus but can recive rr though they are committed to the fight so if something goes wrong they are stuck for 5 minutes at leastpsi am throwing out some numbers so those will need to be tweaked
how about just buff dreads so 10  15 sieged dreads can alpha kill one super carrier in one volley sounds fun 
10m ehp on a supercarrier would be silly thats 4 doomsdays to alphastrike it all youd achieve is that up and coming alliances with small numbers of supercaps would never dare field them unless they were sure that nobody else nearby had their own active supercapsan ehp reduction might be appropriate but if so they should still maintain 7080 of their current levels the main issues with supercaps at present is their unfocused role theyre effective against too wide a variety of targets and the aggro timers role as a getoutofjailfree card
or they would be if they could actually catch an angel cartel ship that isnt being flown by a dribbling moron
two ideas to improve scan and make it easier first to introduse customisible templatesits annoying to drag this arrow each time to make a new formation of scan probessimply premade em 4pr with 4 au 4 pr with 2 au 6 probes with 025 auetc save em and here you gosecond idea to make better damned direct scanwe dont need a click fest each n secwe need smth looks like a normal radarand of course notifying signals if smth can change for ex new shipprobeetc on direct scan we hear an notifying signal
the issue for the array is now the change we had about a year ago that said ram required  runsunitsramdamageit changed toram required  runsunitsramfor drones this resulted in a 2000 increase for those hi devs bhs and inventors who cant do maththat means for every 1 you previously needed you now need 20
could we please have the ability to add more than one person to a private contract separated by a comma like evemail i can think of dozens of situations where this is useful and it cannot be done and one is forced to issue corporate  alliance wide contracts which can get stolen
way to catch the 90day timer
whats the point we already won eve
i mine on six accounts in six boxes it is mindnumbingly boring i physically click and drag etc the whole time the only thing that keeps me sane is i play games on my xbox 360 like ncaa football 11 while the mining is going on monitor the cycles and run the iceore to the station when needed its the only way i have found to cope with how boring mining isedit as far as legalized macro mining i do not support it
back in the day before t2 and all the new stuff it was possable to pass through 20 systems in 00 before you came across anyone instead of fancy modules and stuff why not just introduce more systems that would enable smaller alliances to grab a bit of space as hopefully the bigger alliances would be to stretched to protect huge areas of the map apart from drone space has any other area been open up since the great nothern war we had 10k people on line back then with almost the same area of space so now that there is 40k people how about opening up some more space
possibly you might want to change the sovreignty upkeep system so it works in a similar way to the way wars work with the alliance claiming sovreignty being charged more for each new system they claim so for example while an alliance with one system would pay less than the current ammount maybe 200milmonth each new system would cost 250milmonth for the 2nd and 300milmonth for the 3rd and so on until it becomes financially unattractive for the alliance to control a lot of space that they dont use
and then youd just have thousands of alliances with two systems tnt tnt tnt etc etc
as i said in my thread  just get rid of docking permissionsthat is all you need to do to make it easier for smaller corps to live in null space from the perspective of a corp that doesnt really care about building a sov empire but only wants to live in null space such a change would be the equivalent of making the entirety of null space into npc sov there is a reason that so many neutrals go to curse  npc sov adjacent to empire even with dorilsendaya camped every day  plenty of neuts flow through that gate and dock up perfectly safely in any of the dozen stations nearby there is a reason that curse is such a great region  and it has nothing to do with angel rats
there was a guy that reverse engineered the server way back during trinity or summat
ah that was before my eve time so cant really comment on it
i agree on the broker fee argument maybe split it 5050 between seller and buyeri also agree on the suggestion that the markets should work like auctions however this would have little impact as your bid orders are typically filled by direct sells not listed sells finally i assume you trade yet you complain about too large spreads and inefficiencies does not compute i want spreads to be large for that reason i also do not support the idea of having a listmax price for automatic adjustment it would reduce 001 isk games a bit but mostly benefit lazy traders less so the active ones hence not supported
you are kidding right i always thought that tnt was a 00 alliance i guess not i cant even count the number of times ive docked in doril even with local full of hostiles i still manage to dock and undock fairly easily its not that easy to gank neutrals that have docking rights on top of a station the only time it really occurs is if someone gets aggro but none of that matters if ccp gets rid of docking permissions and instead uses some docking fee like 500k per dock more people will move to 00 entire corps will move and try to live under the radar in hostile sov systems whenever an alliance claims more space than they can rightly control and with a docking fee the sov holding alliance has an incentive to just let them live there sure roam over there and try to catch a few every now and then  but camp the station with a blob for a week straight to chase them off only if you are an idiot or they are working with your enemies
i forgot hics or hearvy interdicters to make some devs understand where im talking about could use a slight buff hp would be nice and or bubble range would be nice buff bubble range to 25 or 30 km at l5 when bubble is up the penalties are just too worse everything can simply burn out or u need to put your mwd on that makes u as big as a battleship  u die light dicters are much safer to use and hic arnt exacly cheap 200 mil min t2 fitted light dicter can drop simple bubble and cloak or burn off hic is in bubble alwasy agroos and a juicy target
noi would say cosmetic only   but thats the thin end of the wedge so nogtc is too much already
umh hell no no  no the hell were taking it njet ei intte nein
no 
they should also enable server transfer and race change for a fee too so that you can really escape your reputa  oh wait
lets stay focused on the topic of the thread which is name changes in regards to the escaping the reputation part of your comment in what way is the aka tab idea andor mass emailing idea etc insufficient
based on the crappy performance i have seen across numerous computers with cq along with other issues i fully believe this should be optional this is eve a spaceship game not world of darkness in space
cq should not be optional this is a feature of the game that should have been there from the start and now ccp wants to integrate it into the game as if it had been there from the start if we had always been exiting our ships upon docking since the game was released we wouldnt be having this conversation
no we wouldnt because if we would the code and computers used to play the game would go hand in handi dont buy that you dont understand the argument of introducing new graphical stuff to a game versus playerbase with multiple clients  not so good computer its the same story as moving from expansion to expansion when the new graphics came along something that arguably could have been in from start presuming your point of view i know its not realisticly possible they let us keep old clients long enough that only odd bunch had computers bad enough to run the old client only now we got computers that have been streched to max running the new client and adding new stuff might get them on the fritz therefore its better to not force them to load cq and give them the option not to this allows us who want cq to have it but allows those who do not want cq not have it who loses now could you please give some backing to the claim that it shouldnt be optional and how it affects your gameplay if i dont want to use my cq on my laptop for example
when pi came out i tried it didnt enjoy it and dont do itwhen incursions came out i tried it enjoyed fighting sleepers more and stopped responding to incursionswhen cq comes out ill try it and ask for the option not to use it if i dont want itsupported
i have nvidia 8800gtcq with high settings  10fpscq with low settings  15fpsin space with high settings  60 fpsdefinetly must be optionalsomething wrong with that cq graphical enginehorrible fps values failif ccp force players to use it many people will be disappointedand what if i want to run multiple clients its unplayable
pls just optional not more just pls optional
edited into first post and posting here as wellok so ccp have added on the sisi test build an option to not load the cq environmentthis is good but not what i was asking for this helps those who have performance issues with the in station environment not those who had rpimmersion issues please keep supporting for having a regular hanger view on docking ship spinning and all with a neocom button to enable us to disembark to enter cq when we want
no because they were overpooh wait supported
wait are you saying that you want the names that people want to change or is it that you think a longer list would somwhow degrade ingame performance im not trying to be sarcastic because i do think you have legitimate arguemnts i just dont think im getting it but if were talking about sarcasmlykouleon thank you so much for valuable input if not for that glorious debate on fine points i dont think we could ever have reached a mutual understandinglemme fix that actually that is rather surprising considering there are some supportive comments hereim gonna assume youre mature enough to handle this bluntly if the pirate spent hundreds of million isk or tens of dollarseuros just to kill you i think he deserves it the whole point of charging a fee for this service is to make such things cost ineffective
scarriers do need something done to them or however and probably alraedy proposed make dreadnaughts xlarge weapnons far more devestating when used against scapsthis has two effects revives the currently underused dreadnaught and brings down the i win button effect of super carriersbut supported as somethign needs doing
not down the same path as your ideas but a way to counter the super carrier blobs could be a capital size smart bomb or give dreads 50 added damage  range pr level on smart bombs when sieged also a capital ship warp disruptor to fit on carriers that can hold down super carriers  titans would solve a lot of the issues
seriously it was epic not sure why it was removed in the first place please bring it back flummoxps i can care less if this is the 420th topic about it
thank you to those who commented intelligently
why not for a reasonably large fee build a stargate taht opens up a new system
after seeing the replies i think my point has been misunderstood and the application of it is rather short sightedi never said anything about a fair fight you can force someone to be in a 1v1 without it being the least bit fair for him being fair is not the point its more about ambushing without the ambushed being able to get help and how they can be used in fleets where certain ships can enforce 1v1 against another ship and simulate rl warfare ambushes and guerrilla warfare try to look a bit beyond the obviousin real life military combat you cant really call for help whenever you want there are a thousand things that can get in the way of your calling for and getting help even if help is only minutes away if called in these situations getting killed usually happens in an instant a sigle special ops guy can take out another guy without the other guy or his buddies ever being able to call for help or knowing in real combat a scout can get dead and nobody really knows that it happened soldiers ships planes can be cut off from others without communication or help get killed and nobody lives to tell the tale the ability to strike a vulnerable target or targets of a group kill it and withdraw without getting killed then repeat is a essential aspect of the few being able to hold off or defeat the manyin eve this particular aspect of warfare is completely eliminated you cannot ambush a scout battlecruiser or hac without getting gang rpd by the whole fleet before you can even dent his shields you cant kill it fast enough and everyone just warps to zero on him and even if you kill it you would be next only way this happens is if the scout runs into a gang big enough to kill him before help arrives its the only wayin eve you cannot eliminate communication and third party knowledge of the event so you have to use game mechanics to create the strategic option of such combat people talk on ts or whatever and can always say whats going on where they are and give critical tactical info even if killed the only avenue left to you is to restrict acesss to the ambushed and at the same time restrict access to the ambusher as neither the ambushed or the ambusher would be able to rely on support in these kinds of situations all i was saying is that gang perma communication and warp to zero the very mechanics of eve eliminates a very very important aspect of warfare which has been around forever in rl used often and which opens up an enormous amount of possibilities and can eliminate the advantage of numbers in many situations im sure im not the only one who would like to see the blob effect somewhat mitigated by the ablity to isolate and kill by dedicated ships in rl the many can often be defeated by the few up to a point and its a very important aspect of guerilla warfare and not only in eve they cannot so you have to use game mechanics artificices to compensate for the differences in rl combat it would make it possible for smaller corps or alliances to stand toe to toe with larger ones if prepared
there is no way at the moment to kill a straggler ship without getting killed in the process you wont even kill it you will just die the whole fleet with lock and alpha you before you even get a shot off all the strategy is pretty much rinse and repeat its all alpha maelstrom  scimitar alpha abaddon  guardian tengu with scimitar the strategies are always the same with no real counter basically dps the hell and tank the hell outa everyone and if they get in range they dead its that simple but warfare is not there are a thousand other factors which are not present in eve and should be im not saying to allow the ambushers to ambush anyone and isolate anyone anytime but only under certain conditions which is distance from the groupthere are plenty of people who like the group thing who like blobbing and who like things always the way they are because it works for them the point of the system is not to work for you its to be balanced so everything can be countered with something else it is possible to make it work and eliminate the abuse of it so that it does what its meant to do and not be used as mentioned above thats just technical thoughanyway this was the whole point of this suggestion its not 1v1 for the sake of 1v1 or because i got blobbed to death or because i cant get enough friends to play with me or because my alliance sucks its 1v1 because i cant think of any other way to mitigate the numbers effect and create endless strategic implications
ill be sure to tell this to the multitude of gangs who do exactly this on a regular basis if youre shooting a straggler a system or two behind the fleet there is no way for the fleet to get you if youre shooting a guy on the same grid as a hostile fleet they arent a straggleras for your last sentence exactly why do you want that
1 i cant remember the last time we had a ship fall that far behind2 i cant remember the last time a small gang survived attacking a straggler bs or bc or managed to kill it before we got there the fastest of us got there and tackled the gang the rest is history3 warp to zero on fleet member is allmighty more than 150k away your buddy gets help less than that its likely the attackers will get sniped by alpha fleet which is what most use these dayshow often do you find a single ship 1 or 2 systems behind the fleet you need a gang to kill a bc or bs a system or two behind the fleet takes less than a minute for a fleet to get to you or the fastest of the fleet you wont kill much i guarantee it we have had plenty of slower bs or bc get attacked either head or behind the fleet mostly behind by small gangs or single ships i cant remember the last time we lost 1 to thati want this because it opens up an enormous amount of strategic possibilities which are available in rl combat but not in the simplistic eve combat its also stated above that its main purpose would be to lessen the effect of blobs making room for some tactical and strategic options which will allow smaller gangs to engage larger ones and actually do serious damage without being suicidal a lot of skill would be required and a good fc to be surethere are a number of things that can be done to make eve combat a lot more ummmstrategically evolved this is just one
how is it we killed a dread albeit badly fit without support showing up how is it that we repeatedly got carriers doing sites to hull before local spiked and had to flee how is it that we managed to kill every bs and t3 that was stupid enough not to dock soon as our scouts enteredhave you tought that it might be your gang composition if you cant kill a lost sheep in time before the farmer shows up with a shotgun out of curiosity what fleet setup do you run if youre struggling cause very few things excluding bait ships for obvious reasons should be capable of tanking a small gang solo long enough for it to matter if they arent caps and even then its soso if you bring the right composition
umstupid caps isolated incident im talking about a fleet vs fleet fight not a drop in a system where you catch 1 ship with pants down ratting thats not warfare thats kills of opportunity and do not constitute a viable tactic that would make a difference in a larger conflicti never said we cant kill a single lost sheep i said we hardly ever lose one my post arises out of a lack of tactical options when faced with highly superior numbers it does not arise out of my particular situation my current position actually happens to be on the side of strength in numbers which is impossible to beat our enemies have no options other than show up not to lose face they stand little or no chance of doing any damage there should never be an unkillable army an all powerful ship an always use setupwe currently have this and i find it lame and to be an indication that there is something wrong with the game because of the inflexibility of game mechanics and tactical options we are hard or nearly impossible to counterwith regards to improvements to the game i like to look at the whole thing and not worry if such a change would make my situation better or worse rather will it make the game better or worse my position and situation in the game is irrelevant its about fun variety options balance and creating an overall intellectual challenge 95 of the players in eve do not favor a particular change simply because it may alter their current position they do not care how it affects the game as a whole look at the above comments
post 1 fair enough so your idea is a module that enforces 1v1 fights i can live with you suggesting it its an bad idea and as said before if youre in a fair fight youre doing something wrongpost 3 yes well fair enough its not fair if hes in a bc and youre in bs ill give you thatwait now theres a fleet i tought it was ment to be used when you engage someone 1v1 and shouldnt you not engage if theres numbers in local  disengage if local spikes its called trap or bait if its intended to make you engage so you cant gate awaypost 4so basicly youre saying that if you engage their light ship their fleet chucks out an alpha that finishes you off thats fair enough but the hell were you doing engaging their light ships on grid  on solarsystem with their fleet and why didnt your fleet already nuke the straggler and bolt out of there unless you were looking for fleet vs fleet in which case module does squat for situationpost 5 so basicly you did mean fleet vs fleet from beginning whats up with the 1v1 theme then post 6so basicly attacking some bs or bc thats alone isnt the point anymore but its fleet vs fleet i just tought that few posts above you said it needs to be some straggler bc or bs wait what the hell are you on about are you high targets of opportunity do not constitue a viable tactic someone need to tell this to every military in the planet and isk farm machines that nolonger feed the warmachine does not affect the big picture or the discontent of pvpers being unable to protect pvers pets or other rentersanyway could you please condensate your post to 1 large post where you have consistency trough the post and keep to a single scenario instead beginning from 1 and adapting it and claiming the other is wrong whenever youre presented with counterargument

hi guysi want to note that the ships are problem and rails blasters as weapon are ok the blasterboats really needs a agilityspeed bonus and the dronebays needs a dronespeed bonus that should solve the dronebays and gunboats have getting their damage to the target only rails needs a boost
probably they wont do anything lazy ass matar biased team
they say t3 frigs about 2014 rightyou can safely say then 2016 for t3 frigs and hybridsgallente revamp about 2020hybrids rip
ccp themselves said to the csm that they dont have plans dont carei can support this like so many other proposals but it will not change anything
this should have been ingame back when i first played in rmr or did exodus come before it anyway i remember training repair drones and then spending hour or so trying to get them to me must have gone trough every menu my support to this and prefenably to full revamp of lil buggers drone controls are somewhat annoying
first off i think youre playing the wrong game and also this might just be some troll post of yours not sureif your topic is realthen i think it is a wonderful idea if if you do not feed the pet at least twice a day and provide whatever hydration it requires then it should die yes you read that correctly i want your pet to dieyou should also incur veterinary bills as well you should have to take care of it either like a stupid tomagachi look it up or a sim trademark retained by eagames which means you cant just leave it in your cq all day long while you afk cloak and go to the mall or watch ownyou should also have to bag the  and properly dispose of them sweeping them into the hallway is not allowedi am not sure i can hate this idea as much as it deservesflummox

i want my own slaver hound to which i can feed minmatar slaves and remainings of minnie pilotsno it cant be just any pilot altho them frenchmen should also qualify as adequate snacks
i want a hobgoblin hovering in my quarter guarding the door

at first blush this does appear to be but in light of your recent replies i think its evolving to something with real legitimacy i encourage you zxmagus to edit your initial post to incorporate these clarifications to better represent your ideabut no support just yet as you havent dealt with the hurdle of ew
1 corp always gets krs as for gangs that could be very greatly exploited2exploitable3you do get killrights and if you dont get the theif in 15 minutes youre not going to4 what i dont understand that also how do you define merc corp it would take forever to code for that
would it reallyi mean the guys a troll but its a fair point merc corps should be capable of taking the killrights from carebears via corporation deal of sorts basicly carebears alliance hires we smash stuff to protect them from flippers and sorts when someone flips carebear alliances can we smash stuff gets killrights instead carebearsthatd be kinda nice if 1 corp has system where they heavilly do  they could hire an corp by the hour to post guard to gates  stations
you have the right to remain silent
formal treaties where one corporation inherits the rights to shoot at another corporations thieves i could support thathasnt ccp talked about a proper treaty system before this feature wouldnt be too much additional work on top of the rest of the treaty system
basically you are going about it all wrong if you want to catch any unprobable t3 you get them at a gate or at a station undock the counterexample in the linked thread for not giving up much also can be caught by just about any self respecting frig pilot on a gate and murdered in seconds by his gang honestly if you think a ship with 10k raw hp a 7 second align time and a 200m sig radius is invulnerable you are seriously mistaken dont believe me fly that tengu from ossogur into amamake on a weekend and see if it is invulnerable like you think it isif you choose to gank mission runners you should gank them at their most vulnerable  on a gatewhile i like that the proposal is more balanced than most ive seen i still cannot support this idea since i do not see being unprobable as being a problemas an aside i feel there are much more important issues to tackle  ie faction war and how faction frigs have obsoleted half the t2 frigs in the game sovereignty post dominion angel ships and how they are comparatively superior to there pirate faction brethren in most respects supers and how they have taken over the roll that used to be filled by normal caps and support fleets the inability for newer players to ever be able to compete in the t2 markets at the level of those owning t2 bpos the terrible state of poss epic arc iteration corporation roles balance of ore distribution among the 4 empires high sec separation of the empires redesign of the t3 cruiser class as a whole  legion and css need i say more etc

legalizing it will only gut mining as a profession by reducing the value of minerals to rock bottom i prefer the much more vigorous stand against them let active players compete for mining prices not auto minersfail post sorry but dropping prices in no way discourages botting if anything it encourages the practise trying to out pace the reduced prices in the same vein artificially increaing prices on plex would cause botting to increase as well eve runs on the free market micromanaging that market is a mistake allowing botters to ruin that market is a mistake bots should be caught and banned as fast as you can find them
i dont see the problem youve got goons to represent 00 and nc to rrepresent high sec
whether you like mittani and company or not they are the elected representatives of the players thats us including you complaining about the csm is basically sending a message to ccp that you dont want them to pay attention to what the csm says thats not good csm is a good thing heck even a bad csm group would still be a positive for eve overall and csm6 is a long way from being a bad groupfull disclosure i am not a goon alt or in fact an alt at all say that 3 times fast  im a carebear mission runner 90 of the time so mittens and co dont directly represent my viewpoint guess what though theyre my reps to ccp so working with them is far better than complaining about them
and as i said in response to your threa whole point of 00 is to allow the players to have sov and make their own rules what your wanting is to mae 00 npc space pretty much which is stupid because then we may as well not even have 00 te whole idea of making your won rules and doing things how yo want is the essence of 00now i do agree that docking permissions could be optional like some people whod ont really care who is in their system can put out docking fees but removing docking permissions entirely is stupid if i dont want you in i shouldnt be forced t let you if yo ahve enough in your wallet because lets face it most 00 corps have alo of isk so an meager fee that woudl allow smaller alliances to roam from outpost to outpost would not ebnefit the corps as you sad in your threadand on topic of this thread if you wanna make it as a small corp in 00 get soe battleships or other heavier hitters and wait til large alliance throws around a large bulk of its leet attacking another powerbloc then you go inand sat abshing pos in a ssytem you want far from their battle now as longa s you are attacking one of the powerblocs that isnt too bright in troop placement yo know who you are then mos of the caps will be in the main battle and be forced to either a sacrifice the system your hitting or b sed troopps and risk losing the battle theyre removing troops fromthough my opinion isnt all that heavy due to me never really spending much time in 00
on one extreme you could build a system which gives sov holders complete control of systems  including locking the stargates or placing guns around them on the other extreme you have a system where 100 of systems are controlled by npc factions some will be lawabiding others would be pirate but none would be player controlled eve is currently in the middle with regards to 00 sov im not arguing that it should go to either extreme but if a widely held goal is to make 00 space more accessible  the answer is extremely simple get rid of docking permissionsso what if you want to lock players out of your stations i want to anchor guns around my stargates  sov holders cant have complete control of their systems at the expense of improving the game as a wholethe real opinions that matter are those belonging to empire corps that want to go to 00 but dont for whatever reason how many of them would be willing to give 00 a go if they could dock without fear of being locked out thats really the question that matters compare that answer to the loss of sov holders control and you can decide whether the change is a good idea or a bad oneanother way to look at the change  it would help reduce the blobs why is this simple many corps and alliances want blue status with a sov holder primarily for docking rights sov holder agrees in exchange for an agreement to help defend that is how coalitions really began in the first place ive been there in alliances that wanted docking rights and made those types of agreements
afk cloaking does not give a large alliance an advantage over a small one but i like how you tried to sneak that in thereafk cloaking if it exists is doing nothing no player is present right its the nonafk cloakers you need to worry about as a small undefended group calling this issue afk cloaking is just an attempt to demonize cloaks in general in order to effect a nerf to cloaking face it its not the afk you care about unless you are just sour grapes over not being able to kill a ship you can unfairly spot with local
messing with the source code no matter how a player got it is against the eula and will get you perma banned on strike one the appropriate way to add a plug in to eve is through the third party api
this change is supported by me
whats your basis for saying that such a rebalance is required justifications that begin with i feel that and it seems to me are not sufficient based on what hard evidence does suicide ganking need a rebalance id like to see some numbers showing that actively piloted ships are in danger disproportionate to the rewards that they can gainfor instance ive used factiont3 ships to mission in hisec for 4 years and i have never even had an attempt to gank me likewise i frequently move valuables through high sec and have never had an issue the high frequency of expensive expensively fitted ships in mission systems is circumstantial evidence that the danger of ganks is not high enough to make these ships not worth usingi think we can all agree that people who are afk do not deserve any special consideration
i say make insurance more realisticyou have platinum insurance you lose a ship no matter who is at fault and your individual insurance premium goes upas stated before you lose your ship in a war or null sec environment no payout
very well put
how was the hulk fit could another fit have made a difference do you honestly think removal of insurance would stop this didnt you find that post funny
no not even for cosmetic
no if there was an option to express a stronger version of no i would choose that instead ie wtf you idiotic goat raping reerees
in so far as local is being used for quick identification somebody already said this earlieroff the top of my head exploit im a rich null sec alliance ceo billions in the bank i grief for fun with my alts how else do i get my kicks every time my name change timer expires i send my alt a blob of isk and have her renamed to the ceos name of a rival corp who i want to grief plus a  or some other hard to notice character at the end fly my ship into enemy corp home kill as many as i cannobody is going to bother to check aka in the character sheet unless they are suspicious and you only get suspicious after you get shot at
i can counter in one phrase not blue shoot itnbsi this is pretty much the standard for anyone operating in lownull sectried and true quick identification is done through standing nbsi if theyre red theyre hostile shoot it if theyre blue theyre not hostile dont shoot it if theyre neutral theyre neither and thus a risk prepare to shoot it depends on the corp policyare you saying youre flying around in unsecure space assuming neutrals are your best buddies names really dont matteragain standing just because the name is similar  in no way whatsoever does that mean a similarly named greifer has the same standing  heshe wouldnt get any further than heshe would with any other name in that case nbsiyoure suspiscious until youre getting shot at then youre not suspiscious anymore youre certain nbsicmon kaelie onren i was expecting better from you
then you will end up with just another ac copy i for myself would like a blastership that is actually suitable for real point blank pvp again this includes that it liberates tacklers at point blank just as good as my puls and ac ships does this at 20km today
dont forget thats on a ship with a 50 range bonus
add that your dps at the end fall off is tremendously ridiculousadd that someone looking at your ship will think wallenteblasters he will kite you with his 425mm autocanons at 20km ad burn ya face while youre looking at it without being able to do anythingunless your in gangs your probability of survive to fights is higher against noob ships than everything elsetraining minie stuff and autocanons has finally completely changed my game experience to something positive
a hybrid improvement is definitely needed and making rails most useful at long ranges not only keeps them unique but it makes them usefulas for blasters they need a tracking increase which is mentioned by op as being used with short range ammo but theres something else they need which cant be done by fixing the guns blaster ships need more ability to close with their targets in the form of rebalanced webifiers web bonuses andor mwd bonusesi also like what someone else posted in this thread about reducing the number of range brackets having so many of them becomes overly redundant since you dont have the space to carry that many ammo types nor the time to swap them out instead of a range continuum break the ammo into range brackets like projectile ammo longer range would do more average damage and shorter range would have better tracking on average but there would also be a variance in each range bracket in each range bracket perhaps there could be a light sabot that has good tracking but doesnt do the most damage for the range bracket theres one in the middle and theres a heavy slug that has low tracking for that range bracket but does the most damage in the bracket possibly outdamaging the tracking ammo in the next range bracketexampleantimatter short range uses less capacitor highest tracking low damageplutonium short range uses less capacitor high tracking low damageuranium short range uses less capacitor high tracking medium damagethorium medium range no cap change medium tracking medium damagelead medium range no cap change medium tracking high damageiridium long range more cap usage medium tracking medium damagetungsten long range more cap usage low tracking high damageiron long range more cap usage low tracking highest damage
im not insulting your lack of understanding here is one such situation that i believe youll see why some get upset about this changeim in eve university and as many others have said  we store off a variety of fits to give out to new players in the game as they are learning and progress 3 of most frigates the same for destroyers cruisers battlecruisers  pve or pvp got it here you goit is rather annoying to find that you suddenly dont have access to a huge array of fits that you once could easily link to other players delete  add  link sucks give me back the local storage link abilities and all is good
the return of the option to not load a station environment at all is a very good thing and i thank ccp the immersion issue remains however and pretend your character didnt decant is still not a valid workaround
i dont want it to be optional in terms of i dont want to use it i want it to be optional in that i want to choose when to use it you already have the hanger ship spin system in place surely it would be easy to just put an icon in the neocom that says leave pod and enter cq or whatever how hard can that be you have cq you have ship spin hanger is there some sort of serious failure in the eve clientserver that prevents the marriage of these two components surely the best of both worlds is better than forcing a choice of either cq or a permanent loading graphici support ccp in bringing incarna to life and i have faith that by the time this expansion comes this option will exist because i like to believe ccp know what they are doing
yes cq needs to be optional implementing these three choices will make everyone happyalways dock to cqprompt to dock to cqstationalways dock to normal station environment with a button inside that to switch to cqbut of course this is not enough for ccp fanboi trolls who are already all over this thread explaining how everyone should be forced to always use cq why because they said so
on sisi now there is an option to load the station environment unchecked it and no captains quartersyour cries were heard and ccp listened enjoy
yes and if youd read the most recent posts in this thread youd realize that although this is a nice development it does not address the core concerns here
reading comprehension fail
the joke is on them and every other troll who has dropped by because their posts bump the thread and bring us closer to 5 pagesit doesnt really worry me that so few have bothered to support this there have already been more supporters than most assembly hall threads get and the issues of immersion and optionality are almost universal regardless as long as those issues remain visible at the corner of ccps eye theres a chance theyll take notice and spend the mere ten minutes it would probably take to implement the three options morar santee reiterated andor return the classic hangar view to default and add a decant button
if they keep the hanger and add cq then its a better eve than just having one or the other i dont really understand why this wasnt on the table from the beginning if there is a specific programming issue then i understand but i dont think there islike i have said in other threads i actually really want to use cq a lot i have been waiting for it for a long time and i know cq is just the first step so its limited but i always just assumed that it wouldnt change the functionality or structure we have in place now the fact they have noticed the issue probably means they will implement the hanger we will see anyway if they want the game to be better and more interesting then they will do so my only worry really is that ccp believe that if they dont force people into cq then it will just end up as a dead feature because of the outcry by many people that cq is just crap and they dont want it if that is the case then i feel sorry that ccp has been made to think that because cq will work even if we are not made to use it all the time it will work because its different new and has potential to grow allowing players to use the feature when they want allows eve to continue to be played by more people and has more immersion
i dont buy that you dont understand the arguments against making cq optionalforemost change is the law eternal without it eve will stagnate and die so if you dont force cq on people they will keep their crappy hardware they wont upgrade to something better because they dont have to that hampers the graphical development of the game significantly after all with cq being optional the entire other graphical environment cant really be substantially upgraded either for the same reason cq was made optional so youre back to square onenow to get back to your question as to who loses the answer is simple eve as a whole loses it will again continue to linger around the lower standards inevitably slowing down the further development of incarna as you cant possibly make every future aspect of it optionalpeople are mostly rather egocentrical as evinced on this forum they reason like my system wont cut it so i want the game to stay at my low level see me im different let me give you an example when i bought hydrophobia prophecy a few weeks ago i realized my old gtx 285 could only pull ca 2040 fps so what did i do i could also have said poor me i cant run your game boohoo please lower the graphical bar for me instead i simply decided it was time to upgrade my hardware and bought the gtx 580 of course much like here the folks with the crappy hardware incessantly whining about it on the forum got their way the devs eventually caved and lowered the system requirements sigh i would have much preferred if they had just stuck to their guns effectively forcing people to get with the program and upgrade would have been better for the gamewith the advent of cq i thought ccp had finally broken with their old ways of catering to the lowest common denominator i applauded that guess i did so prematurely
there is no reason it cannot be made optional and i for one shall miss ship spinning
1 thing is for sure incarna will be pain in the a for lots of us
the issue is not to scale back cq graphically the issue is that the interface is better if you keep the ship hanger  cq it kills two birds with 1 stone and makes sense from a roleplaying perspective
my thoughts exactly make it an option why would i get out of my ship and shuttle down to my quarters and get out of the pod and clean myself off and get a fresh change of clothes everytime i want to dock off to drop off 1 unit of holoreels from my battleship just to undock again 5 seconds later
more options please
lmaooh ccp theyre favorite pastime is russian roulette
really then everyone would leave this ticked on all the time who would want to see new names evereasy exploitname change grief 1i supported this proposal at first with some hefty hefty real money cost to changing a name but im not so sure anymore if you didnt take naming your character seriously when you started you should start a new character or pay someone in china to farm a new one with your new preferred name and sell it to youyour name is like an email address you cant just have it changed that easily
hypothetical situation assume 300000 playersnumber of people who would like to change their name because they didnt really think it through the consequences of their name when they signed onto the game 5 of the population 15000 players liberal estimatenumber of people who will see this as a new social engineering scam and will try to exploit it20 60000 playersnow add to this the amount of extra gm work to deal with the name change cases we assume that they will be screened somehow before a change is allowed  checking for negative standings etc and the extra grief that will come from the 60000 players trying to scamoh and also the name change isnt going to improve the game balance add new dimensions to gameplay nor bring in any new revenue for ccpso from a purely business perspective i would say there is no incentive for ccp to allow this make 5 happy open up exploit to 20 and add more work to the gmsnow what if they did nothing about this5 of paying customers get grumpy and whine maybe some even quit the game lets say its only will be those who just started playing because if you are so invested in your toon to want to get a name change instead of just starting over with a new toon then its safe to assume that you will not quit playing just because you didnt get your name change you will be angry you will think its unfair or unjust but you will still play and pay ccpthe only people who would legitimately be allowed a name change by the gms are those with no negative reputation and those who are new to the game would just as easily start a new toon to avoid the rl cost of a name changeso we are left with the only people who would benefit from this proposalhigh sp good rep players who may just want to change their name from johndork211 to john dorkinlets say that small niche of people are just 20 of the ones who want to change their name for nonscamming reasons so if we exclude the 80 who want the name change to avoid a reputation then we are left with 20 x 150003000 people made happy or made grumpy but will still play the game otherwise with 60000 people trying to scamnot worth it i think is ccps reasoning
 best post in the thread
no it really isnt sunk that theory on the post below ityou ignored the fee looking at those figures you described it would be extremely profitable 1500060000x let x equal the fee being charged and even at the cost of one plex a number most agree is too low we get 1125000 sounds good to me lets leave ccps reasoning to ccp okbut the scamming apocalypse youre expecting isnt going to happen because its neither tactically reputational or cost effective to utilize nefariously and efficientlyreally still think so
since when was miningratting for 10 hours a day considered enjoying evehtfu

thismaking it optional is the way to go there are a lot more reasons to keep it in game as opposed to how many reasons one there are to remove it from the game
would be interesting perhaps a wh leads to an unknown system that a corp can build a stargate in to connect to a stargate they built in the system the wh was inedit clarification
apologies the whole solo honor part in the thread header may have led me astray i must be having an aneurism what was i thinkingquoteyou can force someone to be in a 1v1 without it being the least bit fair for him being fair is not the point its more about ambushing without the ambushed being able to get help and how they can be used in fleets where certain ships can enforce 1v1 against another ship and simulate rl warfare ambushes and guerrilla warfare try to look a bit beyond the obviousso are you asking for a i win button for pvpers to freely go about ganking miners without the miners help being able to warp to zero to guard them are you thinking of the actual ramifications of your proposal beyond your 1 scenario of fleet vs fleet tactics most of the time basing a proposal purely based on rl or reality reasons dont stand the litmus test while i admire your desire to fix game balance which as you mentioned is the only noble goal for any new change in the game mechanics i believe you havent properly examined the followon effects of your idea which netnet may serve to only unbalance the game in favor of pvpers vs nonpvpers
i see in your response you seem to be changing what you originally said might not have been your intention but what it came off was i want 1v1 for honorfairness not i want to be able to ambush a single ship wo having them call for help there is a difference and i think you did really bad at explaining that as i and i think others didnt pick up on that at all you made no mention of stopping their ability to call in help just listed it as one of several things your module would dofor that id think a module to prevent communications or prevent warping to might be a solution comms seems less exploitable as the warping issue can be abused to make people unwarpableinvisible and people  and whine about unscannable ships as it is i could get behind a module to jam your ability to use ingame chat channels provided there arent other considerations i cant fathom at the moment stopping warping seems to be much more problematic and id have to say no without lots more information and debateas it stands a sb can do some of what you want but no comparable tech or tactic can isolate an enemy as you seem to be describing and i dont think eve needs something like that or even that it would be a good idea if you cant take someone out with a sb or have them scrammed when you make the first strike i dont think you should have extra rules enforced to allow you to put them in what amounts to a pen so you can take them out jamming their ability to ask for help in game is one thing and maybe disrupting their scan signature so warping to them is broken for fleets and that might even be too much the biggest issue i see with this is you want a fake mechanic to let you drag someone off grid into an arena so you can duke it out one on one which is just ridiculous catching someone when they are actually alone on grid and making modules to help you keep it one on one is much different than dragging them into an artificial thunderdome in space

i propose a new t3 defensive subsystem fortified sensor reconfiguration and do otherwise away with ship unprobability being a defensive subsystem with the otherwise same layout properties as the amplification node except allowing for only 5 high slots it would automatically mean you cant fit the warfare processor at the same time thats the beauty of it it would elegantly solve the issue of unprobeable t3 ships doing boosting from afar which does seem overpowered yet it would still allow the lone missioner a way to not be invaded in missionedit perhaps in abundance but in case it wasnt clear the fortified sensor reconfiguration would make your t3 unprobable and it would be the only way to do so
sounds like a good idea to meedit i like that it uses the samesubsystem slot as the command subsystem the name i cant much agree with but it would be different for every ship type id go with something like stealth related as that is what it actually does the package may be electronic in nature but the only affect it is likely to have on ship sensors is changing their broadcast to short range waves that would effectively limit scan probes ability to detect a ship based on its transmission of radar ladar or other sensor wavesheres a rough ideacaldari defensive subsystemcovert reconnaisance reconfiguration5 reduction in signature radius per level20 increase to sensor masking per level unscannable w level 5 defensive subsystem skillstructure hitpoints 40 hp mass 1400000 kg volume 40 m3 capacity 310 m3 shield shield capacity 2950 hp shield recharge time 1730000 s shield explosive damage resistance 50  shield kinetic damage resistance 70  shield thermal damage resistance 80  miscellaneous tech level 3 meta level 1 targeting signature radius 134 m armor armor hp bonus 2150 hp armor em damage resistance 50  armor thermic damage resistance 8625  armor kinetic damage resistance 625  armor explosive damage resistance 10  fitting med slot modifier 1 low slot modifier1 restricted to ship type tengu
not supported i dont like exceptions to game mechanics my view is all ships should be probable the problem atm is it requires too little effort its also worth noting that fleet command ships can also be easily made unprobable as can any other ship with an abundance of midslots and nothing else to do with them
well that was pretty narrow minded heres what i got so far all ships should be probeable pvp should be easy and everybody should be forced to participate and be ganked right lets move on shall weperhaps you should have actually read the thread
im afraid it is you who is narrow minded i said no such things about making ganking people easier i think all ships should be probable without exception but i also think probing is far too easy in its current incarnation i dont really know of any viable ways to make it always possible but more difficult and time consuming short of simply increasing cycle timers which is a pretty lazy solution
not gonna read through 11 pages of thisthis seems like a nobrainer maybe it should be t3 drones that allow this or a skill or just a simple setting we have passive setting and aggressive setting just make one more that says defensive or logistical or somesuch finflummox
i like this idea it takes away from dps if they are used this way and they can still be destroyed it seems like a no brainer to me

the answer to sc bloat is not cap bloat im sorry but i think youre completely missing the forest for the trees here the problem being presented by supercaps is that their ehp is such that combatting them with lesser ships causes grid problems read as laggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggif you simply push dreads up youre stratifying things at the cap level and drawing another line whereby subcapitals become even more irrelavent all the while leaving supercaps at their level of impunity
maybe they are keeping them this way because dreads are to become valuable again come dust514 in their role as planetary bombardmentit is what battleships do best afterall relative to carriers

i think its more of a pov of players that have been in since the beginning the games appeal then was its cold and harsh nature for the most part it has remained that way with improvements and introductions of additional content to heighten the cold and harsh feelhowever the addition of vanity items for cq and now a proposal for pets tends to leave a sickened feeling in the stomachs of those of us who view eve as a step above every other game out there wowifying eve to make it more warm and fuzzy destroys the premise of the game being cold and harshthe direction eve is going in tends to make me sad
well the only way this would work is if each type of drone is put in its own squadron ie say a super carrier launches 10 hobgoblin 2s they get put in their own squadron and if he launches say 10 dragon flies they get put in a separate squadron i also like the idea of making it so there is a skill component to it for arguments sake lets say that advanced drone interfacing now lets you control 1 more squadron per level
ah i wasnt clear drones can receive ew interference right i know they can be webbed which would make the whole squadron of drones an easy target with only one lock but i havent tried other ew
im pretty sure you can use ewar on drones although i havent tried it to make sure the only possible exception i can think of is whether 2pt warp scramblers deactivate a drones mwd like they do for a ship
i suggest that shuttles should be able to autopilot warp to 0 on stargates this would allow them to fulfill there role of the individual transport toolif this is only allowed for shuttles then game balance would still be preservedmal
i can not support this idea no ship class should get a free ride
warp to zero is killing this game enough alreadynot supported
will this be included with the coming incarna or is it planned for later release
solution dont mine into jet cansedit spelling error i just woke up
thisi could support that as well but as it stands in this thread no thanks
its not an invulnerable setup unless it enters combat kills 15 ships solo and flies away without a scratchwhat were talking here is a ship that cant even solo vs solo pvp unless it seriously outclasses its agressor and uses threat reduction to survive rather than aggressive tactics f35f22stealth bomberany of those ring a bell this is real technology and completely feasible and in the case of the f22 it even has high threat potentialyou whine and cry because of nothing more than wanting to be able to kill everything and have no one escape unscathed this isnt starcraft and if it were the stealthy race would lose do to inaction even here it amounts to much the same most of the timei really hate the thought that eve should devolve to hack and slash gameplay with no other content or options just pvp all the time everywhere we should just put permanent bubbles on all the gates with stasis fields out to 30 km so you can fit all gank and just pop anyone who comes throughedit yeah i forgot the eccm thingy is a joke and shouldnt exist in game with its current effects id remove that and do away with unprobeable setups just for the sake of realism what we need is a real module that is properly defined and functions accordingly i never really caught on to the eccm thingy before it was mentioned in this thread and no wonder why it doesnt make the slighest sensewhat we have is a module that stabilizes the sensor package on a ship and makes them more resistant to ecm doing the opposite and shielding the signature of a ship against probing that is actually a form of ecm not the other way around
 this finally a guy who gets itthe gravimetric backup array already does as you describe its just not potent enough on its own and its not ecm as its totally passive and just increases your gravimetric sensor strengthalso i dont see much use for a single unprobability mod currently you need skills the right ship and some expensive implants to do it comfortably i dont want every drake to fit it and before you ask yes ive flown a drake for the longest time i believe unprobability should remain within the realm of t3 ships onlyif ccp were to nerf t3 ships in such a fashion that you wouldnt be able to fit eccm next to warfare link mods to boost remotely i would be okay with that because frankly being unprobable and being able to boost remotely that does seem a bit overpowered we do after all not allow cloaky ships to have activate mods running either but mission runners using unprobability solely for defensive purposes i see that as a viable and balanced tactic to try and stay alive against a universe otherwise rigged to favor the suicide ganker
i was thinking more along the lines of taking the eccm mod as it is removing the silly sensor boosting which doesnt even work vs npc frigs in level 1 combat missions changing its name to sensor masking electronics package or something for mid and stealth hull reconfiguration or something for low then adding an appropriate description to match and showing actual calculable effect for what it does that would make sense
it is feasible and detectable ever heard of radar crosssection term any of these planes can be detected and locked depends on the distance environment conditions plane radar crosssection and power of radar array let alone using other methods  like heat and optical detectionits ongoing war between poison and remedy where nobody wins i dont see any competition in evemaking ship completely indetectable by radars youll also make it blind radarwise  and theres already such device which imitates it or tries to because it doesnt make ship completely blind its cloakas for special module for making ship lessunscannable  it should cost vast amounts of money like someone mentioned here 2 bil and take up significant amount of ship resources because in its current form eccms are too much benefit for ridiculous cost and if you mission run in hostile local theres no point in using scannable ships at all i dont see how game can be balanced in such conditions
only if your probes cost you 2 bil too 
its seems so you dont know how it workswe hunted misssioners in 00 for years what we can scan that will die we scan anything less than 1 min the prey will never seen a probe on the scanwe killed several unscannable t3 too scanned down safes with his unactive eccm modulesscanned down exits with directional scannerswe can scan your site and sit in with alts we can wait you everywherewe can use drag bubbles we can open covert cynos you see only one hostile at local never seen his ship  never seen probes you dieif you are in a faction ship you will definetly die faction ship our favorite preyif you are in a bs not badif you are in a drake fun to killif you are in a unscannable t3 we will try kill youwe can watch you several days to watch your spots watch your online time where you go whenif you make one fault you dieif you know how this things work and you are unscannable and you are very careful you will live and you deserve it
again tthe best thing you can do is not letting mission runner to complete the mission its draw when you waste your time you  gang of 10 ppl i suppose and mission runner wastes his if you gank him  you win if he finishes mission  you lose basically unscan makes mission runner to always winif you can kill somebody who sits at the mission for 1 hour and lets you scan him down wo noticing probes  its his own problemstherere even ways to exclude any undock gank risks and no its not undock bookmark  interdiction nullifier whcih combined with unscannable setup make your ship purely invulnerable
basically scan makes gankers always wintheres no weapon in eve be it warpscramblers webbers ecm etc that allows operation across the vast space of an entire solar system arguably  when it comes to player ships  probes are thus already overpowered as it is you certainly shouldnt be allowed to receive your extra i always win from across the other end of the solar system button though
all those electronics crammed into one ship must surely interfere with other systemsintroduce deviance similar to what applies for warping to a probe result increases as ship approaches unprobeable status until it in effect cancels out the warp to zero feature 015km deviancehow is that for drawback
introduce1 a view with time code for the chat window like in the log files2 corp internal afk status  i want to see in the chat window if the person is afk or not or i want to give info to my corp that i am semi afk ie when tending to price resets corp internal cause it doesnt make sense if i tend to prices and people outside the corp see when i go afk this is just to live manners  i usually answer if i am asked something but i want to show if i cant answer straight away3 either make the charakter notes viewable per mouse over or allow me to group corp members  people in my contact list when they are alts of someone
1 right click the text you can toggle timestamp2 supported3 you can create categories in your contacts
1 cheers  playing for 2 years and still learning3 that i did know but its impracticable as i cant see it in the chat window i would have to look it up in the adress book if the label would be viewable by mouse over it would be a start best would be if i could drag and drop pictures like guns and group them in the chat window
i already answered that i want to use the sps for something i really use while playing that game now and not specualte on things i might need before i die
you read the part in the proposal about the haulers reputation being displayed to all their cargo loss rate vs success rate etc the associated loss of ferry license if its excessive and the ability for a passenger to specify a certain quality of hauler who would be allowed to move them right because that would make said scam only work on stupid passengers which frankly then they deserve it
sorry to burst your bubble but while we can only really speculate heres about how it workst2 bpo held by anonymous highsec alt of major nullsec alliance directorleader in jita copies bpo multiple times then puts it in queue for research for awhile out of jita 44 station he manufactures these bpcs into tech 2 ships for sale in jita 44 station using nullsec supplied parts made from moon goo in his alliances multiple pos facilities calculating cost of manufacture for tech 2 invention he markets the manufactured tech 2 vessels accordingly to drive any potential competition into the ground and happily supplies his alliance and himself with a fortune in isk from tech 2 productiont2 researcher spends much time on failed research attempts even with max skills and produces occaisional t2 bpcs from invention runs that prove quite costly then contracts them out for usually less than the effort and isk that went into them these t2 bpcs are then purchased by players who are relatively ignorant of the costs associated and may save as much as a million isk in the production of their own t2 ship while purchasing excess moon goo parts off mighty nullsec allianceseither way the nullsec alliance makes the isk and the highsec researcher gets shaftedif you havent tried invention i suggest you have a go at it and see what its like for yourself 44 bpcs are always fun to manufacture from and even with level 5 in all associated skills only see 1 in 10 successfull inventions from t1 bpcs if youre lucky take into account that you have to spend time copying the t1 bpc use datacores and hard to find somewhat costly decryptors to increase your chances or better your results and its really no competition the nullsec alliance with all the cards up their collective sleeve wins every time
i keep reading how that makes no sense and the way it is done is to keep your tech 2 bpo making the itemship and not waste time copying it so you can then produce off those while doing more research on itwhile you are correct the moon goo holders always make isk off their exclusive goods the simple fact is if you are working to do invention and not making a profit you are doing it wrong if it isnt profitable you dont do it it is that simple you might end up sitting on some bpcs for prices to rise or sell the bpcs on contract but if you are doing it right you make iskop complains about how horrible he is at figuring things out after he does all the work buys everything etc then there is thisbest i can tell is he is using max bpc for ships to do invention which is pretty much a waste to gain at best 1 extra run with whatever decryptors he might use for the time it takes to make a max run copy of the bpo  tldr op is bad at math planning understanding the basics of markets etc and this means more profit for people who are good at those things
i can tell you that the timer doesnt have to be 10 minuteswhile trying to gain sec in losec doing some blockade missions it seems that the time can vary from 10 mins up to 14 minsand yes it puzzles me why the whole sec gaining thing takes that much effordi know people who would like to do some other things than being a pirate but the thought about shooting npc forever just keeps themfrom getting their sec up from 10 to somewhere near 2 especially when you are getting to 3  2 it will take even more time because it works with procentual gains
pathetic  incredibly slow and lethargic  and why no one pays attention to the csm any longer this whole forum area is a dead zone
the minutes need to go through a drafting and review process at present 8 of the 18 sessions have gotten to the first draft stage
for people using mining as an income stream macros hurt their bottom line since each hour of mining becomes worth less and less iskfor manufacturers they dont care they buy manufacture sell at a profit  with sale price being determined by cost of inputs and processingfor pvpers more expensive minerals will lead to more expensive t1 ships and modules and thus more valuable killmails
beyond value of killmailst2 and supercaps would skyrocket meaning nt ony are killmails more valuable bt more people would be required to start traveling in t1 and t2 subcapital groups and capstitans would once more fall into the core but not bulk of any armada like aircraft carriers in ww2 they re important not as common and killing one actually hurts the toher team instead of lolololol buyz some more mnrals from zee zombies and get buildin
who are the nc
is there a simple hardandfast list of what the csm has done not minutes not notes or suggestionsa bulletpointed list of ingame stuff that the csm has had a hand in
as a wh resident for over a year i am thrilled to see wspace represented every past council has droned on and on about changes that most wspace residents wont take notice to and it is my hope that maybe some changes in the future can help mold wspace from a difficult neverchanging style of play to a difficultyetfair dynamic element of the gamei have read the ideas you have posted for possible revision and cannot agree more on all of themon 1 more note there shouldnt be any haters for this guy being in csm most corps would do whatever they could to get an edge or protect their interests and holding the exploits of many against an individual is either a poor attempt to find a scapegoat or anger and frustration from ingame matters pouring out into the forums via ehatred and etears
two step deserves props for twostepping up he is the most active alt and is helping with the drafting of the summit minutes using the video recordings as he was not thereif he keeps up his current pace i will have no reservations about endorsing him in the next election
thanks for your advice but i think the disapproval expressed here and the relative silence now indicates your opinion is in the minority ccp knows why there is so little support for the csm this year no need to worry about that
christ  yah slow motion fights instead of fixing lag hope ccp shows slomo in their video promos from now on that will bring in pvpers by the millions unreal how people latch onto this as some wonderful thing when its a travesty oh but it does have the new csms blessing so it must be good  jeez utter crap calling slomo reduced performance matrixlike does not make it in any way acceptable compared to what is promised
i agree with litraly everything posted on this page at least make them like their t1 variants but with cloaking and covert cyno or bridging abilities for normal ships to covert cynos would be interesting but i think what ever ccp does they should revisit the bo stats in this next incara update at the end of june
ccp please give the black ops some lovingpretty please
i support this since black ops ships are basically on my list of future skills trained
a graphical change to the warp startstop would be awesome also a change to the inwarp graphics would be nice also
agree warp needs a little bit more epicnessit it cant be changed to this then such effect me or st movie can be used for cyno jumping i think will look good
this
sure why not 1
yes please maybe a flash of racial shipcolored energy to go with it
oh god yes yes yes always found warp so underwhelming support for visual changes dont care about mechanical changes as long as they are balanced just yes please sgudestiny style warp would be cool  but as long as it looks and sounds awesome i couldnt care less i want this now
no not even cosmeticonce the camel gets its nose in the tent
nonono
nonever ever
people not upgrading their local hardware does not hold eve online back from a technology standpoint eve could be the most graphics intensive game but some people would like to dial it back to lower settings now and then its not that hard to ask for it and its not that hard to actually domaking cq mandatory hurts eve online because more new players wont be able to play because of the insane specs needed tell me how does forcing new players away from eve help it it doesnt thats right i already have plenty of friends who tried to play eve and couldnt because they had average computers now ccp wants to raise the system requirements good luck guys this is just one more nail in the coffin of things to eventually kill eve online if you dont make it optional so do yourselves a favor ccp make cq optional or start your gradual sinking into the abyss of failed mmos
supported  forcing players to decant every dock is stupidi want to use incarna and i will i just wont want to do it every timeplus i think it is immersion breaking to leave your pod every time you are safer and more ready to respond to circumstancesit will be more immersion breaking that inevitably you will teleport to your pod to undock from the station probably from anywhere in the stationusing incarna to force players to upgrade their system is quite odd why does it matter to you if a player is using lower graphical settings than you ccp certainly hasnt been aiming for the lowest common denominator for system reqs and the game looks fine as isfrankly i think theyd do better to spend more timestaff on gameplay and balancing and less on shiny things incarna will hopefully be a good game mechanic eventually  but for now its basically pointless crapi too wonder if the forcedusage is simply to make it look better on some kind of stats i will be keeping an eye out for articles stating huge usage metrics and for a comment feature on said articles
recent developments in mind i would have to say the reason for ccp wanting to force people to use cq is as simple asif people are forced to look at their avatar each time they dock all the time theres a bigger incentive to buy into cashshop itemsmake of that what you will
there is already a way to change your name with a harsh penalty built in you delete the character and start a new one sure you lose all your skillpoints but you get to keep all your assets and isk
not supportedeve is a game of choices and consequences deal with themand this change would have impact where sellingtrading characters comes into playsorry kids its a no go on this one
this sort of answer type infuriates me too yeah maybe i shouldnt be infuriated  but its the logic that strikes me as something close to lieing  deliberate failure to aknoledge stregnths of an others arguments and pretending like the first answer is self evident all sorts of things hisotries are permanent ooops destroyed the player abilty to see reputation and history of other players npc standings but that was different basically because history would still be trackable if it showed in the employment log their answer holds no waterthey might have answers but its not the issue that they gave as they stated itthey do have arguments beyond some flat statement that isnt true if a name change option was created correctlythe current system of no name changes ever makes it easier to see reputation than it would be looking at corporate history  rebutle anyone concerned about reputation in a dealing will already be looking at corporate history were concerned that allowing renaming of characters would lead to many exploits of various types that would come along and the inevitable and expensive customer service work related to it true but addressable and perhaps profitable stringently limited name changes should be a microtransaction of a type where each will be reviewed by a gm before they take effect replacement names can have a different set of rules requiring that any change also aid the overall immersion experience require a first and last name with only first letters of each capitalized and no use of numbers or symbols  first and last name cannot both be similar to an existing character only one or the other with an existing scott jones a scot jones one t in scot or a scoot too would not be allowed sam jones or scott jacobs would be changed names could also be limited to resemble real world names or words in their use of consonants and vowel combinations the gm screen process should be short enough in average minutes to handle dozens of such requests an hour and be profitable at 20 a shot or somethingwe are concered that even well intentioned players would improve their name by shifting towards the bottom of the alphabet for the incremental competitive advantage that it gives in doing so other players with existing names will have them incrementally disadvantaged by effectively moving them up an alphabetical list of players this is a valid partial consideration that could be addressed if the volume of changes looked like it would be consequential weighing this effect with the benefit of happier players with name charges for other reasons is subjective the effect could be drastically diminished by arbitrary conditions that a name must start with the same letter it currently does or within 3 letters etcits not a gameimmersion influence but a meta game effect that holds us back as character sales can be an important source of revenue for some players and we allow the transfer of characters long time players with better names are significantly easier to sell at higher prices than unfortunately named chracters by allowing a change those players owning poorly named characters could receive a windfall on the meta level even if they just liked to play the game and would enjoy a new name and had no intention to sell we long term players own some fairly well named characters o and we will sell them now and then and wed hate to have more competitionok i think this is the real reason if so come out and say it  again a truthful explantion is important search your heart does this reason have any influence on your emotion about the issue i bet a fair fraction of the people against name changes are against them on a meta not an a character as a habitant of the virtual universe which is the stated reason against themthis is why i got so worked up on the remap gift where thats not how remaps work was an excuse to were making a one time exception to how remaps work and we elected this way to be the exception as giving the moset equitable benefit to all players well that answer doesnt work but answering thats not how remaps work while doing exactly the same giving extra remaps ccp  thats not how remaps work dont give them out unless an equally beneficial manner if you make a fairness mistake and there is a solution dont hide behind a rhetorical flourish end that rehash 
a very simple other reason to adopt a change in some limited shape or formdeffering the desires of well intentioned customers for the reason that other customers might take advantage of the situation isnt a very high minded way to approach the worldtrust by defaultcustomers and people are owed that respecttake steps to minimize the cost the less well intentioned impose if there arent enough steps that can minimize the damage to a reasonable level then perhaps the well intentioned player will unfortutely not be able to have his needs met even though in their case no harm would be done but even if the cost were twice the benefit to the well intentioned the well intentioned should be served if running customer service in a high minded way that asumes customers are trustworthy first if the cost were closer to 10 1  the good hearted customer would probably be able to see that himself and live with his unfortunate circumstance
if it is about avoiding scams or meta advantage related to character values fine they should come out and state that true reason not hide behind a half truth that isnt really consistent creative licence allows them to keep quiet but if they do open their mouths courtesy creates an expectation of honestybeing lied to is being lied to thats a real life thing not a in game thing
im ok with name change if you lose all sp isk ships faction standings everthingyou also start with a pod in a c6 wh
delete duplicate
i support the above changes great ideas for hybrid ammo overhaul what about t2 ammo tho
minnie pilots use missiles too better missile launches please1
with the upcoming incarna there is talk of opening bars and storesi think that is a great idea but we can take it one step furtherrent space from the station in a small medium large or extra largevery similiar to a pos using the hangar tabsrent should be affected by a skill or standingsthere can be modules like labs advanced labs drug lab store front implant research manufactoring etcthis allows for future expansions and other opportunitiesexample brewery module to create alchohol for the barsexample drug labs for the low sec and 00 stations low sec planets produce ingredientsquestions to pondersome stations are larger than othershow much space is there availablecan a player or corp add more space to the station via a module like 00 stations can upgrade infrastructure
i gathered some arguements for the standing display here forumplease bring it back ccp 
yes standings do need to be displayed again just another example of a completely halfarsed fix that was so badly implemented that it isnt even funnylets recap on top of player standings towards npcs no longer being displayed we also got the following npc factions standings towards each other no longer displayed player corps average standings no longer displayed no way to see how player corps average standings are composedwant to get your corp jumpclone access with a certain npc corp tough ing luck no way to tell who has standings and who doesntwant to set up a pos tough ing luck no way to tell who needs to work on standings to get the average or how close you are in the first placewant to hire only people who meet these requirements tough ing luck now you need to do a full api checkwant to know who you lose standings with if you run storyline missions for thukker tribe tough ing luck hope you learned them by heart in timeand yet theres rabid fanbois applauding this crap as always
sec status is just concord faction standing makes no sense that concord standing is visible but amarr sansha etc arent all faction and corp standings should be visible
maybe add some low sec and null sec pockets to highsec to entice the high sec people out also adding more wormhole space would be nice
this is execly where ccp  up for soo many years its really hard to explain to people that dont know what they are talking about that there are different kind of players different mentalities high sec is for bears who just want to log in and make isk 00 if for players who like to shoot other players wormholes  bear space  a littlebit of pvp the lack of pvp in wormhole space makes pvprs leave most wormhole space are occupied by corps that exist mostly out of players that like to log in bear a bit do a quick gank if oppertunity arises and thats it the kind of corporations are a renters in 00 alliances or high sec corps those corps would never operate alone in 00 or be able to join a large alliance that isnt test or some other bear allaince cause they lack player skills pvprs people that makes u be able to be in 00 so by saying eve got bigger due wormhole introduction u actuly say eve got more high sec 00 is crouded for the resources that can be found ccp fianly did something to buff it but tok it away 8 months later
the problem has more to do with moons and less to do with systems
saying there are no good wormhole pvpers is astounting for starters people deal with no local channel there meaning that risk factor is higher and intel gathering skills are actually needed 00 alliances have tons of carebears even pvpers have carebear alts either in highsec or running anomalies
the only gripe ive ever had with t3 ships is that the appearance of the ship is decided by the subsystem choicewhy not make it so you can choose the look separately from the subsystem choiceive seen too many t3 chips all look the same because there are obvious subsystem choices made normally full damage or covert and it makes for less individuality hell ive seen some great potential looks for t3 but you would never see it flying ingame because the grouping of subsystems to get that appearance would be tactically unwiseyou train hard and spend a lot of isk to build a t3 letting you choose the look and not your subsystem choice seems logical and allows for greater individuality and self expression
i demand pink tassles for my loki
would love to be able to do this there are so many cool looking modals attached to subs with ty bonuses
having the best moon mineral isolated in one area of space is simply wrong it is time for it to be fixed so the moon minerals are mixed and spread throughout the galaxy so everyone has a fair shot in getting on on the liquid gold
i too would like to see less incentives for bloc level combat
and how much fighting has been done over the 60100 valuable moons in the north a dozen have been used for pingpong by bored capital blobs but on the whole they have acted as isk printing presseswars have so far been over epeengrudges goonbob and space to lease out everywhere prenerf some of the early wars before the t2 overhaul and resulting moon changes there were a lot of skirmishing to control the big faucets but that is ancient historystatic incomes should be nerfed period all of themif one wants isk one should be forced to interact with game on a regulardaily basispi has the right idea with several degrees of efficiency available dependent on mood or time spentif one wants isk one should be forced to put oneself out there where the hurt livespi has a partial right idea with the space jettisoned product leaving a hauler open to attack needs to be even more vulnerable if you ask me though maybe dust will provide some more options but if not then planetary defenceoffence installations should be introduced
all good moons should be in one system for glorious daily thunderdome action
you mean like last time they tried to fix dyspro 
just a few months ago pl held every tech moon in venal about 70 or so they do change hands
considering the fact that i see multiple moon defence fleets going up every week and the odd attack too i would say that there is plenty of conflict generated by moons as the pl guys states moons in venal change hands a lot and they arent the only ones
a lot of times a player is bombarded with real life stuff and has to step away from the game for many days in a row to deal with it things like moving military school you get the idea during that time the political landscape can change and then your screwed when you come back to the gamei propose that if a player has not logged in for 34 weeks upon character selection they get to chose which system to be spawned in kind of like when you log in and jita is too full you get to pick other places to spawn in besides jita if you were docked then you can pick any npcfriendly station in the same constellation if you logged in space then any system in the constellation and it will be just some random safe spot there

rl stuff happens hope it wasnt something unpleasant as to your proposal seriously you chose to live in a region that could be conquered and you think you deserve a consequence free mechanic to get your ship  pod out in before he proposes that his nullsec station assets should be automatically moved to a hisec location of his choice
not supported this is eve not hello kitty online deal with it noob
i fully support this proposal
anyone else
yeah me too
i also think this is a good idea
i have to concur this is an excellent proposal
i have the same opinionby the way effdrian i love your hair
why thanks that is very nice of you
youre welcome
did i miss something
the alt train above you from one douche supporting this by not actually checking the support this topic box
too subtle for you apparently
this is my mainwhat do we do now
so naturally scs have been a big topic on being opthus leading to discussions of how they need to be nerfed other ships need to be buffed we still dont have a barrelrollyadda yaddaso i had a simple question for you sc pilots out there and in general people who gotta fight them in fleets if supercarriers utilize drones most notably fbs but also fighters do they not inherently have a weakness in that their main source of dmg can be destroyed as opposed to normal ships which only stop shooting by jamming lack of capacitor or destructionexample mind you i know little of carriers sc launches his death swarmwhat can kill those drones rather what is needed frigates and destroyers or are they slow enough to be shot at by cruisers do most carrier pilots assign the drones to a faster targeting ship or do they direct them themselvesthe reason i ask these questions is that i think a lot of folks havent looked at the fact that maybe scs should be tough to killbut their drones shouldnt be if a gang of rifters swarm a dominix the domi will be defeated by virtue of the small guns shredding the drones is there not a similar counter to supers or is it really just easier to bear the brunt of the dmg and kill the sc first while it may sound sillythis almost sounds like a niche role a destroyer could fill with its higherend dps and tracking as opposed to multiple frigatessoto sum up what if the drones needed nerfing not necessarily in damage output but their ability to be destroyed this results in the counter to carriers being a wellrounded fleet of heavy dmg output capitals and bs midrange support cruiser class and your antidronefrigate support frigatedestroyersas opposed to more supers being the determining factor of a battle another way to look at it is that a ships only counter should not be itself  i propose shifting the primary way of defeating a super from actually killing it to just declawing it via destruction of its dronesjust food for thought  i noticed i havent really seen any attempts at targeting the drones as opposed to the ship for discussion what do you guys think
a few things fighters and fighter bombers have a lot of hp fighters have low cruiser level hp while fbs have low battleship hp scarrier pilots are well versed in drone management and will pull drones as soon as they start taking damage scarriers get a bonus to launch 3 extra dronesfighters per level this means that at level 5 a scarrier can launch upwards of 20 dronesfighters a blob of fighter bombers can dish out about 10000 dps against a stationary ship or structure combining the above things its simply not reasonable to attack the drones of a fleet or even a gang of scarriers youd be dead before you even scratch the scarriers shieldsi
besides that sc can also carry tons of replacement drones if they want to so completely defanging a supercarrier is tedious labor at best
the problem with the suggestion that drones need to be easier to kill is the price if the cost to make them came down then sure losing just a single fighter costs around 20m isk bombers are even more the problem is more to do with the smaller drones than the fighters and bombers though a scarrier relies on mediums and heavies to fight off battleships hacs bcs etc a scarrier basically has an infinite amount of the these drones to throw at sub caps ccp could make a separate hold for fightersbombers and dramatically shrink the drone bay so sub caps can actually engage a scarrier that would provide a weakness
or make their drone launch number bonuses only apply to fighters  fighterbombers
thats reasonable but does not address the unending swarm of drones issue
a sc can carry 4050 fightersfbs by removing only 1 fighter 5000 m3 they can add 100 ogre iis 200 hammerheads and 100 hobgoblins
1 ship launches 20 drones  at least 20 backup drones  40 total20 ships launch 400 drones  at least 400 backup  800 total50 ships launch 1000 drones  at least 1000 backup  2000 totaltell me how you intend to kill them fast enough knowing that they take anywhere from 2040000 raw damage per drone to kill for 50 sc thats 80 million ehp or roughly a station reinforcement ever tried doing that with just bs and seen how long it takes with no lag to do ever tried to do it in heavy lag and see how much longer it takes to do imagine a fight where you have 200 fleet enemies have 100 with 50 bs and 50 sc you decide to shoot the station and see if you can kill it before your focusing on their fleet imagine how well that would work out drones are only a small part of a much bigger problem with scs though
perhaps make ships probeable and instead of giving t3s an immunity or some other bs let them have a scrambler of sorts so hat when you probe for them depending on what level your skll is at compared to theirs or however you want to do it it would send off ghost images of a larger fleet that gives the tradeoff of more solosmall gang gankers shying away from warping in to engage unless they warp in within 100km or some distance beyond either players sooting range to scout but lets be honest ifyou see a scout warp in you should run but the tradeoff is you may attract larger groups of players looking for fleetsized killmail lists so its kind fo 5050 depending on what kindof pvper is stalking youpersonally i dont have many problems with being gaked or ganking others so not sure how well this solution would work but i feel its better then alot of real nonsensical solutions some people come up with such as 1 person a while back suggested a modificaqtion to t3 that pretty much made you choose between being able to shoot or being unprobabl with 90 of your shieldarmorstructure gone nonsensical like that is what im against
editi dont consider what im doing narrow minded at all it might be a little narrow minded for me to just call you a ganker but lets have a look at that
no ship should be unprobable rather than fixing low sec we got unprobable ships to populate low sec with rather than fixing null sec the vast emptiness is now able to be filled with unprobable ships unprobable ships are not a fix thats my problem with any solution that keeps unprobable ships
although i agree with some of your sentiments most of the arguments you use already have an answeryou want to scoutspygo about your business in enemy territory you can its called a cloaking devicenow if you want to mission in lowsec or 00 why exactly should you be able to do it with no chance of ever getting caught the whole point of 00 and lowsecof a lesser degree is to enable players to fight each other hold on here it comes whether or not they want tolowsec gives a nonpvp player a certain help with this regarding gate mechanics and agression timers in reality if you travelling in lowsec if you are aware enough and have good bookmarks you shouldnt really be caught although if you look at my kb youll see this doesnt always work  00 you only have session timers and great bookmarks to help you this is as it should be the rewards are greater in 00 so the risks should be equal to thatmy only ask is that if you wish to make any ship unprobable it should gimp the output dps of the ship to make it not worth having unless its a spyscoutfleetbooster shipyou dont like the fact they bring a cloakyunprobable fleetboosteryou can always bring 1 or 2 of your ownas for the mission runner you have a directional scanner use it you see a probe cloak up or make safe if your being targeted its what i have to do in 00 and it doesnt stop me most of the time from earning isk
how about only reduce warp time in 00 due spacial distortions
only if it comes with teleport to final waypoint and instadock feature oh oh oh and instawarp too lets make eve a better waitfree game not
wrong ship to whine from
no
medium hyperspatial velocity optimizer ii
they should increase warp time by 50
yap
and you are unable now am i missing something not supported
right now repair drones cannot repair your own ship theyre effectively only remote repairi lost my first bs to concord because i repped rats in high sec thinking i needed to tell my repair drones to engage the rats so theyd come back and fix mesupported 100
exactly also drones are destroyable unlike a ship module
targeting yourself might be possible now with all the bugs in incursion 16 ahahaha
does the current csm or ccp believe that parking a t3 or command ship safed off grid and providing its bonus relativly risk free is the best mechanic for these shipsbonusesshouldnt these ships be on grid to provide there bonusrequiring this would lead to more command shipsredudancy or battle cruisers fielding these modscheaper right now piloting one of these ships is boring but very nessisary as the benifit is hugethoughts
i think many people share your loathing of offgrid t3 command ships providing bonus while unprobabely safe unfortunately i dont think the current fleet bonus mechanics can differentiate between ongrid and off grid luckily a ccp rep mentioned not to long ago the desire to nerf unprobable setups meaning youll be able to scan them down when they arent posd up
while i applaud your attempt to recitify supercaps online i dont think your suggestion will solve the underlying problems 1 the lock scan res and tracking penalties are there to make them poor antisubcap platforms changing these things might have unintended consequences against subcap fleets and i dont think youve considered these consequences fully 2 the focus of using remote reps rather than active tanking is one of the fundemental reasons for the rise of supercaps active tanking does not scale but rr does i think moving more capital ships into the direction of rr tanking needs a lot of consideration originally i thought it was a very bad idea your 60 resist bonus is one of the major reasons for this as it allows one triaged carrier to rep the incoming dps of 48 dreads depending on how many resists mods the dread installs if you extended rr to triaged carriers this would stalemate many capfights nontriaged carriers would still be very effective adding fighter dps while still being able to outrep 12 dreads and receive rr themselves think about how devistating this change would be to the effectiveness of subcaps when engaging caps now add in improved lock tracking and scan res to dreads and abbadon fleets will be in a very bad spot these changes will have an effect but not on supercarriers dreads will ramin the capital warfare ship of middleclass alliances but now they become much more safe from the subcaps of povertystricken alliances supercarriers will still be far superior to dreads on the battlefield because they can warp around and change the range of combat rather than sitting in one place their dps isnt has highly dependent on range and they can easily gtfo when things heat up personally i think the change thats needed is to enable subcap fleets a method to declaw supercarriers in the same manner that 10 rifters can kill a domi by declawing it first this will never happen while you can remove one fighter and put in 100 ogre 2s while everyone wants to have a bomb option in the rock paper scissors game it fundamentally destroys the game balance
i want to be able to feed the corpses of my enemies to my pets
rideable minmatar slave
i want to be able to shoot the corpses of my enemys pets at my friends
ecm is easy on successful ecm attack you loose the dps equivalent of 1 drone for the duration of the ecm but who ever ecms drones aside from ecm burst and it probably work the same as it does now for thatwebbing is hard one 2 options 1 drone splits off from the herd and can be shot as normal and after its web effect is gone it rejoins the squadron that however is really complicated and hard to code the second option thats really quick and easy is a single web has a reduced effect on the squadron i kinda favor the second one since it this makes shooting out drones in a fight alot easier that they need some small advantage and a reduced webbing bonus is something
i want drone groups but not in the way you are proposing i cant stand the fact that a carrier can put out only 15 fighters at a time that is freaking weak for any carrier especially ones as huge as in eve i think each fighter should be compromised of 10 fighters in a formation thats a total of 150 fighters out at a time then as each fighter group takes damage a fighter might be lost causing reduced dps out of that group of fighters obviously you wouldnt want to have each of the 150 fighters doing the damage a single fighter does nowso each group would do the damage a single fighter currently does
the problem is drones cause lag huge amounts of it the server has to track its position and movment in space then do all the math for the firing calculations and that is for each drone and then send that huge amount of information to every one on gridhave you ever been in a fleet fight with 4k drones in space its pretty brutal reducing the amount of work that the server has to do by cutting down the work it has to do for drones would be a huge step towards laggless fleet fights
no different than 1 gun in a stack overheating though i dont think it really is as complex as you make it out to be
keep all crap in general plz
nonconstructive and offtopic so as much as it pains me click
everyone talks big so why not make 1v1 possible have some sort of beacon and gates mission style that limit the number of players that enter im sure there would even be a way to make it possible to have small gang fights 2v2 3v3 ect possibly even make it possible to have some sort of duel adverts to allow players to freely challenge each other and only accept the fights the see as fair something like that might be pretty fun for new players as well would be a way to ease into pvp without the blob fests of 00
i think it should be like the alliance tournament space pvp without a warp interdiction would be interesting pick your team in staion on the setup screen set a maxium between 110 to prevent zerging people if they did i would like to see the ranking system changed to reflect what was an open world kill and what was a controled enviroment killsomeone who played wow told me battlegrounds killed world pvp i dont know if thats true or if the same would apply to eve somethin to consideri guess i will support it
sighyes this thread is so much different than all the 1000 other proposals for this topic
sure if you remove the cargo bay
much like reallocating skill points  no you let it in the door and itll never stop autopilot is a lazy feature and nothing more at the speed shuttles move the difference is relatively minimal when traveling highsecurity if you wanted to make it through lownull quickly and painlessly you would have made the effort to warp yourselfas for a more logical answer piracy is a profession in eve and depends on one of two types of ransoms  ship ransom and pod ransom one can be considerably more expensive than the other do the math on a snake set shuttle pilots not paying attention happen to be one of the easiest ways for starting pirates and veterans of rum to make isk warp to zero is your 50 chance to escape any conflict  and shuttles make that a near 100 with their incredibly fast warplogic 2 jumpclones by allowing shuttles effectively a 100 chance to never be in danger except in a bubble you have eliminated the need for jcs except as a halfwayacrossneweden necessity why pay for a jc and wait 24 hours to go back when your shuttle can auto to your destination in a fraction of the timelogic 3 if you allow shuttles to warp to zero why cant pods they warp slower in transit but align and begin much quicker read instantly the same applies to interceptors which also show similar values  can they warp to zero as welllogic 4 the reality problem  if anything no ship should be able to warp to 0 as it seriously endangers the warp gate due to traffic and highvelocity mass a shuttle which moves far faster than a battleship and has a small profile could literally tear a hole through a warpgate if it misjumpedtldr nothey already are the individual transport tool
the initial launch of incarna no  were only getting cq and vanity items from what i understand basically eyecandy for the startup but you gotta start somewheredown the road as stations open up and you can actually visit other avatars probably  id say sometime in winter though before we see those kinds of mechanics ingame
and yet by killing bob twice means we get to say it
im on the other side i think that correcting your security status after dropping it is too easy it makes the consequences of choosing to pirate nothing more than a bit of a grind to undotheres also the issue since beta even that concord pays bounties and gives you secstatus increases out in 00 where they dont care about anything else at the very least id expect concord to lower the amount of gain the lower the security rating of the system unfortunately this would trash the economy of nullsec and to some extent lowsec as well but is would make sense from a story perspective i mean really i make myself a heinous criminal by preying on innocent people until im kicked out into the wildlands where there is no law then by behaving nicely out there where there is no law i somehow gain standing with the police just doesnt make sense unfortunately ive never seen or heard of a scheme that would make sense without screwing nullsec players but ill keep hoping in the meantime i certainly cant support making the consequences for pirating even more trivial
if it happens by the end of june ill be pleasantly pleased the teaser was a good preview of what to expect cant wait to see the details
ah yes the good old days where you wrote down a summary deleted the parts under the nda and where good to gothanks for the information trebor it is much appreciated nonetheless
question should you wait for tommroow to draft the details on dust most of it might not be nda anymore right
ok its 10 days short of 2 months now is there any chance of getting a transcript of this
no thank you i wont even go into the potential problems and issues of which it is fairly obvious there is an abundance i dont want someone else to have any power over me in the game joining a corp you voluntarily cede that power npc corps or your own 1person or small corp avoid it mandatory mayors of every region in highsec give whoever is the most popular power over a large number of players that simply want to be left alone and play solo
for a start i dont think every region should have it or even do it by region doing it by constellation is pretty good though and seriously u wanna play solo go play tetris or maybe learn what the mm in mmo stands for
over the last few years i have been playing eve i have followed with a watchfull eye of the piracy element in evei would like to put forth thisin high sec as it stands piracy rarely results in anything less then a slap on the wrist with a sec status drop which is sometimes the goal and loss of ship usually for fun rather then isk all though sometimes they can get a juicy dropwhen said pilot gets ganked what options do they really have hire mercs for high amounts of iskcry to fellow corp mates to risk their ships for a killand so onmy proposal is thisafter said victim is killed under the kill rights tab they can either claim kill rights or selltradethe solution here is this would allow the profession in eve know as bounty hunters to buy said kill right lets say 30 of insurance payout if no insurance then 10 or perhaps the isk goes to a npc is sinkthus enhancing this minute profession and adding a little isk to said victims walleti think this would give those that cant fight back a small option to exact some sort of internet spaceship revenge while adding another role play option to evenow onto the hatelove and trollsfly safe
i was about to tell you to htfu but the idea of trading concordsanctioned kill contracts is actually kind of coolplayer justice  any punitive game mechanic ccp can dream up
more space wont helpback in the day  back in the day the api didnt broadcast every change to nullsec within 1 hour right now you can setup a simple routine to email you whenever anyone builds anything in a system that they do not control be that a pos or trying to claim sovwhen you have the ability to see a pos being built in an unclaimed system you have the ability to log on pull together a team and go blow them up  in a system none of you have been to in the last year of your play it takes no effort at all to find where the new gang is trying to get a footholdthats a hell of a difference in afk empire managing from back in the day
honestly if they dont have alts involved in it they probably dont know what the hell is going on and will find it of little importance that doesnt mean ccp will ignore it check the answers to the community fw was talked about with more certitude of known issues than gallente shipshybrids so at least you can hold onto the fact that ccp is awaredo i hold this to mean ccp will fix it hell no i do see it as something they may do regardless of what the csm may want as a priority the csm helps provide feedback but they dont decide what ccp will or will not do
yea how dare they read threads and have legitimate conversations about game mechanics even going so far as to admit they dont know everything
in real life most of eve would be considered frontier territory going back to the days when people took the law into their own hands without being punished for it the exceptions would be 07 and higher security space where it would either be the law or those supported by the law we would have marshals players enjoying the benefit of high security status who worked for ded and concord criminals would be criminals and they would be shot on sight or lose their possessions and belongings prior to being escorted out of high security space and into the badlands player lawmen would track down criminals for rewards and never suffer a loss to security status for doing so save maybe in 10 space and they would never be fired on by gateguns concord or station gunscriminals would not be able to redeem themselves without quitting what they are about and taking up the honest life so their past would follow them until they fixed it even then it would not be forgotten once you have a skull you always have a skull blue or not
i think youll find few people so delusional that they believe removing insurance will actually stop suicide ganking for one if the cargo is too valuable insurance doesnt matter any more its more the principal of it really even the staunchest pirates often admit that concordsubsidized piracy is a bit too muchalso suicide ganking in general is way too consequence free thats another major thorn in peoples eye you ought to get no insurance payout for starters next to that it should come with stuff security penalties i mean like 05 per incident per offenderthe consequence free ganking is compounded by ccp being surprisingly lax about it even though its verboten people recycle accounts all the time and ccp doesnt lift a finger and their argument against removing insurance is always the poor noob who would otherwise no longer be able to buy himself a new ship here lax turns to downright lazy as insurance payout could easily be tied to security status much like in real life btw good luck getting insurance with a criminal record oh you probably still can but at a premium price bad security status premium goes thru the roof or go too low and pendant simply notifies you they have terminated the insurance on your vessels altogether anyway you get my drift it could easily be made a lot more equitableafter two years of playing eve its my understanding that there are elements within ccp that simply think eve as a whole should just be one huge ruleless pvp zone it certainly explains their rather relaxed attitude towards highsec suicide ganking and a few other things dont get me wrong im not against suicide ganking if its truly profitable to them let them have a go at it but the simple empire lolzgank costing the victim hundreds of millions while the aggressors walk away scott free that really needs to stop
fully suport thios and that wil not bereak economic just somer ppl will not gank for lulz only high sec supostobe safe not suicide ganker paradise
this is a sensible idea
not a bad idea
this is a good idea as it makes sense imo arguments that ganking keeps the economy going are weak ccp has much better ways to influence market prices
adding more to stations like able to place agents in it for common person to run base in 00 as missions could give good mins out put and more common t1 items to be sold
the launch of dust planned for the summer of 2012 will greatly effect the economy of 00 and how production of planetary resources is secured i dont see any point in this discussion until we have a better understanding of how dust will interact with eve
noi do not want that donatable currency if eve online will contain donatable currency what will be next true armor for my soldier in dust 514 only for 5 expanded magazine for my assault gun only for 3true tank for 20do not allow that currency
no
no
well im thinking about this since december but couldnt get my ass up to run some numbers and present them in a well structured post so i think i should at least support the idea however i think that hybrids need a bit more to become effective at the moment we have a way to high granularity in ammo choices my idea would be to split hybrid ammo in two types variation 1 7030 thermkin damage 10  bonus to blaster damage variation 2 7030 kintherm damage 10 bonus to rail damage that is 4 variations for both ammo types and completely sufficient in my opinionadding to that i would like to see way larger cargobays on gallente ships to hold more cap booster charges and reduce cap recharge time on caldari ships while keeping their cap capacity low rokh shouldnt cap out by shooting its gunsadditonally i think gallente need some sort of agility buff to get them faster at speed and maybe add some web strength riggs to present an alternative to armor riggs
supported theres no reason it should not optional personally i think cq will get old fast until they implement more of incarna like face to face corp meetings running into your enemies in a gambling den ect that stuff would be cool walking around a cell going yay i haz a monacle that nobody can see but me and it only cost me 10 million isk  isnt exactly what i was hoping for but to each his own i guess
there are functional losses from this change as well small ones but they are there and will trouble some of usspinning a ship i can fit guns on it and see what they look like quickly and efficiently this makes adapting to the graphics changes a minor annoyance  its a change so get new shots and memorize the new hullsguns excepthaving that ship floating above and behind you in washed out lighting makes it kind of tricky to spot what the turret changes are that big model sits there slowly rotating with no way to control its spin and no way to check other angles it looks little like the ship in space beyond general shape so rightclick view target on a gate is going to give me a dark looking hull with guns fit that i cant see unless i fit those guns on a ship fly out check it then loading please wait style next ship this was not necessary when i could spin the ship in the hangarfor a top quality scout who can report back an arty fit or an ac fit hurricane if that a domi is either neutdisco fit or what kind of guns that kind of intel can make the difference between no lost friendlies or losing a few depending on both the scouts ability to report it and the fcs ability to direct the tacklersi aborted trying to get the screenshots after about 20 minutes which  if i had that old interface id have had at least 2 races of frigates done with load load load load slower than before and only because i cant see the damned stuff fit clearly in docktag on the fact that most games are working damned hard at removing loading messages and masking the ones that they have eve is adding it to one of the most heavily used portions of the game  not just 1 walk to the end of that ramp towards the cq and theres a second load that happensfaster graphics or not  more loading i recall when i left eq for wow 15 minute flight during its open beta  i flew over a gang of 20 bashing on a hill giant without a stutter 15 minutes of scenery without 1 stinking loading please wait that i used to get every what  150 steps or so in eq i dont like waiting for things to load and yes i have a nice quality new machine on order but ill still get those friggn loading slowdownsthis seems a tad backwards  forcing a loading screen like this when its not needed for functional portions of game playif you like pretty  thats cool ill probably wander around a bit myself  when i feel i have the time forcing me to load it when im shifting fits and the like not allowing me to see the ship from views like it will be seen with a view target that i dont like
i choose to push for the option to change names it preserves consequences because there will be a history this and more has been mentioned already been dealt withokay no character that has been sold may have a name change and any name changed character will be reverted to its older name dealt withhmm im not a kid were you perhapes talking about himreactionary and myopic if that is the level of mentality that is opposing name changes i dont even need to say anything
no
you jump into jita or other busy hub there are over 100 people on local are you telling me that you have the time to open up each persons history info and scan through i really dont think so this point has not been dealt withand the point i made of it generating no profit for ccp is this3000 people x 15 usd for name change  45000 revenuethats presumably less than the cost of a 1 year salary of an employee at ccp who would have to deal with the customer support and petitions that would come from the abuses of this system ie no profit
let me help out this thread herethey are s they will not ever let us do this no matter the logic or easy fixes like a name history periodwhybecausesee part about s
meh id be cool with name changes even free ones maybe once per year like attribute remaps name change history would be nice id still have other players set as contacts with goodbad standing etc hopefully that wouldnt change with their name their sec status hopefully wouldnt change their employment history would still exist their faction standings would still exist we already have a system to add notes or flags to specific characters it would make the character bazaar a lot more useful to those of us who dont want alts with ed names doesnt seem like a terribly difficult option to implement seems like it would be used a lot so its worth the time
lots more noyour name is your name stick with your choice and before you mention character sellingtrading choosing to buy a character with a given name is a choiceps your logic is based around a psycological issue named ego outside of that there is no logic to a name change that is a period right therealso buying a character is one of the worst parts of this game so you cant even use that as a reason people who buy characters are just as bad in my opinion as people who buysell isk if you want a new name start a new character im sorry that it means you have to start from scratch although im really not
remember that blasters inherently have a short optimalso if the longest range ammo deals the most damage that only makes a blaster hit out a few km farther but with littleno tracking bonus considering blasters have a higher dmg multiplier as well as high tracking speed this shouldnt be a problem1 the idea is sound for railguns  but you are now making gallente pilots primarily snipers for pve but maintaining their up close and personal role in pvp i like it caldari hybrid boats would do fine with this as well
please support
agree
imho it should be optional off by default you can show them if you want and turn it off if you dont this stops standings from being used as a highsec griefing toolshould be able to view standings of all members of your corpalliance no reason to hide this from a corp unless your a spai lolstandings info should be available via limited api so corps who only pull limited api for recruiting can still check this
two reasons this is a bad idea 1 it stops people from identifying the subs by looking at the t32 if you do that you may as well just scrap the whole thing and make all t3 look the samei appreciate that some t3 subs look a little odd particularly combined with certain other subs but that is part of owning a t3 fact is the subs could use a little remodeling in some areas and they could also be rebalanced to make the scrap ones more appealingnot supported i really would rather wonky looking subs than more generic ship classes
youre being rediculous mars nobody i know uses the appearance of a t3 to base what they have on itfind some other reason to come out against something other than nitpicking
we could allow you to choose the gun models that appear on your ship independantly of what guns you actually have fitted dont like the look of shield hardeners tick a box and get the visual effect of an armor tank insteador perhaps you need to get to know some people who are better at eve
wow a snarky comment from goon color me shocked next
 precisely thisnot supported
alright fine it was just an ideaforget i said anything lets get back to business as usual
you just dont know right people pin less than two minutes you can have estimated fitting of t3 based on ship model and visible turrets and tanking modules graphic effects scouting in wh covers things like that when you want to know what t3s are loged on a pos and what to expect of them
since ccp is working hard on walking in station why cant we get cyno effects fixed its little just why not lot of capital pilots wanting this changed seeing jumping effects and cynos would be nice small change dont you think
problemlow sec has a much lower population than emp or null emp is safe null is the most rich in resources low is supposed to be the happy middle ground and a place where pirates can do their thing problem is no carebear will live in low sec because even though the planets and ore is a little better than emp it does not make up for the increase in risk to losing ones ship or ore to piratespossible solutions up for discussionfix the bounty system yes its been proposed many many times in the past already with a working bounty system it will encourage mercenaries as a profession when there are more bounty hunters there will be mercs where there are mercs then some will enevitably fall to the darkside to become pirates while others remain true and become vigilantes net net there will be enough of a merc population to have mercs for hire for reasonable prices so that carebears can just post wanted ads in station for people willing to escort haulers through lowsec or help guard a mining operation some may make good honest living as good guy mercs others as pirates in disguise who gank their employers all in good funadd drug production and smuggling but make it so that certain ingredients for drug or booster production can only be found in low sec this is more of a heavy handed god manupulation of the market solution and may have some domino effects that are unforseen but in the short term it will boost the desire of people into lowsec make dust514 have some sort of game effect that is unique to lowsec this solution isnt much more than a hazy idea at this point and the sky is the limit to what we can think of but one may be that dust514 players play mostly in lowsec because it may be cheaper to hire ground troops in lowsec etc perhaps the major ground troopmercenary guilds can be based there etc its not hard to imagine as fighting in the core emp worlds will be minimal they are at peace for the most part and fighting in nullsec planets may be too dangerous you may get stranded on a planet with no npc transports to get you offworld relying only on alliance capsuleers to transport you offworld so the wildlands of low sec is where most dust campaigns will occur looking forward to hearing more suggestions
my take on what would make me want to put down permanent roots both as carebear and pirate
put all lvl4 and lvl3 missions in lowsec reduce the industry power in highsec reduce the quality of ore in highsecproblem solved
putting the lvl34 missions in low may work but you cant just send a whole flock of sheep to the slaughter they wont go willinglyproblem is that mission running uses pve setups which will get pwned by a pvp setups so you may just have much less people running lvl34 missions which will make implant prices and faction gear prices shoot through the roof what most people dont realize is that pvpers need mission carebears and vice versa else the market will sufferinterestingly if this was done it would increase the number of pvpers as mostly combat types would be forced to flip between running missions in lowsec to ganking mission runners in lowsec without concord the equilibrium will swing in the favor of the gankers then soon you will have everyone become gankers and no more gankees left making everyone in lowsec pvpers what that would lead to is that no haulers or miners or other noncombat types would venture into lowsec anymore being that the population there is all pvpers the effect of lowering ore yields wont have the effect you think i fear instead miners will stay in empsec and all t1 gear will just jump in price to reflect the extra work industrialists need to put in to produce them with low grade ore sowhat about this we want lowsec to be dangerous but not as dangerous as null sec what if we allowed people who have good standing with the sov of the lowsec pirate faction and the main faction so derelik would be ammatar and sansha be safe in that region that would make good game sense now how do we implement such relative safety in a region full of pvpers make it so that if you have good standing with x npc faction and you attack someone who also has good standing with x you will lose your standing with x also if your standing is bad enough with x then obviously gate guns and police will shoot you this has the effect of making lowsec like a baby null sec except that the alliance in this case is the npc pirate andor main sov factionso a pvper pirate will happily gank a stray hauler unless the haulerminer is friendly with the same faction the pirate is if he shot too many friendly faction carebears then the pirate will find himself unable to dock at stations and have his poses taxed heavily or some other npc faction penalty to make it not worth his while
funny i wrote my response to the latest on this thread then i read your linked discussion and marveled and how we think alike i like the swearing allegiance thing but maybe make it simpler you just swear allegiance the same way someone today joins factional warfare militia just join up once your standing is high enough and adding new lvl34 drug trade related missions will give the missioners a reason to move to lowsec where they will choose to continue to mission or choose to join the militia pirate and keep the region clean of foriegn carebears while protecting his own carebear industrialists
this wil not solf a tring 1 risk vs income to low for creabear tio go in to low sec eny way with standing sytem or wit out standing system so there then need increase income sigificantly to that litle lp pioint increase will not make eny cearbear go to low sec 2 miners to will not go to low sec again ting the same incoem vs risk if miner can mine lets say 47 milj per hour in high sec hee will nto go to mine in low sec to ern 10 milj risk to big lose 230 milj ship specialy miners using usualy multiple chars to mine and mange them all itrs hard in lowsec practicly inposible and do thet safly cerbears and miners wil go only in low sec if his action there will be not posible disturb or income will be so big that that covers ship loses but with curent incomes there not posibul tio cover a ting if miner needto mine 20 hours to cover one hulk sorry thanot aceptible and the same for mision runer if hee need cover his tengu or wath ever ratting ship rat like 67 hours to not acceptible so let me say again thos payers wil go only to low sec if they can aford it that means 1 haur new ship that wuld be acceptible for cearbears  i have talked about this with meny ppl asking them a questions and on such results i comed up ihave lived in low sec in high sec and in 00 so i speaking from my exopirince tosorry for gramatical mistakes english its not my primary language ilerned it in eve
did you read the part of my and the other ladys proposal about making drug production only properous in lowsec presumably because pirate factions love drugs and the low sec areas the custom inspectors at the gates are lazythis is the incentive for carebears to go into lowsec and with faction alliegience it will be relatively safe for the most part still being able to pay for merc escorts would help this a loti agree with you insofar as increasing resources in lowsec drugs and boostersi disagree with you in that you want to reduce highsec resources this isnt necessary let the farmville players stay in highsec if they like they will just miss out on the profits to be made in the new black market and booster trade
problem with using standings as requirement is that it is comparatively hard to get good pirate standings better to pay for the privilege and in the process burn the easy standings ie empires thus technically allowing anyone to stake a claimtrick is to make people want to go there which can only be done by increasing security or the sense thereof and offering something that is not available elsewhereformer can be npc based concordnavy but that would penalise pirates which is counterproductive as low is supposedly their home so it has to be player basedlatter can be any pve activity i went with drugs and security rating grind as they are the most piraty options available l34 missions could work but all that does is alienate the vast number of people who wants to chill chew the fat and generally just be left alone read casual playersmy vision was inspired by the predrugs mafias in the real world who made their cash by taking dividends from everything on their turf in exchange for protection
yes i reded that but that not brings much income in drugsn to producet in high amountsi produce them my slef was nedet 2 month to sel in good market hubs all my week production afciors if this can be chhanged that drugs alowed to use in high sec to but that wil not change a ting profit fom drug manufucturing its not inaf to go to low sec
well then it will be up to ccp to make the drug trade profitable then its a separate issue that needs to be looked at but the solution is rarely to gimp an existing market rl analogy you want more tech businesses in your country you should give tax incentives to new tech businesses you should not increase taxes on existing industries like food production in the hope of getting them to change their business to technology its just a bad idea to mess with the free market those who want to play casually will continue to play casually you cant and shouldnt force them to move to lowsecthe demographic you want to focus on to move to low sec should be current nullsec folks who are sick of all the warring and bubbles and new players who want to try out the reinvented pirate dark side professions
you skipped the most important questioneverybody that never did bounty hunting and tries to fix it actually does this question is very simple who will actually pay for this if you are ready to pay 200300 on individual kills you could already get it done by a merc corp however most people will not invest this much on her personal vendetta against a guy they will probably never see againsince they dont live where he lives in low secbecause behind your white knight illusion of a bounty hunter there will be actually a kind of a merc that will not work for free or to protect people that cant do this on her own he does it for a profit same as any merc corp now that doesnt do bounty hunting for the simple reason that it is to much effort and the targets are most likely very skilled solosmall gang pvpers and a pain in the ass to hunt down separately
another option allow player pirate corps and alliances to sell formal protection contracts when another player corp or alliance buys the contract they are guaranteed not to be attacked by those player pirates funds are held in escrow for the duration of the contract and at then end are paid to the pirate corp if no violations occur if the contract is violated the escrow is returned to the buyerspeaking for myself as a mostlycarebear if i could buy such contracts at a reasonable price id be much more active in low sec than i am now usually a low sec system is frequented by one or two specific corps so if a carebear type can pay those regular pirates off the place is much safer a random wanderer could still pose a threat but its more of an occasional threat than the massive looming threat posed by pirates that live there
on this ihave one idea  ting its such bouty hynting need to be brath togeter with sec status drop if sec status drops lower then 00 than per ewach point wath sec status drops on your head its droping a bounty from concord that actualy wiling to kil you and suports mercs to kill you in low sec lets say 10 milj per 05 points or so nd if soem one kiling him he not resives sec status drop even if he was 001 in sec status that even in high sec pirate itsp irate and have risky live
i like the buying allegiance idea but i worry that that will tip the scales in favor of the rich and will pretty much block access to the new lowsec to beginning pirates ideally we need beginning players to bang out a couple of missions in emp then move to lowsec quite early on what about a special mission like the one in the beginning tutorials which there was a point where a pirate npc wanted to recruit you perhaps allow the player to agree to join perhaps by killing the innocent rats and that would make the pirate drop a letter of recommendation to the player which would give them a 1 time standings boost with the pirate factioni think that the order of gentrification of lowsec is important first to move in must be the missioners missioning for pirate agents once there are enough in a region to be a force then protection for the haulers and the miners in that pirate space can be achievedhow can we achieve this level of loyalty to a faction reward isk for dogtagscorpses of players who are good standing with your factions enemies for pirates this will be the home faction of your lowsec area give standing gains when you kill capsuleers allied with your enemy home factions have home factions do the same for those with good standings with pirate ones giving standing gains for kills of your enemies will alleviate the mission grind problem and will ensure that pvpers will inhabit lowsec also your idea of taking a cut of the profits in the region is a good one allow pirates with good standing after mission grinding or killing your way up there to take a cut in the tax revenue that the stations in lowsec collectin short make pirate space be an npc alliance so that its pretty much like null sec without the sovereignty wars or bubbles and with pirate missionsmy only fear is that it may end up being so lucrative that too many people will leave null sec for low sec at least the casual pvper will which maybe is a good thing
but here is the ting  alts  and such stuf pirats wil be not interested protect tehm they jsut wil take his alts and kil them them self and lot them i tink there need to be ting that if no vialince att al acure not only form them bu8t from every one els if vilience they not resiving amoney att all toget more attention to protect thios miners or cearbears in low secand wil bring more fightuing between pirates actrualy more ship losts not only 1 cearbears ship them but more pvp ships more demanfd in market etc
excellent ideabut what if the contract is breached will there be some sort of repercussion i hope that it wont be achieved outside of the game mechanics it would be pretty lame to not be able to lock somebody just because they had protection perhaps by way of a standing loss or fine or a free insurance payout to the buyer of the protection in the case they are attacked
people will simply farm her alts for isk a system that generates the isk out of the air doesnt work it needs to come from a source that is a not infinite and b re spawning reasonable quick this actually means the people that the pirate kills need to pay for it to make it halve way interesting for a mercthen you will have actually a system that works for real bounty hunters and carebears will hate it because they get charged twiceship bounty anytime they get killed in low sec by a pirate
not a bad ideacouple this with the idea that was proposed about buying a protection contract this could work if you breach a protection contract then concord will come for you same as if you ganked a normal player is highsec faster in 04 slowest in 01edit eperor i misunderstood you i dont agree that concord should be putting bounties as djego mentioned any new isk source needs to be very well justified to ensure it is not abused i was agreeing insofar as concord should be the enforcer of dutarros protection contractsthe problem of alts isnt going to go away the best defense against alt abuse is standings standings need to be hard to gain and you need to grind a bit to get them if you can achieve standings too easily then people will just pay alts to get standings then use them to gank unsuspecting carebears who thought that they were on the same pirate team then just throw away the alt and pass the loot onto the real main toon
i see that you tinking more fprm pirate point off wieve but heren need to tink more form pve ting how that poor cearbear wil arn fast inaf ship back if that its profitable for him to do there and such stuf idea is giood to bring ppl in low sec but need more economical tings here like sytem how can cearber survive there duing his own ting and bring more fighting in the same time i tink thatr contract ting can probably work but stil need work out details much more details
the isk for the contract should be held in escrow for the duration if the contract is breached it is refunded to the buyer  only if the contract is finished without violation does the pirate corp collect iskas for accidental violation there could be a popup warning same as when you attack a neutral outside null sec
i tink there need suys chustem in that contract ting 1 cereabear pays mercs for protection h hee with live therei nthat low sec soem x timem mercs have contracts for that area cearbear accepting contract by paying all amount in midle bank or fat wever can be usued curent curerr contract system for that to mercs not resiving mopney yet2 time is going mercs protecting cearber etc3 time its up for conteracta creaberat lost ship to players mercs not resive a all moeny go to cearbear beck  tax like seling tax rat loses  self destruckt not countsb cerbear not lost a ship in that time to players mercs resiving moneyif prices wil be resonable then actualy this can bring soem live into low sec and more fighting to over low sec systems that wil bring pasive income to the low sec allainces and corps by duing his own ting fighting in low sec and wil bring up small gang pvp back in live
to true
that works too paid protection i like it very mafia very piratyalmost there but what if you are a hauler surely you wouldnt pay the full value of your load for a protection contract as it wont be worth it for you to haul anymore but if you didnt then it is always more profitable for the pirate to gank you and steal your load than protect you and collect the protection contract
if i hauled through the same low sec systems on a regular basis i would consider buying protection there no single load would be worth as much as the contract but added together over a few days or weeks it would be a reasonable business expense
hmm interestinghow long will these contracts last then i suppose some variable lengths that you can choose a day a week a month have concord warn you before your contract expiresi think this is a good proposalbut there are holesi still think there needs to be some nonisk disincentive for a policy insurer not to reneg on the contract perhaps standing loss with the pirate faction we dont want it to be too easy for a a rival to pay off the piratealso there is the problem of the time value of the protection contract hypotheticalhauler a pays 10 million isk for protection for 1 weekeach day he hauls 2 million isk worthproblem on the last day if someone ganks the hauler the pirate loses out on 10 million  unfair for the pirate in fact on the last day smart haulers would have a friend gank them what if you pay the contract on a prorated basis so that if ganked on the last day the pirate still gets 67 of the 10million ie each day the pirate earns 17th of the escrowproblem then each day the protection is only worth 17 of the escrow  which completely makes the protection contract worthless as any day the hauler is seen to move  1710000000 he is gankededit embellished my example
there will be always ppl who rather lose ships to npcs ccp than fellow players
the protection contract would only be voided if the issuing pirate corpalliance is the one to gank the hauler a third party gank would have no effect youre not really paying the pirates to protect you only paying them not to kill you for some period of time this can be done today by paying a pirate corp to set you blue and ive done it but a more formal game mechanic may give more industrial players confidence that the contract will be respected
at the cost of a wardec one time fee you would have to be straight out of the academy to not be able to afford itin my vision you can only lose that fee if another corporation successfully claims the same area but then you are a badass pirate with guns so defending your turf should be second natureback when ccp still cared about rp they were willing to change standings of characters to suit the game swearing allegiance could give a 50 to pirate faction and whatever derived penalty is associated with such a change ie hunted in nearly all empirespositive pirate standing would be lost if control is lost but all negatives wouldshould remain to empathize the consequences of that lifestyle choicethe contract idea was debated 23 years ago and was discarded there is absolutely no reason to assume that either side will live up to their end the first hauler to exceed the value in escrow and poofthe purchase price would need to be absolutely insane for it to make any sense  think about what might need hauling or what other activity one might engage in and run the actual numbers hint hundreds of millions
which has the problem that even today security standing loss only keeps a part of the community from ganking nevertheless i do like the ideafor those being younger link to older disucssions
but then how will i know who to buy contracts from if 10 corps are based in a region would i have to buy contracts from all of them whats to stop somebody from saying hey i see your nice ship there and nice cargo buy a protection contract from me otherwise i blow you up now this will degrade into the bully and lunch money scam immediately if the protection contract is not a protection contract ie a mercescort contract i dont see this working
yes exactly why we need something to make the resident pirates a feel resident ie a sense of loyalty to those who are loyal to their pirate faction the cut of the taxes on the businessesmission bounties run seem like a good idea that can be developed b incentivized to prey on outsiders but protect their own haulersmissioner kin
the riskreward ratio for ls is flawed ls is supposed to be less risky than 00 but in fact it isnt if ls were less risky than 00 then the rewards would be ok risk in lowsec needs to be reduced lowsec currently is the preferred place for pirates it should be less ideally suited for pirates and more suited for corporations who want to take their first steps in the direction of 00 concord is currently protecting the wrong people concord should not impose standing losses when corporations try to make a piece of lowsec secure for themselves and other capsuleers with good standing some ideasmake it possible to kill people with bad concord standing eg 0 without loss of standing those people should display red in overview perhaps use a gliding scale where 5 makes you red in highsec and 0 makes you red in 01 supply concord protection for people who have good standing people with insufficient standing should display orange in overview again you could use a gliding scale where 1 gives you concord protection in 04 while you need perfect standing 10 to have concord protect you in 01add a concord standing requirement eg 0 for anchoring a pos in lowsecadd a bounty worth a  of the value of a pirates ship for killing a pirates shipnew capsuleers cannot create jumpclones because of the high corporate standing requirements which hinders them from taking more risks your first jumpclone should only require a standing of 1 increasing the amount of clones may require increasing corporate standing
i like the idea of lowsec being the stepping stone for nullsec this will only serve to put pirates into empire at least there 40 standing players wont get shot at i dont think we need this rule you should get a sec penalty for shooting anyone above 5 same as in highseci do like this rule though concord protection cannot be as fast as highsec though the sliding scale should continue down from 05 to 01 appropriatelywhy concord why not the pirate npc faction seems strange that concord will have jurisdiction over sovereign empire systemsthis is exploitable i can make money by killing my own alts not a good ideaim not sure i agree here if you allow too many jump clones then people will be jumping all over the place if people are so risk adverse then they should not sink that much money into expensive implants too early on in their careers but you may be onto something here maybe instead of just making jump clones more prolific everywhere make them easier to get in lowsec only maybe you can buy standings with a pirate faction and therefore get a jumpclone much sooner than grinding standings for a empire corp in highsec this will also give incentive for pirates to keep their standings high with the local pirate faction lose the standings and they will lose their ability to jump into their clones
how do you stop the seller from using an alt or noncorp friends or just dropping from corp to gank the buyerthere would have to be a 2way risk here not simply a loss of deposit if you gank the carebearthis is essentially player driven insurance a contract involves the escrow presumably a reasonable estimate of the cost of the fitted ship and and a rate per hour fee and is associated with one or more systems if the ship is ganked by the contract owner naturally the purchaser obviously gets the escrow money but its too easy for the seller to allow 3rd parties the kill and probably too hard for the seller to genuinely offer round the clock protection from 3rd parties im not sure how you fix that
everyone i know hate the fact that one is stuck for ten minutes when opening one a cyno and since there is likely to be added a delay of some sort soon the time is ripe to add scripting as wellcynosaural field emergency shutdown script this script destabilizes the field allowing the user to collapse the field at any time after half a cycle at the expense of increased fuel requirementfuel consumption multiplier x8 eightbonus is that it will make recons a lot more powerful in their oft neglected role as cyno poppers combined with their builtin fuel and cycle time discounts they will be able gods when it comes to cynos
i understand the problem but i dont like the proposed solution much id rather see the cynojump mechanic reworked tbhps even with their bonus recons can hardly carry enough fuel for 4 cynos let alone 8
itd be much more interesting if you could script your cyno to affect the cap of the ships jumping in so you could half the duration of the cyno in exchange for ships arriving with zero cap or double the duration in exchange for 50 cap
1 train for recons2 3 profit

there are many actions a player can take that concord considers criminal  like stealing or shooting at a neutral in low sec you can do these things without being instantly crushed by concord but your security status drops if you do these things often you become an outlaw and cannot enter some high sec systemsi propose that high sec attacks made under offensive war declarations should also result in a security status drop for the attacker the penalty should not apply if the target shot at or stole from you first or if the war has been made mutualthe objective of this proposal is to maintain an element of danger in high sec since unlimited empire wars can still be waged but at the same time to enforce consequences for habitual war decers concord should regard a player who frequently wages offensive war in empire the same as one who frequently steals or pirates
interestingbut some questions lingerit makes sense as if you continually make offensive nonmutual wars decs then the global population should see you in a more negative light it gives a natural ceiling to habitual wardekers besides a monetary one im on the fence on this point as there already is a increasing cost structures for continual war deking but if the declarer will always get this penalty then what incentive would anyone have to make wars mutual
the same incentive as exists now  when you make a war mutual you force your attacker to stay at war this is used when the defending corp decides to launch a counterattack so they are expecting to score more kills than their enemies anyway
exactly the op probably didnt realize that having such a module that prevents anyone from helping you or your target is only going to help the guy with the bigger ship as i really cant see it ever being activated by the outgunned victim to keep friendlies from helping which basically amounts to an i win gank module which will guarantee the destruction of the opponent of the one who activates itcategorically no to this proposal
this module was already made
so basically this is like duel from wowno thanks
i dont know about this its kind of a bit more complex than you make it out to bei know a guy with 12 accounts 3 of them are his mains he has a main pvp char a main pve mission runner and a main pve inventorhauler 12 accountswhich would be his maini pay for 1 account that guy pays for 12 accounts game changes effect my 1 account but effect all 12 of his so should i have equal say to his 12 accountsbullying this happens in the game all the time a person who posts anonymously under an alt can state things that they wish to say but would be punished in game for saying  attitudes and opinions that disagree with their corp etcyes we get to put up with the downside of forum trolls thats a pain in the ass but eliminating the positives  thats kind of like the reviews on computer games that talk about only the vicious vile and addictive sides of gaming without looking at the positive and beneficial aspectsas i stated at the start  its a bit more complex than it seems and i think ill stick with the ugly trolls i know vs the constraints your suggestion would put on the general community
agree totally i dont mind that ninja looting is profession and yes they are taking loot not salvaging a wreck i want to shoot them in the face for doing it without them just insta docking and waiting out the timer whats the point of giving them agression in the first placethis does need sorting but as usual ccp wont listen anyway

ok so what ive seen thus far is that the reason targeting the drones is useless is that they are either too many or more importantly have too much hp to be worth the effort to kill so back to my question  has it been considered that the drones should be much easier to kill pricepoint and such are a good reason to be wary of dispensable fighterbombers and fighters but from what i can see if they were reduced in hp theyd likely be reduced in minerals needed and thus price as a whole balancing out their higher loss ratiofrom a different angle  we dont want to touch how many drones can be fielded at once as in reduction since that would completely undermine the aspect of a supercarrier and what makes it different i think anybody could agree with this fundamental fact i dont know that scs should be any easier to kill as they are now relative to their current ehp  but there back to my original point the only counter for a sc is more scs it seemssofood for thought if you nerf scs will you actually create an alternative counter or will their counter still be more scs but a support fleet makes a difference or will you render the ship worthless the point im getting at hence the post name is that the sc needs a weakness  not just a general nerf tying in another sore topic dreadnoughts are all but obsolete  i know ideas have floated around if shifting their role from stationkillers to sc killers but currently they lack the ehp and siege mode isnt conducive to this ideatldr analyze supercarriers from a different angle  instead of thinking on what attributes need to be changed think about what ships ought to be able to counter supercarriers besides more scsdreadnoughts has been proposed as fulfilling this role and thus not being obsolete anymore but could other ships be made the counter should the drones be far easier to kill  and if so by what shipsa radical idea what if supercarriers couldnt send drones at one another rp reasoning carriers have such powerful sensor arrays to direct their drones that they interfere with enemy drone targeting preventing them from locking on as it is carriers are immune to ewar
this has more to do with blob warfare and less to do with scarriers yaay 50 sc in one fight has only recently been achieved and that by everyone and their sister that banded together to break up the nc should something be done about blob warfare sure are you derailing this thread by talking about blob warfare and linking to your own threads yes

well there is one other way to try and reduce the botting is to have a option for player to mark some what known bot for ccp to look in to that toon and if ccp see that the toon is a bot and global mark them and other players could get a free kill but have the global marked till down time so if they try and get out and bot mine they could end up lossing more isk then they could bot mine and for ccp have a reward system inplace where if they kill so many global marked bots they could get concord lp or soming thats my thoughts
you should have kept them to yourself
sorry iocant suport thisi own 4 accoutns never boted with them even not posibul to difrently tainedi actualy will need to quit game if will be no plex to pay for a game  that my curent rl money status 
noreal players like me use plex in the intended fashion you cant just blanket statement things like plex  bots or blacks  crime its not rightmaybe there is some truth to those facts but not every plex is applied to a bot account
with each patch  it seems that the visibility of the capacity meter gets worse it is now barely visible in bright light conditions this is an important instrument and must be visible in all background conditions keep in mind that colorblind people especially need this instrument to be bright and visible
well there is one other way to try and reduce the botting is to have a option for player to mark some what known bot for ccp to look in to that toon and if ccp see that the toon is a bot and global mark them and other players could get a free kill but have the global marked till down time so if they try and get out and bot mine they could end up lossing more isk then they could bot mine and for ccp have a reward system inplace where if they kill so many global marked bots they could get concord lp or soming thats my thoughts
i agree on this proposal but only one ting let how its was only veldrpar in belts noting els ader ways all bots will move to lower sec systems and that will not change a ting
only one ting ccp its not so quick to rect so fast usualy that wil take them a days to see that but not mins or sec and one more ting not oonly mark him in lcoal for every one but even alow warp to him to fast kil him from local
well if ccp had few gms that monitor region then they could act on the report instead of waiting for days i know some other games have gms that do that why cant ccp even if they moved to a lower sec system if there was some kind of reward like concord lps you could find pilots hunting them down it could be a win win for ccp and us but like ccp would read this tho
agree
i would like an in game or forum poll about those ed that dust 514 is a sony exclusive even after 360 controllers were used in the demosthe vast majority  minus pc players elitist wanted 360 or multiplatform never did we say  we want ps3 exclusiveit seems that ccp has been punching us in the face for a long time now this at least for me is the final strawi think the only way for ccp to know how bad their idea was is a public poll in game where people will see itpoll questionwhat consoles should dust 514 be released ona xbox 360b ps3c both consoleslet the people have a voice ccp
more then likely the switch is because of how strict microsoft is with xbox live and if thats the case i understand and am not mad what i dont get is why its a console only game why cant we have a pc version thats what the poll should be
no sorry it has to be pc  consoles are ageing i own both ps3 and an xbox and i wouldnt care to play it on either i dont want to be nickel and dimed to death for content anyway so with that in mind ill step out of this discussion about this complete waste of time game with the followingps3 exclusive  4 month shelf life gl ccp youre going to need it
sony is much more open to developers though that doesnt make their games much better microsoft is notorious for being finicky about what releases on an xboxand especially what has live accessdeveloping the game for xbox may have run into trouble too  or perhaps the contract was not worth pursuing on ccps part if i were you though id be bugging microsoft not ccp about why dust 514 isnt on their console just flat out assuming they prefer the ps3 and pc is a bit sillyconsidering the market for xbox is significantly bettershort of it put your head on straight and dont be an ass about it by nailing ccp game contracting can be tricky at best and downright ridiculous at worst example the fable series on other platforms or how long it took halo to reach pc moreover asking on eve forums which is a miniscule playerbase relative to the fps playerbase is silly why arent you spamming on major gaming sites microsofts sites xbox sitesetc i bet if you rallied up all the xbox players to holler for dust514 youd see a change
aim bots wall hacks client exploits gamebreak macros etc etc etcbesides thatand no ccp shouldnt then fall back on solutions like punkbuster or vac or an inhouse similar solution i despise both systems vehemently
c for sure picking a console that has recently been hacked beyond oblivion is idiotic at best i know for sure my credit card details wont touch anything that has sony on it
d any of the above
doesnt matter if you couldnt get a deal with ms why show them using 360 controlers and other crap if they said it was a ps3 exclusive 3 years ago i wouldnt care they announce this fail and its overi want c both consoles however shooters seem to do better on 360 opposed to ps3
my vote would go towards the console that had the most flexibility in regards to allowing the type of interaction between eve and dust that makes the whole concept unique apparently ccp discovered that platform was ps3 which doesnt surprise me
was thinking another 360 game ported to ps3 meaning all ps3 extra hardware is irrelevant noweither waywant to failkeep it ps3 exclusive oh well
i would love to see the option of both but as already stated xbox is a closed server so microsoft would be very heavy on what goes on on the server same reason why steam is not on xbox but is on ps3
if ms is closed how come i can run a section 8 server myself for people to play on
id love it if dust was available on pc but wouldnt want it to suffer from the massive trend for hacking and bots that pc suffers fromps3 wow such a negative after the recent problems theyve had makes me sad xbox is cool as far as that goes but aging and not really capable of supporting the graphics and capabilities of pc either platform will suffer for that and i cant imagine trying to play with the blinky shuttering graphics that i know from xbox of old i actually think ps3 is one up on that given i never had to deal with it as bad on that platform a bit of lag here and there but not like xbox i guess based solely on hardware id say ps3 but definitely wish there was another option
its almost like ms might have changed its policies since then but we all know the world is a static universe so thats not possible
development cost explodes when making games for multiple platformsbut really who caresits a console fps a genre with a lifeexpectancy measured in weeksmonthsit will have marginal effect if any on eve its faltering is assured due to the above so integration will be superficial at best  dont see ccp intentionally wrecking their baby by making it a crucial partbesides ps are bigger than xbox in just about all markets except north america if the objective is to use it as an interactive advertisement for eve which i seriously suspect is the secret plan then going with ps makes sense as more people  more potential new customers
put it on the goddamned pc or shove the game up your collective asses ccp only advise i can give you its an outrage an insult and a kick in the face to your largest user base pc gamers
now that you mention it also console  younger average player age so it might indeed work as a transition to evedust is the most expensive eve ad ever cd
i was on the page for the ps3 video and i noticed something the dev that was answering the questions did not answer a single question that was raised about why it is not being a multiconsole game nor to a single eve player nice ccp to totally insult your true customer base i will even bet that ccp will protect the snot nose little 12 year olds by saying piracy or deliberate bombing of planets will not be allowed unless you are actively participating in the fight on the planet maybe but in eve space that belongs to the true gamer base i say lets put ccp on notice we will destroy any and all ships participating in the dust514 gameplay to put it short we show the little snots what being an eve pilot really is there are no rewards without the risk time to put those words to the test
ps3 rules x360 droolsthe x360 controller sucks anyway and kinect is a joke
e none of the above not interested in consoles
signedthey should also bring back faction fofs
bets added to google calender
heres my proposal which could potentially not only fix eve online but also ccpwithin ccp you make it a corp requirement on fridays to log into the game as an entire corporate entity and playyou can divide your corporation up by divisions and each division would represent corporations you then draw straws as to who gets to be in ccp alliance and ccp alliancedot  from here you then stage rvb style warfare where testing everything from gate camps one week to sov warfare the corporations need to maintain an income so things such as manufacturing and pos management become vital to your alliances survivalyou then alternate weeks from doing sisi warfare with your alliance to the next week focusing on tranq this way bugs and frustrations which the players see you will see as well
oh hell why not
i think many of ccps employees already play eve on unknown accounts what they need is their marketing directors accountants and the rest to play sure why not make it a whole party but heres the thing they have to start new accounts just like anyone elsethis means that multiple ccp employees are chosen by drawing straws to lead corporations in game they then buddy invite 20 people each from ccp and start corporations while going through rookie chat together these corporations should be unrecognizeable from any other with names chosen by the corp leader with whatever logo and ticker they can fashion from the corp system this should all be done while working full time at their respective jobs and for the most part outside of regular working hours they should also have to pay for the accounts and recieve no benefit for being a ccp employee they may already do that i have no ideafrom their they should have to work together and link up with the other ccp corps as they establish themselves they should also have to recruit nonccp members into their respective corps and make secondary and tertiary accounts as needed when one of them has the skills and isk to build an alliance then that will be alliance one also named as per the previous rules and the second will then be alliance 2 with similar requirementsthe alliances should then recruit both corps lead by other members of ccp and interested player corps this way both corps and alliances will be open to scams theft potential takeovers and the rest just like the rest of us and theyll have to deal with i wanna macroers toowarfare between corps initially is fair but between alliances will be too obvious later later the alliances should be required to work together to take over a section of 00 but not before they have had to fully testexplore highsec and delve into the reaches of lowsecin addition to this other members of ccp should be chosen to draw straws for who gets to randomly enter the game with no connections and experioence play that way these people should be of varying personality types like the corp leaders and be required to go it alone in game with no knowledge either way of the other ccp members corps and alliancesafter 1 year of play they should have some idea what its like to actually play this game from multiple perspectives each member should also have to draw randomly on starting race gender and ship faction for each and every character they create i like it
1 many ccp employees play eve online already  in fact there are various employees dedicated to playing the game like the gm staff and the various isd developers when major content or patches are released2 ccp owns three games not one and two are slated for launch in the next year to two yearsso eve is not the only focus in fact a dev answered in that answers thread that those two games are two of the three primary priorities at the corporation right now incarna is the third3 corporations in real life have a few people that test their product and draw a paycheckthe rest are building and maintaining said product if you spend your daily job building a game do you really want to spend your free time playing it a lot too see why 90 of barneys end up in jail by episode 204 if you review ccps history of patches fixes and content youll notice the company has a much higher turnout rate than most game companies while their expansions are not as large as most games few can claim as many and the sum of the parts make for a great game  one that you play5 eve online does not need fixing  the games population continues to grow not in accounts but players indicating the game is reaching more players but maintaining its veteran base as well see why aions current playerbase are all vets and nobody is leveling6 ccp is not broken as it has merged with another fantastic company is developing additional games maintaining a mmo at the same time and continues to grow as corporation both in fame fortune and friendsyour forum post could have been better spent actually informing them of what you want fixed as opposed to your here stop working on identified problems and look for more
personally i didnt suggest that ccp members play during work hours quite the opposite really i also didnt say they couldnt quit if they got bored or decided they didnt like it and i wasnt suggesting they play the game to identify bugs but rather to see what state the game is in and evaluate how that affects them and their interest in it there is plenty wrong with eve which i personally dont attribute soley to ship balance pos issues ui stuff or general bugs and glitches actually i dont really think for as diverse and sizeable as eve is that there is a great many bugs even the balance issues are rather small for all that people inflate their importance ships are actually fairly close to balanced now even if they are not really balanced for the diversity of player use of them fact is they are balanced by factional opposition rather than player use if everybody flew ships fit according to faction profiling for their faction in opposition of enemy factions it would work fine the pve balance doesnt help either given difficulty is determined assuming you spec for the faction you are opposing in each mission which means mission runners have to fit for specific resistance and dps where pvp players can invade their missions and take advantage of that foreknowledge griefer pvp always gets the tactical advantage in evethats not the issue though the issue is that eve is overrated and tired and needs new life breathed into it the majority of remaining players are bottersmacroers rmts griefers and nullsec herds and herdsman most highsec players that dont do industry or mining are in fact alts andor just interested in solo missioning or one of a few other tasks that they find time for without becoming to involvednew accounts are actually mostly rmts or rmt slavesworkers going back out to do what they were doing on a banned account yesterday with a few real newbs interspersed and some spyinfiltratoralt accounts started up by people who dont read the eula or ignore it or legitimately started as a new account those are relatively few compared to the majority but still populous their have been some mass influxes of new players but they actually mass exodused shortly after anyone who assumesthinks eve is growing is fooling themselves just because someone asks stupid questions in rookie chat doesnt mean they really are new so not only would ccp greatly benefit their own games population by doing this but they would have the feedback of all their various staff to consider laterwhat did you likewhat didnt you likewhat do you think we could be doing betteryou see
i suggest the last poster lacks imagination chances are most of you do i can catch any unprobeable ship probeable ship bubble immune ship cloaky ship or combination thereof not only that but i can completely blockade gates using current mechanics so that no one gets through or virtually no one maybe the very odd slippery individual will by chance get by but its not very likelyi would require a fleet of course to do any of this but i have figured it out and i know its possible and quite feasible no super caps requiredwhat you all are is scared of the unknown
for crying out loud csm  transcribed  reviewed  exchanged  agreed upon and published  its not that complicated with instant online communications you guys remind me of a monkey fcig a football please post in csm sites  news and rumor all over the place and deathly silence on the official forums we all realize csm does not read assembly hall because you know better than us but at least communicate with us on the official forums instead of 00 related sites and blogs
just finished my two subjects and submitted them the process works like thisat the summit every one of our sessions was recorded each of us chose a few sessions and are going through the video so we can make sure we didnt miss anything important that needs to be relayed we all write up descriptions of what was discussed and send it to the csm panel as a whole and also to ccp so it can be edited for anything nda breaking once everybody is ok with it being released csm for stylesubstance ccp for nda the entire minutes will be released
thought this idea was clever just looking to see what other people thinklet me first start by saying im far from a carebear that hauls goods around and ive been on both ends of the stick for this ive done my share of high sec jihadism and gotten blown up by it i love this mechanic of the game however i think if its reworked slightly it could liven up low secthe problemas it is now when carrying expensive cargo i feel much more at danger in highsec then low sec why is this my enemy in high sec will unlikely be attacked before he scans my cargo and says to himself thats worth him risking his sec status loss and 1030 mill ship to have a 5050 chance at winning my 100 million isk drop youd think lowsec would be exceedingly more dangerous as anyone can attack you since there is no concord as true as this may be  the gate guns are a lot more responsive then concord leaving you much less time to get it in if your gunna die and just being in lowsec allows other players to attack youf that im staying in high sec where i can hunt carebears peacfullythe proposed solutioncargo that has been dropped from a industrial transport freighter or jump freighter will be dropped in a cargo vault the vault is similar to a passworded can however anyone with the right hacking mod will be able to hack the cargo vaults secruity device and open the treasure chest for all its riches and bull doing so will result in being gccd to everyone from jita to nolm9 however it will not get concords attention the owner on the cargo vault will however be able to reobtain his loot with out consequencehow does this solve the problemfor starters having a escort in high sec will actually do you some good in the event you are killed your friends will be able to attempt to secure the can for you to come get itanyone attempting to take the can unlawfully will need equal protection as im sure there will be many angry people witnessing this event who want to avenge the random guy who was just blown upanyways im ranting ill leave this bull up to your imagination  let me know what you think 
i like the idea but instead of region too big too manageconsider being mayors of a constellation its smaller and more easily managed besides how does one get voted into being a mayor majority rule youll have major metagamming issues with that see mitani being voted into csm by all of goon
oh its this thread againthe penalties for ganking someone in highsec are good enough as is you do lose your ship and you take a standings hit why do people do it then because dumb people who want to carry absurd amounts of isk in unbuffered space trucks or people that want to gain in game resources while watching tv provide plenty of game that bring the gankers off the low sec gates into highsec as long as you arent the idiot doing that you probably wont be shot at
pirates gank anything and everything of value they can not just those that have  in their untanked hauler leaving jita on auto pilot because they forgot to read about what eve really isall im proposing is adding a little more favor to those on the ganked side rather then the opposite there comes a point when a gank becomes more then just a gank and cannot be retributed in high sec low sec is low sec no point in getting into an argument over that every action has a reaction butterfly effect here and as it stands ganked has no direct reaction except a loss of ship and sec but unless you are completely oblivious to how eve operates you know that fully going into that en devour thats going to happen so really tell me what repercussion is therelosing sec and ship is half the fun in it im just proposing there be a balance between the two and add something contributive to eve rather then something worthless
yep the company line is clearly they are doing this instead of working on ways to improve lag overall or let me propose an alternate theory to you this was an idea that was born of the team gridlock guys which we spotlighted and got put in the limelight theres a good chance this will be in our future as a feature and while nobody has ever claimed it will fix lag it will make the game playable instead of completely broken this is in addition to efforts being made to fix lag we think this is a good thing tm and worthy of coding effort instead of solely concentrating on just lag fixing efforts i mean what happens when people stuff 2000 dudes in a system 3000 you can fix lag but the playerbase will scale their efforts to take advantage of it id like for the game to at least still be playable if not slow when this happenswait was this a serious comment im responding to i hope i didnt respond to a troll
wormhole class 5 and 6s can be converted to handle a growing alliance no sov to worry with no hot dropping all that is needed is already way past due buffing of pos mods and uipos refinery buff take away the limiter of what can be refined at once bring the time per cycle way downindividual permissions for similar mods like chas and smasin this kind of enviroment a group can build the weapons and cordination against relatively same sized opponents and only be able to lock down that system with continued presence
that pos fixes updates and enhancing it adds value to every type of space not just wormholes and i do hope they improve that stuff for you folks with the guts to buy  build from possthats a pretty cool portion of the game that i think could really use improvingas for wh as the option  as you say and as its been adopted by the community  if you want riskrewards with out the bs of pucking up every time an alliance leader drops their drawers  wormholes are the answer all that political bunk that is the fun for sov holders takes a powder with these places they are nullsec for the small guys
10
all good and useful addition
bump
gallente combat recon bonuses suck split between missiles and hybrids focus on one like to others 
i agree that supercaps in general need some serious tweaking i agree with the idea that they should not be able to disappear with a log off for the most powerful fleet weapons in eve to disappear with a log off is game breaking you should have to find safe harbor and defend that harbor if you want to keep your super  doomsday weapons in service
i think that when the only counter to x is bring more of x then it needs to be reexamined it leads not only to stale gameplay but also a much less tactical environment
1made this character when i first started playing and i made female characters in all my games now im the opposite and prefer a more realistic representation of myself in games i am unable to do that currently but have been dying to at least change t
not supportedjust because you may not like the way the races look after they got buffed out doesnt mean you can change your ancestry changes to bloodline within a race makes even less sense as they completely different in looks  well with the exception of maybe civre and deteis  i think some of the traditional old school star trek fans really didnt like the way klingons looked after their makeover in 1979 but that didnt mean they werent klingon anymore most importantly changing anything permanent about your character can be exploited by players looking to lose their bad rep
option 3 dooooo eeeeeeet ccp
no nobrainer is nobrainerer
i just log on sisi and tried incarna the cq looked good but it still have lots of issuesterrible camera adjustmenttons of laggg you should focused on optimizationinflexible character movementwasd dont work fine you will stuck in corners easilyuse mouse to move just make things worse you will even lose camera control so plz give us an option to disable cq its just a waste of computer resources for me nowto be honest if dust514 just act like cq no doubt it will be an epic fail
i can understand your distaste with character selling but that isnt the point of this thread although you do realize youre actually advocating character selling right by starting a new character just for a new name what do think people will do with their skilledup old characters i dont know anyone who would throw away an asset like that just what side are you onreading comprehension your blatant ignoring of my debate shutting out of all arguments and emotional outbursts mean you might want to consider a bit of introspection if you can stomach the hypocrisy ill let you consider your own special adviceum anywaythere is another option changing the game for the better as eve continues to evolve so too should perceptions
argumentum ad hominum lets stay on topicnon sequitor and begging the question you are assuming the premise that eve will get better with this change yet that has very much yet to be shown and indeed what we are discussion here
what is it with all these silly harsh conditions i mean why there is no needjeez let people change their character name once per year flat fee 10 add and extra name change tab or add to employment history thats it job donewhy make it so difficult and also 50 are you serious
perhaps im guessing that there are a lot of rich griefers out there who would gladly pay to gank the crap out of you join your corp steal your isk change their name and hope you dont come looking for them histories wont work if the character search engine wont search for past names
i dont see why the guns need to be balanced wrt each other nor why hybrids need a distinct advantage over lasers or projectilesif they did it would buff gallente and caldari at the expense of the other races if we consider the big picture and secondary weapon systems of missles and drones and the buffs that these races have for them
if the only commonly used gallente ships are their droneboats and those droneboats prefer to fit projectiles or lasers even when given a small bonus to hybrids then theres probably something wrongi like the gist of the ops proposal right now the big bar to using hybrids in pve is their lack of versatility blasters are unable to hit anything outside of point blank range railguns poor tracking make them weak against small or close targets and the cap drain puts a big strain on the active armor tank most gallente ships are designed to use ill leave it to the pvpers to discuss whether this might make hybrid weapon platforms overpowered
hm okay then i am not against tweaking them if it makes them used more but i am against buffing them without gimping them somewhere else so as not to imbalance the total race weapon set so sure why not to making them unique so long as they dont become stronger or weaker net net than they currently arehow is the hard part i leave that for pvpers
the thing is that once upon a time lasers were so worthless that no one used them and fit projectile turrets to the ships that used lasers due to cap issues and ccp effectively stated that this was bad and lasers received a series of indirect buffs that made them the weapon to use so much so in fact that people started using lasers in place of projectiles because lasers could hit just as far as projectiles while doing more damage because of falloff mechanics once again ccp stepped in and said that this was bad and gave projectiles some buffs to compensate for falloff which have more or less balanced lasers with projectilesthe problem with hybrids isnt so much a problem with hybrids as it is the simple fact that hybrids were balanced against lasers that could only fire for a few cycles and couldnt scratch armor and projectiles that missed half the time the other weapon systems got buffs that they needed but hybrids have been left behindat least thats how i understand it
go ahead make a new disasterseriously horrible idea i too like a clean skill sheet but uninjecting only causes major often hidden problems like what will you do with skills that are prerequisites for other skills take caldari cruiser v for instance if i uninject it i can still fly my tengu but lo and behold what if i hadnt done caldari strategic cruiser v yet and wanted to get it to lv 5 oopsor worse what if people uninject skills and whatd ya know turns out half a year later they need the skill after all thats just a thousand annoying petitions waiting to happenso not supported
if you are just uninjecting 0 level skills and not getting a skill book back out of it then gamewise it should be fine at worse you may fuzz up the gui prerequisites tab in that it may still show you os instead of xs after you uninjected but thats just a gui glitch that should clear upbut on the other hand this also makes it about the most pointless exercise ever
cheerios chaoscould we get the no border client finally wo windowig to choose from it would be actually awesome compared to the rotten shark etc which was promised but never delivered guess due some tower problems as i can appreciate very much for fullscreen which works the best and windows that you can share across your multiwindow environement where you can do all the cool stuff like uhm mine and stuff while you are shooting at something that you do not like so please before you start the rampage to create new space barbie clothes do this cheers
fallacy affirming the consequent
summary so farproblem with just making it optionally shownpeople will read into reasons why you arent showing one standing or another which will lead to trust issues and god knows there are too many problems with trust in the game already we dont need another trust sinkbut i recognize that rpers need such information and although making rpers happy isnt a higher priority to ccp than closing an social exploit tool if they can be made happy without exposing the exploit then they shouldwhat about this make it available info in the limited api rpers will necessarily need to trust each other anyway and any legitimate access to standings information is used to garner trust in people you may not know that means you should have no qualms about giving them your limited api
ccp removing game elements so they can add different game elements without upgrading hardware nothey say avatars do not cause tq lag because its another serverso make standings on another server instead of removing them
also i have to click support so the csm can be sure they ignored another person
maybe you missed the whole part of the thread which talks about the problem and likely cause for standing removal was its use as a griefing tool
no i didnt miss your likely cause i just ignored it as its been a likely cause for 7 years but that it took over 11 seconds to access my standings page seemed much more problematic and hasnt been that way for 7 yearssorry for not expressly disagreeing with your premise i hereby expressly disagree with your premise
due to lag reasons they should just remove our ability to see our own standings
id actually like it if they made the subs more useful strictly from an extengu pilots perspective i have to agree that i usually ended up with a ship that looked funny because of the subs i needed ive also made tengu that looked pretty cool but unfotunately were not worth flying either because of an odd mix of subs or just because the subs are specd so poorly that there is no way anyone would be caught flying them i wouldnt mind if they swapped the sub appearance around honestly and made the cool ones the ones that people need but that doesnt really solve the whole every t3 looks the same problem that just boils down to nobody in their right mind will use any other sub combination than those particular 2 or 3 they really are the only ones that work everything else is a just flying board waiting to be nailed
id also like to have the option of choosing the shape of the wingy bit on my tempest i think octagon is in any argument for arbitrarily changing the look of a ship just because you want it that way is so wrong i dont really know where to start as the more practical reasons have already been covered by my esteemed colleagues ill go with the story argument a shield subsystem just looks like that if you dont like it dont install one you cant change its looks unless you have a degree in starship engineering and want to risk damaging its structural nano fiber whatzits and even then if your engineer isnt named geordi laforge then your chance of blowing up your warp core is 20 per jump
yeah especially the almost always needed dissolution sequencer looks a bit wonky so maybe ccp just needs to do a small design overhaul at some point no biggie thoughand while theyre at it can i have my much craved for sleeper piano black hull please thatd be awesome 
well the positive side to my idea is that while you may not be able to guess the config of an enemy by looking at his t3 he cant guess yours either
supported but not for the aesthetics reasons op cited it is far too easy to tell a t3s capabilities just by looking at it it has huge impact on nonblob pvp and defeats one aspect of t3s advantage in versatility
okay lets instead put 510 of empirespace insurance payments as a bounty on the killers head if he was the aggressor outside wars
i think what we have discovered here is what happens in a world without law and orderwho would have though that those grade 10 history teachers were right for a country to function there must be an executive legislative and judiciary branches of government we live in a world without an investigative branch of policing and no lawyers for all those who thought that the world would be better off without lawyers i suppose now you know exactly what the world will be like  trust is a commodity add to this the ability for people to use alts and you really have a tough problem brokering trust
the issue is that low sec has become like 00 all the 00 alliances that have left or been removed have gone to low sec which itself has become blobby and supercap crazy as well there is quite a few alliances and corp i know that have a good deal of supercaps and this is the issue do oyu think having a better bounty system is going to encourage people to look for them when they can get super hotdropped not reallyalso i personally have hunted pirates and you know what they are either camping with a gang or you cant find them you also have to remember most pirates will also use a scout on the otherside of the gate they are camping and use ninja spots so even if you do look for them they see you coming before you even jump so the advantage is much for thembounty system will do nothing to help1 remove the use of caps in low sec apart from travel2 perhaps lower the number of low sec systems to encourage people to live closer thus more conflict and chance to find them3 then perhaps look at bounty system still not sure it helps as people can hire mercs anywayanother problem is that alot of space is not populated we have travelled 100 jumps and not really seen anything maybe the odd one person or so again because people see you before you see themthis was suggested before remove local or remove gates to combat this there seems to be a big support for removing local whether ccp listens is another thing
the problem with the bounty system is that it can be gamed same with the mercs far hire there needs to be some regulatory body and formal system similar to what contracts did to ensure people follow through on commitmentsi havent yet had time to think about your cap gimp points though but i think reducing low sec systems is a nonstarter
yes this is a very simple solution and imo would solve a lot of low sec00 problemsno need to invent new stuff or overbuff low sec00 to make them work the quality of ore would need to be reduced a lot in high sec so large scale manufacturing wouldnt be possible there it would only be a learning ground
its not a learning ground it should be the home to people who dont want to fight all the time the carebears thinking that it is just a noob learning ground is a slippery slope especially when its a large chunk of the galaxy thinking that it cannot have any good ore is also strange i mean if the ore was so good in lowsec dont you think that the empires would make it highsec by stamping out the lawlessness there and claiming it from the pirates and have concord patrol there toofact of the matter is lowsec is supposed to be a fringe territory of scoundrels smugglers and the underworld if you want to buff anything in lowsec to make it lucrative for players to live there it must follow this theme so make a free drugbooster zones make it free slave trafficking zones if you make boosters produceable there it will become what it was meant to be a gateway between null and highsec where people from both those places can meet in between and do business with each other maybe start up illegal gambling side games that only run in lowsec stations like eve poker and high stakes sabaac in fact the casino idea can have a lot of possibilitiesas for slave trading why not have a marketplace for selling alts in story it will be equivalent to selling slaves or biomass also remember in lowsec isk can buy you anything maybe have agents that can fix your security rating for cash or allow you to install jump clones just for a fee

low sec is very quiet and barren beyond the border systems and hubs what gives you lots of space to do plexing and other stuff relative easy and undisturbed there is nothing wrong with this form the perspective of people that live thereif you want quick and easy pvp stick to the hubs and border systems if you want to catch non  fitted rattersplexers or looking for solo pvp while you try to evade bigger gangs check out the deeper systems the reason why you have issues catching this people there is that they will be not the random empire guy jumping into 04 and warping to the top belt what you will find are also people that are regular in low sec and most of them know how to not get killed by the first roaming ship passing by

better yetbuild a pile of tech 1 cheap throw away cyno frigsproblem solved
wouldnt it be nice if you could deploy a cyno without using an alt
id like to see moon goo to be a limited resource and that it can be mined out not the limitless isk tap we have now it should take 3 months to remove all the resources from a moononce all the techdysproinsert and goo here has been mined from a moon another moon goo resource is placed somewhere else in eve this would have an impact on rmting as the moons will be distributed throughout the universemay spark border wars over newly aquired moon materials with your neighbourswill also make people have to rescan moons in their region on an ongoing basis smaller entities may be able to hold the valuable moons without having a 100 super capital blob as backup
nc qq thread ftw 
not so sold on the randomize resources idea if only we had that magic quantum reality changing device america could have used it to make all the middle eastern oil deposits appear under californiaseriously though if people knew that resources were going to rerandomize every x months then it would cause a serious disruption in the activity of an alliance not to mention the most obvious negative effect of this why bother building up infrastructure or investing any isk in a system if you arent sure you are going to get at least a certain return on its value in fact why bother even fight wars at all if the strategic value of systems would randomly shuffle about every x cycle what will end up happening is that you may just end up sitting and waiting for next cycles reshuffle this will cause the exact opposite effect to occur that you intended no body will fight any wars for resources anymore peace will reign throughout the galaxy utopia realized and with it boredom and everyone will just stop playing okay i embellished the last bit a tad
then need nwew mechanics how allainces and corp wil resive soem isk for all reinbursments etc sov holdings etc big projects taxes defently not inafah forgot suopt tech treat 
new idea lets add a random moon resources with limited avaibility in wh itwill make wh more interesting and of cource make more sense for capturing wh
i have just logged in to the singularity server to have a look at the shiny new station environment when i noticed something very unnervingmale and femaleonly clothingis this what eve is coming to old fashioned stereotypes not to mention that it doesnt fit in with the backstory of a futuristic progressive society i was rather hoping ccp were past this neanderthal attitude please remove gender factors from the upcoming expansion and lets have an enjoyable summer patch
wow shut up if you dont like it quit
lol unnerving how dramatic considering that eve is a spaceship game i dont want to see one extra second of dev time wasted on clothing that works well enough as it isim sure that chaps and ballgags and hooker boots are available with other gamesnot supported
if this game were made 20000 years in the future id agree with you but the game is marketed at todays culture and they want clothes that make themlook fabulous
they answered that some time ago  nothing to do with ethic its a graphism issuethey need clothes that fit the body and clothes of the other gender wont and they dont have time for thatand here i must agree with them
we all know bots are ratting happily in 00 235 hours a day and raking in billions of bounties a daywhy not remove the bounties on all npcs in all regions including missions you will have to increase isk payouts for missions to compensateto compensate the null sec players who rat for their income allow the introduction of agents in player owned stationsto install an agent in your station you need to upgrade the system similar to pirate detection arrays are now the higher you have the index the higher the agent you will attract with the possibility of having level 5 agents in your spaceall members of the alliance who holds the outpost gain access to their agents
then ratting bots will be replaced by missioning bots which already exist
that wil braek corps to they will nto resive ney mo0ney form taxesetc
there are tons of bots out in dronespace they dont have bounties there already this wouldnt stop bots at all
contrary to the popular belief the only effective antibot tool is ccps banhammer effectivnes of the banhammer is whole another storychanging gameplay because of bots is a sign of a lost battle against them
only in the form of courier missions there is one with a mining mission feature i doubt anyone uses it though currently there are no combat mission capable botting programs youd think theyd have one by now but they dont
lolsomeone else might believe you but not me 
bump on an important topic needs more thumbs up guys try and think of the player and not trolling please
not suportedthen move out befor go away but eny way if you not participated to defend your space you need lose everting incloding all that  wath you had there in station i even not understand way ccp still not made that if station is concured all lot wat its tere gets a winer so ro say all pernoal  gos to winner afcors ned give soem time to retake the station to but this can be a motivating ting to ppl go defend all tyhos structures if tey will lose it so they lose evertining wath its there inside for now ppl not care soem one ataks soem stupid st6ation its boring i will not go to defend it vbut if hiss wallets wuld be on stake they will be pused to go and defend it  here can even bring soem damge modifiactor so to say if station taked givep pl 2 weeks to retake station and new owner to hold it so long then so to say half of inside items get damged half gos to winner
sorry not supportedi see this like the allow name changes or uninjecting skills or other champagne wishes and caviar dreams proposalssorry that an aspect of the game doesnt please you
oh and just because i like you better than you ill actually throw in a reason you and your alliance track down a bastard who stole 1 billion isk from your corp wallet cornered his ship in a dead end constellation you set up 237 watches and afk cloakers to keep watch on the gates3 weeks later he surfaces in jita somehow he sneaked past your blockade hmm drats does that seem fair  argumentum ad absurdum
not supportedyour problem was caused by poor planning on your part not poor game mechanics
actually its eve i dont know this eve you spoke ofalso getting out of hostile territory has become a rite of passage for returning players the first challenge they must overcome denied
needs punctuation spelling and grammar this post gets an f
any one agree with that
i was reading about this process in this thread url
you are misstaking leverage with margin tradingleverage is when you can multiply profitlosses by spending broker money and only fraction of yourswith margin trading you cant loose more than you gambled becouse you cant win more than you gambled simply because you dont borrow any money with it you just setup buy order that you need to have money for in your wallet to complete you in no way decrease the amount of money you have to spend in order to acquire goods you just reduce amount of frozen funds and postpone payment to the moment of closing of contract
thisnot a loan the most you can call it on is a dishonest intention to buy akin to flashing orders on the market which is not technically illegal btw at least on the tse though it is frowned upon failure to complete an order may result in temporary suspension of your exchange trading license maybe penalize the number of orders that the trader can hold temporarily for each consecutive infraction 5 orders after the 3rd infraction 10 at 5 infractions etc etcno to negative wallet balances as mentioned many times already it can and will be gamednegative wallet balance toss toon to the biomass heap start up a new toon isk is now sunk out of the economy there unfortunately isnt a repro business in eve heck wed have to start with a banking system first then credit rating agencies etc etc you take for granted how many necessary agencies that we need in rl to get around problems like this
you havent even read the description of the skillopening your own thread to make a comment to a reply on another thread ftw
despite some slight misconception on ops part i do support removing margain trading for the simple reason that it does not work unlike irl due to an important difference i personally knew someone who was given jail sentence for a scheme partially involving margin trading it was suspended but he was still ruined financially and otherwise there is no such consequences in eve which is what led to all runaway scams that clog up market screen it was a concept that would never have worked in game to begin with not all things that work irl makes viable game mechanics
really im sure every destroyer that has pulled a battlecruiser out of warp may beg to differ but you were joking and i appreciate the comedic relief in what was getting to be a stoic crowd 
a fair fight in eve means you did something wrong
correctiona fair fight by choice in eve means you did something wrong
meet up with the other guy in an npc 00 system anchor t2 large bubbles on all the gates with a hauler undock in combat ships duke it out done
pretty much the idea is the more rr the less effective the rr becomes like adding on 4 photon hardners or 5 mag stabsthe most you should recieve before there is no point to anymore reps should be about 6 after that there would be no point in rr as it would not add more then maybe 1 hp per cyclethis could be an interesting way to break up sc fleets as they would no longer be impenetrable and would make drake fleets less ftomwhat do you guys thinkyeah with me
yes i support this idea
and so you break the rr chain of your opponent by using dessies with small rr to max out their rr allowance
hmmm good pointmake it stackable by size so only 6 medium or 6 large or 6 capital that way you cant go in with small rr to break the turtle but then again small rr is pretty limited in range so it might just be worth having that as an effect go in close its easy to kill you
please check out my similar proposal tactical overview option for solosmall gangs ship velocity vectorsits basically the same but for all ships with overview rules for who wants it not to steal support from your idea but who likes this one probably likes also mine cheers
1i did propose at one time a more advanced version which included more controls for actually piloting your ship still taking the 1hz server tick and all but that thread died so 1 to this
support this topic
yep at least buff guristas to angel lvl
i thought that angel ships are based on jovian designs makes sense that they should be superior to all other ships of the same classwhy do they need a nerf any reason besides i think they are way too strongif you dont like how you keep losing frigate pvp to one why dont you get one yourself i heard that the drake is the hands down the best battlecrusier you can get would anyone think think it fair game to give other races bcs a buff so that they can fight on equal ground
the most i would support is a removal of drones
to balance the dram you just need to axe the drone bay or reduce the speed down to around 36kms mwd without any other speed mods it would still be an amazing ship just not so much of the iwin button that it is atmps fix the phantasm it is just junk atm i also think the ashimu is junk but corpies of mine dont agree
realid isnt a bad idea actually not real id but consistent id across accounts some kind of identifying upc for all accounts to identify them as yours that carries over to the forum threads like this it would still be dependent on upfront honesty when accounts are createdidd but it would automatically match across all alts on one account at the very least
i used to think twice all the time as i dont really have any alts or generally not for long as im simply playing with the character creator or making a funny alt for a single completely irrelevent post for a laugh not sure if anybody has actually got it when ive done that but i dont suppose it matters either and it really doesntnow i get that little spark of oh no i cant believe im doing this and post anyway fully willing to accept the consequences if they ever come fact is quite possibly they have already but eve is such that you wouldnt really know if they did as it wouldnt actually appear an different unless of course someone actually raged on you about some silly forum post or comment before podding you for the 4th timethats actually why i dont care and blithely insult people or call them out on these forums because i know it really wont change anything theyd do it anyway and repeatedly if they could so in game consequences are not really of any concern to me out of game well thats bad and a possibility given the assortment of unusual individuals on the internet wouldnt recommend it though besides they usually crassly insult me long before i actually take offense to them sometimes days depending on how long it takes me to read their post i try not to really offend people anyway though i understand its not really possible to avoid at times i also dont run scams or troll or flame others even going so far as to try and take some though with most of what people say sometimes i dont bother and dont post futanari sex in stations etc why bother most of it disgusts me and i couldnt possibly join in or have anything nice or unbiased to say ill admit for all that i could really only get through half a page of the most recent not everybody is that bad and some just jokingly go about it thats fine its the others that make me sickanyway have fun
guys i got scammed by thesameguy with three of his toons nerf it
i think its fine to only let one character per account post especially when it comes to forum voting i have two characters even though my newer character is on my second account i still think of her as an alt p sapph
not supported in the forum is already too less moderation and too much flaming and insulting to findie just see the arguments pvp vs pve or vice versa x demands more easy killings by high sec nerfs y demands more rights to carebears like higher standing loss for ganker needing to post with the real name would mean to transfer the flaming and harassment into the gamei agree that the forum needs alot more active tending to but this can be done only by more moderation in the forums starting with enforcing netiquette by moderators and for example banning forum trolls whole account from the game itself like for 3 days same goes for insults and flaming
there is a thing called a warp disruptorif you are playing can flipping games at a station ffs show some intelligence and put the can out of docking range
i dont think you understand what the op is saying they aint playing can flipping they are shooting people at station or when they undock i think this sounds like jita 44 scenario many ppl undocking war target gets hit ninja looters stay at station ninja the loot dock up instantlyi have to agree though you have agression you should have a docking timer
and what exactly keeps you from having a friend sit by the station with an indy picking up the loot immediately after you pop your prey and before a ninja looter doessorry i dont really see a loop hole here i just hear op is complaining about the current mechanics of the system makes it harder for him to claim loot if he ambushes prey when they exit the station ambush you know something ninjas do to their victims so one form of ninjaing is okay but another isnt maybe the victims of station camping should petition windows or scanners to be put into the station so that they can look outside before choosing to undock to make sure unfriendies arent campingseriously though you cant change this whole aggression docking mechanic just because this one lone case inconveniences you if you did then that would gimp legitamate lootingand if you want to make looting a nondockable aggro then what about corporate theft  when a corp spy empties out your corp wallet see its a slippery slopeif the looter irritates you so much declare war on them then ambush him when he comes out of the station to loot 
step 1 locate target while cloakedstep 2 align to target and close to 4035 km at full speedstep 3 uncloak and fire bomb launcherstep 4 gtfo and cloakstep 5 step 6 profitoneoneone1111ps note i didnt say target the shipship is unaware of your presence until its too lateps2 your doing it wrongps3 you do know the bomb has a 15km blast radius right
cant wait for the videos then
i hope you can since they will never ever be released nda if the content of the summit could be released i wouldnt have had to do up all those words writing minutes thats why the minutes have to be scrubbed by ccp to make sure nothing nda gets through
no this basically will basically make it so people keep killing each other until the original owner returns way to much in the way of the carebear here
yes the idea is for people to engage each other if your going to suidcide someone it needs to actually be well planned with a exit strat the carebear is given a reasonable window of oppurtunity to get his stuff back and the attckers actually have to commit some assets and skill to do a successfull gankas it is now the gankers take little to no risk they can sit on a gate all day waiting without taking any risk they risk sec status and a minimal amount of isk
so now we wait for full minutes any exact eta
nope every csm took a few topics and are writing up minutes as their spare time permits id say were nearing the end of the write minutes portion and will be moving fully into the ccp checks for nda portion shortly
taking more than a week to put together five paragraphs on each of three three hour sessions isnt very impressive and falls way below our expectations 
i just log on sisi and tried incarna the cq looked good but it still have lots of issuesterrible camera adjustmenttons of laggg you should focused on optimizationinflexible character movementwasd dont work fine you will stuck in corners easilyuse mouse to move just make things worse you will even lose camera control so plz give us an option to disable cq its just a waste of computer resources for me nowto be honest if dust514 just act like cq no doubt it will be an epic fail
which of these best describes your reasona because more people took part in the voting than in previous years b because i dont like who wonc most people are realising that csm wont give them a free tengud because everyone i speak to hates these guys that won by majority of eve player votes

should have been made years ago
im not sure about this one to be honest if there is a problem with suicide ganking i dont think its with insurance insurance for suicide gankers is unrealistic insurance for 95 of other payout situations is also unrealistic a cut in suicide insurance wouldnt really affect thrasher suicide gangs which cost 600k a pop in those cases the main costs are both getting the pilots into position for the gank and either grinding back the security standings or training up a new throwaway suicide altid rather this get looked at from a ship design point of viewdo hulks and subfreighter sized haulers need more durability relative to their cost someone else said prevention involves not making yourself an appealing target is this even possible if youre flying a hulk its a ship that costs 180 million and can only be insured for a fraction of this amount itd be almost pointless not to put t2 fittings on it and its nearly impossible to get it above 22k effective healthdo thrashers and whatever battleships get used for suicide ganks have too much alpha damage for their costare there too few defences available to the suicide gankee again for a hulk pilot is he supposed to warp out every time he sees someone appear in local in crowded highsecare there insufficient penalties or risks for the gankers even if they miscalculate and fail to pop their target their looter will be able to strip all the wrecks long before the target can do so and any kill rights the target gets are probably worthless if theyre not tradeable even if they were tradeable what if a throwaway alt was used i suppose the removal of insurance payout would help here
with regards to making nullsec more independent of jita has anyone thought of revamping or augmenting alchemy as i understand it alchemy currently allows you to create r64 goo out of r32r16 goo at a lower efficiency than moonmining with the last moongoo rebalance i doubt anyone does it though how about making it possible to synthesize r32 and r16 and r64 reaction products out of a combination of minerals ice products pi gasses r8 and maybe r16 goo this along with a tech rebalance should both break up the goo cartels and allow the various other nullsec alliances to at create limited amounts of goo they cant moonmine for corpalliance use corp alchemy operations should allow t2 manufacturing in nullsec to become more common while also creating nullsec markets and sources of player income for various things that are currently mostly ignored or exported of course this would also cause more towers to be anchored and available for shooting which of course would create a market for replacement towers   comments are welcome
no
cosmetic only
nogive us the possibility to create clothes ship skins etc maybe under approbation of ccp that would enhance creativity and role playing immensely
i like the custom ship skins idea but if people can change it at will without any real world cost it will be abused
i qoute ccp shadow from the ps3 blog on dust514hi vorlord dust 514 wont have a monthly subscription like a number of mmos dust 514 will have virtual goods sales though that allow you to buy various types of gear used in combathey shoryukenllyouve asked a few things i cant delve too deeply into but what i can comment on is what you said about virtual items and real money dust 514 will support purchases made through both ingame earned currency and real money currencyhmmmmm dust514 is supposed to be tied into our eve universe so now  for game changing items is one step closer
no
noi will never support microtransactions in a submission based game
nerf ehp so 100 sieged dreads can one shot alpha kill a super carrier
ccp plan to nerf them anyway so why not
question i can see how these nerfs would be useful and they make sensebutyoure also trying to bring dreads back from being obsolete explain how these nerfs help out dreads the only change i see that helps some is the reduction in fb dps meaning a dread might compete if these changes arent going to improve dreads any then we need to also be looking at ways to buffchange dreads such that they arent obsolete anymore the main problem i see with supers is their only counter is more superswhich is highly unusual in any game i like the ideas for reduction of drone capacityehp so that supers could be made toothless with a wellbuilt enemy fleet of subcaps
i do not support this nerf at alli am a capital and supercarrier pilot as many other pilots here have stated supercapitals cost a huge amount of isks billions not forgetting that the fit often costs even more than the ship itself as was said by ccp at fanfest 2011 supercarriers are meant to be super and the financial investment and time that many players have dedicated ingame in order to own and fly a supercarrier must be protected by giving us the ability to indeed field those powerful ships and to be able to leave the field as well the vast majority of those who want this nerf are pilots who just hate supers simply because they either cannot afford them or they just ruin their killing game supers are destroyed every day in eve they can still be obliterated why should a simple fleet of tiny ships that cost very small sums of isks be able to take down a ship worth billionsi am totally against it
pretty confident this is a troll but o welllets imagine a ship that costs 1trillianit is indestructiblecan insta pop anythinghas 0 signature radiusand goes 30kms with perfect agilitybut its fine cos it costs 1 trillion so why should anything be able to kill it yerto create balance cost effectiveness should always go down as price increases otherwise you just have the standard tier issues where everything beneath the top tier is uselessimo to balance super caps you need a combination of a lot of the ideas already posted in this threadi would say5 drone limit but 3 per dcu make dcu passiveseparate drone bay for fightersfbs and regular dronesslaves no longer work in combination with supercapsthis makes them pick between dps and survivability modsmeans they cant release endless swarms of dronesslightly reduces the obscene ehpbalances the armour supers more with the shield supers
optional is best for role play her is why we pilots are operating our ships from an egg of ectoplasm and are hooked up to our ships through a neural socket many of our station dockings are merely to unload cargo or to escape danger for short periods of time in role play you certainly would not be exiting your egg for such reasons i think the captains quarters could enhance role play but only if done realistically from the perspective of the capsuleer pilot captains quarters is a sort of end of daybeginning of day thing so to speak it should be optional and in control of the pilot
having it optional is fine but it cant be optional just because of preference in gui there should be things that you can do in cq that you cannot do in the pod hanger interact with station people in a pub take part in station poker games buy vanity items for your clone these you need to decant foryou can choose to stay in your pod if you are just waiting out a aggro timer for instance
its more like were attempting to work out the issues name changes would cause and thus provide a solid coherent plausible proposal the fee is there to make name changing inefficient and less abused since there are already many nefarious avenues that are used more efficiently even now although all points are certainly debatable
ill give it a try although i welcome you to provide me with more specifics like who are you looking for if its a target that can legally kill you it would be more advisable to scroll through looking for reds like youd do anywayif it is a suicide ganker its to lateif its local spam throwawayalts are the way they go anyway thats why there is a fee to make it inefficient to do soand i guess i havent been clear im assuming proposing standings will transfer since this is about name changesi was just using your words why cut out the 60k nowgood point on the search function if i led this thread id add that to the opening post but as for the rest its the same old stuffganking isnt worth it if you consider the fee there are a more efficient ways to do so currently in gameif your corp recruiter cant be bothered to check their history they deserve it with low standards like that even a throwawayalt would get byif you dont care enough about your losses to hunt them down i cant motivate you eitherbut then again you havent responded to most of my arguements the aka thread while ive been nothing but compliant so ill give you some of my latin u mad bro
first off let me thank you for your intelligent and thought out answers its obvious you are someone who actually thinks something thru before posting it and that is commendablesecond im not a bro nor am i mad its just that time of the monthand i have not left any of your points unanswered that i am aware of if i havent responded to point x its either because somebody already did and i agreed with her point or i agreed with your point to begin with please enlighten me of any such holes that i have allegedly leftwho would i be looking for corp theives corp recruiters will see histories but exactly where in the history would it show that someone stole from what a recruiter would have to look up their past names and then do what exactly i suppose a ganker would have his killboards shown but a loot or corp thief wont show so you need some sort of global record keeping of past criminal names and allow people to register complaints on people who have wronged them etc etc im already reeling in the amount of work this change will require to be done rightwhat about the person who ganked you when you were a noob now you want to deliver payback 1 year later how would you find him would ccp have to buff out the character search query server and start adding new hardware
at the end of the day i would love to have this feature as well heck i spelled my name wrong but i am living with ithowever one of the fundamental tantamount basis in eve is that your choices have consequences and that you can exact revenge on those who wronged you as seen in countless marketing trailers no change in the game can ever threaten that god given basic right of any player in the game even if it is still possible to track peoples histories if the change makes it harder read more work to find and exact your god given right of revenge on them then i many on these threads and ccp will say noespecially as those who really really want to change their name is in the great minority
i didnt ignore your side of the debate and i had no emotional outbursts my statements still stands on firm legs also no as eve continues to be assaulted with moronic childrens attitudes brought up by parents who award trophies for last place my perceptions will remain the same because my perceptions are based on something different than yours logiceabodflummox
havent seen any good arguments against this other than neutral rr is creative mechanics were so clever andlogistics pilots spent time and effort learning to be neutral reppers its not fair to nerf them so i think its a good change
yeah ive no idea why theres no drone implants would be so nice to have
okay that sounds reasonable but can anyone point to some hard as in qen numbers on the percentage of gallente ships fitting projectiles instead of railsas i said i am all for it so long as play balance is not disturbed it is very dangerous to think that you can buff 1 weapon system without affecting many other things buff it too much and maybe minmatars will start using hybrids instead of projectileswhich is why im all for making them have a unique capability not a buff a unique feature that should complement dronespurely as as example if you give them excellent tracking at long range like lasers then maybe make them do less damage but also take less cap than lasers but faster cycletimeremember tactical balance is such a volatile thing all it takes is the ability for say a common ship like the megathron to be able to field 1 more hybrid due to tweaked cap use or increase their dps a bit due to increased dps for everyone to stop complaining that the hybrid system in its entirety is gimped im citing completely hypothetical situations i have never flown a gallente shipi defer to the experts
as the good doctor pointed out in his devblog i dont think they have that kind of granularity what they do see is tens of thousands of railgun modules being produced but that isnt because anyone is using them its because theyre being used for mineral compression to move resources mined in hisec out to null perhaps everyone was just looking at manufacturing and industry stats and thinking everything was fineother than highlighting how broken mining and industry in nullsec must be in order to make exporting common ores preferential to actually mining them in situ it also seriously skews many other figureswhat is interesting is that there is no gallente vessel in the top10 this quarter a trend that will be continuing until they are redesigned from the ground up in fact the only gallente vessel that outstrips other races by a significant margin appears to be the nyx mostly for aesthetic reasons  certainly not functional ones since almost every alliance will tell you to fly an aeon instead

i would love to hear what the csm has to say about the mt issue especially considering the quotes and links i will provide belowcsm look at all the threads regarding mt look at the 52 page threadnaught in response to the dev blog on mt look at the thread in this forum where almost 80 of the responders dont want mt at all the eve community needs you to be our voice i qoute ccp shadow from the ps3 blog on dust514hi vorlord dust 514 wont have a monthly subscription like a number of mmos dust 514 will have virtual goods sales though that allow you to buy various types of gear used in combathey shoryukenllyouve asked a few things i cant delve too deeply into but what i can comment on is what you said about virtual items and real money dust 514 will support purchases made through both ingame earned currency and real money currencyhmmmmm dust514 is supposed to be tied into our eve universe so now  for game changing items is one step closer
plex
i agree been a problem since they started it however plex as it stands doesnt allow you to buy game altering items the day you start playing some will say that selling plex lets you buy high sp characters mother ships titans and fancy deadspace gear but even if you do that in this game it takes more then a few  to buy an understanding of how they are truely usedallowing  to out right buy an advantage in eve has been something that ccp has stated they dont want for our game hence keeping mt limited to vanity items the tie in with dust 514 and the ability to unwrap the game throw it in your ps3 get your visa out buy upgraded items and use those upgraded items to effect 00 sov mechanics is exactly what is going to happen the opposite of what ccp has told us so we now have two messages from ccp that are the polar opposites of each other what is going to happen only time will tell until then the only thing i can do is share my concerns
a little premature to start complaining about dust as we have zero information as to how it will integrate with evethey will never be able to hold space obviously so the space ship part is probably still going to be the deciding factori dont see mercs can be anything more than a positive modifier to regular invasions as ccp will have to insulate eve to some degree as the console fps is the mayfly of the gaming industry
not complaining about dust tbh its the idea that ccp will allow advatages to be purchased with  and that it will cross over into eve weve introduced mechanics allowing people to manufacture goods on the planets but planets will play a more pivotal role in sovereignty mechanics further down the line this is the statement that ccp made that concerns me the most every player in 00 needs to really start thinking about what this could meanallowing rl  to purchase an advantage in dust will cross into our sov mechanics at some point how big will the impact be i dont even think ccp knows yet how they are going to change sov mechanicsthe one question that i am afraid to hear the answer to ishow long before ccp allows more then vanity item mt in eve
honestly this seems like an attempt to balance the eve players giving their dust character a pattycake mission for a gazillion isk prize so they can instantly deck out their dust character that had been my biggest concern when i first heard about dust we can only wait to see the mechanics because were really working only on conjecture right now
80 of the responders in that threadnaught make up about 002 of all eve residents dont pretend that its the majority of capsuleersbesides im afraid this is happening no matter what so you can either go down with the threadnaught or accept it and move on
fyi it wasnt my premise i heard somebody else said it and just because your 1 case of lag for you that happened doesnt go to prove anything in fact the only thing it proves is that maybe lag is a problem so i dont see why you were saying that the lag shouldnt exist because its done on a different server anyway lets say that even if the griefing tool is only 50 of the reason and the other 50 is lag um then why do you think that it should be brought back just for rping reasons personally and its maybe just me but i think that the priorities for a game mechanic should be1 no lag2 no griefer intel3 role playing
lets noti dont think it should be brought backi think it should never have been taken away
i never saw a reason for this info to be public at best it should be optional to display standings like the display of medals and certificates are
while i can see the use of removing it so other players cant track where youve been hanging out a loti would like to know which faction is on what standing with which other faction in eve like thef act the minmatar like the thukkers but hate the angels and the amarr empiresure i know most of it by heart but for a newbie its very usefull information not to mention to the vet who does missions and wants to keep his standing with certain factions intactfor instance you get offered a mission against the thukkers youre a noob and you run missions for minmatar and say caldari the caldari agent offers you an antithukker mission the noob things hey its not empire faciton kill only to find out that messing with the thukkers messes with his minmatar standing toobeing able to see this among npc corps and factions whos who is kinda important
see there you go not only does my idea let you choose the appearance of your ship despite your subsystem chice it keeps your opponent from know what systems youre using
no if that is what you want then you should just remove all appearance changes in t3 ships so there is no possibility in knowing what they are fitting but that is probably the whole reason ccp made it that way in the first place you think they did it just to be ccoland no 1 alt supporting does not a good proposal make
do you fly t3
eperor please can you run your posts through a spell checker i think you do have a lot of good things to say but i am finding too difficult to understand youat all
thisnot a lot of resources so null is still the best place but a small amount to prevent complete resource blocks
that may work but lets see some stats on the distributions is this magic gold only found in a certain region of space
tech needs a correction imo needs it badly and there are a couple of ways this can be done first and foremost the advanced materials t2 component contents would have to be changed again to remove the dependence on tech the second way to balance it might be to rethink alchemy allowing alchemy of r32 reaction products and perhaps even r16 in addition to those involving r64 goo allowing alchemy of those materials would also go a good way towards permanently breaking moon goo cartels while probably stimulating moon mining and lowsec poskeeping in general as well while creating new targets to go after to help keep pos keepers sane a reduction in cpu and grid use of reactors and related item might be a good thing as wellcomments are welcome
bumping this one back to the top as there is another fix wardec thread which is that wardeking should cost morei think that this proposal mixed with that one may be viablemake it cost more for subsequent nonmutual wardeks the lower the avg standing of the members of the corp areso if the avg of the members of the corp is a 5 secstatus then it costs them a lot more to wardek than a positive standing corpwhat this does1 encourages more legitamate wars and makes it harder for griefer corps to use wardeking to just prey on innocents without secstatus penalty2 griefers will be forced to grind standings back up after a cycle of mindless killing allowing the carebear industry to recoverthis mechanic will force a break in the contiuous sequence of wardeking it will encourage even pvpers to be more positive in standing over all as it costs their corp more which will make corp ceos encourage members to have not too low standings so that they can continue their pvping activitiesadd an exponential decay to the corp avg standing dont publicize the formula this will keep ceos from dropping low sec members before a war just to reduce their costs only to add them back again after it is paid
make it cost more you serious it already costs a sily amount if you dec 4 alliances your looking at a huge weekly billthis is not low sec you cant putting sec status hits on war deccers lol whats the point they pay crap loads of isk for the dec they could actually lose there is nothing stopping the other side shooting back you knowand then no one will ever do war decs it will just kill it completelyyes i think 2 mill for a corp to dec a corp is cheap and perhaps that should be the same as 50 mill alliance decbut leave the alliance bills alone its can cost billions for just one week yes its only one week for god sake lolseriously this has got to be a whine thread cos someone decced youfight backhowever there could be some options rather than sec hit thats for pirates1 i believe high should be safe so war decs should only be performed in low sec this way low sec gets busier and ppl will have to look for targets however then jump frieghters should then be like other caps low sec only  you then have to move your stuff from low to high in a freighter so it still gives and element of risk and something the war deccers can hit as well so it benefits both sides to some extent
an element of danger by protecting highsec residents coolbtw ccp nerfed 90 of 00 space because theres too much isk in the system stuff should be blown up more often
no
wardecs arent perfect but this isnt the way to fix them
this more of this
blowing stuff up doesnt get rid of isk in fact it increases inflation
supported raising the cost of war decs is a pointless endeavor as where this idea would be a step towards making war decs what they should have been from the beginning a means by which to settle grievances between corps and alliances in high sec not a free high sec grief buttonnow this solution wouldnt curve ward decs altogether but it would make the offending corp or alliance have to work harder by making them do things to keep their sec status positiveits not too much and not too littlemake it so
dont much care as long as the sec hit is small significantly smaller than for lowsec gcc actions and it doesnt occur in lowsec
im pretty sure this would be a high sec war action only hit if not thats the only kind i support low sec guys dont really need to dec in order to grief though so little change either wayof course they could always make it so that the declaring corp or alliance incurs a one time sec penalty hit for all members with every dec they make hell that would be even better
why should there be a penalty for attacking a war target explain to me how attacking someone that you are at war with is a criminal act
i think he is saying that habitual war deccers should be punished from a rp perspective it makes sence im sure the amarrians would want to know why the same corp has been in 10 non mutual war decs in their empire space in the last week alone and concord is just turning a blind eye if im the amarrians gallente caldari or minmatar why would i fund you if youre not doing your jobi think this idea could work but it needs some fleshing out like maybe if your corp declares 1 non mutual war there is no penalty the more non mutual wars you have the more scrutiny is placed on your corp until you reach a threshold where concord and the space owning empire would say wtf is going on here and start taking away sec status from your corp or not take sec status away but they would say you can still declare your wars but its gonna cost you more cause were getting heat from the gallente over thisjust some ideas
one hi sec war by itself doesnt mean much but i think the op is referring to corps that make a habit of wardeccing indy corps in hi sec hint selfproclaimed hi sec piratesa change like this would make hisec pirates kick scream and squeal like pigs see they want to be called pirates but without the consequences that come with the title
most people have bad taste anyway so i wouldnt worry about it im still waiting for the day that i get to walk around the streets naked because i cant find anything im willing to wear in the clothing stores im not kidding im already limited to levis stock tshirts dress socks and work jacketsoh yeah and lets not forget i already have to buy any blue jeans 2 waist sizes up to avoid losing circulation because they gendernormed them to look attractive on women and removed half the material
progressivecaldari  corpatemilitary dictatorship hail great caldari state o7amarr  repressive religous empireminmatar  tribal based society with ancient traditionswhere do you see progressive none cares bout gallente anyway
i have to echo most people here the op must have confused eve with star trekgallente pleasure slaves are the top vice of caldari ceosamarrians keep matari children sex slavesif you have bothered to read any of the eve novels
wtf is this if you not trolling then you should get medical assistance go to a psychiatrist
gallente are a bunch of homeless junkies hypocrites deviants masochists and the most corrupted ethnics in eve this is why you start gallente and you finish to join the other camps not really the good or only reason the good one being when you start using blasters
that cant be true look at them now there are no gender specific clothes
its a bit early to complain about sexism in the clothing selection when its still really limited in general if there isnt a womens version of something the men can wear theyve probably just not got around to coding it for the different bodyshape yet
i know in my primary characters allaince we often see characters moving from one corp to another in order to sepcialize the purpose of the member corps within the alliance this is especially the case when new recruits transfer from our training corp into the corp that specializes in their are of interest pvp industry logisticsi think it might be useful for there to be a function that allows corp ceos and the alliance ceo or designated personnel manager to allow an immediate transfer between member corps that are members of the same alliancewith out the member having to go through the 24hr wait period and having to reapplyi kind of envision the process going like this1 member applies for transfer from corp a to corp b both being members of alliance z2 notifcation is sent to ceo of corps a  b for approval3 once ceos of corps a  b have accepted the member is transfered and ceo of alliance z is notified of the trasnfer thoughts suggestions would any one else find this of use
fool combat mission bots have bee in the game longer than i have they are also quite fun to toy with after petition of course
not supportedsounds like another handout proposal whats wrong with botters if they want to spend hard  for isk then let them this proposal will only serve to make them buy plex instead and then you wont even have any easy prey for pvpers anymoreyou dont get mad at the cows and the sheep for eating too much at the farm and burning all the grass and let them starveyou should cull them instead and have steak dinner once in a whilethink capitalism not dictatorship communism

i would be very surprised if this hasnt been brought forth as an idea before though going back several pages i found no topic which related specifically to this my evesearch link to look at the forums wasnt working buggy pos and mittanis pos misery topic seemed more about small ui fixes or people are posting pos related issues when they should be talking about outpostsidk nvmnow i remember in some topic i was reading through a long time ago someone proposed allowing outposts to be destroyed but a response from ccp was that they had tried to test it but it actually caused a lot of problems well if you cant destroy an outpost why not just unanchor it and go on from therethe idea is that once you have sufficient sovereignty in a system the same required to build an outpost to begin with the owner may unanchor the outpost and essentially deconstruct it from this point they may pack everything up and move it to another orbit inside the system or to another system all together or they could take the components to the next nearest station and reprocess them if you can build and anchor them logically why shouldnt you be able to unanchor and recycle them maybe providence will get a little cleared up now xdif i truly was blind in my topic search i apologize for my nubness
a variant of this his has been proposed beforelinkageabandoned poses are a problem all over eve and it does need to be sorted out
no
do you have reasoningedit and thanks bo
as a new comer to eve ive noticed that if youre a newbie and youre in an industrial corporation you tend to get war deced a lot nearly constantlyim a little fuzzy on the game mechanics but it seems like the war dec system is too open ended and far too cheapas i understand it you basically bride concord for the right to wage war on another corporation seems like the cost of a war is incredibly cheap a few million to wage what can in some cases be an intergalactic conflict a whole 100million to wage an alliance warin real life on one planet the cost of a war goes into the billions of dollars and does so with out exception how on earth and mere companies of 1 to several hundred people manage to wage a war for so little across so many systems just seems grossly out of alignment with the rest of the games realitywhat i would recommend is thisif were going to use such childishly small number bribe what are in fact the intergalactic police force  youre opponent should have the right to counter bid the war dec i also think we should raise the minimum bid from a few million isk to 200mil isk for a single corp war and to 500mil to dec a corp in an alliance and 1billion isk to wage war from alliance to alliancemutual war declarations receive no reduced expense ask anyone who works in politics or the military  the cost of war is a constant onei also think to make the cumulative impact of war more realistic the cost to renew the declarations should go up by 20 each time they are renewed so if it cost you 200 mil for a week long dec it would be 240mil the next week for a third week it would be 288mil and so oni also think there should be a mandatory period of 30 days diplomatic immunity so people can manage to recover from wars that means for 30 days you cant be declared upon in option should be included for corps that want to be at war to decline the diplomatic immunityin my mind what that does is force people who want to pvp to play against other corps that like to pvp it would greatly discourage highsec griefer corps from bullying newer players around trade hubs and picking on mining barges before the industrial player has had a chance to learn pvp skills like armor and shield tanking the fact is most of us pay for this game with real life money and no one will pay money in real life to get bullied ingame its a waste of time and money so in order to ensure younger players arent basically getting hosed at their own real life expense i think these measures are appropriateif youre deced and you can bribe your way out of it thats your cheapest option if youre deced and cant bride your way out the juice steadily becomes worth less and less squeeze which seems appropriate if you have 20mil skill points per player and 20 guys in your corp vs 5mill skill points per player in a 20 man corp youre going to win and there isnt anything that can be done about it which means if you want to be a bully youre gonna have to pay for the privilege of being an online newbie poacherwe newbies have to learn how to handle wars no argument there but i think step by step month at a time would be a fair compromiseso thats my idea what do you all think
in real life the cost of a super capital would be such that it would bankrupt entire spacefaring nations to build too many of them yet in eve alliances of 5000 build hundreds and sacrifice them with little concern this is part of the reason everyone thinks supercaps are unbalanced or pretty much all of it actually when in fact its just the alliances wealth that is unbalancedso for war decs yeah pretty much the same thing as far as perspective goes but not in relation to cost just ease of access war costs plenty whenif you start losing ships but shouldnt be extremely expensive to initiate its just paperwork afterall and corporations in eve are pretty much singular entities mostly seperate from the spacefaring nations and outside their rules still too easy
first off id like to say i am sympathetic but i cannot support this unless i see some statistics on the frequency of wardecs on new corps and their repeat rate just saying that something is too cheap must be backed up by some evidence that it is so i am a believer of free markets so maybe the increasing scale of wardecs should be based on the standing of the corp with that of concord in aggregate criminals should find it harder to declare war
not supported wars in eve should be cheap
op the problem is not wardecs but simply eve being one huge ocean with very big fish in it and very small ones upping the price of a wardec is never going to help the little guy especially not if he wants the option to put in a counterbribe to co
no you just dont get it do you this is eve online survival of the fittest mmo if you cant or dont want to defend your corportation assets against wardecs then you shouldnt have a corporation in the first placego to a npc corp and try again when you are ready simple as that
im offering support in terms of the cost of war it is too cheap i think your suggestions are too much but i dont think the cost of a war should be so low that a new character could afford it in a week the cost of a corp to corp war is cheaper than the cheapest ship you might fly in that war something is wrong about thatmy biggest gripe with high sec war is station games fix this cpp you want to talk about carebears carebears pick on people who cant fight back and use tactics that keep them invulnerable they rely on an army of neutral alts to tell them everything that is going on and play station games when they cant win
look this type of whine has been visited countless times ccp needs to develop a statement in a newbie tutorial that cleary states this is eve space is cold and unrelenting and so are its inhabitants theres no such thing as being completely safe in this free environment of a sandbox we encourage all styles of interaction from friendly to the down right beating of a baby to get its candy hello kitty online this is not be prepared for struggle and torment learn to survive it even adapt to it and glory and riches could be yours time to put your game face onyeah eve is a virtual rl story in space expect to get tested keep in mind most of these older players had to deal with it now its you turn adapt or die btw if you dont like station games dont play them use your head and you can either trap them or escape them depending on which side youre on
i can concur with what youre saying wardecs are broken but so are most mechanics for corporations role management pos operations etc ccp really needs to take a look at this and fix itthe wardec thing is whats keeping as many players as there are in npc corps while i am by no means against wardecs i do think they need to be more balanced the trouble is in finding a good balance for the revision as there will be griping either waysupported but dont get your hopes up
first let me thank you all for your input it is varied as i knew it would befor those of you who gave support limited as it is i thank youthis is in fact my first computer game ever first mmo or whatever it is you call them what im learning about this game is that it is largely intended to be a pvp game which means the road to success means about a solid year of real life playing in npc corps until your sp is high enough to go toe to toe with the big dogs it also means youre going to experience ridiculous amounts of resistance in establishing a corporation of your own because the bleak outlook in eve as painted by my babybrowbeatingcandytaking contemporary is wonderfully against you at every turn also the tutorials are no where near adequate in painting the big picture of eve to the new coming player within 2 weeks of trial time i can see now that some of my suggestions are a bit over the top obviously the frustration of constant war declarations was present when i wrote it at any rate i cant help but feel some of this is slightly in favor of the more predatorial sort of player at the same time im a former us marine and i remember being vividly disgusted with the naive notions of kids fresh out of boot camp so while i dont think ill be quite so brazen as to take candy from babies i do see the need for players to mature and recognize the reality of the gameill count this among my lessons learned but i may also simply stop playing for the amount of time and effort i spend on this game i could probably become a fairly decent bowler who knowsanyhow thank you for your responses fly safe
really the overview is just returning hits in space like blips on a radar but there is no reason it couldnt be programmed to show bookmarks as well for player sake i mean setting the overview to show a specific type of bookmark for which we would have to have two types overview ticked off and overview not ticked off some people have a horrendous amount of bookmarks i cant see it being fun to sort through that even in your rightclick interface that would be cumbersome but yeah optional and placeable it wouldnt be a bad idea
i dont think the resolution is the same overview items are on the grid bookmarks arent you cannot be x meters away from a bookmarkedit if you dont know what on the grid means i suggest doing some googling but briefly it means in the shared space where objects will be seen to everyone in the same grid bookmarks cant be in the overview because they are not objects that everyone can see they are off grid indeed they are just coordinate tuples in a notepad of course you could put them in the overview but as that would be a bit of a hack as they should be only visible to you on your overview and your client would have to do some number crunching to figure out distances but then we are back to the resolution problem bookmarks do not represent an exact down to meters point in space for example if you warp to 0 on a planet and then somebody else does the same you will note that you do not crash into each other
you can be x meters away from a bookmark if you bookmark a wreck after a mission you can warp to it if you fly away from the wreck and then go back to your bookmark you can approach it it is a coordinate in 3d spacei want this but yes it must be optional to show them a checkbox under bookmarks in places would be good even better would be if we could turn this on for a whole folder then we could place our overview bookmarks in one folder and our others in a different one
or the ability to bm spots with a shortcut
does not work exactly how did you come about this conclusionwhy dont you let the traders make the judgement call on that you must not be one if you think it does not workedit ps it works im a trader
confirming that it works beatifully and is a must have skill for any trader
the op didnt actually mean anything about an honorable fight yeah i know you i and everyone else who can read made the same misunderstanding toohe just wanted a i win button so that if he caught a stray ship then he could kill it without anyone helping the ship we suspect he is a roaming pvp griefer looking for easier carebear miner kills 
too obvious try again
appreciated that the time you all take to do this comes out of rl and your gaming time as long as you can get into the csm notes the info you want us to read im happy to waitmike d
were even closer now than we were 24 hours ago honestwhat is involved in creating summit minutes1 each session was approx an hour long we all took notes but each session was recorded so we could go back and make sure we got all the details correct each delegate chose 2 topics to write about and they either use their notes the video records or both to create a document2 each delegate has written theirs in their own style some used a conversational running dialogue on what was discussed others chose a more bullet point oriented style and highlighted details its up to each delegates personal preference and style theyre all longer than 5 paragraphs though most people tried to capture every detail we could sc from the meeting3 completed minutes are submitted to the csm as a whole and ccp so we can format for proper style while ccp looks for nda breaking stuff thats where we are mostly at now once everything is cleared well release the minutes but until that finishes were forced to sit here and be a bit vague because even we dont fully know what is nda or not so out of an abundance of caution were chillin until the process finishes sorry we havent been more out there with information flow but it is definitely moving forward
revenge as a negotiable commercial commodity sounds an excellent idea and would help the profession of bounty hunter become a reality a typical ganker counter argument as someone who has myself in the past ganked profitable targets i find it unconvincing and tbh id have welcomed the excitement of being a marked man to add some flavor and risk to hisec life
yes this thread has been seen beforestill being able to sell the kill rights like a contract commodity would be interestingwhoever buys it could then hunt down said killer and claim a bounty equal to a percentage of the killit would actually mean bounties are worth hunting for
adding 25 tabs wont make any real diffrence if you have 26 members in corp adding x ammount of tabs is not the solution to the problem the problem is that you dont have any personal spaceone way of doing it would be to have dynamic tabs you can add hangars basicly but that would be a  to administer so the easy solution would be to simply add one tab a personal tab that only you and the directors can access there are a number of public tabs that can be permission controlled pos fuel mods and such but then one tab that is only shown to you directors can give you access to that personal hangar through permissions directors can then list members with stuff in the cha and the amount of space they take up they can then access each individual members hangar throug that interface if members leave for instancesame with smas add a corp tab that can be used by all with permissions and a personal tab for you and the directorsa change like this would most likely fix 99 of the security issues you encounter in whs

the true answer to suicide ganking can be taken from real lifeits all about the money thats allif they are doing it for the money then lets hit their pocket bookit might be positive now but after the suicide fine only the player with deep pockets can continue to do ithow much you askwell i say it should be based on the security status of the systemin a 05 system it would be only halfin a 10 system that would hurt any pocket booknow to the amountim open to suggestionsformula of the cost of the destroyed ship vs the suicidercan someone start off at say 50 million fine for suiciding a ship
you have a valid point but ccp lives in a sandbox where it never changes civilizations as advanced the ones in eve never evolvethis would be the case of kevflavik staying like a western town of dodge city ks foreverbut wait didnt they grow up too evolveas in case with american history law and order was established and criminals moved west to the likes of tombstone and tuscon azdid crime go away completely no but the constablesheriffmarshall could look at you and run you out of towntheres an idea eve  plenty of crime and no punishment
the only way to stop suicide ganking is to stop people from locking up ships in highsec otherwise all that it will do is raise the floor of value for targets of gankersthat said who cares fly a freighter for your spensive things if not that then an armored bs if you cant do that set up a courier contract with redfrog
so funny that this topic is mostly supported by nc and goons who loved to throw supercapitals around without a care in the world but are now losing or are going to lose their space i didnt see any of you complaining when you dropped supers religiously for a week on bs gangsso on to some common sense1 super costs the same price as approximately 100 abaddons at 200 mil each that super would die alone why shouldnt it take numbers to match in the investment for the supercapital quit crying because 10 supers costing 180 bil not including the subcap fleet they are usually with forced your fleet to run away so its perfectly acceptable to say release a ship that costs 1 trillion isk can one shot any ship every 60 seconds and has 5 billion ehp so it needs 1000 supers to kill it or 50000 sub caps to kill itlets do some quick math real quick 1000x 18 bil hmm k hang on i got dis carry the 4 here ah yes  18 trillion isk super capital fleet learn math 1 trillion isk in 18 bil supercapitals is 55 well under what has been seen by many fleets or 20 titans at 50 bil whereas you are giving it the equivalent of 138 titans in ehp so yes if someone got 18 trillion isk for a ship that every 60 seconds could pop a mom then thats great totally unrealistic and never going to happen but great

you sir have never even read about the spec developement of games have you games develope new graphical features all the time most of the time its in form of sequels or new titles from studios eve players are gamers and as far as ive heard never have played only eve they buy games as they come and for most 100 fps isnt an requirement as your average gamer is a content tourist they will upgrade hardware when they absolutely must to play the games that they want in that terms eve has always been in a kind of a nice position its been shiny enough to enjoy on more advanced hardware but you could always dial it down for your average laptop now lets face it laptops these days run dualcore setups with 34gb of ram and 1gb vram  shared vram for gfx card sure you got quadcore monsters with 2gb of vram but those are costy and most casual gamers that just want laptop to study and maybe play with wont get those plus theyre not exactly portable in terms of weight  size forcing them to use cq will make sure that those that chose profession that requires docking and undocking a lot will view it negatively is this what you deem good for evebecause more players able to play it i see to be honest i dare claim that if we go down to the path of requiring hardest hardware for eve to run we lose more than not requiring itbasicly youre disapointed that people who do not have your fathers creditcard  your income  your low living costs  whatever it is where youre getting the money for your hardware want devs to better optimize their game obviously its not away from you and therefore you should see increase as well im not on the loop with hdyrophobia but id imagine better running game would be your gain as welloh well what do i know
supporting the idea to load the station environment and have a separate disembark button to lead to cq
argh thanks for the cooloff this has been a fun but trying experience and i too hold you in equally high regard curses my nemesis posts againthat i was not aware of makes a whole lotta sense now i figured it was argument by omission then what i could really use right now is a bit of collaboration to begin to stitch together our points of agreement and identifying ongoing issues that need a resolution im gonna have to admit my ignorance here are corp thieves branded is that branding searchable what im getting at is if its not being done now i dont think thats a fair expectation to have for the name changing systembut i like the capability anyway old name search turns up new name too corp theft flagging etc so what i would propose to the csm is to enquire about the feasibility of such a search function and most other points so we can base further discussion on fact rather than conjecture       yes i missed you too thanks for bumping this thread
in no way is name changing as proposed here going to allow anyone to evade consequences this is irrefutable yes it does add an extra step  be it an incredibly shallow one  but eve is also intended to be an immersive scifi experience and to be omitting an integral facet of life life yes even the guile deceit and betrayal by reflection being scifi and thus an intended aspect of said immersion i just dont think one small step should halt greater progressmeh ccp has done stranger things anyway name changing is nothing compared to character transfers in terms of destroying immersion evading consequence etc thats just ignoring the elephant in the corner of the room

a potential compromise could be that contactswatch liststandings carry over to all namesdoes it matter that much that the instant fred mcgee pops up in local you dont realize that he was d34thmasterbaitor last time he ganked you if hes already on your watch list and shows up as a red

somehow i doubt anything you can buy with rl  is going to make that much difference in dust not on a grand scale anyway and given that you dont have a monthly subscription rate does it really matterby the same token you could say paying for a sub in eve is an unfair advantage or buying plex for that matter though i fail to see how forking 250 out of your own pocket for a stock pos and thanny is an unfair advantage especially when someone is likely just going to blow up both of them anywayive already said a dozen times or half that anyway that rmts are selling stuff left right and center which makes any microtransactions effect on eve completely without ripples except for those that roll up against the rmts which is the whole point isnt itwhat youre not seeing with your somewhat skewed perspective is that the microtransaction business model is the product of the rmts and not the developers developers have simply proven adaptable and shifted their own business model to apply competition against the rmts who are otherwise ruining their businessmicrotransactions work people are perfectly willing to spend their money to get ahead in a game and they are generally not concerned about whether they buy their advantage from the developers or the rmts generally however they will spend an extra dollar or two to be on the safe side and within the rules to keep from getting their accounts banned this is what the devs are relying on which is why you dont see them competing pricewise with the rmt thats the way i see it anyhow and i appreciate the devs proactive approach to maintaining a competative business model that hurts the rmt
so having a nyx with supercap char after 2 days in eve while others have maybe a rifter after that time is not an advantage then you say that they dont know how to use it how is that different in dust if i look for example at bfbc2 the unlocks give you better stuff still i have little doubt i can defeat virtually every 2 day old player with all gear if i only use basic gear also right now i am pretty sure i know how to use a supercap but i dont have the isk to get one how does rmting one with plex sorry it is just rmt not give me an advantage above not doing italso it is imo highly unlikely dust will have must of an influence on eve ccp claims alot more than they deliver
so the 2 day old new to eve player spends 720 on a nyx based on current plex rl gtc pricing has the understanding to get into an alliance hstarts a second acct to get fuel to the nyx buys more gtc to convert to plex to buy the fuel and has the understanding not to lose a nyx i doubt thatthat is alot of rl cash for just one nyx and the support for it even if you have the understanding to use it properly i somehow dont think ccp is going to have items in the money store for dusties that cost over 700 ccp has repeatedly stated that dust is going to have a significant impact to nullsec eve not low sec not hisec those players are going to impact how our sov mechanics work that is a big deal the larger issue is that i feel ccp is slipping rl money store purchases for advantages in game into eve they are warming everyone up with vanity mt only and within a few months of dust rolling out will include it in our game i can see the dev blog now dust 514 uses cash for item mt and it is part of eve to be consistent we are adding items to the mt store such as modules and ships that you can only purchase there with aur
this is argument has been used by forum warriorstrolls who happen to hold a minority opinion since the advent of the interwebsof course it is utter bullyes there is no guarantee this forum thread represents an entirely accurate statistical summary of the playerbases preferenceno that doesnt mean every other eve player who did not post in the thread agrees with you effing moron thats how statistics work you take a sample minority and poll their opinion innit this is what this forum represents 80 of this sample group agrees mts are detrimental to the game
quoteso the 2 day old new to eve player spends 720 on a nyx based on current plex rl gtc pricing has the understanding to get into an alliance hstarts a second acct to get fuel to the nyx buys more gtc to convert to plex to buy the fuel and has the understanding not to lose a nyx i doubt thathe doesnt need the understanding not to lose a nyx he simply has a huge advantage compared to a 2 day old noob in a rifter of lets assume he also uses a rifter fitted with officer items he has a much stronger ship than the 2 day old noob that doesnt use plexesand how about the other example me i am pretty sure i know how to fly a supercap am quite far skill wise yet i dont have one if i buy one with plex i do have one and a nyx really is better than my thanatos so that new dusty buys a tank in the store and goes straight forward to the enemy and dies horribly how is that different than what we already have in eve and plexes ccp also stated they would iterate on fw that pi gave you options to really govern a planet t3 ships would have 5 subsystems of each they would add more ihub upgrades storefronts giving smaller groups a chance in 00 etc in other words ccp states alot more than they deliverafter which it can be sold on the marketcontracts again why again would i care if people get an advantage by purchasing stuff with aur or plex
he doesnt need the understanding not to lose a nyx he simply has a huge advantage compared to a 2 day old noob in a rifter of lets assume he also uses a rifter fitted with officer items he has a much stronger ship than the 2 day old noob that doesnt use plexesand how about the other example me i am pretty sure i know how to fly a supercap am quite far skill wise yet i dont have one if i buy one with plex i do have one and a nyx really is better than my thanatos so that new dusty buys a tank in the store and goes straight forward to the enemy and dies horribly how is that different than what we already have in eve and plexes ccp also stated they would iterate on fw that pi gave you options to really govern a planet t3 ships would have 5 subsystems of each they would add more ihub upgrades storefronts giving smaller groups a chance in 00 etc in other words ccp states alot more than they deliverafter which it can be sold on the marketcontracts again why again would i care if people get an advantage by purchasing stuff with aur or plexi personnally didnt agree with adding plex in game i would be happy to see it disappear altogether however it is firmly a part of the economy of eve nowto address your last point i honestly dont care how much you do or dont care about buying advantages in game and the impact it will havethe first line in this thread was directing it to the csm there are a huge amount of threads currently out with player feedback regarding mt in eve most of the posts i have read have been clearly against the idea i want to see what the csm didis doing or are going to do to address what is a large issue for a lot of the player base
i wouldnt be so bold as a player to tell ccp how they should make their money obviously ccp decided they would be able to make more money launching dust as a free download with mt ccp has stated that they will keep markets in eve and dust seperated it seems that direct transactions however will be possible i doubt that items bought with aurum will have a major effect in eve or dust dust might have some effect on sov warfare but lets face it its the big fleet battles that decide whos in control alliances often dont even bother keeping sovereingty in the systems they control i dont think they can make it much worse than it is now so ill just wait and see what happens
i know csm cant really propose gameplay changes to ccp but the game really needs a sub cap counter to super caps or caps in general sub cap game play is diverse and varied caps are just do you have more if check yes you winmy idea is a role for assault frigs as dedicated cap killers strip their guns make them tanky with a tiny sig radius then give them a dumb fire missile that does a percent structure damage to anything the missile hits think like stealth bomber bombs but just for 1 targeta small to medium sized group of these should propose a serious threat to a super cap fleet and should prevent them from being used till they are cleared off the field
supported mayeb a larger group but i mean even in rl every ship that enters service in a navy another ship somewhere will be developed to counter itthis is basic fact but in eve we have caps which can only eb countered by more caps which really doesnt make sense a dedicated capkiller would be useful and would give people in standard subcaps a purpose even on large battlefields running interference on the assault frigs which means taht blob warfare will have to eb more structured instead of just caps and logistsics blobbing it out you would have a blob of caps relying on smaller ships to defend them against even smaller ships they otherwise would be hurt forbasically battleships  destroyers  submarines  battleshipstranslated to eve thats pretty much caps kill battleships and yes other caps too which have the purpose of killing the frigs who kill the capsbecause realistically if a ship the size of a frig went against a cap or supercap ist so small it would be very dificult to hit so realistically it would be fitted with weapons designed to combat the ship type that would have the hardest time engaging itbattlefields rely on specializations of function to accomplish goals so should fleets in eve
you complain about all t3s looking the same and then ask for a change that will lead to all t3s looking the same what
you obviously didnt understand the idea then the idea is to let you choose the configuration of the ship separately from the sub basically you would add your subs then choose the appearance of your ship rather than have the sub choice determine the appearance
no i understood it perfectly what youd get is everyone using the one appearance that looked the least ed
of course because everyone has the exact same tasteas it stands every t3 ship pretty much looks the same already due to there only being a few decent sub combos worth a damn that was the whole reason for the idea so we could have the setup we wanted without being forced to have all the ships look the same
bump
i think this is a well deserved boost to low sec
not supporting this idea to trick carebears into going into lowsec you should get a higher security boost in highsec than in lowsec or 00 it makes no sense for concord to give higher rewards for areas where it cares less
reality says otherwise as lawless and instable countries means cheap workers and recources which produce a cheap yet very comfortable livestyle for more powerfull countries the capitalistic version of slaveryafrica and south america have proven thus the problem is in eve there is no real equivalent of workers no need to recruitable crew no price for the manpower the complete non pod population produces the normal reason for unstable regions as it exists in reality does not exist in eve
fyi any rookie ship impairor ibis velator reaper can fit a cynosural field generator i and a micro auxiliary power core i with cynosural field theory 4easier to haul modules around than frigates

can someone translate this into english
can someone tell this guy in some language he can understand to  never mindanother qq post if you want some of those moons why dont you grow some balls and go fight for them
this may have been said but the alchemie guys english was so bad i didnt read the entire posttech is very valuable so techmoons are valuable i can live with that would be nice if there was an alternative method of getting technetium generating it from lesser minerals using alchemy 
back when eve came out visual customization was rampant in other mmos far beyond the players face i played eve for a few months when it first came out and was disappointed there wasnt more of that i just recently started playing again and ive got to say i see things being changed and adjusted and improved but just  nothing that makes the game cooler id love to see options for painting ships maybe different kinds of paint as trade goods and the ability to have the corporation logo appear on your ship
it would be cool and all but as it is its hard enough to see ships when they are so far away that any paint decals or custom body mods wouldnt be noticeable this would be done at the expense of rendering too there are some neat optimizations you can do if every ship using the same model looks exactly the same
options  video  enabledisable paint and logos
scenario pirates wardec your corp or youre the pirate and have someone chasing you for revenge either way youre docked you think i wonder if theyre out there waiting for me  too bad theres no windows on this massive space station or no service provided by the station to show me whats out there youre like a groundhog in a hole in this advanced society your only chance to know whats out there is to undocki propose a station view button when docked clicking it will show the view of the station from the outside along with the stations overview of its surroundingsmaybe this button will only be available to players who have a certain standing with the station maybe players with high standing might actually get access to the stations scanner anything would seem more likely than being in a big fancy space station and having no way of knowing whos sitting out there waiting to blow you awayjust sayin
it would be cool if they could merge this with walking in stations or captains quarters and you could see outside space in real time 
i support this
this actually makes sense supported
no doesnt protect high sec residents just throws scum against scum this would even make more killed stuff since you like that much to blow players shipsho wait you dont have the balls to fight vs confirmed pvp boysi understand now why you live in high secwhat a dumb this oneedit self proclaimed pirates and pvpeers like you are the breakfast pussies in low sec come get some in low if you have some balls to shoot other thing then defenceless players like noobs indys and small industrialsthis would be a huge step from ccp to make low sec more interesting and bring us interesting targets ubber piwates would like to see how much time they need to leave the game or start missioning to be able to return in high sec thickens 
thanks for all the responses to this proposal i want to clarify one point that i meant the security status penalty for offensive war attacks to apply to characters not corporations high skillpoint characters can easily be moved between corporations but skills cannot be moved between characters
i am going to assume youre not a troll even though you probably areyou seem quite visibly agitated about a computer game you should ask your mother about the times she burned her bra in the 60s to fight for you now having actual womens rights in an actually oppressive society in real lifejust dont mention to her that you are progressing the cause of feminism by making unintelligent keyboard warrioring on an internet forum about pixels in an spaceship game unless you want her to cry
sexism what where what do you mean
please visit your user settings to reenable images
confirming i too would like to wear a dress
i believe she is referring to the tony gonzales novel empyrean age which i guess you didnt read the chamberlane or whatever of amarr had same sick habits
exactly its outrageous to suggest there could be any futuristic and progressive society that isnt completely dominated by state feminism and genderpedagogics
i accidently made my boobs way too bigwhen my character started i wanted him to be skinny but now that im a mogul i want him fative been playing eve for 5 years and i want the age to show on my characters facei just fought in a 500ship nullsec superbattle but i dont have any battle scars now i want onetired of feeling this way have no fear ccp is so awesome theyll read this thread and decide to make body and certain agecomplexion options recustomizable for everyone we are all just clones after all yay
support
yeah even my alliance though were pretty samll is divided into highly specialised corps that draw from a central rookie corp would amke sense to just transfer them between instead of ahving a perios fo time where they are just gone from teh member list while quitting rookie corp and joining the main one
i too feel that nullsec should be nerfed again to make it even worse than highsec
its lalready worse meny ppl moved again out off 00
and removing bounties would send those who didnt leave right back to empire missions are boring as hell trying to force everyone to do them is a bad thing
local is an impossible to avoid intelligence tool unless your in wormhole space and as such has no real place in a game that is based around pvp but allows bots and those who cannot be bothered to take proper precautions to escape the consequences of their actions with an instant heres a redneut dock up quick card
what are you talking about you can move back and forth within an info window and you can open new info windows by enabling it in the options or holding down the shiftkey when clicking on show info so either i dont understand what youre trying to say or youre imagining things
judging by the op id say that youre the one imagining things actually
its called pod yourself then you spawn where your clone is not supported
sorry that its so wwhen you lern english in eve 
there should be an incursions api for community sites and tools to work withinfo would be at least constellationid stagingsolarsystemid maybe even some info on control percentage
i vote make them be destroyed not packed up and moved though
nm i just read the other post
and im sure there will be some back and forth after ccps review to boot its nice to see people frothing over output from the csm but these things take time given the performance of this csm so far i have no doubt the final product will be worth waiting for so just be patient
oh the pain
you do understand that because of the effectiveness of logistics fleets are measured by their ability to alpha a target before any of the logi can react if this module exists that threshold will be higher depending on how truly effective the module is so promoting for bigger blobs
have you tried unchecking load station environment
the other interesting thing is that all the csm mains have become strangely accidentprone recently for example just last week i was almost crushed by a falling piano
that was me my bad
o reminding ah of this wonderful thread
maybe its just mebut why did you support the topic then
cant imagine why there isnt an option to keep the original hangar view ive tried incarna on duality and all i can say is meh my original complaint still stands what can we do in eve with incarna nothing for however long it takes ccp to add somethingpersonally i am not looking forward to incarna
i agree i dont know if i mentioned something similar here or in the aka thread but i think that is going to be an integral part of the name changing system im slowly making an attempt to coalesce all these general ideas should i just start a new thread since the poster of the op has lost interest
well the idea is that you make the game f2p to encourage people to play it even when they dont feel like spending the cash on it this isnt part of the rmt business model i mentioned earlier of course but a developer adjustment to that model with an intended purpose it gets players to play and dust is such a game that it is going to need a very large community to make it an effective addition to the eve universe ideally dust has 50100 more players than eve online think of it this way ccp has advertised eve as having more than 50k unique planetary bodies i dont specifically recall whether it included moons or not which theoretically can be inhabited and controlled to one degree or another one sec yeah i know youre not really waiting
a lot of that is base speculation but if any devs are reading this i suggest you get a poll on what fps players are interested in and adjust to suit even if only a little personal opinion from someone who used to love rpgs and eve i dont want to get to complicated in dust i just want to shoot stuff and make people hurt badly before taking their stuff i dont mean griefing either i want associated costs and grind to be minimal so i can enjoy the fps part of the game and not get jammed up with industrial logistics warfare strategy tactics and associated logistics should be my only concerns if i toss a blueprint no research or skill required in the oven on the way to the next job so it pops out my favorite dropship tank or whatever when we arrive and are ready to deploy thats fine corp handles materials cost no mining required i get a pay stub share of operations or whatever and the ship makes my gear for me automated all i do is make the decision based on the scenario im going in to simple if i run a corp here and there or just here or just there then maybe i have a bit more work to do but everything is fair maybe i can get rich and maybe it doesnt matter what matters to me is what happens on the ground when im in combat and how i deal with it what tools i have to deal with it and being capable of doing it without any of those when all i have left is a knife i want to be able to use it end of story survival of the fittest not the richest
think of it this way ccp has advertised eve as having more than 50k unique planetary bodies i dont specifically recall whether it included moons or not which theoretically can be inhabited and controlled to one degree or another one sec yeah i know youre not really waiting
sorry i cant find exact quotes right now but all i can say is youre jumping at space baloons ccp has released in interviews and the like that dust has high low and null security just like eve and players will be able to choose between them highsec planetary combat will be npc based of course but it will still be there lowsec and null take things further and null allows the players to build their own planetary infrastructure null is also the only one that involves alliance impacting changes based on this interaction im not sure about planetary infrastructure availability in lowsec for dust playersactually im not certain about anything we can probably expect changes to various things along the way which will make what we think we know now kinda pointless
rps so if im an eve player how is my game going to change after dust is releasedtorfi well you have the ability to be more strategic when you are conquering planets and solar systems in nulsec those are the main touchpoints highsec carebears need not worry the same for lowsec the main touchpoint upon the launch of dust will be in nulsec will be in sovereignty will be in inflicting damage and destruction and death upon your enemies destroying their infrastructure and their means to survive either by means or scorched earth or by stealing their installations on the surfaces of planets there will be more going on on the surfaces of planets weve introduced mechanics allowing people to manufacture goods on the planets but planets will play a more pivotal role in sovereignty mechanics further down the linesnippet of the rps interview on dust 514copied from my first post there is your quote highlighted the important bit for youjust announced on the at9 stream ishukone scorpwith aur purchase ofcoursecloser and closer to the edge ccp
wait is that just a different paintjob for the same ship like the corplogos they mentioned or can you actually purchase an entire ship from aurum possibly with other attributes than a normal scorpion
it is just a different paint job for now this is just one more step closer to more then just vanity items though
oh yeah i was just wondering whether they were there already ccp have lost so much credit with me that i wouldnt even have been surprised anymore
its a custom skin and you know what if they make special bonus ships and start selling old at win ships for aur ill say good job kick the rmt in the nuts that is the only reason to be bothered by this mt thing you know if you happen to be a rmt are youwhat youre doing in this thread is propaganda and i believe that is what i was looking for the part you conveniently avoided
and just to be clear some players have specifically asked for custom skins for their ship on these forums here in this exact forum where you are not treating it as it should be this is not a proposal thread directed at ccp or the csm which is all that is suppoosed to be posted here so sod off
once again you fail at readingwhat is the very first line of this post let me copy it in for you i will make it bold so you dont miss it this timei would love to hear what the csm has to say about the mt issue especially considering the quotes and links i will provide belowseems to be clearly addressed to the csm and asking for feedback regarding this issueread this again too its the description of the assembly hall section of the forumsassembly halla platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar managementto address the rest of your post take a peak at over 100 pages of player feedback on the mt issue as a whole once again scroll up and read those 100 pages are just in 2 threadsand as far as sodding off no thank you i will pass u mad
unfortunantly you have to read once again scroll back up to the original post dust will not have an impact on eve hi and low sec dust will have its own hi and low where they can pew pew each other at willso the game doesnt die if they dont get 00 contracts and such i am discussing the tie in with eve itself and asking for the csm to give the community some feedback on the mt issue in eve and how the rl mt in dust is going to impact the sov mechanics in evethere i made it simple for you this time
tired of this canard some say whats wrong with mt you can buy a plex and buy a character and implants and stuff with the isk so why not some mt thingthe purchased character the implants and stuff were earned someone spent the time and the effort in the game to collect those items train that character make that isk etc ingame time and effort labor was expended by someone in the past they took all the risks everyone else took played the game flipped our cans we flipped theirs we shot them and they shot usbut with this mt stuff were going to find a blurry line theyre already seeming to cross it in dust and teasing to cross in eve so far the indications are that dust players will use aurum to purchase a bpo or some kind of blueprint they can then make and sell the itemsis that going to be cool with everyone in eve when you can buy the t2 shuttle that has 50m3 of cargo but the only source of the bpo was aurum i mean you can still buy the shuttle with isk you can buy the bpo with isk if someone resells it  so thats ok huh no its not ok new functionality is introduced via a means that is has a source of risk labor time and effort that is outside the environment ccp has already done this before with some of the boxed sets the teaser is the ishukone scorp then itll be the theology council maller the quafe extra scrumptious that gives 5 on selling your soul im sure weve all heard the old story about putting a frog in water and turning up the heat enjoy the simmer
it doesnt sound like you are discussing the tiein with eve at all but rather flaming over speculation on your part about the future of microtransactions that is what you are doing and i dont fail at reading your entire post and every response except your last reflects thiswhy would csm have an opinion on fictitious speculation of what ccp intendeds for the game seems to me they dont know anything about it and couldnt possibly hold an opinion on something that doesnt exist hasnt been discussed and is yet to even be truly considered at this timewhen it comes down to it ccp will make a decesion on that which reflects on how the playerbase seems to feel about it and how they feel about it before they even make a point of evaluating our opinion they first have to decide on their own and how they see it negatively or positively impacting the gamejust an fyi despite nullsec being the only major crossover to eve it has been discussed and released that eve and dust players will share the same chat channels and communications and the same server the eve shard will have the number of players increase with every addition of a new player to dust the only exception is that dust players will fight their battles on different servers around the world to reduce lag and ping problems which would occur during those battles if they existed on the same serveryour thread title is irrelevent to me its just there for show so you can flame these forums and get upvotes what youre doing is obviousedit and yes i am going to see about making a point of destroying triple a assets in null after this when i get my hands on dust
sounds like what youre really saying is its okay if people buy plex with rl  and use it to buy in game items because then the isk goes to me but mt is rl  going to ccp and i dont get my piece of the cake thats just wrongokay well at least that makes a bit odf sense and its the strongest and most valid argument ive seen to date heck even the rmts kick back to the ingame economy once in awhileheres my counter argument though and as far as im concerned it outweighs anything you could possibly say mt are a direct frontal assault on rmts the plex froms the basis of this assualt and allows players of any age to exchange rl  for isk then use it to purchase nearly anything in the game unfortunately that is not enough as the plextoisk conversion is highly susceptible to fluctuating market prices and does not account for availability of commodities or ease of access to them rmts will deliver everything you want to any safe system of your choice in gamestill not a good enough reason to buy imo but they make a lot of rl  doing this in fact even i was a little shocked to know something easily achieved could net me 75 real cash if i anonymously sold it on ebay something i could achieve in game with no more investment than selling a couple plex and having isk to spare now i know why rmt deal in plexi never would of course even now that i hold less value in my sub due to meta gaming bs griefing and a generally popshod economy but the point still stands its easy to rmt and it has very obvious real rewards for which the only counter is to offer stiff competition that has no repercussions from gms devs or cc companies were talking about relatively safe easy transfer with the game company as opposed to potential identification theft cc fraud and hacking of game accountsplayers control the value of plex of course which automatically places them in the purvey of rmt yet again not only can they use them to make money in the short term but they can invest in them buy and resell to players for profit in game which they can use to make even more rl  good idea but not working out so well in the wash i think maybe get rid of plex entirely and switch to direct purchases of ships items and isk remove it from player domain entirely and provide direct competition for rmt
why would the csm have an opinion it is the point of the csm to have an opinion and to address issues raised by the player base ccp has asked the csm their opinion on mt and additions to it and shown the csm what they are planning for th mt system as stated during the at9 coverage it is very valid to ask what exactly the stance of the csm has been on this issuethe point of the csm is to be the filtermiddle men between ccp and the player baseoh you are absolutely correct in stating that my thread title is there to get attention the more people that see this will realize the impact that mt will have on eve the more times this post gets bumped the better the chance that the csm will see it and respond to the questions askedbased on your edit yes u mad
so put in simpler terms allow frigate sized craft to fit a high damage weapon that bypasses shields and armour but is only effective on capital sized craftthis actually sounds like an awesome idea it would make smaller ships more relevant in large engagementsi bet that ccp could find a way to implement this in a balanced fashion that would make large engagements in eve more fun
i like this idea a lot but make it so that the afs have to be moving at like quarter speed or so within 5km of the capitals this would make them easier to kill off and fit with the idea of getting in close and sniping the important structural componenets
they also need to cost as much as 900 mil each otherwise they will be spammed and it will be dumb larger alliances that would be on even ground with supers would throw a hundred or more against supercapitals  people should need to be careful with how they use those or lose a lot of isk very quickly
having a ship that perma jams you constantly and you cant do feck all is stupid yes i have died to a falcon before you say it i dont mind but not having any chance at all to fight back is just ridiculous no point using drones when they can also be disco falconssick of ships where you can do feck all to defend yourselfits been proven falcons pretty much permajam there is no chance baseits wrong
currently all skills for t2 weapons and drones have a bonus of 2 per skilllevel but it could take as long as bsv to completemy proposal is to change the bonus to 2n where n is the level  1 like socurrentlevel  2  1  2  newlevel 1 20  1currentlevel  2  2  4  newlevel 2 21  2currentlevel  2  3  6  newlevel 3 22  4currentlevel  2  4  8  newlevel 4 23  8 currently the same bonus many people just stop here for a reason level 5 is not practicalcurrentlevel  2  5  10  newlevel 5 24  16 bonus which is more attractiveadvantages easy to implement  is bitwise friendly it rewards skillracefocused players is sweet for bitterold players with the removal of training skills this could be a nifty way of making players focusing on a specific race it doesnt create a big gap between new and old players gangs fleets and blobs is what matters in a multiplayer game to followdisadvantages to followtesting possibly creates an imbalance to defense bonuses
yeah im good with this currently the only reason to train most skills to level 5 is boredom or it being a required skill for something else 2level bonuses do not scale well with current training times and level 5s tend to severely impact player progression also when you have a character trained up to that level it really should mean something and an advanced player should pwn players who are only partially trained making 2to1 odds viable for that advanced playeredit  support
get back the standing
then youre barking up the wrong tree and maybe you should go and ask ccp to beef up some of the other less popular subsystems a bitto just have people pick a t3 look regardless of what subsystem combo they have however is plain stupid
because you want to put tractor wheels on your ferrari still have it look like a ferrari but make it run through muddy and bumpy terrain why not take this a step further and be able to use any ship skin you wantill have my nyxmodelled blackbird now please
deciding the appearance of your ship is stupid not having other players being able to guess the setup of your ship based on appearance is stupidfine then like i said many posts ago just forget i said anything i wouldnt want to shake up the static status quo
carebears shouldnt have negative sec to start with so no trickery going on here also what is the point of getting massive sec gain in highsec when those who actually needs it cant enter those systems
try opening your eyes and looking at a perspective other than just from your 10 u see all the yellow skulls they can rat in high sec because they were responsible enough to not let it drop that far oh noes i didnt bother to care enough about my sec and now i cant get back to high sec u made your decision now deal with the consequences or u can rat in the low sec u love so much u do realize u can already do that right
i have to disagree with this not because pirates should have to rep their status in lowsec but because they do it there or in 00 anyway and based on system security increase profit while doing now heres the dumb what about highsec players who feel like ratting to raise security status suddenly they have to go to lowsec and rat in places that are now overrun by pirates rather than just completely dominated by them im not talking gankers or pirates in highsec either im just talking playersheres what i think again no security repping for gankers and pirates at all you want to rep your security you stop being a criminal it should take you days or weeks to have the opportunity again based on where your security status is at 5 ten downtimes without a neg security hit 10 30 downtimes bamm suffer i dont care about your whining either you play the game your way and suffer the consequences i also think i should be able to gank you sans security status hit anytime and anywhere without concord interference provided my status is above 0
took the liberty of pirating clever pun or what  the idea to incorporate into my lowsec vision threadjust too good to leave out
as a counterproposal id say remove security status gain in nullsec that should at least accomplish part of what you are looking for and it makes sense nullsec has no concord and thus no reason for security status gain aside from popping rats either that or reduce it to the equivalent security status gain you would get in highsec and make low the predominant area for quick security status gainsive never actually checked what the gains are per area but i assume the tougher the rat the higher the gain
other than the mechanics issues involved with changing cynos is there any valid reason in current eve to not allow dreads in hi secwhat do you think and whyi personally think that dreads should be allowed to fly freely concord is impossible to tank hi sec pos owners do need a reason to be paranoid and none of the dreads are going to be used for suicide ganking and such since they cost so much in addition the lack of carrier support will make them more vulnerable to other fleets without making them a guaranteed kill like they are in lownull secwith their increased mobility and usability dread popularity will increase plus it will give smaller alliances a way to build a somewhat capable capital fleet without risking the wrath of khan before they are ready to actually use itother buff ideas notwithstanding this relatively simple change could go a long way to helping dreads increase in relative popularity
quite simply this is annoying its been going on for years chribba profiled it last year but the problem continues to build it is no longer confined to the major hubs but is increasely happening in any system in proportion to its populationthere please support the following proposalban the spaming of contracts in local
i dont see the harm in this proposal1
yesonly automated bots will be spamming anywayif you dont like this proposal youre a bot
only automated bots will be spamming scam contracts lots of people will drop a contract link in local to advertise on their way through thats not spam btwso given spam is essentially chat how would you propose to isolate contracts from it and also to actually isolate actual spammers pretty sure that the way the system works the game likely makes little differentiation between hi and 2xcaldari navy control systems only 2 million isksure it has the autolink but what is that really
i support the concept but not the imlpementation if ccp would move lots of the faction things to the market a lot of the spam would go away
right now its impossible to swap ammunition ceasing fire this makes sense there is nothing wrong with thisthere is something wrong with how the user interface handles this we should be able to tell the server keep shooting but oh by the way change ammunition when you finish the current cycle spend the appropriate time reloading and resume fire when you finishwhile this isnt a huge issue for missiles projectiles or hybrids it is a quality of life concern for amarrianson the plus side this should reduce lag as what previously took three messages to the serverstop firingload new crystalstart firing againnow takes only onefinish current cycle load new ammo resume firewith all the time spent on ui coreification i feel this is a longstanding issue that should now be resolved
every other bloody race has no trouble reloading it just picks up new ammo and then your ready to goamarrians have it bad when it comes to tech 2 ammo or faction ammoeverything stops dead in its tracks for one busted crystal out of 8you have to reload the whole damn array with a different crystal then switch backthen start firing againonly to have an another bloody crystal shatter after one cycletheres a difference between rational and insane thisis insanei dont mean to sound like some spaz right nowbut its been a nagging issue ive had to tolerate for a better part of a year now make the maddness stopjust have it stop and autoreload provided you have enough ammoand then you fire them again small price to pay for a little seamless pew pew yestldr hell yes supported
i get around that issue by sticking spare crystals in a container so they arent used prematurely and then i just discard the entire stack when one of them breaksthe few remaining shots left per crystal arent worth bothering about and id rather that the new set break at nearly the same timeif any changes to laser crystals themselves were done id appreciate the ability to combine and split damaged crystals the way you can combine and split stacks of ammunitiondoes any other race have to purchase 4000 rounds of faction ammo per turret when they go off to pewpew no but amarrians do
i consider the disruption caused by crystals shattering one of the downsides of lasers one that can be worked around by raw isk spares o or intelligent use of weapon grouping made a lot easier recentlyas for op simple little tweak to reduce the clickityclick which is always a good thing make sure you add it to the 1000 things thread as well
have your proposal include hybrids projectiles and missiles being able to reload and change ammo types in one second like lasers and i will give a thumbs up
as a diehard laser user i have to agree we get such a good deal on ammo changing that reloading faction and t2 crystals is a minor annoyance i run a cnr cruisemissile boat for giggles against angels and the 10 seconds to reload always seems like forever i much prefer my lasers weird reloading regardlessi will agree that it makes sense to be able to hit reload and have it put in a new set of the same crystal however even if only one crystal has burnt out
ask a friend to help problem solved
i suppose i should have explained my point i meant anyone using a cyno currently like drake suggested cynos are most effectively deployed by a cyno alt yours your friends or someone elses an immortal pod pilot with one purpose in life get up fly cheap frig to location deploy cyno get podded go to sleep for awhile
the only part of customization that causes rendering issues is when the custom logo and details are seperate images or require tags that tell each client to apply a modifier to the original textures this is generally assuming the new texture has mutiple layers that render at lower resolutions when the object becomes more distant if the customization was just another texture stored in the database there would be no change to the display properties or rendering limitations
well then thats exactly what it should be
they should make all textures the same resolution first
yes but how to identify the ships out there from inside the station or viewing a cam outside like the jita cam on a screen in station  best and most feasible idea i think you wont be able to identify individual ships and pilots i propose we add on to what you propose and put a terminal in the shows you who and what ship they are flying is on grid around the station as well as docking and undocking pilots on another screenlater we could have additions to that like using the station computers to scan incoming and outgoing vessels or just those on grid for cargo and fitting there could be another console for looking up pilot details too type in the name access the database and depending on your security clearance anything from corporation standings to exact skills and pvp history
thats what i meant by overview it would just show an overview window just like when youre in your ship but with this option built into captains quarters which would be even more commonsenseically awesome maybe a more graphical overview would be appropriate
i dont like the button idea there should just be windows even if its just to enjoy the view but yeah the ability to check whos out there would be nice as well
hi im not sure if this is the right place to voice this concern and if it isnt then it would be appreciated if someone could kindly point me in the right directioni raised a petition almost a week ago now and still it appears as open could someone please clarfy the petition response times for me as this is the first petition i have ever raised and a week to get an answer seems awfully longmany thanks
it depends on the category and if major issues have been around recently but it could take 2 weeks or more as long as its open youll get a response eventually
this also the cost should be related to the size of the corps involved including the defending corp  it should be cheap to dec 1 man corps who are just trying to avoid the npc tax rate

ive read quite a few of the threads on black ops getting covert cloaki feel the covert ops cloak should be a given it slightly raises its survivability while not truly changing its combat effectiveness this helps it survive return trips when it for whatever reason would have to fly solo or without cyno it doesnt create a solo machine because battleships even without a targetting penalty have god awful targettingalign times in the case of the widow and ecm i would say make bonuses either uniform or matching bonuses either all speedagility related mirror the recons or for those who want the black ops to do a more supporting role grant them something like a rr bonus as for improving jump rangefuel i would have to agree to this as well one of the major complaints i keep seeing is that for a specialized ship it seems to need a lot of help performing this special task whether it be going out of ones way in fitting it or having alot of ships supporting it if the black ops are support ships why are they being supported i know logi ships do an entirely different form of support but they still work in pairs or groups as one would be easily primaried otherwise black ops ships already work in pairs as well one black ops and one ship with the cyno but with limited range and fuel it makes their job very difficultinefficient a covert cloak would help with this as you would be able just jump in and cloak instead of using the cyno besides a cloaky blockade runner would also be providing extra bombsammunitions etc so the more fuel they have to carry the shorter your trip will be right to sum it up grant the covert cloak smooth out the bonuses and improve fueljump range personally the bonuses are the only point i feel shaky on as ewsdetc is already done by the recons and would probably result in them being op especially in a fleet but then again rr etc would be welcomed in a fleet of otherwise squishy ships what keeps them alive is not getting targeted generally a battleship loses in this aspect so thats a major set back alone and those of you mad at cloaky ships escaping remember that that is their purpose and primary defense however they can still be caughtwhether it takes planningluck or whatever it can still be done and once they are caught they go pop rather easilyone last thing create special scanning probes for detecting strictly cloaked objects just so people cant spend forever just cloaked up that should make everyone happy
except that they wont granted people will fly them but not in those kinds of numbers the vast majority of players will go capital over and above blops
dumb that they cant if they could it would be so much more useful also take into account that at this point black ops are the most underused ship in the game give their portal range a boost and they may actually become viable
let it go drf and dc have made a mutual equal profits deal so you wont get affected by them killing your rmt coalition besides with vuk lau out of the way you will get more profits from selling isk
i dont mean to be rude but there are some grammatical errors that are keeping me from completely understanding what youve written i think youre saying that this module will increase the ability of logistics to respond because it raises survivability from alpha thus making it a boost to blobsi do realize this in fact i mentioned this worry in the op so what id like to gleam from you is this do you think this is more or less of an advantage than what ecm currently affords with the absence of ecm shutting down an enemy logistic would the ability of the module to transfer damage received from the rest of the fleet naturallyto an enemy logistic or the enemy receiving repping be equivalent and youve prompted a really interesting question just what development could actually be bad for blobs anyway
hes talking about alphafleets which are designed to use the high alpha of artillery to destroy an enemy ship before logistics get to it you suggestion would mean more artillery is required to pop a ship in a single volley and would thus mean that blobs would need to be bigger ecming logistics doesnt make a differance
its sisi it isnt the finished product yet
sounds like a great idea
this sounds like a  supers arnt fair  post by people who either dont want to fly them so they support any nerf to them have died to them multiple times or some other lame reason theres a reason supers are considered to be the most powerful and destructive ships in the gamecause they are thats why they cost 1860 billion isk but now these guys want it to be  fair  i wanna kill a nyx with my abaddon herp derpplz so if you dont want to deal with supers go to empire and care bearbtwif you want to be honest a single npc empire state probably have more supers than the entire drf and its freinds combined if you can afford to fly it then fly it and dont ruin other players experience
it really is getting to the point of another titan manifesto is coming soon its very simple to alot of people that supers being dropped with zero support obliterating anything is game breaking to the point of absurdity cap gameplay is very boring allways has been in eve its do you have more if check yes you win and the long awaited super cap critical mass has been reached that was warned oh so long ago
so true but at least they have to push more buttons then the old dd titans did 
ccp have already agreed that supercarriers need a nerf though the only interesting debate is about how theyre going to do it
bump hope its in incarna
i have voiced my oppinion elsewhere on the forums earlier but adds my view here as welli fully support making cq optional in the following waychose in esc menu if you want to go to hangar view or quarters as default when you dock if in hangar view you can enter cq via click of a button and vice versaby no means do i want this from a pc performance perspective i have no troubble using cq on my pc though i hardly ever use less then 2 accounts at the time and would need to disable station environment on all but one if cq isnt optionali want cq optional exclusively for the immersion that has been mentioned so many times beforefirst of all you have propably all seen this video and perhaps also this one the getting out of pod part at 115  158 now ccp have here clearly set the bar that the process of getting out of your pod is a rather uncomfortablepainfull experiencenow why the hell would i want to go through that process every time i dock up for 12 minutes to get ammo or talk to my agent you cant talk to your agent face to face from your quarters anyways that can easily be 1020 times every dayfirst of all if youre just going to do a quick stopandgo there is no point in getting out of your ship and forcing your character into the cq is nothing other then immersion breaking and unnaturalsecond if youre on war ops and are waiting for the order from your fc to undock wouldnt you want to be ready in your ship and not sitting in your quarters again very immersion breaking it just feels plain wrong that when fc screams undock undock  gogogo first then are you going to get into the pod get hoocked in fill the chamber with pod goo get the pod over to your ship and get it plugged in and then undockthird if you absolutely have no desire to leave your pod at all why should you be forced tonow im not against captains quarters or walking in stations in fact ive been hyped about it ever since i started playing 4 years ago and reading about it in eon magazine 006 and after spending time playing around with it on ducie and sisi for the past weeks i know that i will be spending a lot of my station time there i never was much into ship spinning anyways however there are times when you could use cq like if youre gonna be spending some time docked and it would feel natural and there are times where you should stay in your shipjust getting the option to not load station environment if you dont want to use cq is just wrong i still want to see my ship and hangar and besides if you have docked and then change your mind you have to reenable station environment again and then eighter undock and redock or relog the fact that ccp have only given that option is basicaly them saying we want to force you to use your quarters regardless of how wrong it feels cause weve spent a lot of time and effort making it and if you dont want to use it then fu heres a static image that says loading for you take care now bye bye thenso yes i want an option
here here id love to see atleast a mod fitted onthe actual ship
maybe its the fact that almost all of the threads in general discussion and assembly hall lately have been specifically focused on overinflated fears of mt to the point of being more spam than anything else i get ed off at jita local tooill point out again that you are speculating if there is any more information beyond that currently provided through interviews and the like it is currently the province of nda anyway irregardless of which ccp has to test the impact of mt for flavor on the game before they move on to mt for progressioneither way plex already exist as do rmt and well not be seeing any truly game altering impact from anything ccp decides to do unless it happens to be making raven state issues available to the playerbase for 20 a pop thats not going to happen btw and i dont really believe it should despite at one time wanting to fly one fact is even that would only have as much impact as having a few proud rsi owners ragequit for two weeksthe reality is players would buy and lose these ships just as fast as any other or faster even given the nature of the design and if they didnt it would be the result of them safeboating around highsec and doing odd missions or leaving them in their hangar to sit in once in awhile much like the current existing rsi are treated either way its still a vanity itemtime is moneythat essentially means that if i work 12 hours a day then use some of that income to buy something in game i still worked for it i just worked for it in a real job rather than slugging away grinding money in a game either way i still earned it and personally earning it in real life is less time consuming which puts us back to time is money its not worth it to grind for isk in eve i cant make in 10 hours in highsec what it takes me 1 hour to make in a rl job i dont even make a good living doing what i do which makes that all that much more poignantif i made 100 bucks an hour id probably think nothing of wasting 12 hours a day grinding for 100 million isk the fact that i have to work for everything in rl makes me less interested in doing it for a game the game becomes tedious a waste of my time when i could be doing something else more productive
sorry to burst your self righteous bubble but not everyone is as selfish as you stop projecting my concern is the integrity of the game
you missed this part corrected a little typo there but otherwise im fairly sure that was the next linehow did you get selfrighteous and selfish out of that anyway projecting now i know youre full of 
quite frankly this is simply a way for ccp to make more money and sell the items for cash that they have banned and chastised people for doing over the years its hypocritical at least i understand making a buck but there are ways to do it without messin with the game mechanics from your core money train i predict it will take less than a year for it to start seriously impacting the greater game
they ban and chastise people because they are breaking the rules point of fact an american running an rmt business is not only breaking the rules he is breaking the law and earning undeclared income the only country i know of where this is in fact legal and encouraged is china and it is still against the tos by running an rmt an individual is profiting off of someone elses proprietary content and technology it doesnt neccessarily hurt the developers wallet but they are still selling their merchandiseits theft
thanks for confirming my assertion
oh good troll gotta give you a high 5 for that one sarcasm
keep it up youre doing my argument a favor
which part of this gave you the impression that i was projecting on you my wish opinion that ccp doesnt make money off mt mts shouldnt exist and are bad for the game and i want isk from player plex purchases to fill my pockets im confused by that as every argument i make is generally pro mt to the point where i aggressively defend ccps right to do it not only that but selfrighteous implies religious intolerance when i clearly considered your argument the only one which had validity of all ive seen and selfish implies that i have something to gain by mts being brought into eve and want them there for my own useso yeah im calling you a troll and the fact that you just fish out one liners to insult me doesnt make it likely ill see it any other way as for moral superiority and hypocrisy on my part maybe i am a little guilty of the former but certainly not the latter i wont deny that and acknowledge that i often come from the high ground but that is because i claim it and make every effort not to waiver from it this doesnt always work out that well for me and to be honest is often more trouble than its worth my life has generally been one where i make a stand on something and people try to find ways to tear me from it and make me as bad as they are or condemn me for my position and treat me as ann unworthy individual because of it im not religious by any means nor am i aetheistic but i do believe in right and wrong i am perfectly willing to go through life without friends should i not be able to find anyone who demonstrates good character doesnt use or abuse drugs beat their kidsanimals harass people spit on homeless demonstrate racial intolerance or any number of other things i made that decision a long time ago and try to be tolerant of people even should they act in a fashion i would choose not to the only thing selfish about me is that i want people to be better than they generally are id also like for once to actually make a reasonable wage rather than plodding along earning less than your average stock boy for a job that requires technical skill dedication and efficiency to produce quality quickly consistentlyi honestly dont expect to see much from the mt system at all and im not even sure ill continue playing eve for long id like to try dust but if its a carbon copy of eve with all the grind and bs from the community i doubt ill burn the money on a ps3 for that especially considering i barely have the residual cashflow to pay for subs for eve and still have the ability to actually make an attempt at enjoying some small measure of life
my personal opinion of eve mt which i think is broadly similar to most on the csm is that vanity mt is fine but there are secondorder knockon effects that need to be watchedthe most obvious of these is plex prices because plex are the only way to create aur the demand for aur will increase the demand for plex but the supply may not increase as much as the demand and thus plex prices will go up the most obvious victims of this will be people who fund their accounts by grinding iskanother concern is that the economic cycle ccp has introduced iskrlplexauriskplexaur has cleverly kneecapped the simple arguments against nonvanity mt for example consider the following thoughtexperiment what if a popular class of ship say t3 was only available for aur because of the economic cycle these ships still have an isk price  someone somewhere is putting up the rl but it doesnt have to be youthe isk represents player labor arguments against nonvanity mt are interesting but with the current economic cycle the number of plex being purchased every month merely constrains the supply of mt items of any type and influences their isk price
thank you for taking the time to reply in this threadthe t3 example is interesting but if you break it down at current gtcplexship pricing a tengu with just a t2 fit and 5 subsystems would cost approx 26 usd this is over 15 months of subscription fees spent on a shipas you stated in your reply there is a huge potential for the price of plex to dramatically increase an increase in plex pricing would make your  go farther and potentially make you want to spend more  in the money store i personnally believe ccp wants the price of plex to increase atleast another 2550 this will in turn drop the rmt cost of a billion isk and cut the profits of the rmt playerscompanies while stopping rmt is important it is not so important that ccp should put up the cone of silence and not reply to the concerns of the player base combating rmt at the expense of your player base is also not the right thing to do i fully support efforts to remove rmt from the game i do not support removing it at the expense of the player base though i also do not support ccp admonishing every rmter and then jumping on the bandwagon themselves in an effort to stop rmt i am also glad that you have seen that ccp has already started kneecapping arguments against nonvanity mt the concerning part is that they have stated for a very long time that they did not want mt in eve online with the cq patch they have already reversed course and included vanity only mt once again they stated they do not want game altering items in the money shop by announcing full blown mt in dust and stating that dust will impact 00 sov mechanics they have taken another step towards preparing the eve player base for full blown mt in this game this is a major concern to a lot of players in the community especially those of us who been playing this game for 5 years we dont want to see what is the best space mmo turn into a dollar grabbing ads and a lack of development in favor of developing more rl  sinks once again thank you for replying to this thread and please share my concerns and those of the players that posted in the threads i listed with ccp
with recent news items on an alternate site quoting the mittani as giving a  about rmt the csm need not comment on this issue leave it for those who do give a  as the the csm has lost its credibility in this
how about some linkage of said commentsalso what one member of the csm states doesnt always reflect what the entire csm feels it would be nice to see some other members of the csm post as well
no i think trebor has got it about right and youll notice he states an opinion that is perfectly in line with how he has shown himself to think in the past hes not blowing air up your skirt just giving his honest opinion on an issue that is actually quite deep and sometimes very hard to measure in terms of potential impact just looking at prices now would make an player who relies on plex to add game time worry personally that amount of isk is worth more to me than 30 days of play and i wouldnt waste it in that fashion to be honest it would very nearly bankrupt my character to do that im also unlikely to sell plex at current prices for two reasons i dont see the prices holding because i am absolutely convinced its a false market and i dont believe that buying and selling now would actually guarantee a sale i also dont have the rl  to spend on plex whether it would be an investment or a complete waste of money is irrelevent in that regardaur will have an impact i dont doubt but this is currently the result of pure market hype fueled by threads just like this to drive the prices up even farther its kind of like superstition if you think its there it really is to you but it actually isnt ideally the impact of aur will be on vanity items and plex will impact the value of both not the other way around when people realise that a vanity item is just an item that makes you maybe look cool then their value will drop people will still want of course but not nearly as badly when they realise they wasted their money on something completely superficial the reality is the aur purchases will drop and people will pick a couple affectations here and there but never really get into it unless they happen to be stupid rich meaning without any regard for the value of money that means 12 items per character main on average unless theyre relatively cheap but in all cases this will be governed by the rl  value of those items or the isk used to purchase them in gametimeeffort that market will balance itself the exception to this is items that impact the game should they be introduced which is what vandrion seems to be afraid of they would still have to be unique and unavailable by other means to create real impact but they would

plex even adheres to the investment of time and effort somewhere down the line someone had to create the item that someone sold the plex to buycreating an item does not include entering your credit card and having said item appear in your hangerhere is one of my posts from a thread in general discussionsomewhere down the line of transactions someone had to invest their time skill and effort to earn that isk money shops circumvent this and ultimately cheapen a gamehere is one heck of an assumptionexample for you  for the love all things internet spaceship related i hope it never happens what would happen if ccp decided to sell 1mil in skillpoints for the aur equivalent of 5 think about itto head off the current character sales argument there is one big piece of the equation that is removedsomeone had to invest the time to train the character being sold it doesnt matter if they never undocked the toon it doesnt matter if they never did anything but switch skills it still took time attention and effort from a player the same can be said of selling modules in the mt store you are removing the players and their connection to the game selling items in the mt store only is very immersion breaking in this regard a player wasnt involved in the followingtraining the skills to build the itemgathering the material to build the itembuilding the itemhauling the item to marketselling the item on the marketabsolutely no inclusion for the player back in 2005 i mined the minerals for my first megathron in a 6 system in my vexor when i had mined enough minerals to cover the cost of the high ends i built the ship myself the sense of accomplishment that came from doing all of this from start to finish was incredible that sense of accomplishment is what kept me playing this game from talking to other players over the years i have found that i am not the only one that has felt a great sense of accomplishment from doing certain things in eve allowing someone to walk in and remove that sense of accomplishment by spending rl  kills a part of what eve is
ok no for your ideabut thumbs up for discussion about a sub cap cap killeri would much rather seethe heavy bombertech ii tier ii bcit uses citadel torpedoes gets a bonus for rof and damagecovert ops cloakheavy bomb launcher basically a much bigger bomb but has such a slow explosion velocity that only capital ships get hurt
i should explain how i see this working out in practice a fleet fight is going on supers are dropped and the enemy sub caps form a screen around the supers to try and block the missiles from hitting the assault frigs warp in align speed towards the target at different vectors they get to with in like 20km activate the mod it cycles and after the cycle the missile fires off in a straight line and what ever it connects with takes a certain percent of structure damagethe assault frig shouldnt be useful for much else then doing this so cant add dps to a fleet fight i like the idea of the weapon system being a blockable skill shot for the very reason to prevent spamming down ships too quickly but they have to do a dangerous amount of damage to be seen as a threat to super caps to deter super use with out a sub cap support fleet to counter them
the problem with ideas like this is that your new antisupercap ships get priamried and killed and then youre just back to square 1 with the remaining subcaps still being worthlessits a far better idea to make supercaps vulnerable to not just a single class of subcaps but to all subcaps that means removing tackle invulnerability and maybe ewar invulnerability too and makign sure that the supercaps cannot effectively apply dps to the subcaps
cant disagree with you on that one i think they should be effective but there should also be a defense vs it and i dont mean a super cap or titan
perhaps buff eccm but the falcon is pretty balanced right now an annoyance but one easily removed of ecm drones are worse tbhthat said you really havent proposed anything
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesimage from
guys falcons are not fine as they are and not balanced how can you say thatyou cant expect everytime to fit an eccm just incase you bump into a falcon you would be fitting for every possible  that might attack you notreally viable is itit annoys me when ppl say fit a mod to counter it well as said you would fit a mod for a poss neut ship or a tding ship or whatever its jus tnot possiblethe fact is falcons permajam with no chance at all to do anything you are instafcked there was a post showing that this was true and the statseven if you fit 1 eccm it does nothing you have to at least fit 2 wtf and again you cant expect to fit an eccm just on the off chancethe fact remains falcons are still way way overpowered the can disco they can permajam multiple targets stupid its simply not righti dont have a solution im stating the issue boost eccm ofc and boost ship attribs that you must have at least 2 t2 jammers to have something like 80 jamming chance 1 gives you say 50im sorry guys but go on sisi and test the falcon and tell me if you can get out of a disco falcon then tell me its fine
hint exaggerating this badly just makes you look like a moronno falcon is going to permajam multiple targets on anything like a regular basis unless youre all flying t1 frigatesoh and youre flying just the right racial combination for the jammers they have fitted
he probably flew a matar ship like 90 of eve and still whines here about other ships being op
yeah gotta say its a lot easier fitting the right racials where everyone flies hurricanes and angel ships 
when the first 6 words of your proposal are a demonstrable untruth the rest is inevitably irrelevant
problem is not with the hulls but the mechanic ecm needs to be rethought from scratchchance based stunlock with limited counters available is just fubar
stupid idiots are stupid lets get on sisi guys right now and prove who is rightotherwise stop trolling about something you know nothing abou
you really are a loser just like your fail alliance
we just got another usual high iq adult pro gamer who knows everything about pvp in eve and with his allknowing wisdom show us that the ship even he has trouble to counter is broken  and needs to be nerfed so he can continue his superior pvp we can just dream of
well i say it a again anyone willing to come on sisi and disprove me i am happy to show youhmmm guess not then
oc i always fit eccm on my ship when i undock have self logistics at lvl10 can self rep with my 20 drones and have 2 dd on my cane with 15sec cd ive trained hard for those but now i have answer to all situations and to every one op yes the falcon is cheated yes lachesis and his little brother also at less extent you dont see that much other wf ships around because those are the only that aloud you immediate superiority and instant gratification now answer me what is the game aboutill give you the answera any method giving you the superiority over your opponent is not overpowered its a good game mechanic youre just some noob that didnt understood the good lesson train for it and use it let noobs use other stuff because noobs always use the bad option but shssss dont tell them keep it 4u
keep posting r4nd0m keep posting dand what do you want to show me on sisi that you can fit smartbobms on falcon that it is a ecm ship and why not on tqand what is your experience on using ewar being once jammed and killed by falcon is not so much
i support this in theoryhowever the 2 per level already means t2 weapons are 10 more effective at lvl 5also your formula table is starting with a level 0 and finishing with level 42 at level 1  22 at level 2  42 at level 3  82 at level 4  162 at level 5  32basically the bonus would double every level
where n is current level 1 is more practical and realistic where n is current level leads to somewhat unrealistic results that would throw game balance for a serious loop
well it would be more practical to lower the bonus itself15115152301536015412015524012112122241234812496125192another possible method is to create an elite skillset that is trainable after level 5 sort of like adv learning workedtorpedo specialization v  10elite torpedo specialization v  1010
i can see a cap of 20 working fairly well ive thought of elite skills before too but the training times would be aweful id rather they just made each level worth the extra time investment than that
well elite skills dont necessarily have to be a higher rank than the skill they require they could also give a different bonus for example large pulse laser specialization is a rank 8 skill same as battleship and gives 2 damage to tech 2 large pulse lasers per level elite large pulse laser specialization might give an entirely different bonus such as 2 rof an 1111 dps increase at lvl 5 or even an unprecedented double bonus of 2 rof and 10 reduced heat damage the elite skill doesnt need to be rank 12 as the ccp skill tree tends to go with but instead either a 25 or 50 decrease in sp need rank 6 or even 4 the vast bulk of the sp is still in the tech 2 spec skill at a month to train for normally adding another two or three weeks to train elite skill to v and you still have a credible time sink for a very specialized weapon systemelite skills could also be used for other things such as elite energy management with another 2 cap capacity per level elite em shield compensation with 2 more passive resist per level etcimagine elite gallente battleship adding 5 railgun optimal and 10 blaster falloff or elite caldari battleship offering 5 missile velocity and 5 hybrid damage at rank 4 but requiring bs 5
the best part of this idea suddenly ship balance will be so much less important but seriously id love to be able to get a stable fit without needed two level 5 implants and nerfed dpstank
im inclined to agree with this as it stands large pulse laser 5 just isnt something id even consider training seriously 45 days or whatever for an extra 20 dps on a 1000 turret dps bs just isnt a good use of skill training id rather train t2 torps and give the raven a whirl for example and im one of those who spent the 20d or whatever training surgical strikes to 5 for that extra 3 damage in fact that right there is the problem if it only took 1015 days to train large specs to 5 id probably do it but between the small increase and the huge training investment it just isnt worth it
yup my bad sorryn  currentlevel  1i will update the post
im sure everyone out there has been to a fast food place lately and youve noticed how what used to be called a medium drink is now a small so when you make the mistake of ordering a large drink expecting something you could hold with one hand instead you are served a gallon of sodameanwhile here in the sci fi land of spaceshipsif you wanted to shop for an armor repper for your battleship youd look for a large or heavyif you wanted to get a capacitor battery for your cruiser youd look for a mediumif you wanted a pulse laser turret for your frigate youd look for a small or would youturns out quite a few turrets are off scale in that medium fits on frigates heavy fits on cruisers and battleship sizes are anyones guessis there a particular reason why almost every other module fits the smallmediumlarge scale but we still have several modules that clashid like to see a simple naming convention fixfrigates  smalllightcruisers  mediumbattleships  largeheavyim sure there are some synonyms we can toss in for good measure but this way there wont be as much confusion over what fits on which ship
actually they fit because the ships have powergridcpu to fit them they are in fact designed for each class as per their names but usually the smaller they are the more pointless they are to fit the only way to change it is to restrict module sizes to ship classes they are intended to fit unfortunately that would also severely nerf some well liked fits and make even more ships entirely useless
local alternativethis is a very simple idea that i dont believe would require much work to implement and just adds functionality to an existing game mechanic while solving the press nothing receive bacon status of localafter local is removed the directional scan should recieve two simple buffs in order to help people know whether there are people neararound them1 all active ships will show up as a bluecyan font on directional scanner simply put currently when you directional scan you get a bunch of ships on your list but thees no way to tell whether they are piloted or not well now the directional scanner will tell you2 cloaked ships now show up on directional scanner but with a twist if you directonal scan a cloaked ship it will show up as orange  the new directional scanner will be able to tell you the current distance of a cloaked ship but you will not be able to tell which direction the cloaked ship is coming frombasicly a player should be able to set there scanner to any distance and the cloaked player will show up as  but only when they are in range of the scan also every scan when it comes to cloaks are treated as a 360 degree scan even if a pilot narrows his scan to 30 degrees and aims it at the completely wrong direction the cloaked player will show up on the scan list this will prevent a pilot from ascertaining the true position of a cloaked ship but still let you know hes there if you scanone more thing gate cloaks should not show up on the scan list at all this is to make sure that people who jump into systems maintain their same level of relative safety they have during the 30 second gate cloakand thats my ideacross posted from fi because no one reads fi anymore anyway
the issue with popup windows that have only ok option to click to is that they freeze your whole ui until you click it away and thus have very little value unless the value is to annoy crap out of people in the gameinstead make those information appear as normal message text as used in many other server countdown timer you have entered to blahblah space where criminals are not welcome places  or better yet make a configuration option for it if in fear that someone truly truly loves that popup but the rest of us can get rid of thosealso the config option version removes the argument for the issue when the server is coming down and some want to be notified by it when they come back from the toilet but please give the rest of us a breakthanks for your time

you cant mine moon goo in high sec therefore no reason to have dreads in high sec
dreads in highsec you dont need moon goo to make this plausible there are plenty of pos after all and im sure theyd be much easier to take down with a nice dread think of all those bpc farmers and how they just continuously research and manufacture all the time thats kinda like moon goo and they have the ability to heavily impact the market while providing heavy competition for nonpos industrialists reason for dreads yesnot high on my priorities list but it wouldnt bother me if it happened
lore that hasnt mattered since 2005 all the more reason to provide a more effective method of killing enemy poses
if scs are not addressed then dreads in highsec may not be such a bad idea theyve been rather marginalized in that respect having them romp about high sec  why notof course if this happens there will be hundreds of them roaming around high sec some of them looking for tasty poses run by industrial people that could care less about pvp with gunsso i would suggest that they could not enter seige mode in high sec this will somewhat balance out the general nature of high sec activities with dread capabilities

alright first of all 165 km is not a really long range locking yourself down to improve your local tank also disables any rr you might receive and id personally like to know how you got remote reps in the low slots
its actually 15km for capital remote reps but thats still far enough to rep any ship in the undock area and the idea of the fit is that you give remote reps to ships while absorbing damage not to receive them itself unless you are thinking of pantheonspidertanking fits in which case gl killing 3 or so dreds without a good number of battleshipsalso the fit reads from low slots to high slots
well if you arent using thisi cant say for sure but im pretty sure your moros would cap out very fast trying to do all that and with the limited range on the reps in addition to being anchored it wont be that useful overall
i dont realy see a problem with this you got my votebut i would reather see them kick super caps out of low sec and let that be the main kicking grounds for none super caps
awful idea neutral rr is bad enough but at least you can send them scurrying back into station with a little dps try that with a neutral dreadif you cant take a pos down in hi sec well tough get more dps or friends they are supposed to be difficult to take downin null the moons have resources creating conflict in hi sec you have noneoh really why is that about 700 mill after insurance is peanuts compared to a full of technetium jfthe reason dreads are unpopular is because people are frightened of losing them a 200 man dread fleet although not a counter could easily kill 1015 supercarriers off field before they died the isk value is around the same but they have a time advantage now dreads are far easier and quicker to produce than supercapsthe reason you dont see dreads fielded is just through fear and not because they are not viable
can ask the exxact same question in reverseis there any valid reason to allow them backhighsec pos are almost exclusively used for invention as far as i have seen so the value of tearing them down is minimalif you want to make them easiersafer to knock down then just double the fitting requirement of all pos mods if in 05for logistics purposes i can see them making a reentry but it would be without being able to activate capital mods while there ie travel only
while i agree that you should get more use out of your dread your suggestion that it will actually help small alliances is laughable dreads can be built in 4 space out of reach from pos bashing mega alliances any alliance in empire that has the isk to build a cap fleet can do so with ease and in safety small alliances would actually be the most victimized here as they try to build assets for an eventual cap fleet only to have privateers orphanage or any number of high sec pvp wannabes use their own dreads to either extort them into poverty or pound them into submissionnot supported
stupid idea if you want to take down a pos gather a fleet thenthis change would make it impossible to any small corp to hold a pos at alltell me what could a 10 or less member corps could do vs 10 dreadssupport  like nothingas only they could fight due to concord would def the dread fleet vs anybody who isnt wardecked
lets be realistic the meta capital mods cost somewhere in the range of several hundred million isk the base version costs a paltry 30 to 50 mil which are you more likely to seewith level 5 skills it caps out in 1 minute 32 seconds but thats only if you are running absolutely everything while in triage mode a dred gets a bonus to local armor repping amount so you only have to pulse those armor reps every now and againplus most station campers just want to be kept alive long enough to deaggro and dock up when the situation turns on them this kind of dred with its massive ehp wall will greatly assist in that it cant be forced out of the fightand yeah i made a mistake on the fit typed it out manually still you know to what i was referring to
only purpose of dreads in highsec are nub highsec wars and neut repping so no thank you
or just disable capital remote reps on anything not also fitting a triage moduleit is not a matter of abilityif you find a jf full of anything that actually sticks around long enough to be targeted by a dread you could have killed it with a destroyer blobso what are the dread pilots flying carriers and supercarriers if you had a choice between a helnidhoggur and any dread would you realistically choose the dread no why would you the helnid are considered the worst of the carriers in general yet nobody would choose any of the dreads over either of them for normal pvp operationsdo you have any evidence of that dreads cost much more than carriers and carriers are just as vulnerable yet i never see a shortage of carriersyesthat doesnt mean there is no value in it some people do things for rp and not necessarily iski actually want them to be harder to knock down thus the dreads dreads will force poses to be stronger and better defendedmaybe and maybe not but doing that for dreads only wouldnt make sense since they would still be relatively uselessno not reallyif they cant handle that then they will be slaughtered in lownull anyway id consider it a test of will and practice for the real thing
hardly there are countless poses in low sec that have nothing to fear why would hi sec be so much more dangerouswell it isnt impossible to defeat that but if someone is going to run a pos valuable enough to be a target you better be able to defend it yourself i have no pity for people who deliberately avoid taking responsibility for their own safety
in lowsec most pos are in big alliances alt posession  and anybody can counter drop a dread fleet anytime without a need for wardec  ppl dont attack pos just to kill it  small money incomewith your idea in high sec nothing could threaten the dread fleet due to wardec is needed  im sure you would be a pussiest player fielding your alli dreads in high sec when you are wardecked by a larger alli who could easily counterdrop youyou would just wardec small corps and kill their posses knowing that they cant do anything at all to save it if they want help their friends have to wardec you first plenty time to  hide your dreads what is that if not the biggest deliberately avoidance taking any kind of riski know you are just another pirate wannabe who wants to blow things up without any risk involved hiding it behing some capital balance rp thing
i appreciate that all you poor dread pilots out there are saddened at your ships being made almost completely redundant by supercarriers but i dont think this is the way forwards if supercarriers are nerfed a bit especially in their posbashing capacity therell be much more for you to do
of course it is in whatever security space you are in you use the tools available there are plenty of pos in hi sec that get blown updo you actually know how to stop someone from warping away a corp mate can bump it so it never alignsyou do realise that most dreadsupercap pilots are alts and not the players mainif the nc had called for all dread pilots to get on and suicided fleets into the supercap blob when they were attacked the enemy would have no means to replace them to carry on momentum as it said it takes balls and a good reimbursement policy but it takes 2 weeks to rebuild a dread and you can make them in stations so a very cost effective way to beat a supercap blob
so in order to cater to the 05 of the population highsec rp corps you want to give the 995 remaining griefer corps a free rideas much as i want rp to matter more than it does i am not willing to chop off my limbs and sell my organs to get itonce you allow for cynos you allow carriers and dreads in both  didnt think that needed saying but meh the whole trend of biggermore being better is sucking the fun out of the game and should be discouraged in all areas kicking caps out of highsec was the best things that has ever happened for real pew in that sector since their introduction  partially been replaced by neutral rr abuse and other shenanigans but at least the playing field is relatively even
you should be wary of making assumptions they tend to make you look foolishwell to be honest the dread buff i proposed first was far more interesting and went far more to actually fixing themthat statement was in response to the allegation that dreads in hi sec is being proposed because i cant kill a pos today which is falsei wasnt aware you could bump it from jumpingyes and what the frack do you think those alts do when they arent giving away dread killmailsi am aware of the theoretical superiority of the dreadnought blob over the supercarrier blob
has it not occurred to you that griefer corps might not be willing to take the risk that they will lose these dreads ccp has indicated that it is possible to discriminate explicitly which ship can and cant use a certain cynocapitals were a mistake from the beginning but they are not going awayhi secs existance is the main problem with pvp in general
this is about the principle of spamming contracts in localwe all know spamming when we see it and posting a contract once is not the issue it is the posting it every few minutes we see in the major hubsi leave it up to the csmccp to discuss how often is considered spamming
i do ccp only has so much money and id rather them spend it on the problems before the annoyances you also have the option of blocking offenders yourself if you must look at that horrible channel laugh with glee as you nuke them on your on
technically preventing the pasting of contract links into local would be a trivial implementation
1contract scam spammer spotted
laser arent like normal ammo so i find it alright as it is however i always found it strange that when the last charge has been fired you have to wait 1 full empty cycle  reload time youd think that the ordnance system would know theres nothing left and should get to reload right away thats the most irrational thing i can see concerning ammo reload
easy answer is to discard your damaged crystals before it becomes a problem you dont have to reload at all otherwise so you never lose the 10 seconds every cycle that that entails its not like crystal have a 10 minute lifespan they last for ages and then they crap out and dieand yes other races do have to load up on 4000 rounds of faction ammo every time they go out and do something aamrr or were you forgetting that they have to put all that in cargo carry it around and every shot uses it up
to prevent abuse and keep the penalty of reload time consistant for everything except lasers of course if it were the case that reloading literally only ever took 10 seconds after the last shot was fired id slap some artillery on any battleship with 8 turret hardpoints put all my ammo inside a can and split out and reload my guns with stacks of 8 for every shot fairly sure itd be pretty brokenly overpowered that and this would benefit weapons with longer durations in general as a reload would essentially cause them to fire relatively faster and in the case of large artillery just plain faster
4000 rounds maybe 4000 rounds per turret hell no i dont know anyone that purchases 32000 rounds of faction ammunition for their artillery maelstrom but that is precisely what every apocalypse or abaddon pilot has to do for every type of crystal they bring to pvp simply because you cannot purchase them in smaller quantitiesand discarding mostlydamaged crystals does not solve the problem i described in my original post
wouldnt be that much faster as you would still have to wait for cycle completion to shoot again1400s have 20 rounds and they take about 2030s per shot so you stand to gain 10s for every 610 minutes if reload could be done from the moment it empties during cycle  not worth the insane amount of micromanagement in my world
i think youve missed the point of my proposal i never mentioned anything about the reloading that occurs when you run out of ammunition all im asking is that when you issue a command to change ammunition that its smart enough to handle the command appropriately when youre firing at something finish the current cycle spend time reloading if its not a laser and resume fire
you wouldnt be willing to double your damage by reloading every shot i bow to your laziness
new pve lowseconly content would help such lowsec missions mustscale with the number of ships ongridbe of shorter durationbe as rewarding to grinders as hisec l4s  no more no lessbe best completed in pvp fit shipsuse a sensible sleepersansha ai and change targetsnot involve standing penalties for failure regardless of whether or not they produce standing bonuses for success it would be nice if some of those missions were for pirate factions too
problem is with pirates nothing else when 10 im a pirate wannabes ganks my solo cyno frig you can see there is something bad with their playstylethey shot anybody without thought no matter how valuable the cargo is  there is no consequences at all other than gate guns shooting and they cant enter high sec not that they would want to at allpirating is dullif you want more ppl in lowsec then pirating should be made harder
title says it all we need more supers in gamewhysupercarriers exist as the next thing beyond carriers currently beyond a dread is only a titan this isnt rightmake these ships similar to titans in that they use 67 capital weapons each but they dont have to siege to get the full dps keep the dps inline with a titan minus the dd and keep the ehp exactly the same as a supercarrier this will provide an alternate option instead of forcing players into a supercarrier while still giving something for high end players to achieve as with the inability of a supercarrier to triage make these ships unable to use a siege modulei would imagine a fair base price would be around 30bil for a bpo with the min cost being 15x that of a sc keep a similar slot layout to a titan with perhaps 1 less mid and low and maybe only 1 utility highslot use the existing dreadnaught skill as supercarriers use the carrier skill make it like any other supercap with no ability to dock but immune to ewar and standard tackling give it the dread jump rangewhy is this a good thingsupercarriers use lots of drones this creates massive amounts of lag guns dont create as much lagone reason supercarriers are powerful is their ability to spidertank while doing 810k dps depending on type a superdread wont have that abilitythese would be useful for hit and run pos reinforces as well as hotdropping lone capsthese are still less cost effective than dreads in terms of the amount of dps you can output for the isk costthese allow an option for supercaps to take on battleship fleets without lagging the server to hell with fightersthese reduce the blob supercaps offer a way for an alliance to counter blobs of battleships or battlecruisers if these were turret fit theyd be very effective against large amounts of low skill players in cheap shipsone of the main reasons i would like to see a ship like this is that the only real combat type of turret based ship that comes after battleships is the titan a dreadnaught does very little dps outside of siege is unable to receive remote reps in siege and outside of tower shoots is fairly useless the advent of high dps supercarriers with fighterbombers and the change in the sov system have made dreads useless for all but reinforcing towers as supercarriers will quickly eliminate sieged dreads and a siege dread cant hit anything smaller than a capship this is also a reason to train capital turrets up as if you cant afford an 80bil titan these things are prettymuch uselessthe other thing is that this gives ccp the opportunity to add a new class of combat ships something unseen since the arrival of t3s and the supercarrier changes to an extent we all love cool new ships especially big ones that become a long term goal to train for
thumbs up excellent topic would post again all my 5s aaa grade idea
juggernauts have been suggested a few times
first i thought you were incredibly stupid but i reread we need more supers in game and realized you were trolling210
so these ships would have an advantage over scs being less laggy while having no fightersbombers less drones cost more  no corp hangarship bay no remote rep or ecmthat sounds realy balanced to me
super dreads theyre called titans

so i was watching the alliance tournament and had something like this thought why arent there more formal pvp events other than the alliance tournament with that in mind ive developed an idea for a potential second formalized pvp event the eve online premier league it would work much the same way as the football premier league in england with different divisions based on pvp skill that teams can be relegated from or promoted to tournament style pvp rules would be used the difference being the championship is decided not by a single tournament but a longer series of matches against the teams in the same division much like sports such as baseball basketball or football the kind where you actually use your feet a lot otherwise known as soccer additionally teams in the premier league would not be restricted to being formed by a single allianceany corp with sufficient resources can enter a team as such the matches might need to decrease in scope of the number of ships per team to accomodate corps over a long period of time rather than whole alliances over a short period of time there could potentially be a playoffs at the end of the premier season as well though this would be optionalas this is my very first ever proposal to the csm any and all feedback that anyone can give me will be greatly appreciated
so the issue in my corp right now is that some of the more advanced members are getting annoyed because theyre contributing 150k per mission into corp tax while the newer players are averaging about a tenth of that which isnt fair because the new guys are the ones who get the biggest advantage from our corp wallet with starter cruisersretrievers ship replacement etcid like to see tax options that give ceos the ability to set specific tax for certain different things mainly for the different levels of missions maybe mission types as wellanother thing that i think is long overdue as an option aside from corp tax is corp dues this could be in the form of a monthly or weekly bill to the members and be even across the board unlike taxes are now as an alternative way for members to contribute to the wallet
in addition to this ccp could add in a tax evasion mechanic in which the wealthy dont have to pay any taxes at allive always wanted my corporation to be america after all
i support this
could also institute welfare give a bonus 50 mission reward for l1l2l3 missions from the corp wallet
i mean itd be simple just make sure the character has over 1bil isk in their wallet and then they not longer have to be taxed none of this pesky tax stuff since theyre rich see
endercapitalg for csm
also you could have unemploymentif youve not done missions for a while you get paid 50 percent of what you were making every tick for a couple of weeks while you spin ships in your hangar
i support this man 150especially on the unemployment thing that would be fantastical
i mean sometimes i dont feel like logging in right why shouldnt i get paid isk as i pay for my account right
or you could make the unemployment coincide with real unemployment and you get paid a plex a month to still be able to play eveone word sums it up brilliant
follow goonies advices set 20 tax for every one and rent high sec belts for a few millions per month then also rent some stations and planets was forgetting anomalies but this is the extra for those renting all the systemthis will aloud you to change your side when war turns bad and have enough isk in your wallet to play lotteries
supporting morebetter tax options which are a good idea for the horror that is options and customization of the corp ui id add options for either classes or based on time period members for less than 6 months one tax over 6 months another tax rate etc any corp tax rates or brackets should be easily visible and checkable to members so they can easily see they fall in tax bracket x instead of standard rate y or bracket z changes to tax ratesbrackets should also take at minimum 24hrs to prevent ceodirector abuse changing rates while people are in the process of missioningratting the standard corp wide tax wo brackets should remain the same only the additional brackets that override or replace the standard tax need that delayjust on the issues youve mentioned you should educate your advanced members and tell them to stop complaining the new guys earning under 100k arent putting as much in as they are with their millions of isk bountiesmission payout new players are an investment either you and yours are committed to helping them out meaning putting time effort and isk to support and grow them or you arent complaining about the new players not putting in the same isk as older more experienced and capable players is pathetic it also helps breed animosity in the corp you put up with that and these advanced members obviously dont share the corp vision of growingsupporting your new members or the whole team effort why you allowed or want people in your corp that dont share the corp culture is beyond me people in your corp should mostly believe in the same thingsnot supporting corp dues this seems like poor leadershipenforcement of the corp vision if you expect people to pay to be part of your corp then demand it and if they dont pay they get booted if they want back in you charge them plus a fine for rehiring them in the corp they have to pay to be part of corp dues are better made in the form of corp ops where you require members participate at least x times a month giving ample opportunities for people to make the op since people have different schedules
wealthy pay taxes when they make money
so like a moron i used evelopedia to read up on a radar site central guristas sparking transmitter before actually entering the site the lack of information provided in the eve wiki caused me to get my ship popped i decided to add the spawns not mentioned in the article and it seems im not allowed to do this i went to the discussion tab and theres nothing there and i cant post any comments eitherso either make the evelopedia more user friendly so we can actually update some of the very poor articles or just get rid of it altogether that way players can look elsewhere for information instead of relying on a halfassed attempt at a wiki
ask your friend to light the cyno with thier main or use a cyno generator make sure you do that unscouted btw
might be a little late but it seems kinda ridiculous that this isnt an option even if theyre using the genetic tack this is the future there oughta be some dye righthence the baldness lol
1i can understand having limits on sculpting chars to stop all the races looking the same however there is no good reason for stopping people having any hair colour they likealso long hair for the male intaki  anyone else that wants it
fix blonde too take a blonde character and add a beardmustache and it looks like someone painted on your face with a oily marker the alternative being to give yourself a black or dark brown beard and yes i missed the darker hair color options for all those races that lost them
supported i miss ravenhaired kokobear
thanks
pot meet kettlehave you ask vuk where the money is go visit on of his internet cafes and enjoy the place you just might see what rmt has done for him also tell him i said good luck on that whole court thing for tax evasion seriously how much money do you have to get from rmt to get busted for that
this means i could run all my alts and get kill rights then have plenty of kms with my main char
i consider the motivation of blobbing to be partially independent of high minded virtues such as one volley kills if there is a surplus of available pilots odds are they will blobbut wait youre saying this is reducing the capability of blobs because they would need to bigger to be equally effective the increased survivability of brute force tactics such as an alpha fleet would create longer lasting combat allowing greater use of tactics and strategy ie logistics ew retreating etc this would slightly balance out numbers by allowing a more practiced fleet to handle a larger brute force fleet im still not convinced
it would also make it even harder to break a decent logistics team youd need more ships or the logistics in your opponents fleet would have a much easier time of repping the ships hit with split dps than they would if it all hit the same one on top of that youd probably make it impossible to take down caps with subcaps
i honestly dont see the problem with ecm atm their great at allowing smaller fleets to engage larger fleetsto an extent and depending on the enemys ecm ofc as their a great force multiplier yes it can be annoying if you come up against a fleet the same size with say 3 times as many ecm as you but at the same time you can say that about logistics too lol  decus
hmmm im going to have to mull this over a bit sure the easy solution in eve is always adding more ships but what im more concerned with is how it would balance outside of that variable i mean now not only are you diluting your dps with logistics ships but this kind of ship as well methinks making it a highslot now might work better its the part on subcaps vs caps that i think you got me stuck especially since i havent found a way to deal with multiple ships protecting the same ship via the module i could just abstractly say only one per targetted ship but there isnt currently an in game mechanic for that is there in the case of a single ship yeah the combined dps typically focused on a cap ship would easily overwhelm the defensive capabilities of this module in most likely one volley leaving the moduled ship defenseless beginning to get convincedin no way do you feel ecm is overpowered in comparison to the other ew in all honesty i do kinda like ecm too butalright keep up the criticism

i support making the cq optional let us dock into the normal hanger and then go to the cq only if when want to

edit pirate faction isntead of all faction shipsspeaking of low hanging fruit proposal treat pirate faction ships as t2 ships for entrance requirements into fw plexes doing this one simple thing will make t1 frigs t1 destroyers and t1 cruisers relevant again and will allow lower sp poorer players to be competitive in an arena originally designed to allow them to have a chance
i know what you are trying to do and agree with it on some level but it will have unintended consequences at least for me and mine amarr onlyno minor would ever see a frigate it will be all destroyers all the timeall mediums would be flooded with caracals ruptures and bbs  simply because nothing comes close in efficiencyfaction would also include the navy hulls which were made for fw so it becomes a one step forward two back type of thing hint exclude navy and you got my support 
i agree make it so only pirate faction ships are treated as t2 otherwise i fully support this idea  anything to make plexing fairer for those that cant afford the fancies it wont fix plexing by any means but its a good start
excluding navy frigates gives you rp consistency but doesnt actually solve the problem  a fight between a plain t1 frigate and a decent faction frig is going to be every bit as stupidly unbalanced as a fight between a plain t1 frigate and a dram or af and from a roamers perspective itd still be annoying to be out in an af or intie and see a comet or firetail or we hiding out in a plex i couldnt get into id far rather have the minors broken out into two tiers  one that admits only plain t1 frigate hulls and one that will admit any frigate or destroyer hull t1 t2 or pirate faction
i cant win personally i would rather see all faction ships treated as t2 but the cold hard facts are that while navy faction frigs are a bit overpowered the navy cruisers are not especially the lower tier cruisers nobody will say a navy vexor is better than an ishtar ok somebody might but theyd be lying and the navy exe suckshowever pirate faction ships are better across the board than their t2 counterparts and should definitely be bumped up to t2 levels wrt plex entrance requirements
i hate how the good ideas tend to drown throwing out the life ring
yes it does
all you had to do was read the post above yours but i will repost the part you missedto head off the current character sales argument there is one big piece of the equation that is removedsomeone had to invest the time to train the character being sold it doesnt matter if they never undocked the toon it doesnt matter if they never did anything but switch skills it still took time attention and effort from a player
sure but not the player who bought it they stepped into a 14day trial subbed plexed and bought a character with anywhere between 4 and 100 million sp because they could they probably went out after that plexed again bought 3 cap ships 2 orcas 5 cnrs and a ton of faction modules too match they didnt work for any of it ingame
this is false someone in the past had to spend time to make that character even if they never undocked that character was trained over time that character evolved through normal game mechanics even if they never undocked in the most obvious terms someone had to go earn the isk to pay for that characters skill booksperhaps that character was a subscribed account or a plexed account it doesnt matter when someone uses plex to buy isk to buy that character the isk used to do the purchase of the character was also earned in the game someone spent their time and effort to gather that isk they went out played the game took the risks and got the rewards two things created in the game by ingame means are being exchanged a character and isk the external factor that facilitated the trade was the plex but the plex in no way impacted the potential productive capacity of the ingame worldmt is not like this someone purchases a plex for cash and aurumifies it buys a mt gizmo and then sells that for isk the only means for that gizmo to enter the game is the cash no in game effort time or risk was expended to create itpersonally so long as it is just some vanity thing i could really care less but it is when and if a useful functional element is introduced that has no other source other than cash we have a problem if this happens the overall productive capacity of the ingame world is directly impacted and influenced by forces that can not be initiated by ingame means this will happen with dust it is a logical certainty by all accounts of the tid bits of information we are able to get at this time how much impact it has well just have to wait and see
i honestly have no problem with dust using mts since its ftp at least as far as iv come to understand
problem is that dust is going to impact our 00 sov mechanics which by proxy is allowing rl mt to do what ccp has said they wont it will allow rl mt in eve one universeone warnot to mention at the rate ccp is going it wont take much for them to flip the switch and do it full blown in eve
fair pointhowever we dont know how dust players will effect sov we just know they will their effect could be a minor one such as slightly improving well in the negative direction truesec or it could be something major we dont know yet and when eve players dont know something they tend to make a lot of worst case theories
whatever the impact will be no matter how minor it will have an impact on eve game play this directly conflicts with ccps statement regarding  for advantage in eve the worst part of it all is that it does open the door ever so slightly for ccp to bring a money store crashing in to eve proper based on the upcoming vanity mts and the lack of ccp response in the feedback threads they made them just for this purpose to address the communitys concerns it would appear that we are heading down the road to money stores in eve no confirmations no denials no explanations bad combo
t3s were just used as a placeholder in the example their cost is irrelevant the point is that items in the virtual goods store have both a aur and isk priceeconomic interactions even in a simplified case like the eve economy are maddeningly complex whether incarna translates into a plex price spike or a collapse increased volatility or a slow movement or some bizarre combination is entirely unclear my impression is that the good dre would prefer that whatever happens it happens relatively slowlyi share your concern on the abstract level but ccp is a business and the point of that business is not to produce the best space mmo evah it is to make lots of money if that can be done by making the best space mmo evah great  but never forget that doing so is a means not an endthis is not to say that everyone at ccp is a soulless moneysucking leech as individuals they are not except for ccp flying scotsman but hey hes scottish he cant help it in the abstract they too want to make the best space mmo evah but while we play in eve they have to live in the real world and put food on the tableso if you truly think that mt is horrible then you need to help the csm make good arguments as to why not doing something like nonvanity mt or doing something else instead is going to put more isk in hilmars secret underground money playpit
i appreciate you following this threadthere are several good arguments against mt vanity or nonvanity i will mention 21 loss of subscriptions the threads are full of people stating they will quit if mt goes beyond vanity only is this just emorage maybe but i know that i will take a long hard look at leaving the game myself if nonvanity mt happens no you cant has my stuffzwould the  generated by mt balance this out in the long run or would it only be a short term boostwill adding mt attract new customersmore importantly will these be the type of customers that will be interested in doing the time consuming things you have to do in eve sov grinding standing griding isk grinding market trading even travelling through the universe can be very time consuming eve is not an instant gratifaction game you have to work for your happinesslolwill these new customers be the ones that are dedicated enough to actually train a character real time or will they emorage quit because they cant power level overnight2 mt even vanity items are immersion breaking below is a snipet from my earlier postthe same can be said of selling modules in the mt store you are removing the players and their connection to the game selling items in the mt store only is very immersion breaking in this regard a player wasnt involved in the followingtraining the skills to build the itemgathering the material to build the itembuilding the itemhauling the item to marketselling the item on the marketabsolutely no inclusion for the player removing player inclusion in the process also removes the players ownership and sense of accomplishment in the results eve isnt about having an easy button eve is about reaping the rewards of your effortif hilmar has to fund his underground money playpit thenraise my subscription price by 12 dollars a month i would pay a bit extra on each of my accts to keep mt away the crack addict must have his crack
i appreciate the business argument but you are forgetting one thing here were not talking about just any business or a game design studio with a seperate publisher or even a company which has multiple services active and in balance were talking ccp herethroughout the years i am sorry to say and i can understand this may bite a little bit ccp has increasingly decreased the strength of its brand integrity towards customers that it has managed to maintain that integrity on a publishing and presentation level is a given that is fine ultimately however there is more to business than just the sale and this is a tradition of fixation which ccp have created for themselves if they were selling cans of soup  retail  i would not worry but its a service and ccp has ample precedent of simply saying one thing and doing its own thingthat is ccps prerogative obviously that does not mean it should not worry the current customer nor does it mean that it should not worry the john or jane doe ccp staff member below the executive there is this fun little argument of hiding the cost of sales throughout divisions and ventures yet at the end of the day cost of sales is just one factor faced when engaged in an ever faster going cycle of replacing elements of a customer base dont get me wrong that is normal but the speed and various costs of it should be monitored ccps metrics there public and as we have seen over the years internal does not give any credence nor confidence thereim sorry but where it comes to the strategic direction and the necessity to balance that step by step in conceptualisation and research on product development ccp is starting to drop the ball do not misunderstand this for some sort of slippery slope point of presence that is not the case on the contrary it is becoming clear that in spite of a lot of words and fancy talk ccp on a strategic level does not just do what it does for strategic reasons in many parts the strategic objectives are ok but the underlying argumentation is absent and thus lolexecutionno i know theres a lot of presentation that it is there but please forgive me for saying this but unfortunately ccp has built up a nearly reflexive tradition rooted in only a few parts of its organisation where the only validation ultimately needed is awesome regardless of the cost for customers staff short term long term and so forth think of the technical debt it is not the only type of debt which existsas for csm i am sorry considering the statements of mr mittens in regards to rmt and considering its modus operandi i just cannot see this csm even asking any tough questions whatsoever this csm neither will nor can do much as its chairman in collusion threw out its instrumentation csm6 is not a democracy its a cheerocracy at gunpoint of troll and spamit should be clear by now that ccp as a company has long decided to change the functioning model beneath eve that they do not see this from an internalised view is clear considering ample precedent it is however also unfortunately quite likely that they just do not give much about it at all in spite of the love and care of those who actually work on the product eve a year ago a lot of people including folks in mainstream and industry media expressed concern about ccps strategic views on the question of what to do with eve and equally expressed concern over how ccp was stretching itself not in size of company but in absence of simple processes best practices realism between presentation and delivery and across a multitude of projects for which eve continues to function as just something that feeds cash and shares resourcesit is becoming clear now eve is just only a topic for cash understandable but that does mean that the baby is dead and yes it also means that the old disconnects internal are rapidly coming back in force
no sane person uses shield boostersrepairers on transport ships so none trains this skill beyond level 1 wouldnt bonuses like this be more useful and actually encourage players leveling this skill beyond level 1x warp speedorx to all shieldarmor resistancesor x agilityor x velocityor other things which would increase the transport ability
yes i too would like a fleet of cruiser sized dreads that fit through a wormhole to terrorize the neighbours pos with

your talking about somthing thats only real use would be against ships you dont see in high sec so make the bombs major illegal cargo cause hell it would make sense concord and the empire would try and stop someone flying a massive bomb through their territory kinda like how they dont want titans and whatnot going through so there hi sec jita problem solved mostly still i think an orca could smuggle them in in corporate hold or is that also customs susceptible an the onl time frienly fire would happen is if you had a moron undock when you hopefully announced you were undocking with a bomb and if that was the case he would be a dumbass and doesnt need to be in a corp
concord can remotely disable cloaks i am sure they can have dampening field to avoid accidents
id say give it to destroyers they already dont get enough love they need the boost

mr r4nd0m talks out of his 4r53
not supported  it gives too big of an advantage to older players you get diminishing return for your investment the farther up you go this makes it so that you dont get the huge dichotomy between older players and newer players you spend 15th of the time for 80 of the benefit  tbh this is part of why i like eve as opposed to games like wow where abilities go up exponentially the longer you play
thats the whole point of this system as you advance trough the game every extra sp is much less significant then it used to be which is what allows new players to catch up or close enough to it anyway since at that point the really old vets are spending a month on 2 for a single weapon type
you may be right but i still think vets should have a leg up without needing an officer fit nightmare to get it plain fact skills should mean something a 5 year old toon properly trained should outstrip a newb rather than die to 3 vs 1 odds against 2 week old charatersedit likely this would also make a difference in how many supercaps and caps were fielded vs subcaps in nullsec if having a very well trainined battleship actually meant something more people would continue flying them instead of needing a supercap to make 1 vs 1 odds seem good
whythe vets advantage lies in having a very big arsenal of ships to choose from so he can pick the best ship for the job his experience and skill and the wealth he has accumulated during the years
im reasonably certain that medium beam lasers were not designed for cruisers this is a contributing factor to eves learning curve so you can expect people to defend it like rabid dogs in the name of not dumbing things down as such i wouldnt expect any luck with this otherwise reasonable petition
if you take away the ability to fit an extra large shield booster on my maelstrom i will thump youin all due seriousness the names are more like guidelines i see them as a way for new players to quickly identify modules that should work with the ship theyve chosen nothing more
exactly i mean just because the sign says no diving in the shallow end does taht mean if i try some wall will pop up with cant let you do that written on it i dont think so if i wann put something over or udersized on my deathcruiser or lolfrig i will
the amount of reading comprehension failure contained within most of the above replies is astoundinghes talking about how strange it is that small pulse lasers are actually named medium pulse laser i while for every other module in the game medium means medium beam lasers are oddlynamed the same way theres also the same thing where medium blasterslasers are named heavy but several large things are also named heavy hes proposing more consistency in naming things in accordance to their size and it has nothing to do with fitting ships with oversized or undersized anythingseriously can you people read facepalm
figured he was talking about fitting requirements and module sizes when you look on the market you are looking under the appropriate tab whether its got a weapon called heavy in it or not just a minor misunderstanding but i see your point i suppose i probably even wondered about it myself at one timeps xlarge shield booster is intended for a bs there just happens to be two sizes is all they have capital shield boosters for anything larger
not a bad idea but id modify it a bitid allow the cloaked ship to show up in grey font with its type loki buzzard raven etcthe cloaked ship would show up directionally on any scan from 360 degrees to 60 degrees 60 degree scans would not reveal it and this could be explained by the cloaked vessel detecting the scanner and electronically acting to counter it directlyi like the idea of blue font for the active ships and i might even go so far as to allow orange and red fonts for ships piloted by outlaws and ships piloted by gccs respectively technically they are flagged through the ships signature so there is no reason for that not to be possible except maybe in nullsec take that or leave it as you wish the rest is goodedit and yes that means i have no objection to the removal of automatic updating of local in nullsec and perhaps even lowsec highsec local should remain of course and i can see other game changes making local visibility in lowsec optional such as allowing pirates to bribe system officials to remove local shut down gate guns and the likei want to see eve become a more dynamic game despite my predeliction for being on the right side of the law i see no reason why there shouldnt be options for those that arent to make the game more interesting
the point of a cloaked ship is to not be seen having cloaked ship types show on the dscan totally removes the fear of having a hostile in local i for one do not want my target to know that i am in a black ops ready to drop a covert cyno i also do not want my capital ship target to know that i have a cloaky dictor in system waiting to pounce when he makes a mistake i also dont want my targetvictim at the jump bridge to know that my stealth bomber is in system until i launch the bomb at the juicy hauler on the jump bridge capital ship pilots also will not like the idea that d scan will let the targets know that there are 3 titans and 20 moms cloaked and waiting to strike in system the cloak adds a huge element of danger and that element of danger is what 00 is all abouttotally in favor of removing local in 00 though only down side to it is that it would potentially create more scouting alts removing local would feed the kill machine which is fine by me and my pvp toon if they do remove local the tears will be legendary
wouldnt be much of a cloak if they can see you on dscan and have your distance now would it what about wormholes
even cloaking devices can have a signature of some sort what they effectively do is mask ship signatures and displace the ships mass with regards to light presumeably they bend it or use shield emitters to obscure the ship from sight in some fashion if you actually looked out a window at one you would see the light displacement against the backdrop of a planet or moon in all likelihoodno reason to believe that it wouldnt be possible to at least partially detect them even if by no other means than a hole in your sensor sweep i can see implementation for this though perhaps youre right in that the actual identity of the ship would remain unknown its quite reasonable to assume that the ship id would be masked as well though you might determine typereally for all the 20k years advancement of technology sensors in eve are horribly unreliable
things are still little we need to push to have cyno effects changed come on people pass it along
antipriacy vs piracy and the sec status systemi have been antipirate for the entire four years i have played eve i have no desire to become pirate or even go global on targets if i dont have to i have taken breaks from the game due to my frustration with this there is no direct benefit to being an antipirate except that you can fly in highsec this is wrong no offense to pirates as i understand it is a way of playing but there are much more benefits for being pirate than being antipirate and its very hard for people who live in low sec not to lose security status trying to fight piratesfirst off i believe the security status system needs a rework starting with some simple logical fixes1 empire factions do not support piracy thus pirate players should not be able to join the militia straight up and simple2 corporations should have a security status or concord standing just like they do with corp and faction standings even if an entire corp is 10 you still have to gcc there poses in lowsec in order to shoot them this change will allow players to shoot their poss and anchored cans furthermore the sec status should effect all players in that corporation so that one  5 in an entire corporation of 10s cant just fly around as they wish without being able to be fired upon this also would be the fix for pirate corporations joining the militia3 you should not gain sec status from 00 npcs especially in sov space right now as easy as it it to lose sec status it is to gain it if your willing to go out to 00 and true antipirates and pirates dont generally fly in 00 in 00 there is supposed to be no or very little concord influence so why can you even gain sec status in 00 if you can not even lose it bounties are understandable however as you are killing a wanted npc character but its not like your doing it in empire controlled space thus its not like your helping the security of the system for the empire it simply does not make sense4 players should gain sec for killing 5 and below as they lose sec for shooting 5 and abovethe math on this is dicey to ensure it is not abused but i could kill neg tens all day long and not get a sec status gain for it and if i wanted to gain sec have to find some npcs somewhere to kill it simply does not make sense the trick would be getting it so that 10s killing each other does not allow sec status gain5 there is little or no deference in a 04 system to a 01 when it comes to npc antipirate aidi really dont know how to fix thisbut a 04 system should be safer than a 01 theoretically and that is really where most of the pirate forces are on the edge of low sec the only thing i can think of is npc ship deployments on 04 gates when someone gcc much like the rats that show in highsec when you just into a caldari system and you are in the mini militia it could even be a benefit to pirates to kill these they could drop something or what not also killing npc pirates in a higher security system should warrant more sec status gain as the npcs pirates are invading deeper into space concord obviously cares more about or the reverse could be said 01 is helping concord more until you reach 00 where there is no influenceim tired of having to gcc poses and people that with pirate organizations and lose my sec status because of it and have a hard time getting it back up especially in low sec where most antipirates and pirates live i also know plenty of other antipirates feel like i do some even within electus matari a well known antipirate organization there is simply no real benefit to being an antipirate these days its frustrating aggregating and makes me and plenty of other people i know enjoy the game much lessneonmetallic dragons

i mean why not youre already validating to yourself why people should be allowed to buy ships out of thin air with  so how about it ccp lift the restrictions against rmt i could probably make a good bit of cash off my two characters and youve just shown that you are all about the idea
they already are allowed in havent you seen the veldnaught seriously though i dont know on this on the one hand it would be a nice to see some new ships since i dont spend a lot of time in null on the other hand the simple power of dreads would potentially  current hs combaton the other hand i would love to loot from a dread that dies outside jita
yeah they were allowed from the very beginning but after banning capital assemblies in highsec with some restrictions like no combat use etc but with recent changes you even cant trade your capital in highsec
think about all those third rate alliances that are funded by 3 man invite only corpshow would they every survive if dreads were popping off their untouchaposes in hisec
ban needs to go furtherthey should be excluded from all sovereign space
no
yes because freighter pilots need an extra set of fear every time they see sieged dreads out side of 44
no idea i dont know of any of those
actually i know plenty of bored privateers that attack pos for no other reason than to kill it ive also seen pirates from lowsec temporarily set up a pos in a wormhole for logistics just to destroy a pos or two that was already there and ive seen evidence of people who simply wardec just to destroy a pos for griefing purposes its not exactly uncommonedit if i supported the idea of dreads in highsec it would be conditional on siege mods not being useable there
its sometimes a pain in the  when you happens to have a conversation or want to read the latest smacktalkonly solution should be a little window that could be turned of and on with a list of the local contractsput on there by contractors or generated in a automatic wayanybody who spams the local chat could be petitioned and a gm could warn or even tempban somebody
to be honest the simplest solution would be to have a trade chat channel that you can set to auto join once you reach a market hub system that should separate the spam from local sure it wont stop the botting but it is easier to implement technically
are you bothered by the spam in trade hubsor are you bothered by the spam of contracts in trade hubsbecause a certain amount of the spam isnt contract related at all and thered be lots of ways for the contract spammers to get around restrictions such as decribing the contract verbatim and linking people to the relevant pilots bioif you want to put a stop to the small number of people talking a whole lot in popular channels thats a whole other thing because people do have genuine conversations in local too
why cant they do something like thisif not a local chat window  do whatever you want elseif local chat channel
i have no idea what i pushed but it chopped me off  let me rewriteif not a local chat channel do what you wantelseif public local channel if linked contract shown in past 3 minutes cant show else  can showendifu get the idea  if basically a contract was linked in the past 3 or 5 min or something  u cannot relink it in local
supercarriersnerfing damage on supercaps reduces thier ability to perform thier capital killing rolea better solution is to make them more killable regardless of the numbers of them on fieldso easier to catch  increase allign timenow the important partreduce hp by 30 but stop doomsday weapons from working against supercapsmy ideas arent finalized or well structured but all i see atm in these forums are supercap pilots whining about nerfs and non supercap pilots supporting every nerf thread they findwe are looking to balance supercaps here remember if supercarriers are too severely nerfed they once again will become pos ornaments thier ability to kill capitals needs to be maintained whilst reducing thier ability to engage subcaps effectivelyremember the main issue here is that gangs of 20 supercaps are overpowered killing a single supercarrier isnt hard but introduce the rr of other supercapitals and they become unkillable  and this is what we need to fixi hope this opens some eyesrock
in all reality the main mechanic that needs to be looked at is the logoff timer no one is afraid to use their supercaps if they have a fleet of 30 or more because the most they can loose to nonsupers is 4 or 5 for most alliances that can field that many 4 or 5 is an acceptable amount to loose if ccp made it to where if any ship is tackled it doesnt disappear until either tackle is lost or the ship is destroyed some alliances would think twice about using themto rebuff some arguments that will arise from this ccp has said that client side connection issues are not under their control and are not reimbursable
very few supercap pilots would consider this an acceptable loss not without killing at least this many enemy supercaps your nerf doesnt solve anything reducing hp makes them easier to kill within a 15 minute logoff timer however in groups like you find in most fleet fights they will still have 90 resists which means rr is just as effective on them so how do you overcome rr there are four standard methods apply more dps than they can rep but you havent changed their resists ewar out the rr cant cause of ewar immunity neut out the rr its prohibitively difficult to nuet a group of scs or alpha stike which is easier with lower hp but near impossible without titan dds for your next suggestion please keep in mind the two major problems of scs 1 the lack of vulnerability their amazing dps is not the problem its that they can apply it without any penalties or vulnerabilities their nearlyunlimited drone bay means they can select the right drones for the job and can take on any ship nearly any structure better than anything else in the game additionally their lack of siege coupled with the ability to efficiently destroy any and all wouldbe tacklers makes them near invulnerable 2 scalability one or two supercarriers does have some vulnerabilities rr can keep a group of hics alive while they tackle a sc and you can nuet one or two out however in small groups 410 these vulnerabilities disappear as they can project significantly more dps their rr abilities exponentially grow without limit and they are just sickeningly efficient at destroying any ship or structure by the time you reach 10 scs you need a similar number of supercaps to kill them the nerf that will come should make it vulnerable to subcaps by limiting the drones it can carry limit its scalability by reducing the amount of rr it can receive or change its utility by limiting the types of targets it can engage
hilike the title states i would like to read your positivenegative comments and ideas about changing the cyno skillmake skill requirements match ships like reconsconspronsyour thaughtsedit  kerrisone edited thx
whytrial accounts cannot train cynosural field theory
i think recon level requirements for a skill like that are excessively high to be honest making it require 23 weeks of prior training wouldnt be an off idea though say electronic upgrades v prereq
how is that a problem now that you can create a trial buy a plex for it and get a new one back trough buddy program when you use it and then sell that new plexi dont really think cyno skill requirements changing would have a big impact they will still be insignificant compared to getting the cap pilot
hi there im trying to get onto the singularity test server and for some reason my accounts both keep getting denied access this is the message im receivingboth of my accounts are completely active on tranq server and so i am very confused could someone please offer some enlightenment on this issue if this is the wrong place to voice my concern then i do appologise but i couldnt find another forum post that reffered to the same issuemany thankspersonal information removed zymurgist
you really shouldnt be posting your account names
wrong place to put it contact customer supportremember to ask mods to deletelock this thread
i would guess if you let them expire at any point since those last logis that the sisi build is using the data from when they were not active sisi is setup with data at a certain point and after that it is no longer accurate to tranquilityif your accounts never expired then i dont know what it is maybe ask in the testing forum or file a petition
your character names are enough to look up information on you  also you may have better luck posting in this thread for help with singularity account activationmoved from assembly hall
no i didnt post 4 just nitpicking and discussing nowsure i would but that is not what would happen if reloads happened during cycle guns will still have to complete each and every cycle so rof remains the sameif they cycled off instantly upon empty then yes damage would increase dramatically for guns like l artillery by microing reloadsbut the idea is to be able to give a reload order at any point and having the stopwaitreloadstart sequence become automated it is already halfway there as you can give reload command during redflash after a target is lostdestroyed but it is not possible to do it manually by deactivating and then reloading  manual deac forces you to wait for cycle completion
i was originally referring to thiswhich implies he thinks reload should begin immediately after ammo runs out which would indeed create the possibility of drastically increasing artillery dps and would cause inconsistencies in the relative penalty of reloading depending on weapon duration
sorry thai ndee secretary in eve to  i can run true spell cheker but hee nit shows wath exactly ineed to change only shows that i need to change someting but i dont know wath to change never lerned english i writing how i hear its right 
youll make people leave high sec to null sov big alliances safer than high sec or leave the gamegood work your idea is really impressive and the whole community will join me to thank you for this grat idea
i hope you are joking
what of they just removed the no remote rep penalty from siege mode on current dreads i bet if they could be rrd during siege theyd have better survivability and be more useful for tearing down scs you still have the problem that an sc can move out of range but its a start i guess
apparently the alliance tournament is speshul
holy cheese what manner of ststorm have i stepped inexcept im not proposing a full on arena pvp system the eve online premier league would be more exclusive and not just anyone could waltz in and have an arena match it would be restricted to teams established officially in the league im not sure on how the establishment process would work but im sure it could be worked out in such a way as to not confirm the fears of the omfg it would break sandbox pvp people

with the new captains quarters you get a kickin rad wall mounted tv but all it shows are boring repeats about stuff in game clearly what you want after a long day of being a fierce pirate in low sec is to come home to your captains quarters and watch your pirated animes in fact we should have a bit torrent control in the ship hud so you can pirate while you pirate
poo
anime is cartoons
i use my noob alt to steal mission loot from mission runners and when they kill him  i get a kill rightsi then wait until that mission runner starts up a new mission a day or 2 later i then warp my loki into the mission and accept the contract for the kill right while im 10km away from him decloak and pew pew not to mention that the mission rats will do most of the actual work for me scoop the mission fit loot and laughother than situations like this  i believe that the bounty system needs a lot of love
why are you comparing ecm to the rest of ewar they do not all need to be the same
i fully support this topic the pos mechanics need to be fixed as they are clunky and frustrating to bother with on good daysedit i live out of a pos in wh space and as it stands i have no way to find explore the incarna content if pos mechanics were fixed to let me do so honestly id be tickled to death or whathave youor at least let us build gorramn stations in wspace kthx
yes
yes
tempest and tempest fleet need 78 guns with rof bonus and tracking or falloffi prefer tracking bonus making it dedicated arty platform and only mini ship with tracking bonusvargur excludedthat way apoc and abaddon can be sub par using artys as they should be and not making me puke at terrible state of tempestall short range weapons should get nerf in range bar blasters so gal ships can be usable again and long range guns become more usablesorta that
so how did your may summit go did u recommend any ship changes to ccp
in addition to many of the other things suggested here many of which i support i would like to propose halving the cpu used by all reactors and silos this to bring down the entry level for reactions to generally improve the sanityquality of life of reaction pos keepers and to allow more reacting the purpose of which is beyond the scope of this post

welcome to the darkside kerrisone here is yet another thread full of people upset with mt give it a look it is worth the readships for   general discussion thread
i dissagree strongly with this in fact i think the opposite is true the trend in fpss is having more rpg elements in player character progression especially games like bfbc2 and the cod series they have semipersistant stats and leveling for players and this makes those games far more popular not less fps players are asking for more complex systems in their games the only thing that is missing is more persistance which is where ccp is way ahead of the curve and in a unique position from what i understand when you are in your war bargepersonal quarters youre in your civies and you dont haven anything with you but your trophies maybe equipment is all modular and assembled on the battlefield so when you jump clone to where the match is you pick a setup and whenever you call in a vehicle or chose a weapon it is assemble to your spec on the spot also from what ive read supplies will be delivered to planets via eve players so if the planet is blockaded maybe some of your fits are restrictedfunny i play all of those games myself and ive been playing eve since beta elitist much that is more than a little generalized i think that would likely describe a vast majority of eve players as well i think its a little naive to think that the majority of eve players play nothing but eve all the time
edited to be more concise and easily implementedthe way that mission rewards are now split for fleets is underwhelming to say the leastof the 3 available rewards there areisk rewards loyalty pointscorp standingas it stands these 3 rewards are heaped into one big pilemy proposal would also allow you to decide if you want to share all 3 types of rewards or if you only want to share one or twoan example would beyou and 5 friends fleet up and take on a mission upon turn in you choose to keep all the corp standings but share the loyalty points and isk rewardswell thats the system its more fair and gives the mission runner far more control over what he gives his fleet members rather than an all or nothing approach and lets him choose which if any of his 3 rewards he wants to sharequestions
change something that barely matters from simple to complicatedorbe the classic eve dbag and kick the people you dont like from the fleet for turn inoronly run with people youre actually willing ot split withordont splitseveral other options already exist and there are more fortunately none of them actually matter much
proposal edited and simplified
a lot of people want wtz and some hate the idea saying you should play your game i say theres nothing you can do in transit anyway except take forever and use the facilities and be vulnerable most ships used for hulling have little to no capabilities do defend themselves and in some cases there so slow it ads an 30 mins to an hour on travel time or it seems like it in my opinion wtz should be in the game however i feel that it would be fair to make it a skill meaning that if you want wtz you have to earn it unskilled  15km autopilot programming i  10km autopilot programming ii  8kmautopilot programming iii  5km autopilot programming iv  0km autopilot programming v  include auto docking  waypoints
im sure we could also make moving the ship at all tier 10 skill and initiating warp too after all we dont want noobs to fly their ships too early
havent heard a single person complain about it for several years until you came along leads me to believe the problem is with you and not the systemcamping is lame and already way too easy so most definitely does not warrant a boost and inserting wasted time just for the hell of it is neither here nor there
pointless not supported there are a multitude of important things to spend dev time on
i suspect the first and second replies misunderstood the point of the op  not sure i agree with it but hes suggesting a boost to autopilot allowing it to warp closer to the gate with increased skill level  not a nerf to existing wtz mechanics
not supportedthere is supposed to be a benefit of traveling manualy the benefit is that you get to your destination faster since you can wtz when doing so if you have something expensive to haul then you shouldnt be autopiloting anyways but travel manualy and by doing so help to protect your investment by reducing the chance of getting suicided
wtz is an abomination and is one of the biggest factors in eve pvp issues today but arbitrarily inventing new skills for something we already have is even worse
i didint knowed that scaner now shows cloucked ships  tink befor write
the same questio nto you siting afk cloucked in system how its that enjoument off the game 
the enjoyment comes from the reactions of people like you
given the ease of flying the assault frigates you need to have some way of keeping them flying in such large groups that they alpha a super cap increased risk to caps is great but having them provide the same risk titan vs a carrier has because you jump 50 man assault frig gang into the battle is stupidplay with the idea and find a balance if you over due something like this you will basically put super capitals definitely back into afk mode and most likely push standard capitals into rare fleets which leads to the world of slow sub cap sovpos grinding
well i think i formed the idea enough so you cant simply warp in and alpha a super lets say the missile does 1 structure damage per hit that means you need to bring 100 assault frigs that do nothing other then fire its missile not to mention how many times are you in a fleet fight with just 1 super on the fieldthink about it this way your a cap fc are you going to drop your cap fleet on a fleet that has a hundred dedicated cap killers on grid or are you going to wait for your support fleet to thin them outthe part i think really makes this weapon system is that its a dumb fire missile you still need to hit the target evade its defensive fleet and reposition again for another attack run
because of falconsure are a lot of falcon alts in this threadmy main is 10 days from a level iv recon ships falconnot going to be training it though id feel dirty
after the range nerf i cant really say i see a lot of falcons around tbh at least not compared to how many of them there used to be
there are more rapiers boughtused than falcons  it is strange that the speed race field as many or even more high tech recons than the ew racesolution nerf the imba op perma webbing matar recons it is just ridiculous how i dont have any chance at all to fight back no point using drones as they can also be disco sick of ships where you can do feck all to defend yourselfits been proven rapiers pretty much permaweb there is no chance baseits wrong
why is the market limited to regions i can acces pi over 5 regions but cannt buy ammo in jita there would be no more need to look on evecentral for information that should be availible in the game or to jump to the next region to check the prices therewe have already filters for the market that are useful and will handle the mass of orders and this maybe will avoid the 1000 time overprized sells and 001 isk buyorderswhat do you think about ita universe wide market with good filters ftw stable prices less overprized sell orders becuase of higher pressure on sellers good buy orders because of higher demand no more jumping or internet research for good prices performance issuessimply a logical question too why pi in entire universe but no market in entire universe
i wouls like to see some kind of drop down menu like in contracts to select regions for price check
why is your proposal limited to damage there are lots of science and industry skills that only give a small linear bonus for the exponentially longer training time imagine if this method was applied to manufacturing material efficiencies and time efficiencies im sure this wouldnt give an overwhelmingly large advantages to highly skilled manufactures rather than the small advantage they currently get for such long training ques what about ewar effectiveness training the last level of turret destabilization or signal suppression takes several weeks but it would suddenly be worthwhile if they got exponential increases in the effectiveness of tds and sensor dampeners wouldnt it be neat if a celestis could damp a recon to 10 kms lock range and if an arbitrator could make a hurricane unable to hit an orbiting supercarrier what about leadership skills why should someone who trained all those long fleet boosting skills to level 5 only get a small extra bonus wouldnt the game be better if having a fleet boosting command ship gave exponentially increased bonuses think how much 200km web and point ranges would boost game strategies imagine rr on dramielsized bss sporting 90 resists sarcasmdiminishing returns is an extremely important feature of this game its necessary to every aspect of game balance i can understand your desire to increase the bonus that a level 5 skill provides but the level of boosts your suggesting are way overboard basically skill training time increases at an exponential rate for a linear increase in bonus stick to this formula not supported
ccp designed the skill system so that vets would have more versatility over newer players not more powerwhile i dont mind the idea ccp would also say that the purpose of the skills as they are is so to get that extra 2 requires dedication most stop a 4 because there are more beneficial skills to train than wasting a month of an l5 skill that only gives you 2your way would see less versatility as to be able to compete you would have to train to 5 nearly every time especially with weaponsalso to intact this system would cause complete chaos among any players that werent vets due to the bonus that currently exist at the levels they exist at are all that allows them to use certain ships and modules they currently usestill ill support this because i like chaos and something more worthy to work for
as it stands the jukebox is designed to work best with the eve playlistwhen you proceed through a warp gate the song changes up to create an appearance of dynamic musicthe problem is that it does this with your own playlists as wellhow many of us have been doing a mission listening to a song and jamming along and then upon activating a warp gate the game stops your song and launches you into a track on the eve playlistwhat im proposing is that ccp give us the ability through a check box on the jukebox perhaps that allows us to disable this dynamic track changeup
reasonable
thanks i love how many people have read this but not said anything good or bad about it like cp im afraid this particular section of the forum is broken people only really reply when the thread is a troll or you go off half ed complaining about something thats already happeningthe fact is many good proposals that would improve game experience get ignored and left to vanish into obscurity while threads about crap that we all know will never get resolved due to ccps thickheaded ways linger on like a bad smell for months and accrue tons of rebuttalworst part is the new csm which i support like many csms before it rarely comes in to say anything making them about as involved in the section designed for them to hear us as ccp is in their own suggestion section of the forumfact is people if youre going to ignore stuff that can improve the game just because it isnt something you care about personally you might as well hang it upthis idea has merit and is low hanging fruit say something
simplebut maybe add those tracks to default playlist so if someone likes them he can listen to them
supportedid really like to use the jukebox when missioning but the fact that it automatically changes track whenever i activate a warp gate really annoys me at least give us the option to disable this behaviour without turning music off entirely
a good idea although this is more of a bug report than a feature requestit surely cant be intended to work that way
supportedthis bug in the jukebox is absolutely annoying
supportedone of the reasons have muted my jukebox even after the playlists were introducedalso jukebox should support internet radio streams
sometimes you want to listen to music and not the eve music for the 1000th time
why not just use your own media player like a normal person
supported sounds like another papercut
compare owners of yellow skulls to shop lifters and reds to murderers  one is a fine or community service and the other is hard time or task of helping to clean up a rough neighbourhoodhave you ever tried repairing more than a few digits by ratting in highsec sure it can be done but chances are youll be dead from slit wrists at the end of it  it is like digging a trench with a table spoonbounty and system security both factor in which is why one has to be a bot or a moron to even consider repairing anything but a securityblip in lowhigh as things stand
if you removed the show distance bit for the cloaked ships id be all about this and i generally hate any changes to cloakingi dont mind the fact that you can be picked up cloaked but i dislike the distance because of things i can already think about doing to exploit knowing distances when the measure is small
i think removing local is a good idea but adding cloaked ships to directional is bad in fact adding them there makes it even harder for cloaked ships than it currently is since now you only know someone is in system but not in what kind of shippersonally i want cloaks to function in a diffrent way from the currentprototype cloak remove from overview still fully visible in space and on overview no reduction in sig sizeimproved cloak remove from overview and directional if your ship is stationary it is harder to spot in space but not impossible while moving a distortion is fairly easily seen in space slight reduction in sig sizecovert ops cloak remove from overview directional and if not local is dropped then from local as well if you are stationary you are all but impossible to spot in space when you move a slight distortion is showed if you are close if not then you will be more or less visible also the makes the sig size of the ship tiny so it takes a long time to target even for interceptors while being cloakedi would also like to add a assault covert ops cloak that removes you from the same places as the covert ops cloak but has rougly the same cloaking effect as a improved cloak maybe a tad bit better the diffrence with this cloak and the regular one is that you can still use modsweapons while being cloaked mod effects are not cloaked however so that shining hardner effect will be fully visible for all to see
removing local i can support it needs doing as soon as possible but i see no need to change the dscan to enable even the limited detection of cloaked vessel cloaking is working as intended you pay a penalty for being able to avoid detection already ie sbs are glass cannon without trying to nerf it
well done youve just broken wh space
how about no
how about reson that wil emty 00 coplitly no one wil run anomalys just sit pvp toons ins station and that its and launch them when needet that weil hapen if you wil remuve local and rater will be not able see reds with are incoming probably you wil get first time soem kil but then 00 will beckome as desert allready its desert after last anomaly nerf
bad idea no
from this threadi would like to hear the csms side of this specificallyis that exactly what you agreed on ie paying aurum for a ship hullpaint job without that a regular hull is removed from the gameif yes did ccp actually seek your advice or were you presented with a fait accompli and asked for your approvaldoes there exist a transcript of that meetingchat which you can publish or is it under an nda
secondedi would like our representative to advise of their role in this and precisely what was saidnot saidedit and their reasoning behind any decisions made and how they believe it relates to other eve capsuleers
pitchfork
that would be rifter
yup i too am interested i hearing their perspective on this i havent ever whined once on the forums but i do agree that while this new ship purchase is not a tactical advantage it is a paradigm change that is concerning just make it like the damn lp store how can it be that hard
rifter with t2 pitchforks grouped blinking and waiting for a lockbetter
aye would like to hear what was said on this topictemporary ship releases will only create isk sinksthe few new people eve would get because of this feature will ragequit after their new shiney and recently rare ship gets gankedi feelfear thisll do nothing more then shell out eve to nothing more then a rmt hobby
in context what was actually said wasso its temporary and the stats are the same sowhere is the problem its a bloody scorpion they cost a pittance anyway
youre acting like ccp asked their permission to do this change its just cosmetic so i dont see the issue especially when you would need the actual item as part of the exchangetranscripts are you serious lets try remember that this is a video game after all
since you must obviously be a major distributor of scorpions otherwise why so upset why not just build ravens for the 34 months from incarna to winter patch which will remove it againit is a paint job on a mediocre ship and while it may just be ccps way to lure us into accepting a foul turbine type system i sincerely doubt they have the deviousness to have even considered it  ccp  baldrickplayerbase  blackadderps use the threads already spammed with the exact same topic
i think what the op is suggesting is a vote of no confidence in which case i fully support it
not supported1 weeks trail  support of mt
a trial basis on a single cheap as  battleship up until the system can be fixed does not constitute support for much of anything get out
allowing rmting would worsen a problem already its greatly effected 00 politics most realize rmt played a huge role in the current number of super caps currently being fielded if ccp was to allow rmting wed simply see a cascade in the game where only those wealthy enough to buy mass amounts of isk and those intelligent enough to write botting programs would climb to any wealth or importance in the game
10 no20 goto 10
vote yes ccp is dead set on ruining the game as evidenced in their little post about a certain scorpion being bought for aurum without taking a t1 counterpart out in exchange if you have faith in ccp that they will fix it later im not sure what game youve been playing later never comes so please give me a way to sell my character legally for  so i can get off this failboat with a profit
strangely enough i play this game for fun not a profit i would examine your motivations for playing i assume that you didnt expect to make cash out of this game when you started playing and accepted the monthly sub as the price of a service provided if you want to save yourself cash then stop paying to play this failboat game and spend the time doing something profitable for you instead of trying to undermine and destroy eve for the rest of us
ive prepared a plan of actions for when rmt is allowed1 sell everything2 profit3 cancel subscription
no neverccps allowing rmt would open ccp to a large number of legal liabilities and legal responsibilities because by doing that ccp could legally be seen either as a game of chance or more likely as a banksomehow i really doubt ccp wants to go through the rigmarole of bank validation and further i doubt ccp would want to be forced as a bank to back the isk with a set amount of real money note that in that case your isk income would have to be reported for income purposes    there are other better articles on this matter but finding them is left as an exercise for the reader
make carriers and super carriers mission specificcarriers in eve are the swiss army knife of eve ccps term this needs to change they can perform the role anytime the change i propose for the csm to toss at ccp is thisadd mission modules to carriers this takes up one of the slots used for t3s so the mechanics are already there and would be the followingcombat1 drone control per levelability to use drone control units200 bonus to fighter control rangeability to fit warfare linksgal5 bonus to drone damageamarr5 bonus to armor resistscaldari5 bonus to shield resistsminmitar5 bonus to drone velocitydrone bay reduced slightlylogistics1 extra drone per levelability to fit capital remote repair modulesability to fit triage module50 bonus to remote module range including hull5 bonus to drone remote repair amarr 5 bonus to capacitor use of remote repair modules drone bay 525m3gallente 10 bonus to drone remote repair armor only drone bay 600m3minmitar 5 bonus to remote repair amountdrone bay 540m3caldari 5 bonus to remote repair cycle time shield onlydrone bay 500m3what this does is give carriers specific roles either dps or repair
or just buff dreads enough to make them a viable counter to scs because supers are fine atm dreads aint
instead of all super blobs you get super blob with a few dirt cheap carriers thrown inhow is that supposed to solve anything
recently i came to the conclusion that sc are not overpowerd when you only have 1 or 2 they die easy to a well planned 30 man fleet with cap support1 sc can kill a sieging dread in about 5 min heared from a sc pilot the problems start showing up when you have a big fleet of sc together as they can kill any cap ship on grid in a few secblobbing is the problem and perhaps the logoftimer for suppers 
i think the static plexes where introduced to give people a chance to try them out all they do is current provide home for bots and peoples alts who camp all day in the final pocket chars like 1430 days old in t2 frigsproposalonce someone enters a final pocket the respawn of the overseer with the keycard in the first pocket is blocked also you can blow op the final component like serpentis financial center only once and take the loot no respawn as long someone is in the final pocket to prevent people from blocking the final pocket for someone else to be in right position to enter id suggest you make a random time like 110 mins after blowing the structure with the loot based spawn of an undefeatable amount of ships for a t2 frig ie 30 elite frigs 20 cruiser 10 battlecruiser 5 battleships  so one has to leave the final pocketif you want to do it clean id suggest even a binding of the key card to the very same static plex so no one can sell the keys and go somewhere else
im not against any kind of subsuper capital in high sec they arent capable of spreading more firepower than a fleet of bss and using them as devices of ganking would be dumb given the costalso they would add an interesting aspect to high sec wars i personally would love to see some of the kinds of wars you seen in null take place in high sec with dreads standing in for titans and carriers for super carriersalso since high sec is a training ground it would let new cap pilots learn how to jump and use their caps in battles without being sprung upon by a huge pirate nest or null sec blob gang
i think that all capitol ships should be allowed to freely come in an out of high sector given their security status they would not however be able to fire on any target provide any type of drone or ship based repair as well as all bonuses being reduced to zero if however the capitol should be attacked by an aggressor then the ships weapons systems would be released by concord in order for the capitol ship to defend itself once the aggro timer had returned to zero the ships defensive and offensive systems would return to a state of zero usethe capitol ship would only be allowed to stay in any high sector system for 24 hours after which concord would locked the capitol ship into the station hangar that would cost the owner no less than one billion isk to have concord release the ship into the owners hands
no capitals do not belong in highsec i would much rather ban supercaps from 04 and maybe 03allowing covert cynos in highsec even just 0506 is something i really could live with
stopwatch in accessories
it doesnt need game mechanics hhandle it the same category as racism or sexism break the rule and get the banhammer
the pilots get reimbursed its about the corpalliance finances while the small number of supers you risk loosing now isnt crippling for an alliance so theres no serious risk loosing the entire fleet would be that risk will discourage the use of them and make a lot more of them die when something goes wrong reducing the number of supers in the game the problem isnt really that too many are built the problem is that not enough die to compensate for the ones that are built
from what the op is saying i think it isnt the damage or the health of super caps that needs to be nerfed its the remote repjust take out the ability for supers to remote each otherproblem solved
mistake pls edit
p sure bob killed bob you just try to claim credit

hmm i dont know where you got the idead that i want all ew to be the same far from it really but why would i not compare one of something to the rest of the somethingjust like faction weaponry ie the four common weapons which recieve ship bonuses based on faction lines being missiles hybrids projectiles and lasers  used to exclude smartboms and bombs er ignoring stealth bombers there should be a balance ecmewmissilesfaction weaponry if you want to know why there should be belance in eve then effort
thats not bias its an inescapable result null is so fed up almost any change to any part of eve would improve it
fixed old content is new content as far as im concerned promise us one year two expansions or so without new ships new art new effects just revisit all those old game mechanics that have twisted or staled balance things out again and uncover the good idea at the core of all those halfbaked featuresive given up on so much of the game that eve seems much smaller to me now reviving the dead branches is as good to me as brand new stuff better even since it might become good rather than just new

while fixing gallente consider that many gallente ships have active tanking bonuses which may be nice in pve situations but in pvp buffer tanks are the choice for the moment so either make buff active tanking and make it a viable choice in small pvp engagements in large fleets i dont see a way ctive tanking could be used properly due to focus fire crushing all active tanks without problems or replace those bonuses by passive counterparts while caldariamarr get tanking bonuses weather they use buffer odr active tank forcing gallentesome minnie pilots to fite active tanks to actualy gain the bonus is not fairanother point i see is the fact that the way how blaster should work it appears the weapon system better fits to minamtar ships use haevy damage in close range encounters needing fast and agile ships to get in range fastthe most blaster plattforms like hyperion deimos are simply far too slow andor have difficulties fitting sth like a tank to start withsecond point on same topic rails should be the weapon system with low rof but high alpha  railguns as they should be per definition need time to charge before a shot and due to highly accelerated projectile cause high damage whereas artiliery can sustain quite nice rof and decent dmg again it seems the weapon systems between gallenteminmatar are swaped
possibilities for frigcruiser involvementbig ships still useful leave outright destruction to the big gunsmediumsmall ships useful add targetable weak spots that only a frig or cruiser would be accurate enough to hit destruction of a weak spot has limited effect causes only a brief incapacitation only reduces efficiency or is just much easier to fix maybe a very small chance of a catastrophic chain reaction that destroys whatever weak spot was on very star wars but could be fun obviously some things would have to be immune andor much less likely to have this happensabotage module wears down some timer or a fourth hp bar causes less damage or has a less enduring effect than a full on assault maybe chance based like salvagersewar not a gun so it requires ship fits less suitable for other things good or bad depending on who youd ask perhaps effectiveness is tied to something like scan res to give smaller ships an advantage could be a good covert only thing or maybe reconsblackops use them as if they had a frigates scan res maybe it makes ea frigs useful somehow
dump the common ores in hisec rare ores in 00 paradigm even out the mineral distribution and just affect availability gradually reduce the volume of ores in hisec until you see the desired price and population shifts there are so fing many people in hisec capsuleers and normals that if anything they should be dependent on a constant influx of material from outside empirehisec comes off as a paradise right now but it should be rife with the problems of overpopulation residents there should be at each others throats fighting over what little ore is left
slowly raise sell build and research costs in hisec until you get the desired effect adjust as needed keep hisec safe but make them pay for it
this there are a lot of ways to change the costbenefit of hisecnullsec but at the end of the day the nearperfect safety provided by concord is basically free on possibility might be to make concord protection a kind of optional insurance that applies within hisec systems the costs of concord insurance increases as secstatus decreases or something

supported immersion breaking and lorebastardizing love incarna hate cq
i like incarna and looking forward to it since i heard about it nov 05the prospect of finally interacting with my corpmates in a lounge or just sitting on the sofa while logged in is excitingthat said because of usability and immersion breaking issues i dont support the mandatoryness of what is currently known as incarnacaptainsquartersmake it optional until you addressed those issues

the current war declaration system allows two perhaps unintended consequences 1 a high sec piracy corp can remain continuously at war with up to three unwilling target corpsalliances for as long as they like 2 a high sec industrial corp can find itself the target of offensive war decs one after another so that they are never at peace for an extended period of timethe war dec system is meant to provide an occasional element of danger in the normally peaceful environment of empire imo it is not meant to turn empire into low sec for certain corps therefore i propose the following changea every week that a corp remains at war the cost of offensive nonmutual war declarations against that corp increases by a factor of 15 b every week that a corp is at peace its war scaling factor decreases by a factor of 15this is to ensure that if a corp is forced into war unwillingly they cannot be kept in that state foreveredit increased costs for the aggressors time at war removed from the proposal

but for some people building ships and mining is a way of life stop trying to ruin the sandbox for people who dont play like you
usually that is a good principle for eve each player can play how they like in their corner of the sandbox and if another player doesnt like it they move to another cornerin this case though the targeted players have nowhere to go inexperienced players dont have the knowledge or ingame character skills to prosper in low or null sec if they also become perpetual war targets in high sec some will decide there is no place for them in eve personally i would try to convince such people to evolve rather than give up but not all will listen if eve gets a great influx of new players with incarna as hoped a good number of them will be turned off from the game if they find themselves perpetual war targets of experienced pvpers the moment they leave the npc starter corp this might be exactly what some eve veterans would like but it is not in ccps interest nor the majority of current players
i support the principle in general that war dec costs increase over time not necessarily by the amount suggested
support but please stop calling those scum pirates just because you see an yellow icon with a skullthose are just and nothing else but griefers
i too enjoy my taxes increasing each year as i grow older instead of being just a levied percentage government needs my monies yonot supported point on the doll where the mean warddec corp touched you
please explain to me what constitutes a griefer as per the context and rules of this game
if i were a merc or pirate corp id split the corp in two find a way to keep assets between them sorted and just alternate wardecs between them same effect but now with more painintheassalso war is a way of life to some same as popping rats and hauling stuff is to others
why arent they pirates part of pirating is figuring out how to get at the juicy innards of your ship some leave hisec to where more people are valid targets by default others declare war to turn you into a valid target its all right there in the rules of the game make them hurt for targeting you and youll get fewer wardecs
of course such hisec pirates could bypass part the scaling war costs by corp shuffling just as those attacked can even now avoid war by corp shufflingthat is why eve provides vast regions of space where concord does not interfere in player vs player combat ie low sec and null sec high sec is meant to be the safer zone for newcasual players with less risk and less reward insisting that high sec should also be a nonstop war zone is rather dogmatic
except the reward for hisec is pretty high for the minimal risk involved
i agree however war decs are a poor balancing mechanism wars are disproportionately directed at the weakest least experienced corps thus the players who can reap the least reward from high sec face the greatest risk the real money makers in high sec are npccorp alts of veteran players who have main characters in major alliances and they are completely immune from war decs
what does bitter vet alts in npc corps have to do with war decs i though the topic was about player ran corps getting war decd anyway to keep this in line to determine if there is a real issue what percentage of player corps on average are actually under a war dec out of those how many are pve based
my anecdotal experience ingame and from reading the forums is that war decs are quite common now especially for pve corps with mostly new players only ccp would have access to statistically significant data and they have not provided it to us players or is there some fansite where all war decs are logged
to counter your anecdotalin game and regular forum whoring that war decs are pretty rare as a matter of fact some pve mission corps have never seen a war dec in their 2 years of existencei am pretty sure there are some data some where
youre right  i was in such a corp a few years ago times seem to have changed the twoyear old corp you mention is of course now two years old and would not be an attractive war target any morethe recent trend is there are a lot more high sec piracy corps now than there used to be and they single out relatively new easytokill war targets that interpretation is consistent with both your experience and mine
it is not the age of the corp but the resources and numbers they have targeting small corps is not really all that fun and useless in keeping your guys focused enough to log in and shoot others in the face the ones that do dec small corps are normally just cutting their teeth on the game play to move on to better things if they stay in focused on decing small corps they will get bored and burn out or disband to a space rich pve corp that sicks mercs on them and the first time one of those tiny little corps actually put up a fight the defending corp will find them selves much better and stronger for it and the decing corp might just fade away darwinism works both ways most pirates as you call them will rather dec a corp  alliance that is space rich to extort or provides a target rich environment
i agree with these changes and would go furtherhawk should get significant bonus to missile damage 5 rof per levelvengeance should get significant bonus to rocket damage 5 rof per levelwolf and jaguar should get 75 tracking per levelretribution should switch a 1 high for a 1 midishkur should have a 10 bonus to drone hitpoints and damage per skill level bonus and lose a high slotenyo should have a 75 bonus to armor repairer effectiveness per level repair bonus and 15m3 drone bay and bandwidth not 5m3all assault frigates should also have a generic role bonus of 25 afterburner speed boost as was discussed a long time agoin addition to this i believe ships smaller then cruisers should get an additional 10 reduction in sig radius
the masturbating hand social club offers their support
i suport this but i have some idea baout this that fof launchers and misles are more use fullmake them realy usefull that they can be lounched agenst not only missiles and rockets but ageinst lasers projectiles etc depends fith type off defenders you usinga ati laser defender culd make soem small cloud off somting forgot word that enemy cant shoot true it some seconds and need to move in difrent postion to atack youb agenst missiles  not jsut hit one misles how its now but make false tagets for missile targeting systems that each misle takes some not right taget and just blows up there to protectim ship from geting soem hit not alla offthem but somec artelery and autocannons to can make soem coud off soermting where thos bullets stuck or hit false taget and enemy ned move to difret postiond rails can be the same as artythat wil increase usuage off defenders not only in solo pvp but in fleet battles to restricvtion can be that you can fit only 1 defender launcherafcors here can go to the ting to crreat spetioal ship for sucjh role in fleets with can flood batle field with difrent kinds off tagret ditruptions fields andf false targetspropbably not in right post but eny way i got fast idea and writed it up 
when can i start selling my millions of loyalty points on the market so much effort to convert millions of loyalty points into items and then move those items to highsec to sell themcontracts would work too
god forbid youd have to put effort into it i dont think id mind seeing a set block of isk in lp stores though but it should give you the lowest isklp ratio of the options the current system at least ensures that faction mods enter the game with a just the isk thx option added youd see a huge shift in faction gear prices
wont happen has been discussed before youd run into massive rp issues with people having tons of lp with corpsfactions who have them koseffort is fine but do you have any idea how many times you have to click to spend a million lpps fw lp are so plentiful that millions are the smallest denomination would personally be satisfied if the lp store interface was redone so we could buy x amounts instead of one at a time
at present the lp store is one of the games largest isk sinks introducing a gimme cash kthx option would completely undermine thati wouldnt be opposed to a dynamic rebalancing of tag requirements but turning the lp store into an isk fountain is a patently ed idea
i play battlefield bad company 2 and it is nothing like eve and has no rpg elements it is a very good game though i wasnt saying i didnt want dust to have a level of awesome in a persistent universe just that i didnt want it to get quite so bogged down in the market and industry when it was originally presented as a persistent shooterone thing i dont like about evelets say i buy a rokh for example 100 million  iski outfit it with weapons and tank 50 million  iskto do this i had to grind for 1 week 8 hours a day at 4 million isk per hour in highsec that rokh is worth at a minumum to me 560i fly out of jita 44 and make my way to a mission hub dodixieon my way to uedama someone scans me on my way into system and i get jumped on the other side of the gate losing my rokh and all fittingsi just lost a 40 hour work week the equivalent of 560 or more even at a low payscalenow try using that same example with a hulk or another t2 ship of cruiser class or highernow toss in the fact that a second ganker podded me immediately after i was specifically targeted and i lost my clone and full set of implants valued at 12 billion iskthis is a fictional event and just an example of course but the effect remains the same you might argue that gankers lose ships too to which i would have to point out thatdue to their professionthey make a lot more isk than me now apply that same logic to a game like dust where people are supposed to shoot each other as mercenaries working for alliances in eve suddenly going to battle seems a lot less interesting particularly when some of your upgrades come from the mt storenone of this really matters of course as it is still speculation and that is only one issue among many i have with dust being too much like eveits not a matter of elitist at all i am a member of evga gaming forum and have been sinceidk 2005 or something i know what these people play and what their interests are for the most part i attempted along with others to get them interested in eve andmostlythey wouldnt have it there are currently something like 7 retired players and 811 players who maintain subs that i am aware of that does not include myself of the 7 retired members at least 3 quit because of grind vs pvp i cant say regarding the others but i suspect most were just boredfor the number of people we are talking about here that is a relatively small group the gaming community alone is 3763 members of which 1101 are currently online given that id say no eve is not a common choice amongst fpsor even mostgamers sure 3700 people equates to very little in the wider picture but statistically it is relevent
first null sec sov mechanics need an overhaul anyway and maybe dust is a good way to shake things up there as as many care bears in null as there are in high sec and the risks are lower in null but the profit higher risk verses reward in null is brokensecond i see this as a way for ccp to recover  from the real money traders now theyll have to spend some of the money that they make from eve on gear for their dust troops so they dont lose their planets and sov seems to me to be a brilliant solution
so your argument that microtransaction and plex are different is that buying a nyx is a big irl cash commitment you know it doesnt have to be a nyx  10 battleships for a small sized corp is a pretty big deal for example
the nyx was brought up by furb killer and i used the math to address his point you are correct that 10 battleships can be a big deal as well what is a large sum of isk or rl  is up to the individual to decide for me having any item that is available by circumventing the in game creation process with a visa is unacceptable
be bit more realistic in your fiction pleaseif you can afford to fly around with 12 billion in implants in your head you make more then 4mil an hrif you can fly and t2 fit a rokh coulda used a better ship for the example you can make more then 4 mil per hrif you had to grind for 40 hours to buy that rokh based on the two lines above you sir fail at eveunless you went out of your way to take a giant dump on someone there is no way a groupyes it takes more then 1 or 2 people to suicide gank a bs is going to waste their time ganking a t2 fit rokh of all things if you are going to try and prove a point with examples i recommend making them as realistic as possible to lend credibility to your argument
by the same token many feel that any item  advantage gained by circumventing conventional iskraising activities mining missioning is unacceptablenot only can your wartarget generate isk in a way that you cant affect they are also using real life cash to get a in game advantage over you at your expense at the peril of a corporation  alliance  ships  assets  structures that you have spent legitimate in game time and in game resources at requiringim not saying that i like aurumim just confused how people can complain over that and not realise the flaws of plex
i agree with your statement on plex the only difference is that the isk and the items the isk buys come from effort and time by an eve player to either grind the isk through any number of sources or build the items with  for items even vanity only items are spawned for use in game with absolutely zero involvement from the player basethe only thing that buying a gtc then converting it to plex will get you is a plex that plex is only good for one thing and that is extending game time now it will be two things buying game time and buying aurum which in turn allows you to circumvent in game industry as a whole and have items spawned in your hanger
wtz was added for practical reasons i dont know if the forumdevlog archives go back that far but before it was implemented there were many million bookmarks set out at 15km from gatesstations to achieve the same effect and it was proving to be a major db headachethat being said i give no support to this proposal
there are thoughs that will cry no i realy dont know why though1 if you want to auto pilot to 0km and auto dock at your picked station there are 3rd party programs that will do this for you already anyways mite as well just put it in the game2 theres nothing you can do in transit anyway except take forever and use the facilities and be vulnerable most ships used for hulling have little to no capabilities to defend themselves and in some cases there so slow it ads an 30 mins to an hour on travel time or it seems like it copypasted becouse its so freaking true and stupidly so
wtz is fine has it is has mechanic yes it has his own little issues sometimes meaning you dont warp to zero but at 2600 nothing really important but still tiny little bugif people dont want to be behind their screen when they play or dont want to have it in first window then youre doing it wrongdont play at workdont lie to your wifestop afk youpUFFFDrnwhat about stop playing you dont have issues with wtz any more
its fine as it is i just wish there was auto dock to station if the route end at a station
wtz was added when ccp caved to the whiny players that were complaining about the instajump bm nuking
not supported
ccp recently published a devblog about possibilities for 3rd party developers to monetize their work on projects all arround evenow while the basic idea is a cool thing and very welcome one clause mentioned in it is totally unacceptablethis a slap in the face of everyone who is putting time and efford into providing tools all arround eve basically it means if you take a donation or charge isk for a service you provide to enhance the game you have to pay 99 a year to ccpdo something now
10
thumbs up why read
supportin
i agree with ccp if you intend to profit from their product then you should require some sort of commercial license and 99year is hardly unreasonablewhat i would have liked to see is an option to pay in plexs
signed  l ll llama    
i fully endorse this opinion whatever it may be
10
10
over 4 years i roughly got 15bn isk in donations thats 375mio isk a year so basically you say its ok that i should pay 99 a year to maybe get 375mio isk or that i have to actually require people to pay right
when you quit eve can i have your stuffz1
agreed if youre making money from eve pay up 99 is  all
save 3rd party devs
i agree with this post it is going to make the 3rd party market smaller and push a lot of good applications that are currently active and updated and fixed out of the way 99 dollars i think they are taking a play out of apples hand book
save 3rd party devs
if you are making money then yes but what people are upset about is if they ask for a donations they need a license if they offer the service for isk they need a licenseif you are not making the 99 a year then its not worth it you will lose a lot of services
just occurred to me just how much free advertising all those developers of 3rd party apps have been giving eve in addition to keeping subscribers onboard by providing tools that make eve more enjoyable shutting down the free work provided by these developers also shuts down the free advertising that their sites provide for eve i dont think youll get 99 from developers that are trying to cover their server and bandwidth fees by providing a donate here link i think youll lose a good percentage of your subscriber base as well as not having newcomers to replace them due to the loss of advertising
no ccp thats a bad ccp11
dear ccpwrite the third party apps yourself and then defenestrate yourselves onto a broom handle bottom first
people will sell their app for money earn maybe 50 a year and not pay ccp 99 a year ccp can then track them down to whatever country theyre in hire local lawyers and sue them either for the 50 or 99 depending on local laws see it all works out
i think a commercial license is reasonable as long as you can pay for it in isk
5 clones just isnt enough anymore especially if you have the isk and want specific clones for specific tasks
hmm why not doesnt hurt i thinkeven for the risk to be flamed i could imagine with such a skill the jump times could be reduced as welltraining time multiplyer 5lvl 0  24 hrslvl 1  21lvl 2  18lvl 3  15lvl 4  12lvl 5  9 hrs
i prefer eres idea but eve is a big place as you said sometimes 5 clonee just arent enough
funnysupportus maximus
and whats your point with comparing reality to a science fiction game well other than confirm exactly why reds deserve what they brought on themselves as for sec status repair try to actually check all my kills then check my sec status andwhoa guess what im still here does that boggle your mind maybe u just need to htfu and handle the consequences cant handle a little punishment go to 00 or quitor in your case sure go ahead and wrist
that is just it there are no consequences you can go on a killing spree tank your security and then go to the mens club 00 and get it back in nearly complete safetylooking at your kills i can understand why you oppose a change such as this it would mean that you actually have to put yourself at risk instead of shooting unarmed ships and ratting sec in blue seas
suport this good idea that will halp some ppl understand that sec status its important not just number in lineforgot to suport 
i would support this but i would like to see the secstatus gained from lowsec rats increased slightlyccp should also look into other ways to raise ones sec status other than grinding rats killing outlaw players for example this should have a major positive impact on ones secstatus imo
with the 9001 afkcloaking whine threads i beg to differ since theyre too scared to continue when 1 red shows up in local thats the equalizer right thereu talk about risks and consequencesnews flashits called automatic ship loss u know when ure guaranteed to actuallylose your ship thats more risk and consequences than most 10s would ever have to face or to be more accurate want to facenews flashtheyre called kill rights only u dont want to exercise your kill rights even though its much easier to do so in high sec because ure too scared to since u cant hide behind a fleet if u dont want to lift a finger to enforce that risk and have ccp do it instead then thats your fault for being lazy and scarednot to mention any 10 can circumvent their risks and consequences with an alt i can understand why ud still want a change such as this u want high sec to be 100 safe just like every other 10 here who wants to log on their high sec alt to afk isk print in safety especially when theyre waiting out an actual fight by shooing away their enemies with boredomand with all of your riskaversion ure asking ccp to put in more risks and consequences for your enemies and at the same time more safety and riskfree althiding for yourselves keep dreaming or htfu cause it aint gonna happen
that is part of the original suggestion i think to bring the gain up to approximately the same level as is currently possible in null  it shouldnt become more of a timesink than it already is balance is in the inherent risk involved in lowsec rattingperhaps if we can persuade ccp to give us a viable bounty hunting system instead of the exploitable mess we have now the sec for killing other pirates would make sense  difficult to do without creating obvious loophole of smartbombing highsec to go instantly to 10 and then killing that alt repeatedlyvalid if insurance was voided when concord intervenes until then it can not be used as argument as insurance skews the riskreward heavily in your favourwe both know that carebears have neither the skills nor the inclination to pursue those right if that was the norm then suiciders would have some other hapless guys to kick around  might be valid ifwhen kr become tradeable commoditiesi veshta yoshida am in the militia and rarely exit lowsec could care less about security in highsec to be honestas for alt use yes they are a way to get around consequences in just about all areas of eve since they are not exclusively by pirates in that capacity used the argument also be discarded
supported as long as sec gains of lowsec rats are increased to match those of null sec rats that will be removed
good idea supported no reason null should have sec gains if it doesnt have sec losses i dont know about removing it from hisec though as long as its scaled appropriately ie it takes forever
just for this id say hell yeah twice their tears are more valuable than any carebeer kill reallyccp do it nao
u neglected to mention the reward part relying completely on the target and uve forgotten the sec hit u already stated which is obviously so painful for uand what about their mains and the consequences of their decision to hide behind a weak char when carebearing it up thats what i thought1 u say ure in fw and u could care less about security in high sec yet ure whining about suicide ganking and the best part u cry about risk vs reward while ure hiding behind the safety of your fw blob plz continueid really love to hear it2 and not all suicide gank victims r exclusively newbies or pure carebears without pvp alts either so by your logic any whines about suicide ganking namely yours r invalid
in all honesty i could care less for about the cloaking part in general the only reason i added it was to throw a bone to people who cant stand the thought of losing local and would become all emo i spend the vast majority of time in wspace and have zero problem with current cloaking mechanicsstill we have to learn to give and take and if you want local removed you will need to make some concessions somewhere
remove the distance to the cloaked ship and ill support thisand a resounding  no to everything mars theran posted
the take is realtime updates of local the give is putting the fear of empty space back into people i can see hisec having good lore reasons for realtime local concord always know exactly who and where you are after all maybe timed or sigrelated delays in losec to allow quick ambushes go wh style in 00 or maybe give control to sovholders via deployablesedit cloaks are just fine as is
you are complaining about whats called a modal window they are a terrible design element they prevent their user from appropriately responding to other activities they interrupt workflow and in eve they are everywherethe appropriate response is to kill it with fire
death to modal windows
very annoying waste of time get rid of them
not supported its a balancing element to suicide gank efficiency among other things there is a reason theres no do not show again tickbox its working as intended
and how about the ones that have nothing to do with suicide ganking have no tickbox and only the one option
it has recently come to my attention that ccp and the csm lack an efficient way to transmit information to the player basebefore continuing i want to make something very clearccp  im not sure how aware you are of it or if you even care but for the most part i am proud to be a member of this community and im sure most others playing eve are as well for 8 years you have brought not only impeccable vision to contemporary gaming but you have built from the ground up one of in my opinion humanitys greatest achievement  a living breathing and a frighteningly real virtual existencethat being said of late you seem to be slipping you built the universe as gods and we populated it you made the rules and we exist by them eve however isnt just spreadsheets market orders apis and space ships its alive we the players while beholden to the carbon engine and the eve servers as the body is beholden to blood and organs are the soul  that which makes eve great that which makes new eden realyou need to rethink your business strategy  you need to take a good hard look at yourselves and think where would we be without the playersill tell you  you probably wouldnt exist it is because of us  the subscribers  that you exist it has been our unwavering loyalty that has kept eve and ccp aliveim not asking for anything in particularim not asking that you change your timelines development plans or anythingall im asking for and i think many will be with me on this one is a little transparency when youre considering changes to the game with that in mind i suggest a reevaluation of the player  csm  ccp interaction perhaps televise via the internet csm meetings ala cspan you could hold polls for registered subscribers on suggested game changes the benefit here is twofold1 change is tough for us players i have invested some time but others have invested what seems like lifetimes into this game and community when devblogs come out with new features its often said that development is already progressing on them put simply we feel left out2 taking that into account this would help you direct your development efforts read development costs in a way that would benefit players and keep them resubbing instead of just infuriating and frustrating themso without further adieuitt  suggestions for methods to improve communication lines between players the csm and ccp impromptu poll for support please include reasons why no rage  ccp nonsense and otherwise nonconstructive posts the divide is wide enough without more anticcpismlets bring something constructive to the table here
i applaud your thoughts and ideas but i feel i have to disagree with the transparency one of the most glaring problems if they open up what they plan on doing in 6 months we plan to start on project x which will accomplish y while fixingreplacing zthis opens up advance knowledge for scripters bot programers reverse engineers and other people who could take and use this information to either get game breaking software in final stages just awaiting a ui release to finalize the changes or to emulatesteal the ideas for use in other projectsgamesi wish we could be a fly on the wall for developer meetings but i understand why its the way it is and why there exist things like nondisclosure agreementsa more realistic method would be to develop changes into a semiusable but buggy fashion and get them on a test server with daily code recompiles and let people beta test them while in development you get the kind of feedback that actually matters you changed the base speed of a rifter to 63kms with navigation 1 while awesome was this intentional and none of the this is bull ccp why did you make this change it breaks everything and makes the dramiel worthless
proposing removal of time limit on clone jumps if clone is in same station youre in this removes a major cause for risk aversion without creating exploitable instant travel spam carebears are no longer limited to one pvp session per day
maybe two jumps each with its own 24 hour timer you could hit one every 12 hours or do 2 quickly but only every 24otherwise no might as well just add another layer of ship mods with no timer at all
sometimes brief lag is annoyingthe paper cutfrequently after a gate jump i try to reengage cloak immediately after aligning or starting a warp i clearly do one start warp then the other hit cloak but if i dont pause exactly the right amount in between i get the cant youre still cloaked message i cant risk spamming the cloak button cause that could turn it off again and get me killed so i have to wait and see if the message hits and just try to react quickly if it does this might also get me killedhealedif i do something that breaks gate cloak and do something else that requires my being uncloaked it needs to just do one then the other no matter how close in time the two keys were hitdrone ui launch drones buttons of useful size and not buried in a menu one launch all button if you only have five or all one type multiple if you have groups more keyboard shortcuts for launching specific drone groups focus fire setting that works my drones still split themselves on occasion target priority nothing too fancy like sort by dpstank ratio just tackle first or even frigates first is a huge step up options to not engage a type at all could handy too ai range limit keeps drones within a set range of your ship only limits wandering is overridden by direct orders let drones be in more than one group i launch my predefined speed set and it tries to grab 5 warriors launch my dps set and it grabs 3 hammerheads and 2 of the same warriorsclone costspvpers tend to have less money as it is what with all the sploding we do nullsecers on top of that almost always lose the pod if theres a bubble involved the richest of us almost never risk their pods maybe a monthlyweekly cost tied to quality plus a flat fee for replacements
i just started playing eve again due to school being let out and everything and all this incarna stuff is sounding pretty bad to me can we just cancel it or something i dont mean to be rude or anything but i always thought it was vaporware but now that its coming to fruition as a half finished patch im getting kinda nervous expansions in the past have been buggy often requiring more than 5 patches to fix what they broke as well as extremely long down times keep in mind those expansions did not have a disclaimer saying they were going to be buggy in the vdb however you say something about bugs being expected so i can only imagine how much worse its going to be nowseriously though my alt just finished all leadership skills and i wanna do some solo pvp not download patches so just canceladd an option to not load station or else i think its going to be like the old new lolforums and your just going to end up taking it back and working on it for 18 more months fix all that other stuff that people are yelling about that just require tweaking variables and crap k thanks bye
ccp zinfandel clarifies mattersoh and we have video of all the meetings its useful when drafting the minutes
i seem to remember watching day 2 of the alliance tourney when they showed the ishukone scorp and it was stated that the ship would be rolled out for aurum only this summer it was also stated that they would transition to the exchange a scorp  aurum for the ishukone version this transition wouldnt happen until late fall so unless i am on some really good crack ccp planned to do this test for 34 months regardless of what the csm advised the only reason ccp is pausing and i assure you this is just a pause is because of the massive outcry from the player base in multiple threads in multiple forum sections it also didnt help that ccp threw the csm under the bus however inadvertently by saying you okd and supported this testone thing i want to remind people of when has ccp said they were going to fix or correct something other then an issue that prevented the masses from playing the game and actually did it in a reasonable time or for that matter even bothered to do anything about it at all this breeds distrust in ccp from the player base i completely understand why people were and still are upset over this issue ccps track record isnt good when it comes to delivering on what they commit to
thanks for the clarification csm dudethe problem with having even a 10 minute test of said matters is that there are some very rich people that play eve and i have no doubt that someone thought about putting 10s of thousands of real life dollars if the ish scorp is not that much higher than its mineral cost to reprocess a huge amount of free minerals because no one really thinks a scorp is game breaking but what about the supers made from the free minerals
both ccp and the csm stated that they talked about this and that ccp asked for the csms opinion on this topic i never said anything like asking permissionthat is the point  the actual item wouldnt be a part of the exchange at first originally planned time span for this stage 34 months so since noncosmetic nonvanity items would be spawned out of thin air it would be an issueas trebor mentioned the meetings are recorded besides internet spaceships are serious business
your concerns go in the right direction you wouldnt even need to spend rl cash on it since you can buy plex with isk and convert those plex to aurumthe process would go about like thisbuy plex in jitaconvert plex to aurumin a station in deep 00 buy sparkling scorpion from aurumreprocess sparkly scorpion to mineralsconvenient riskfree mineralsdepending on the price of plex the sparkle scorpion and the minerals it could also go like thisbuy plex in jitaconvert plex to aurumbuy sparkling scorpion from aurumreprocess sparkly scorpion to mineralssell mineralsprofitgoto 1
some of the responses of the csm from the gd threadedit quotefu
you forgot the quote from vile rat in which he says he cant be bothered to read the 14 pages of outcryalso the csm should quit over thisthey said they are opposed to anything other than vanity itemsor ccp is using them to justify the one week magic outofthinairshipsales test by perverting their statements during the conversations in which case the csm is a sham and any member with dignity would gtfoor the csm lied to the people they represent and found the one week magic outofthinairshipsales test acceptable in which case the csm is a sham and any member with dignity would gtfo or you should just stay in your golden cage and enjoy your time while grabbing those ankles hard
thiswe all know that ccp has a trackrecord of fixing stuff they did put into the game half finished rightcant believe the csm accepted thiseven more so if they want to test the aur shops creation of ships from thin air how about using sisi  the testserver  for thatthats the server where such stuff doesnt affect the economy of tq and can be played with as long as it needs for polishingam i in the wrong movie here or what
ifnonvanity items like a ship are sold instead of new paint of a ship it is money for just an ingame itemso sooner or later we weill pay  or  for titans t3 or battleshipseverything in eve is created by players  except a complete battleshipare you nutsare the csm delusionali am really ed off ccpand even more ed off csmwhat sleeping lazyheady nonbrainer could say yes
this  sucks really poping ships out of thin air  broken game  a lot people quitting
as opposed to selling plex and using the isk to buy mineralsit would only be an issue if the auronly sparklescorpion reprocesses to more minerals than the direct route and given these would have been at a premium to the price of a regular scorpion via iskplexaur this would not have been the case afaict
although i agree with you that the chances for that happening are slim you should never underestimate the talent of eve players to exploit such mechanics nor should you underestimate the ability of ccp to  up something like this remember the pos structures when pi was introduced
does that include the discussions the take place down the pub
you forget that the mining of those minerals takes time and buying up enough minerals for a big number of supers can become very expensive if you throw enough money in there will be a brakeeven pointand if there is an ignoble exchange in every station you can spawn them everywhere and you dont even have to haul them
im not sure what to think of the csm right now the one week test sure looks a lot more like a test of mt directly for noncosmetic items than a general test of the new system so either youre being suckered into okaying a trial run of something that should never be considered or you are trying to sucker us into letting it slidewe cant let this in its not about whether it affects the markets significantly if you only need a week to get the proper basic scorpion to painted scorpion exchange working then take that week take a month if you need how about a yearwe can wait prove to us this isnt a not so covert trial run for a future cashforships system
side point the sparkle scorp should not appear in game as ishukone watever scorpion or special hyper mega alpha directors cut posh scorp or even custom scorp ill need to buy a second monitor or something to hold the extrawide overview to get past the adjectives to the actual ship typenice and thin useful column  scorpion blackbird falcon tempesthorrible and fat useless column ishukone watch sc uber1337 omgwtf r
never going to happen the core of this issue is that rmt happens anyway  its just a question of ccp taking steps to legitimize it through channels that arent going to be damaging to the ingame economy or the gameplay itself
if you dont understand the difference beetwen reprocessing ships created out of thin air and buying minerals  how the hell have you become csm
you are forgetting one very important step in the process of isk generation the isk that one gets for selling a plex came from someone  somewhere down the line who took the time to earn the isk through ingame actions the only way to earn something from the money store is to expend the effort and time to enter a credit card number last time i checked we use isk not visas in gamepeople will continue to use the argument that players will sell the items purchased in the money store on the market or through contracts for isk however the fact remains that items purchased for aurum in the money storeeven just vanity items are initially spawned into the game with the use of rl 
everyone trebor has indeed understood the difference between iskplex and aurumship no need to lecture him any further about this
please see this post from ccp zinfandel for the correct series of eventstldr csm not quite as fail as it first appeared
it is a way to get a forships trial into the game to see how peoples wallets respond the only a test rhetoric is to pacify people like you into letting it slideso whether the csm is allowing the test out of ignorance sincerity or malice is immaterial this approval demonstrates their inability to act in the interest of eve players and thus warrants a noconfidence motionif ccp need time to complete the system they can take that time and release the sparkle scorp exchange when its finishedim assuming of course that the op has actually got it right support withheld pending further researchplex and no further
i think the csm is still against microtransactions they were just naive to believe the one week test with ships for  was for technical reasonsi too believe ccp wanted to see how the playerbase would react i still have confidence in the csm lets hope they will forward our sentiment towards mts to ccp
supportedquoting myself
it really would be a shame if the csm could do nothing to stop mt  as i see in the forums here which my not be representative at all about 80 of the playerbase are strictly against mt  even the conmeticsonlymt the rest ist somwhere divided among cosmeticsonylisok and dontcare opinion so why the hell isnt the csm strictly representing the players who voted for them and give a clear no to ccp regarding mtduring the last few years it seems ccp acually dont care about the eve players and their issues with the game at all just check the forums and youll find a large bunch of proposalswhiningsnice ideas being completely ignored by ccp even with dozens of players supporting it  not even a comment a la we cant do thatso im starting to ask whats csm good for  except for free trip to iceland having some nice smalltalk without results and signing a nda to have sth to hide behind when there are some serious questions on the horizon why cos it seems csm is damned by ccp to only nod with the head when ccp serves them another bit of information what actuall will happen with eveps sorry for bad english
im not sure exactly where this is coming from i watched the atix live stream on sunday with the dev whos working on this system and he specifically explicitly said that they would require a t1 ship as part of the price for exactly that reason and thats also why it wont be available on day 1 of incarna because the actual code for doing that isnt ready yet
if anything they should limit the amount of isk that can be bought i dont mind buying plex for isk i pay for my accounts that way its also fine if someone sells plex or two for some extra pvp capital but no one should ever be able to buy isk enough to build a sc
they are doing so little about rmt that they are effectively allowing it

you also have to keep in mind that titans are also overpowered since they can engage and destroy any target on field group of supercarriers and titans is pretty invulnerable to anything that does not outnumber them hilariously providing that fcs are not tards of course server is liable to break before you have enough subcaps that you might be able to kill something coordinating and resupplying thousands of pilots is much harder than working in smaller elite outfitsdds handle logistics ships triage carriers and bubblers sc can spank everything else and can attack pos and sov structures with titans titans can also portal whatever subcapital ships you might require past camps mainly tackledreads cant handle supercap blob too weak buffer and are unwieldy in lag and carriers get outright vollied by dd  fb spam which makes all types of rr shenanigans irrelevant
i would like to propose 4 separate changes to the market order system one is a concrete fix to a problem often complained about the other three is to make traders lives easier as well as bring the market more into line with expectations found in real life markets the four proposals are partially separable the first is standalone the third and fourth while implementable separately and without the second wont make much sense without it1 modification of margin trading with respect to minimum volume orderscurrently if you attempt to sell to a bidder who has insufficient funds to cover their order up to the minimum order volume the result is that the trade is canceled with no exchange taking place this opens up the door to scamming and does not make sense in a market context the seller is attempting a goodfaith transaction with a buyer who cannot meet the requirements of the transaction despite having placed some portion in escrow as an apparent but insufficient and false in the case of scammers show of good faith on the buyers sideinstead the minimum order volume should only be checked on the sellers side if they buyer has insufficient funds to cover the sale they should still be forced to buy as much as they are able to pay for and the remaining order canceled no more margin scamming2 changes to crossed market price dispute resolutionunder the current system crossed market price disputes are settled in favor of the older orders party this does not make sense from a fiduciary point of viewthis may require a bit of explanation a crossed market is one in which the buyers maximum bid is higher than a sellers minimum ask in this case both parties could potentially receive a better price than they requested the buyer is willing to pay more than the seller is asking and the seller is willing to accept less than the buyer is offering currently this dispute is resolved in favor of the older orders party thus a buyer placing a buy order now will pay more to a seller who has an older order stating that they are willing to pay less or a seller placing a sell order now will receive less than what a buyer with an existing buy order is willing to pay if i were the broker in these cases youd want to fire me immediately not to mention id face potential lawsuits or jail timecrossed markets should be resolved in favor of the newer orders party that is a new seller to the market should receive as much as buyers are willing to pay at that moment and a new buyer to the market should pay as little as sellers are willing to accept why else would we be paying brokers to do this more responsible brokers more predictable results from buysell orders may be harder to resolve market orders serverside3 add allornone aon order flagthe buyer should be able to specify that a market order they are placing should be filled immediately and fully or not filled at all this combined with 2 would allow them to place a single order and be assured that they will get the best price for all that they need to buy or that they will know immediately that the order cannot be filled4 add fillorkill fok order flagthe buyer should be able to specify that they only want to buy as much of a product as is currently available at their specified price or better with 2 without having to worry about canceling the unfilled portion five minutes later this would allow a player to buy up to a desired price without having to initiate multiple transactionsboth 3 and 4 would result only in immediate orders neither would ever result in an order being added to the open orders list  both can forestall multiple transaction initiations one order placed instead of many both justify possibly reduced brokers fees more isk sinks added serverside complexity might outweigh savings from above
surely not the csm minutes will be nice relaxing bedtime reading with puppies and kittens on every page
can i just ask a dumb question why the nda in the first place really if its stuff that is progress and being worked on for eve online a game that is live not something that a year from release why does it need to be shrouded in secrecy anyway whos going to steal it who cares other than eve online players if they are filling your meetings with a bunch of stuff about wod and whatever they call the aurum store then why are they telling about those games theyre not fully developed and csm experience with eve wont help in the development of those other two games fake edit i could give a credit to ccp explaining exploits and theyre fixes to the csm that would be nda
imagine you were privy to information about blueprint mineral changes moon redistributions moduleship changes and had weeks or months to act on it  csm members and their buddies could make trillions one example gistii abs sold for a couple of million prior to qr patch and rose to current level of 20m immediately following itthe way it was handled is how it should be everyone got the same information at the same time by way of the patch notes
so from what i can gather the proceedings between ccp and the csm are so sooper sekret that there is an nda in place right whats the point of having player representation as embodied in the csm if things are kept so tightly shrouded in mystery that if you told us what was really going on youd have to kill us or to quote blazing saddles or are we just jerking off
the vast majority of things discussed at the csm summits are not covered by nda and are disclosed in the minutes in fact i am sometimes surprised by how much ccp is willing to make publicthere are however some things  mostly related to upcoming changes to the game statistics about the game such as subscriber statistics and ccp business strategy that get sealed under nda
i cant wait for the notes i have a feeling some nice info will be revealed and yes i can use some good news
no thanksalthough an automated mining platform that is anchorable and can only be deployed in nullsec could be a good way to increase local industry there it would also provide something for roaming gangs to shoot at to disrupt that local industry and promote home defensebut legalised macro mining  hell no
right then im seeing a bunch of t3 kills and a few others i seem to be missing the hard proof of botting part could you please provide some more information otherwise ill just say nice kills  insmother looks like a good place to hunt carebears in t3s
well i have been known to post from time to time when i have something to contribute to a conversation i can also be found on failheap and occasionally on the forumthatmustnotbenamedthere will be occasional lulls in the amount of message traffic actual csm business like doing the minutes takes a lot of time and sometimes there are situations where we just cant comment because of ndai personally scan jita park assembly hall and devblog threads more than gd simply because of time constraints but if theres a thread you think i need to be posting in poke me on evemail
thanks trebor for showing your face here i also applaud your effort to keep us up to date on various places throughout the internethowever i cant hep thinking the csms efforts would be better served if you focused your communications in one place that is easily visible by a majority of your electorate i believe this place is here or at least someplace that is directly linked from here i also think while podcasts are a nice touch written statements are ultimately more useful for most players to get up to date on your effortswe have been told you folks met online a lot to discuss issues both old and current would it inconvenience your mission overly if you were to post regular headsups on both your progress and your takes on current matters and what you plan to to about these in the manner of mittens open lettercurrently i see a lot of players really upset or unsettled about certain happenings surrounding eve please dont let them hanging
close but not quite  if you steal mission loot from somebody you are being shot at legally and kill rights are only applied if you are unlawfully destroyed in secure space from the wiki entry here no kill rights are given against legal targetsyou get an aggression timer that allows you to reship and come back to kill them but this is different to a kill rightedit i like the idea of transferable kill rights free market prices would be better though
a typical ganker counter argument as someone who has myself in the past ganked profitable targets i find it unconvincing and tbh id have welcomed the excitement of being a marked man to add some flavor and risk to hisec lifewhat did that mean exactlyyou welcome the being a marked man but on the other hand you want whoever kills you to be free game to someone else for 1 month as revenge you claim the counter argument is invalid but then validate it by claiming to doso yourselfyall highsecers are weird bunch
i have a problem with this heres a scenario to illustratesmall fast hard to hit gang say ab armor hacs is running rings around a bunch of easy to hit big ships with slow tracking say alphabaddons one highly tanked alphabaddon stops and activates the offensively scripted module on a targeted ahac it then has a number of its fleet hit it not so much to kill the abaddon large ehp so it can be repped up fairly easily by the escorting guardians but enough to vapourise an ahac now imagine that with something like a carrier groupthis would allow big hard hitting gunsmissiles that normally struggle to tracksig small fast ships to bypass that trackingsig issue and apply large damage onto small ships that would normally be able to get under the guns as they should
and the last nail in the coffin has been struck well played everyone
and yeah verily it hath come to pass

changes to hybrids and synergy with hybrid ship hulls ie gallente and caldariive been reading the discussion threads on what to do about hybrids and the ships that use them and so id like to offer my own ideas on the matterhybrids currently have 8 types of ammunition each corresponding to their own range band instead take the 8 types of ammunition and split them into 4 ranges and 2 exclusive damage types this makes ammo selection much much simpler and gives the hybrid user more options while still retaining all 8 ammo typesfor example antimatter plutonium uranium and thorium cover the ranges that the 8 types used to but now only do thermal damage lead iridium tungsten and iron likewise cover the range spectrum but only do kinetic damage therefore if i wanted to deliver thermal damage eg vs blood raiders or shieldtanked ships at extreme range i would load thorium rounds likewise if i want to deal maximum damage at close range against serpentis or armortanked ships at close range i would load leadi also believe that doing so would increase the demand for certain types of hybrid ammo when was the last time you saw anyone buying tungsten ammo or buying anything but antimatter faction ammo from the lp storehybrid ammo should also be fairly compact  ammo propelled by cap is going to be smaller vs ammo propelled by mass not a major issue but one that makes intuitive senseequally important is how ships that use hybrid weapons synergies with them specifically the ship bonuses and powergridcap useunfortunately i dont have enough experience with caldari railboats and eft to make many suggestions regarding pg or cap usage i also am not in a position to comment on t2 hybrid ammo xphaving said that i do like the idea of increasing dps and reducing alpha on hybrids by increasing rof and reducing cap cost per shot having more compact ammo would help compensate for the added ammo consumption if not the cost tracking changes though remain a contentious issue that i dont have the experience to comment onbut i would recommend the following for gallente boats1 change the hybrid damage bonus and any active tanking bonuses on drone boats to an armor bonus reason being that drone boats dont really rely much on guns to do their damage while increasing buffer seems a lot more flexible than increasing local tank2 change the blaster boat bonuses to a tracking or damage bonus to hybrids and a speed bonus to propulsion mods ab or mwd the first addresses the particular strengths of blasters while the other addresses the weakness of blastersi suppose the hyperion would then become an odd ship  having a dps or tracking bonus and an armor buffer bonus instead of the expected prop bonus maybe the hype is supposed to be suited for either rails or blasters i dunnoits important to note that none of these copy any other races specialties exactly and allow gallente ships to retain their own particular niche

eve is famous in the mmo market for being a game that has a steep learning curvethe current new player experience is bewildering to newbs and needs improvementin order to appreciate and understand the eve sandbox its imperative to find and join a corp that fits the new players particular needs as well as teach them to get the most out of their desired activitieseve uni is famous for being a corp run by people dedicated to bringing new players up to speed and part of an corp eventsso why cant ccp run their own corp for newbs  they have the resources to do soi suggest that ccp use the factional warfare militias  specifically make the fw militias run by ccp employees for new players after all if they can hire people to run the help channel and have the funds to create dust 514 they can sure as hell use the same resources to draw and retain new players to both eve and dust 514after the new player does the tutorials he has a bunch of shiny ships that hes itching to use he is automatically assigned a militia based on his starting race and is directed to the corresponding militia hub systemevery sunday and a rotating weekday each militia schedules a fleet op of varying type  fw pvp hiseclowsec mining tutorials etc naturally there are going to be other players trying to grief or crash these events so the ccp employee running them would need to be flexible on other days militia members are still close enough to each other to run their own ops if they likefrom there players can choose playerrun corps to fit their particular timezone language and activity preferences
pretty much what has already posted i want to add another thingreduce the amount of times low fuel messages are sent to pos managers it becomes annoying when the pos begs to be fed 6 times in a day it becomes even more annoying when you have multiple accounts with you mail flashing with a load of notifications
just say no to pink bunnies on scorpions that is what hello kitty online is for no
noso many votes no and they are mostly veteran playersi really dont like where it goes and after playing the game for 6 years it may be a time to quit to bad i just passed 100mil spwhat is better  a returning customer or a new customerif ccp thinks that a new customer is better then think again or change marketing specialistssimple thing  this is a game for older people if you change it to be a game for younger people older will quit you cant have them all sitting in the same sandbox  it just does not work
noseen it before no microtransactions policy then microtransaction only for cosmetic itemsbut then wait and game changing items start showing up anyone what a super dreadnought with a extra large drone bay that can lauch fighterbombers  just pay 500x in the store today
nono micro transactions not even for cosmetic items because once theyre in it wont stop at cosmetics read uselessand no additional currency pleaseiskplexaurumisk wheres the sense in thatheck even plexisk was a bad idea
no
no
no no microtransactions at all
no
nobecause after seeing how eve development has been evolving even the cosmetic microtransaction would and will redirect development hours away from other things which got much higher priority in my mind

gallente ships deserve some lovinfix blastersimplement uber combat drones to be used specifically by gallente ships
nayi always hear the fix blasters story but truth is the megathron is one of the top used bss in null sec fleet battles right after the apocalypse

galente power should be in drones  nosferatu not in hybridsyou have my drones and my onboard axe
so who should specialize in hybridsdont say caldari since they have missiles and ew
wrong in actuality sniping bs fell out of favor over two years ago along with the alterations to make scanning easier their range advantage did not offset their pitiful railbased dps and once probed out is easy to drop a blob on with the op state of projectiles the current fotm is a shieldfit maelstrom the reason for this is if you can alpha a carrier you deny the enemy the ability to even use their logistics from our wiki  if you bring a gallente ship to a fleet fight people laugh at you

i agree let us choose cq or hangar view static also if anyone wants it dont just cut us off ccpcq eats 90 of my cpu and gpu while in space eve hangs at around 3540 both cpu  gpu while i could live with increased req for the game show us you care for your customers by not kicking hangar view outwe like our hangar views ship spinning looking from all angles and enjoying it
i actually love ship spinning in hangars
1 also stop ruining my game
until i hear a good reason as to why the cq is replacing the old hanger i support thisi dont have any trouble running it as it presently exists on sisi but i cant think of agameplaytechnicallore reason why the cq would be mandatory if ccp has one i would love to hear it
i think it already does something like that iirc the system doubles the cost per week of the war
not that im aware this is the formula quoted by evelopediatime doesnt appear to matter
because pirates never go after tankers container ships and pleasure cruisers they always demand 1v1s with navy warships right right
not supported this is a bandaid to the wardec system  it need to be redesigned from the ground up as it does not currently provide interesting gameplay for both parties for neither party if they play sensiblythe correct and reasonable way to respond to a wardec is to1 avoid all combat except when you can2 crush the enemy with overwhelming forcethe correct and reasonable way to enact a wardec is to1 avoid all combat except when you can2 crush the enemy with overwhelming forcethis discourages further wardecs and makes your side look stronger  but it is not fun for either party the only time it becomes interesting is when one party gets the overwhelming force calculation wrongcurrently wardecs are only well designed ie fun if you wish to be wardeced
call me cynical but the war dec system is not designed to provide interesting gameplay to both parties it is designed for the attacking party to deprive the defending party of interesting gameplay imo depriving other players of game enjoyment should not be a design goal but that ship has sailed long ago the present proposal is intended to limit said reduction in game enjoyment to a finite time period for any particular target corp
you would think that before signing up for a game someone would understand the game play before the made a decisionright
yes of course eve is very complex and for every tactic that affects one negatively such as a war dec there are numerous counter tactics corp shuffling join an alliance hire mercs move to low sec hide in wormholes etc etc we who have been in eve for a while know this and are not driven away from the game just because we are targeted by hostile playersthis proposal is more for the benefit of new players who dont have access to or knowledge of their full range of options to deal with conflict
wait there was less options and access to information back then when i first started stumbling around christ have the time you had to guessthe new guys now have much more depth and ease of information it actually requires less of a brain stem now to play this game then it did in the day and if the new player has that much of struggle now keeping up then hesheit should move on
yes to setting to zero the recharge rate of shields and capacitor while a noncovops cloak of any kind is activated im surprised it wasnt already like thatedit to attempt to remove any ambiguity
i dont know what you guys are talking about i scan through a random selection of youtube vids on nullsec alliance wars and the second most numerous battleship that i see is the megathron right after the apocalypse and the most popular carrier is the thanatos and nyx surely just because gallente ships dont make the top 10 most popular in some economic report isnt adequate proof that hybrid guns are gimpy it doesnt follow

how many times do you have to repeat yourself before you are comfotable that you have stated how you feel i havent noticed any change in your dialogue at all just a continuous reiteration of the same two points
as many times as it takes to help others along the path of realizing what the implications of mt are and what it really is unfortunatly you are beyond hope i and others have countered your points hey your entitled to your own opinions and you have now reached the level of basic trolling you cannot field an adequate argument so you have resulted to trolling 101 let me try and distract and derail threads with sarcastic and smart a remarks this isnt the first thread that you have attempted to do this in which is truley sad on your partand i qoute did vandrion get kicked from triple a or did he leave and start his own corpalliance that is the question of the day you poor poor manyou have resorted to threats omg no you are gonna come and pew pew a planet when dust comes out this actually made me laugh so hard it hurt because i have a different opinion then yours if you dont like my opinion or what i post then dont read it yes i know i have had to repeatedly tell you to read in this thread alone and now i am telling you not to perhaps reading isnt your issue maybe ccp should have a special money store item just for you reading comprehension skillbook i firmly believe you will be troll stalking the forum threads and looking for more opportunity to sneak in with an attempted troll just remember you have failed every time and that wont changenow back under the bridge before you hurt yourself
eh i never read corp and alliance forums no reason really good on you though despite that you are now in an alliance collectively referred to as the borgas for trolling i am doing no such thing i have just become so bored of your posts and that of others like you that i havent bothered reading them which would probably explain my last comment which was something along the lines of nothing new to see here moving along but not before i take a poke at you to see if youre still alive besides conflict is good for people like you it makes you actually have to think up a response rather than post the same old filth over and over againif you hadnt noticed this thread had boiled down to you and 23 others patting each other on the back for a page or so i felt it was my duty to change that shake it up a little so to speak the thing about you is you seem to think you are some sort of authority on the subject and even have a precognitive vision of the future which cannot possibly be wrong your posting chums seem to agree and feel the same way about themselves just a lot of doomsayers really we should get you all little placards you can hang on your avatars in fact thats a good idea for the vanity store somebody should post it in the features and ideas discussioni can see you hanging around caldari stations now with your little sign that says the end of eve is now we could even get you special little emotes that make you wave your arms around hysterically and put wild crazy expressions on your face wait i guess that wouldnt work considering your rp perspective okay itll just have to be shuffling arms a blankeyed stare swivelling head and slow clumsy steps then or maybe thats zombies of the apocalypseedit and by the way i havent even mentioned till now the fact that you are reposting your op from this thread in any other thread that is even remotely similar in nature thats just a little wierd

by a roleplay perspective this may seem legitimate the argument i have against it is the fact that it displays no actual effort on the behalf of the real person doing the afk cloaking in effect the person who owns the character is not playing the game and is not being engaging but does have the ability to affect the game and the people playing it the people who see this person in local are actually playing the game and are investing thier time into the game itself be it the carebear doing his thing the miner doing his or the fleet attempting to catch the pirate in system the latter are all people playing the game while the afk cloaker may be at work no where near his computer i say institute a timer that logs you like pretty much all other mmos have im not saying you cant camp a system to wage psywarfare but you should have to be there making inputs even if its talking in corpchat or checking market prices like everyone else to do it bluf to be able to affect the game in any way you should be actively playing the game regardless of any sentiment about the unfairness of local chat a person not at thier computer is not playing thae game and should not effect iti personally just ignore afk cloakers they dont stop me from doing the things i want to do
cant believe this is still on the first pageanyway op if an afk cloaker is preventing you from playing that is 100 your fault
i have been a trader for several years now i have taught many traders and ive made and lost small fortunes by no means am i a mogul but i know my way around the place i am also very familiar with the 01 isk adjustments and their pros and cons my proposal is to slightly shift the way sellbuy orders work on the market by allowing all traders who have an order at a matching price to sell collaboratively this would allow the market to remain stable for goods like trit which have a very small margin which you can imagine will stabilize prices of everything in eve this wouldnt end the practice of 01 isk adjustments but it would allow collaborators a way to share the market in a way thats advantageous to players as well as traders facets of this proposaltraders may share goods by putting a market order for an item at exactly the same price if the orders are for the same exact area of space only one order will be represented on the orders screen if the orders are for different areas of space but overlap multiple orders will be represented on the orders screen but in the area of overlap purchases will be dealt out to all traders at that price in a roundrobin fashionthank you for your consideration and commentsbaron von steubing
i have come to the conclusion that it is time to split the future of eve from its current incarnation what i propose is the followingretroactively remove new iterations of eve from the current server going back to before dominion sometime after releasing incarna  at least give the players the chance to experience what they will be missing before removing it entirely the current server will no longer see expansions in the direction of the past few years which will make a lot of the older playerbase happy business can continue as usual here and players who like that can return to what they enjoy with no future prospect of mt the new character creator recent sovereignity mechanics changes or the like basically everything everybody has been complaining about for the past three years with every new expansion an alteration to their beloved game leave in wormholes t3s new planets and the like im sure none of them have much issue with that overall most importantly no dust bunniesinvest in a new server for a new shard and announce the coming release of eve 2 hopefully by another name as im just using that for projection purposes introduce eve 2 with all the new developments in early 2012 this includes the carbon character creator carbon framework mt incarna support for the coming dust 514 etc eve will be reborn there will be no option to move characters from the existing shard to the new one all players who enter the new new eden will start from scratch and have to develop everything from an empty universe rife with possibilities split isk 40 into two seperate iterations one designed for the current eve and one for the new shard expand and redevelop both into guidebooks for their respective shards and lay out the fundamentals of character planning corporation building and all the rest within their pages players who are looking forward will likely restart on the new server quickly populating it with varying levels of experience and reinventing the wheel in an untouched universe i know i willcontinue with team bff and the thousand little things ask the current veteran playerbase to share their opinions of where the current eve universe should go and seperate your vision of the future from theirs  any bug fixing of shared content will benefit both shards all the new content liked by many of the playerbase will be available on the new server ship balancing can carry across both servers eve can retroactively split along seperate paths in totally different directions for the next few years perhaps at some point they will begin to parallel each other again but i imagine that will take some time dust 514 can thrive with a new eden brought to life only short months before its existance most importantly we can do away with the current trend of ragequitting renew old subscriptions bring back bitter vets and everyone will be happysee im happyrunning out of space one more post coming
go to chinese server theyre running older versions there and still use mostly t1 ships and modules
1 importantly id like to suggest changes to the new shard that include doing away with current aggression mechanics in favor of a system that actually places characters on one of two sides in an ongoing battle good vs evil if you will which perhaps even replaces the need for faction warfare this would give criminals rights in low security space where they have the benefit of corrupt and scandalous officials to support them and give others sorry eve doesnt have the precedence of a name for players who achieve high security status while being law abiding and just rights in high security spacethese two areas of space would define the borders of the warzones and each would be fair game within the others space a certain neutral standing would occur between 2 and 2 security status where things would be much the same as they are now concord would protect anybody above 2 security status in high security space and gate guns would fire on anyone ganking anyone in lowsec with greater than 2 security status this would result from a lack of notoriety for which the corrupt officials would have little respect or fear and thus operate according to local lawsthe other side of this is those same criminals who have the run of lowsec would be valid targets in high security space to any individual who has greater than 2 security status the war would exist on these fronts and security status gain or loss would be properly balanced to enhance this sort of gameplayany player kill would prevent the gain of security status for a certain period resulting in a cooldown timer security status gain would become directly impacted by where player kills are made a 2 security status character killing a criminal in lowsec would result in a gain of security status negating the cooldown timer for that character on that kill 2 or worse criminals killing each other anywhere would not result in a cooldown timer and would cause neither a gain or loss of security statusnullsec rats would have no impact on security status gain while having the highset monetary reward high and lowsec rats would have variable monetary rewards and difficulty equating to varying degrees of reward within the standard monetary range while having a reduced impact on security status the overall impact of these security status increases would be minimal and not greatly impact any characters security statuspolice would become targetable as rats are exist only in high and lowsec and have the same varying rewards and difficulties of highsec and lowsec rats faction standings would become affected by this ongoing conflict based on which space you pursue your activities in powerful criminals could actually gain standing in low security space due to there involvement with corrupt officials while seeing only a minor loss for pursuing their activities in highsec 2 or greater security status players would see faction standings increase for pursuing their activties against criminals in high security space while seeing no impact in low security space all levels of missions would be available in all space to account for these changes highsec characters would still be penalized for podkilling criminals in high security space and recieve a cooldown timer on security status gain for doing so in lowsec2 id also like to suggest implementing changes to standings mechanics such that being a part of one faction and running missions does not neccessarily mean you are enemies with two others how often does one soldier take on the rage against an empire okay quite often but i still think its a little extreme at least offer us the ability to make a checklist of who we are willing to engage so our agents can look it over and quietly shuffle those other missions to the back of the pilethats about it for now that security statusongoing war thing is quite involvedo
i would actually be dropping this server and moving to the new one as i mentioned in my post feel free to argue what should be kept on this server if such a thing should happen however honestly ive felt that this should happen for some time as ive seen the opposition between the playerbase grow more and more intense since dominioni think the first time it occured to me was nearly 6 months ago you cant make everybody happy and keep it all on one server at the same time currently it trends towards the older players being ed off and left out im not sure which one you are feel free to discuss what you would like to keep of the current trend on the current server however
so if i understand you correctlyyou want to essentially double ccps server costs double their maintenance time really double the cost of maintaining eve all while suggesting that the most populous singleshard universe on the planet should be split all because older players read you are mad at recent changesheres a little tidnibblet eve has undergone changes especially in the past three years and their subscription base continues to grow why with no real incentive other than saving face a quality which ccp really doesnt care about and increasing their overhead would they do thiscant tell if troll or just stupid
check his post history and the answer will become clear unfortunately
yes i know you may or may not be working on new pos stuff but here is what you can do to lessen the amount of pos managers commiting suicide spending hours upon hours for one pos due to the current mechanicsreduce all anchoringunanchoringonline timers by 75all you have to do is go in and change the numbers on the those aspects and it will help out tremendously until you bless us with the new stuff
i would tend to agree though i might make it 80 or 90 just to alleviate the pain of past experience
yes plz
ive asked ccp to do this as part of the jump bridge changes but it was too late to make that patch i will ask again i specifically asked for all module unanchor timers to be set to 5 seconds and for tower unanchor timers to be increased to compensate
most anchoring timers maybe onlining and unanchoring though is a different matter reducing that would make it much easier to maintain a towers defense by onlining new guns as old ones get incapped and allows you to online defensive mods that you turned off to fit more silosreactorswhatever much faster removing some of the penalty for doing so and worse if you just blanket reduce timers it would make cycling cyno jammers and similar mods much easier reducing the online timer for towers themselves makes it much harder to kill it before it goes up and reducing the anchor timer for the tower itself gives you less time to prepare and cutting down the unanchor timer lowers the risk of someone coming along and stealing your tower while youre trying to take it downbeing able to queue it up somehow would be nice but just cutting the timers does have consequences
the only real issue with 00 is that its not accessable to individuals that arent arleady established and hasnt been since the gates opened up to that area in 0304 since then stability alliances the ability to set other alliances friendly to form massive coalitions nc fc drf sctheyve gained stability and would be hard pressed to be pushed outpushing these alliances to the tipping point and causing massive failscades across new eden would be the only way to open up more 00 and get players willing to venture back out into nullsec however there is really no way to do this within the current scope of the gamespawns for anomsplexes in 00 should more evenly reflect the spawn time in 05site spawns should be region specific not sec specific ie all sites have the same change to spawn regardless of sec statussite rewards should be spawn specific not spec specific ie a frigate that is worth 3500 in high seclow sec should be 3500 in nullsecall moons regardless of sec status should have a depletionrecharge time of 2472 moon mining should only be allowed in lowsec nullsectech ii ship insurance should be balanced with the cost of the ship not with the t1 counter partthere should be an equal number of w space as there is k spacebased off of the 7 year average of modual dropsbounties drone drops should be increaseddecreased as needed to be more inline with current faction anomsreverse the jump bridge changes implimented at 00 currently they pose no real logistical challenge threat or otherwise change the face of 00 that ccp wantedeither increase passive and active armor mods to more accurately reflect their shield counterparts in bonuses cpu and pg requirements and draw backs or decrease shield mods to reflect their armor equivilenteither increase repair mods to reflect the use of a shield boosterboost amplifier or decrease the effectiveness of shield boosterboost amplifier to be more inline with armor repair modsautocannon blaster pulse artillery beam and railguns should be balanced to be more inline with each other leaving missiles how they are may drive players to use missile boats over turret boats however that is still the current state of optimal play this would only balance the different types of turrets to be more competative against other turret typesincrease the minimum corprate tax rate to 15 in order to eleviate the tax havens that highsec players createdo not allow corps to be created with less than 20 people that must include a minimum of 1 player from each race that is not the ceosalliances should not have the ability to alter standings with other alliances removing the ability to form 10000man allainces corporations in an alliance should not be able to alter corprate standings
i agree with this vast areas of 00 are empty and a big reason is that its just so hard to get there some things that might help more wormhole connections from high sec to 00 i havent opened a huge number of wormholes but it seems they almost never open into null sec more crap regions in 00 along the lines of providence places that are accessible from high sec and resource poor compared to the rest of 00 so that the superpower alliances are likely to just ignore it how about sleeper incursions in 00 that annihilate all the poss randomly seed the incursions so that every region gets one at least every few months if players want to recolonize the region they have to fight their way in and clean out the sleeper nests
more 00 that nobody wants to fight over oh grandhow about an ore supercap whose job is to mine moons something that doesnt even need to be on the same grid as the pos and mines the moon that can perhaps pull 100 per type per hour and if you mine 100 units the pos mines nothing have the thing siege and it would lock the moon so itd have to be outside a pos shields a long distance no more afk income for alliance leader pockets unless you defend your moons now those rich moons are for everyone not just 5 big alliances
premature mouthfoaming much check it out i bolded the interesting part and even took the liberty to underline the very interesting partfor clarityrequiring payment  accepting donationin simple terms if you charge people for your software you have to pay up and you damn well shouldif you do not charge but accept donations from people that enjoy your software which you provide free of charge you dont have to payalso it appears they are rethinking if isk should be considered payment at all
just slap a paypal button up and accept donationswell duh derp derp
the bigger point here is the utterly ridiculous figure of 99 something around 1020 would be much more reasonablein general apps that would fall into the category that would desire a commercial license would be those that would offer a superversion of what they already offer with slightly more shininess thats going to be for what 099  2 tops unless the programmer is a moron
this is youdue to general ignorance andor selective reading i never realised devs of 3rd party apps currently cant require a payment so now that ccp is actually putting in place a way for devs to charge for their timeeffort i am going to rage up like a stupid manchild
in that case cheer upseriously with the current figure of 99 what are we looking at in terms of revenue for them maybe 23k a year topsat some point you also have to see the thing from their side how much money would you be willing to pay for the ability of a 3rd party to make a profit from your product
if i could support this a thousand times i wouldffs ccp you are letting chribba wollari peter powers and many others that shaped this community down the drain
id have to agree that the crapstorm has gotten out of control an iphone apps devs get greedy and now the entire community is getting shafted for iti understand how useful cellphone apps are but ccp dont throw the baby out with the bathwater this is a community who loves this game and produces items sometimes for a nominal isk charge getting slapped in the faceevidencesso much for forum signatures and the many artists who use this to afford the pvp ships or otherwisewhile battleclinic and others may not have a severe problem paying the 99 per year it does add another straw to the proverbial camels back and one that is unnecessaryif the iphone app falls through because the devs cant charge for it one of the other avid fans of eve will create an app it may not be as good but it may not need to be as good as wellccp think of your community first as the smallest groups tend to have the loudest voices
ccp fail greed got the better of you its not like they need the money when they can take 409 staff on holiday to mexico every yearcommunity is everything in eve player participation is what makes eve what it is youre killing that ccp they dont make money from the api so why punish people for fleshing out your game its not like it costs you anything thats not already covered in the subscription
how about you charge the same amount blizzard charges wowhead mmochampion etc  nothing
bad idea ccp
whowho whowhat have they ever done for me thats what id like to know
amazing ignorance or troll cant decide which

my guess is an owl
im not the richest guy im a student and this will force me to shutdown my work in hosting for isk and providing some paid and some free services to the community

ive posted in the thread csm did not see the devblog in advance which is unfortunate because we would have made the same objectionsits pennywise and poundfoolish imho
its not even pennywise the entry bar is far too high for a gaming community in the apple app store world you have a potential customer base of millions of users all of them cashedup and ready to spend in the eve online world you have a potential customer base of a hundred thousand or so who are already paying 15month to pay the gamecharging people 99year for the possibility of being able to make a couple of hundred dollars is rather ludicrous noone will be able to afford that licence feecut the licence fee to 0 take a portion of the revenue provide ingame advertising of licenced properties itll be a different picture for both ccp and the third party devsmy suggestion on the matter is to implement ingame subscription purchases using the eve ingame store as something like the apple app store to promote third party properties and make it very easy for players to buy subscriptions to the third party servicesthe system ive proposed will allow folks like chribba to continue doing things exactly like they are right now every now and then i could throw an aurums worth of real dollars his way without racking up small transaction charges or excess monthly transaction charges up on my card a 99yr fee  portion of revenue makes sense in the apple app store world because of the size of the market and that markets propensity for spending money they bought iphones helloooo money it doesnt make sense in the eve online world they play games to pass the time instead of starting new companies or working second jobs  bunch of cheapskates edit duh click support before submitting 
make it a 5x multiplier skill which maxes out at 8 jump clones at level 5 and youve got yourself a dealwith regards to the jump time its more relevent to cost and in game lore than character training make it an increased cost for jump clones to decrease the waiting time between jumps seperate that from jump clones stored on player ships unless upgrades are purchased to improve those facilities result being a jump clone which is available in 9 hours would cost a literal fortune 2 billion isk for that availability where the standard would cost only the usual 100k isk also make advanced infomorph psychology i a prerequisite to the use of advanced cloning facilitiesid be good with that
eve is small enough as it is do not want
pretty simple this one it just came to me but im still surprised i havent seen it beforein ui boxes that expect a numerical input such as splitting stacks or transferring isk allow us to type a single letter suffix to multiply that number for example2k becomes 2000005m becomes 5000000009b becomes 900000000000
very nice ideasupport
how about using an existing standard for entering numbers in scientific format1e3  10001e6  10000001e9  1000000000excel works this way so why not eve too
subject new in eve how to maintain updated my clonesubject im new and dont know how to update my clonethe whole concept is avoid being punished and generally only applies to pvpers and newbs vets and carebears just set a high clone and forget about the whole thing for yearsdo newbs and pvpers really need to be punished i doubt people are really losing sp at any real rate anyway so why keep a needlessly complicated systemjason just broke 75 million sp ntrabbit is about to break 150million sp the real problem is that sp is getting really high and theres not a great deal left to train vets need a new thing to train for and sp needs to start going awaymy going suggestion is bioships where high sp characters jump into a bioship and the thing starts off weak instead of training skills you grow the bioship the actual bioships weapons and stuff gets bonuses from all 4 races at once 1 year old bioship might be an epic frig year 2 can be epic cruiser year 3 can be epic battlecruiser year 4 can be epic battleship say the ship dies in year 4 thats 4 years worth of sp gone this would be epic for the game vets get something and the game gets a good sp sink
when you run out of stuff to train on your main char start sinking the sp into alts on that accountabout the sp clones i dont particularly like them either where the hell is my notification about uncovered sp but they are a small isk sink afterall and there are not enough of those anyway
because it keeps monthly subscriptions coming in what part of this business model is hard for you to understand
shameless bump
spoken like someone whos never dug themself out of pirate status
bump good idea
exactly my pointand they dont want to find out oh noes grinding sec status is so hard baw so they just take the easy way out by hiding behind their high sec alt to afk wait out and avoid any actual fights while isk printing at the same time cant war dec them cause they stay in an npc corp so when they face the consequences for doing so via suicide gank they cry about the suicide gank and cry about nerfs to it they want an easier modejust for themselves
why to make a point one they will hear and feel because lets be real companies only feel their walletis eve ready for such a thing its a common tool in rl why shouldnt it work in eve could it be a new tool for the csm every thought about itedit man if you dont spell it out for the children its like a worker striker you know boycotting the service and thats not illegal its showing them whos boss  customer
what are you babbling about it seems as if you are suggesting something which would be illegal not to mention generally stupid and fanatically driven
strike as in attack or strike as in dont log inlulzsec are doing the former for you anyway and as for the latter well congratulations on winning eve i guess
they are not okay to mey afk clouckers araund to litle eforce from thos to kil some one if some one teling me thet they are vurnible when lauch cyno than that bul  when they launch cuno allready to latenedd to be soem mechanics to get rid off them hoo is siting in sytems days and weeks cloucked actualy i have one idea just put mesage there that and that guy cloucked in system that every one see it if hee nto tuching that char notm oving ship etc for like 30 mins than masage up that and that its uinactive and when hee is active presed sotming or moved ship then agein warnign that and that cloucker its active that ways couck remaisn how its is but all will knoe that that guy is afk and no need to frade off him and if hee start move ship or do wath ever action in game with that char again mesage up so every one knows and if wish can awoud or set trap for him
im sure ccp has a reason in specifically picking those out to have no tick box
1and if you are at it also remove all meaningless progressbarsprogress indicators should only appear if something takes longer as expected 3s rather than showing us a progressbar in every jump do a fullscreen jump effect or something like that an
no it doesent you need more to work with than just the basic concept
anyone have a list about this i see a lot of qq on the matter but no specifics my understandin is its cosmetics like you see in wow where people buy flying crap w cash but has no effect on the actual mechanics personally i think something like that is a waste but if people want to spend 15 on a cool pair of shades for there toon by all means go for it if your paying 15 for something that impacts mechanics then no so anyone have a list or can comment
been saying this for months now somehow its not getting through to either ccp or the csm they keep failing at communicating at least link your posts blogs tweets whatever on these forums
csm5  csm6 wheres the accomplishments the transparency the communications mittanis own writings state that you should make it as easy as possible for people to receive your message and to use all possible channels im not seeing squat coming out of csm6 why did csm5 take only 23 weeks to produce their minutes but csm6 takes months what happened to the csm6 campaign promises wtb mynxee administration
1 again
so much truth as i have mentioned time and time again ccps slow crawl to faceless entity mega corp is slowly stripping it of its soul the craze for gaining more subbers on a game that from the ground start is made up to appeal to a core specific mindset is doomed to fail from the start i support this idea
one of the strongest points about this game that i dont see exploited enough is how pvp has real impact lets take wow for exmple as lets be honest thats where most people are going to be coming from being the biggest fish in the pond by a long way and all for around 6 years i think the horde and alliance have been fighing over various bits of land via battlegrounds thousands upon thousands have poured in and given their virtual lives in these conflicts and yet the situation has not changed one iota you defeat an opponent and are granted a couple of points and 30 seconds later theyre back in the thick of the fighting unaffectedin eve the same broad conflicts over territory and resources exist and they are actually at stake set your sights on a system to conquer and victory doesnt mean points and a step closer to some achievement it means you conquer the system defeat an opponent and they loose their ship potentially affecting their ability to fight effectivly for some time even if they can a afford to replace it 10 times over you still make a measurable dent you may remove them from the fight totally be it because they have to go pick up a ship fit a new one or are unwillingunable to risk anything more even if they come striaght back out with another boat from the stockpile you still cost them and chances are theyre tactics and loadout will reflect this defeat is actually meaningful you take a chunk our of your resources with every loss forcing you to learn and adapt and making victory all the more sweet when you achieve itthis is eves usp what sets it apart from wow and its clones and i just dont see it being overtly exploited enough
adjustable warning timer id love to get a mail when i only have 5 days fuel left and one every other day after that
noi wouldnt have a problem with purely vanity items but its the thin end of the wedge if we tolerate monocles next thing you know noobs are buying titansjust say no

a year later we are still heading down the failed pathturn it around help us help you we have ideas for gameplay we have experts on balance economists who predict your market behaviour and computers we would volunteer via programs like foldinghome if you want simulations runthis is not an unfixable game this game is not expensive to fix get started notified i already supportedhad to wait 2 mins 
meh i would say it is way past time to work on content such as faction warfare and other previous releases
negative the rationale works in all security if a is being ambushed in highsec and the opponent b formerly named c isnt being blown away by concord its because b has justification justification beingkill rights  your karma is not my problem  set victims to red next time odds are you wont remember a particular name or be looking for several in local every millisecond anywaywar  being red should have been your first clue to shoot ityoure being suicide ganked  its too late regardless of their namein any case the name change is insignificantalthough yeah while you cant go around killing neutrals without expecting consequences in highsec i did deliberately write if theyre neutral theyre neither and thus a risk prepare to shoot it depends on the corp policy emphasis on prepare this is eve not hello kitty online if youre not suspicious youve got it coming
also the old name should be indexed so if someone does search for it the new name comes up with an explanation that the person had changed their name
i feel exactly the same way please ccp give us the option to choose a different font or at least increase the size a bit for higher resolutions not just in the chat but for everything
ccp dont listin to their members do they so many support this like the most supported thing ingame and still they dont do anything about it why have this forums ccp u never listin to players anyway

support thisalso as someone else in other thread noted there is no point storylineimmersionwise in deploying a capsuleer from hisher capsule which is supposed to be a tedious process every time heshe docks and throwning the said capsuleer back into the pod upon undocking especially if heshe docked just to change the shipmake it optional with a button enter cq or something like that while retaining the hangar view were used to while not in cq for those who like shipspinning or are just passing by to take some wares from the hangar and are in no way interested in renting a fullyfledged cq because their visit qwill be really short
supportedi want it to be an optional feature like it was in the very first preview of it at fanfest some years agoits pretty much impossible to run multiple clients across 2 monitors now with cq even if only 1 is docked and the other is in space massive fps hit and i am not a fan of a static bg image with an overlayed ui
it should be so but knowing ccp and past screwups it wont be
i think you mean cerebral cortex not brain stem too much of the latter in eve now if you ask meback in the day there were no bored 6year veterans to deal with you cant compare todays new player experience to the one we had  the game has changed too muchedit irrelevant comment about moons deleted
what do moons have to do with new players
industrytradingmining  its all pvp just not done with cannons when you installed eveonline you tacitly agree to wardecs and suicide gankingnot supported
no i meant brain stem the basic stuff to control life support the nervous system etc apparently you missed the point it takes very little to grasp this game and the fact some cantwell you get the ideait is all relative the age and size of the population moons back in the daycurious to get an understanding of your concept of back in the day what the hell does moons have to do with the topic
war weariness eh perhaps balance it so that increase is mitigated by success in battle sandbox goes both ways so kind of a silly thing to say besides the people who live the dream of constant wardecs rarely if ever have protracted wars against single targets so will be largely unaffected
youre right that an individual war dec rarely lasts a long time whats more likely is that a defending corp is targeted by a stream of war decs so that it is in a state of war more or less indefinitely this proposal is meant to give such corps a break once in a whileas for the effect on aggressive corps who like to declare wars on further thought i dont think that needs changing if someone wants to declare wars all the time so be it as long as there is some mechanism to prevent one target from always being in the crosshairs the original proposal has been edited accordingly
well you made yourself sound sufficiently like a pervertif you bothered to read youd know ive posted in most of those threads and hold the same position i do know opposing yours and many of theirs so ive got integrity which doesnt really prove anything or even mean either you or i are right in any fashion at least ive shown i have the ability to consider the views of others and have even taken some liberty with modifying my position if only slightlyneither you or many of those others seem to have the ability to do this which only provides me with all the evidence i need to be convinced that you are not only propagandizing but are fanatic in your cause lets say youre right and ccp really is extremely bent on destroying your version of eve to replace it with some money grabbing online application what do you think will happen the vast majority of players will decide they have better things to do and they will unsub from eve and eventually eve will either go f2p or itll die entirely due to a low population and being an unworthy investment maybe do you really think ccp hasnt thought of that or that they would be investing as much as they are in the continuation of eve more likely theyd discontinue future development almost entirely releasing only minor expansions here and there while doing marginal bug fixes and simply maintaining content they would already be moving in the direction of f2p and they would have a generic mt store planned with gimics and ships to enhance your gameplayonce eve went f2p none of the old guard would matter anymore as only diehards would stay beyond all that rmts would move on to other things for the most part with little reason to invest in that sort of game the server would be repopulated with lower income or cheaper players looking for something with quick and easy rewards and minimal time investmentthere would be no graphics updates rd or anything of that sort because the time and development staff investment simply would not be worth it eve would be backburnered and forgotten for all extents and purposes at some point ccp would sell it to a company interested in operating an mmo with minimal time investment requirement and a satisfaction with small rewards for that effortccp would not put their next generation graphics technology into eve or continue development on any of their proprietary technologies with eve that would all end no carbonui no carbon framework and no nvidia partnered technology you would still be happily wearing your old plastercine mug while looking quite colorfulhave you thought of that or are you completely blind something most people are accusing ccp of being these days

the recent changes reflected in agents made easy have removed useful complexity from the mission system i believe this has resulted in a much poorer experience instead of making missions more interesting and varied its turned the mission system into much more of a grind than it used to be two flaws of the new system1 fixed agent quality  there is now no sense of progression i find a system where access to agents and rewards improves as you gain corp standings much more immersive and logical than one where they all instantaneously switch from being disgusted by your mere appearance to finding you super sexy awesome2 removal of agent division variety  while the changes have made life easier for the folks that just want to do the same thing over and over and over its completely removed the set of agents that enable players to be generalists for me having a mixture of combat couriertrade and mining missions reduces the monotony of missioning my favorite mission chains are those that require or allow a mixture of skills and activities for example i love the level 3 new frontiers chain because it has mining courier pewpewpew and having to deal with neutstasis towersproposal make agent quality go from 20 to 20 again keep pure mission type agents but add back in mixed mission type agents eg advisory personnel marketing pr astrosurveyingside note the entire agents made easy blog seems inherently contrary to the ethos of eve i still cant figure out why removing complexity for the sake of removing complexity was considered a good idea
1 totally agree with this point2 i actually liked this change because i hated getting random courier missions when i wanted to pewpew but it would be cool to have at least one agent type that gave random missions it would also be great to have mission arcs that spanned all of the various kinds of missions in one arc
1 they did this to eliminate mission hubs now there are players more spread out and less load on the servers and many corporations now have decent agents in highsecurity space winwin2 i can somewhat agree with a chaos type agent who gives out a variety of missions maybe have a different type of agent that may give securitydistribution distributionmining and securitymining and maybe one type of agent who gives a spread of all three typesone type of split id like to see is security who gives antipirate missions and internal security who gives antifaction missions some people prefer to run the antifaction missions who dont care about opposing standings and get the highvalue items in the lp store
1 for freelancer agents in concept they could even take crossfaction jobs

thisnow grow a pair and get on with life
apparently someone failed to realize that servers are low maintenance compared to development or did you think that 5075k a year per developer would cost less than server maintenance and youre calling me stupid or troll lets see current developers working for ccp multiplied by an average wage of approx 72k just a guess but its not unreasonable comes to approx 43272000 per yearnah servers must cost more than that
you donbt have to like it or even agree with it but the idea is up there i should have expected that the only posts id get are the usual flaming and trolling as per usual or even responses that suggest im a trollforums as usual no surprise here
you suggested something that goes 100 against the idea behind eve and the direction ccp wants to takegb2wow if you want multishards seriously
i played maybe 5 minutes of wow in my life found it dreadfully boringas for eve and new shards i dont say this because i want eve to split up into two shards but more because i see it becoming an inevitability since the release of dominion the eve playerbase has become steadily more and more disatisfied with the current direction of eve with numerous players quitting cancelling subs andor working actively at ruining ccps reputationit has developed to the point where specific groups are actively targeting ccp and eve online and attempting to dissuade new players from subbing or continuing subscriptions this does not look good for the future of eve despite that some of us remain loyal and a few of us believe ccp is doing the right thing others do not and more players are following the trend of dissatisfaction with every new expansion or release of content and every live blog that details ccps plans for the next series of updatesthe only exception to this trend is when ccp releases a dev blog detailing fixes on old legacy content which they are preferentially holding back on until they can properly release it under the carbon framework ccp has already released blogs to this effect but an impatient player populace is unsatisfied with the lack of a quick delivery to solve their problemsmoreover players are unhappy with the current projections of mt in a pay2play eve and have no intention of giving the service any credit or merit even before it has been released on a trial run scheduled for the 21st of june no more than 2 days before eve tq is migrated to the new server clusterplayers rant and vent about ccp not meeting their expectations and lacking any consideration for the playerbase yet these things are being done none the less players continue to cancel subs and enact bitter vengeance on ccp through inconsiderate and inflammatory posting which is generally in poor taste and lacking in foresightedness while generally being completely ignorant of the facts as they are presentedso i posted this and read it or not this is my feeling on the matter id rather it was not the case but when the playerbase in general wont even acknowledge the need for some controls on how pvp is forced on players who havent the time or inclination for it while lacking the isk to support such activities among other things i would say eve is riven by opposing viewpoints and thoroughly steeped in animositysome thoughts on the matter of ccp and eve from 00sage00 i do not agree with him in the slightest but there it isediteve online currently has two active servers in china and the uk respectively they are serenity and tranquility there is precedenceid also like to note a blog by another pilot which mentions the rift in eve of which i was speaking and it is not an uncommon viewpoint this essentially mirrors how i feel though i have not been so much subject to this phenomena as witness to it
fact is your wanting them to deviate from the last freaking thing they ahvent deviated from yet so your just wanting to splitt he playerbase which in the longrun will serve little to no actual purpose
actually there are benefits to splitting the playerbase which i havent mentioned here yet one is that a new server and shard with a fresh start will be at first free of rmt and have a great many opportunities available for the players that go there the other primary benefit is that the players who stay here will see a massive drop in competition in the economy as players leave this server for another nullsec space will open up and jita will lose a great many traders while wormhole space will see a drop in active players claiming space thereanother benefit for tq would be the trend to develop according to the player interests currently for the older players most likely to stay this includes fixing of old content rollback of certain unwelcome developments like the current sov mechanics and most importantly they get to keep their griefingcall it a splitting of the servers between light and dark new and old and allowing each to develop along their own progressive paths it wouldnt be such a bad thing and i for one would actually welcome the change i would also be somewhat saddened to see and acknowledge finally and without doubt that the current shard of tranquility cannot exist for all of usit is my thought that it cant and some of us will have to move on and leave you to your grief
if you no longer like the direction eve is going stop playing no need for old shard and new shard no need for ccp to cut into their profit margins building out a new server cluster for those who cannot or will not adapt to the changing environment of the gameto paraphrase a meme adapt or unsub
as soon as serenity went online the single shard mantra became rhetoric
i agree it was useful informationplease show at least standings toward factionscorps those toward agents are not that useful

it was a stupid change reverse it please ccp
how about this idea to quell you we already have an aggression system in place so why not include towers in it if it attacked or was attacked in the previous x minutes or hours or whatever then no changes can occur or time is multiplied by xi know that is a bit more that what the op had in mind and may take a bit more programming than changing a number or two but stillanyway with that out of the way i do agree it does take a bit too long to unanchor and offonline pos structures but we do need to keep in mind what steve said because he is right it can be made unfair as well
counterproposalanchoring rank 3 this skill reduces anchoring times by 10 per level
as steave435 already pointed out a drastical reduction in anchoringonlining timers will have significant gameplay effects currently when an enemy tries to set up a starbase in your space you have enough time to discover it and mount a defensive force before it is fully operational if the entire anchoring process took 10 minutes you would barely be able to spot itwhat i would really like to see is making the timers separate for each person so if you have three people setting up the pos they can anchoronline three modules at the same time this eases the pain and also promotes teamplay instead of having to draw straws for who of the four pos guys in corp gets to sit there for a day anchoring we could all get it done together in two hoursi also like the idea of the anchoring skill slightly reducing the timer  gives it a reason to exist other than a prerequisite for sdm
this is a good idea i would also like to see a serious reduction in the hps of offline towers but thats for another proposal
how about this lower the overall average time it takes to anchor starbase modules in enemy sov it takes longer to set up a starbase in sovless systems or npc space it takes the normal amount of time in friendly sov it takes even less timethis way you cant quickly spam starbases in enemy space
eve urgently needs and has needed for a long time another 23 regions like curse large 70 systems npc sov close to empire several hisec entrences good connections to the rest of the map lots of npc stations there should be a guristas curse a serpentis curse dont talk to me about syndicate and a blood raider curse positioned to caldari gallante and amarr space in a similar way to how curse is to minmatar spacespace like this is the ideal territory for smaller corporations and alliances to gain a presence in 00 without having to deal with the massive cap blobs and coalitions that are inherent in sov space

the handy buttonmany pilots finance their living in new eden by belt ratting and to improve this a certain button could be placed in the user interface below the system details would be yet another collapsable field from where you can choose to browse either only planets moons or asteroid belts those who practice planetary interaction can view planetary details from the quick menu choose which type of a planets storm ice barren etc customs office they want to travel to and those who are looking for setting up a control tower pos can view moons and finally those who look to shoot pirate npcs can see how many belts there are in the system in total and when theyre at a belt killed the npcs they can just push the next belt button in order to warp to the next belt this would speed up the ratting process as otherwise one would have to browse through the vast list of asteroid belts in the system find where they are at the moment and then select the next beltsome systems have over 40 beltsa new pos module or a modification of the ship fitting arraya pos module sort of a depot where pilots can dock their ship to the depot would offer fitting services as well as repair hull and armor damage on your ship and regenerate your shields not only that the depot would be able to repair damaged modules aswell this would be great for pve and pvpplanetary interaction updatethe ability to save a planets structure layout this would speed up pi building and routing process you could make different kinds of presets and save them at a planet you just open the saved presets window and load up the structure layout youve previously done and place it whereever you want
not to be exceptionally hostile but if you cant even remember where in the system you are for 5 minutes or be bothered to actually move around and explore a bit and just want everything handed to you so you never have to actually go somewhere to learn about it stay in the station pleaseall i mean to say is your whole point seems to point to taht you cant be bothered to remember where you are or the planet types in systems you frequent which lets be honest if your gonna set up pi its going to be where you frequent because no one wants to go 8 jumps out fo their way to kansas just to pick up piimo this entire proposal seems as it would only cater to those too lazy to actually go do something or look around and would serve very little purpose to people who have an attention span longer then 5 minutes and no im not just saying this i have only had an account for upwards of 2 months and have already memorized every gate most of the solar system contents for every planet from amarr to mai and all i had to do was go out and play the game 2 hours a day

this doesnt really haven anything to do with the op idea and in of itself is pretty awesomeyou should make it its own topic reallyyes its happeningpl statistically has the highest concentration of sp of any alliance in eve right now no i cant remember what website it was we have like 7 of the top 10 sp alts in game and our average sp is like 85 million and i can tell you that we have people constantly losing skill pointswe make fun of them but they wont stop i personally screwed up my clone hopping twice now and have suffered
solutionremove clonesmake it so you can perma bind till bound somewhere else to any station that has med lab for free or really small feeprofitclones adds nothing to the game anyway its like learning skills its here but it doesnt make sense should be scrapped imo
clones are an isk sink a punishment for idiots and another consequence for dying they add plenty to the game and should not be removed
losing ship and implants which might be worth more than billion of isk in some cases is enough punishment for dying clones are pointless and their mechanics are very clunky  punishing players for not pressing one button every time and then or punishing them for having more sp than others lol is really dumb adds nothing to the game but unneeded overcomplication
the clone upgrade mechanic is what lets you incapacitate someones medical service and make their pilots lose sp every time theyre podded or have to move their clone somewhere else potentially far awaynot supported
theres always the character exchange you could sell your highsp characters and start fresh with a newbie  and a few billion isk

so to buff 00 would be to nerf 00 wouldnt a perfectly fine method of nerfing highsec and minimal nerfing lowsec be a superior method suddenly all highsec industry slots cost 15 more materials while buffing amarr stations so productivity is like insane fast currently 30 time bonus how about 50 the goal being to keep slots open if people manage to get 30 day lines on would be like 60 days worth of stuff in highsec suddenly building stuff in pos is meaningful and fighting over moons leads to far more destruction of everything

just because you dont understand why they are doing something doesnt mean they dont have a good reason this option allows ccp to collect personal information on indivduals who run api accessing sites and trade in isk with the playerbase it also allows the admins of those sites to make money from donations or commercial means using those sites while working within the parameters of ccps eula and tos provided they are interestedif you read the blog youd know that its in talks at this stage and open to changes youd also know that ccp intends to have a free licensing available for applications and sites which do not and have no intention of making money or isk off of this everything is still open to discussion and any 3rd party develoiper can bring up their issues with ccpi admit it might be a shock to have this news released but its a perfectly acceptable alternative to not having this availability which is potentially problematic legally uses bandwidth on ccps servers through api functionality and generally has been the subject of support development on ccps endas for your comment if you dont want to respond then thats fine and more your issue than mine this discussion has been tremendously lacking in crosscommunication anyway nice insults by the way id respond in kind but im not going to stoop so low for the likes of you if you cant see reality for what it is and step outside your little shell of fantasy and delusions then thats your problem i honestly dont know how old you are but i get pictures in my head of some 30 year old child running around his mothers basement in his undies when i think of itediti will give you this its likely that a lot of the recent developments in this area are a result of ccps dealings with sony who is known for extensive legal contracts and terms of service i have little doubt that with the development of dust 514 ps3 exclusivity and certain terms of their contract with ccp some of these requirements were laid on the table
bumped for more discussion
if it was something you could set in a configuration menu without ticking off individually every time you complete sure why not nothing wrong with the idea as long as you can change your mind later
laser buffer and ham buffer layouts are fine you will really really need those medium slots getting fewer would really gimp those setupswhats ed up is ewarcov ops legion ewar takes most of your high slots while cov ops gives ty laser bonus and no drones at all compared to any other tech 3 its ridiculousamount of mediumlow slots is hardly problem with any useful setup i know of having a lot of medium slots allows you to do beautiful things
while i understand the underlying reason behind the agent quality change i really miss the reward of seeing more and more agents open up as you work with a corp given that the change involved both access and reward quality how about reverting to the old way for access and the new one for rewards with the above setup you would still get a sense of progression for those that are interested in that at the same time you would maintain the same end state of having a larger number of high quality agents available
no
1 hell no2 maybe
what bothers me right now is that some corps agentdivision for who i was raising standings doesnt exist in high sec any more the only available choice is afk hauling stuff from 3 to 7 jumps away again and again and again and againthank you ccp for removing choice and also grats to set the only soe lvl4 agent security in osmonwait osmon is in caldari space right 7 jumps from jita right has 3 nice ice belts too please ccp make some static ded 568 some hidden belts with end ores and ice also add a couple of roid belts like 15 or 20 eh
i think the new divisions rock maybe more uniform agents but still who wants half trade and half battle missions the old system had lots of agents no sane person would want to touch because of a goofy ass mix of mission types if a person is a miner or hauler doing level fours it is pretty crazy to give them a mission that requires bs skills they might not have normally we haul things but i want you to kill some serpenties battleship fleets todaywhy cant mission diversity enthusiastics just work for a corp with diverse agent types and take missions from agents in multiple divisions
first the obviousbeing a pirate in eve or engaging in low sec warfare at all can a pain because of the obvious repercussion of having your security status dropped every time you kill someone clearly you cannot go into empire anymore after your sec has dropped below 5 thus making it difficult to survive in eve without an alt to do the logistical fun stuff for you it is an even bigger pain to regain your sec especially without contacts in an alliancecorp in null sec that would allow you to rat in peace even if you have access to a quiet ratting area it can take upwards of three weeks of nonstop system to system ratting to reach 2 to allow you to go anywhere in empire basically all these punishments for simply wanting to engage in pvp are serious restrictions that make the game much less fun to play for those who play it for the pvp interaction regardless where and now the proposalto fix this issue i do not suggest we change null sec or low sec as that would unbalance the game i propose we allow negative security status players into empire without being attacked by npcs but can be attacked by other players however if said person attacks another player first they will get concorded the mechanic would work the same way as taking out of someone elses can if they attack you you having too low of sec for that system you can attack them and only them this would allow people with negative sec to go into empire at a risk but be able to defend against a lone attacker they would have access to supplies but would have to take great caution to retrieve them fleets of neg sec people into high sec would be extremely difficult to run because they can only attack the players that attack them for instance if you and your neg sec buddies go into empire a fleet of players could just pick you off one by one thereby making it impossible to gain an advantage in empire it think this would encourage pvp everywhere in the game but mostly in low sec because players would then be able to survive being neg sec but with much greater ease than previously
great idea when i was a pirate hated couldnt go get ships and carebearing sucks so took like three months to get sec status up in 00
as a corollary to my idea i like itapprovededit meaning this is very similar and could have been appended from the idea i posted in the linked thread above i didnt mention concord in that post because i felt it was unfair and poorly concieved to have both players and concord attacking negative security status players in highsec the notion of player policing is a good one but concord still needs to exist for other reasons such as those you mentionedi think its a great idea and would like to see the game change this way new shard or not
i had this idea awhile back too npc police dominance sucks in any game let the players do as much of the enforcing as possible
you can come to high sec as you wish when i can get concord to come to low sectill then i will enjoy your pirate tears
what does concord have to do with it
suggested before but since incursions will be around for all time how about decrease the security status of the system during an incursion enabling influx of pirates sporadically throughout new edenhence empire 60 empire space becomes 50 and 50 empire space under incursion becomes 40 or whatever it doesnt have to be exact as the security rating which can be justified through the economicmil power of the sovereignty this would also be valid for 03 dropping to 0201 etc into the negatives overall all security systems will suffer under an incursion enabling influx of different pilot ratings anywhere in the cluster for a short period of time  epic
not supportedthis idea is making wrong assumptions high sec is no pure pvp area thus those who dont like to participate in pvp have to be protected from people who would target every ship if they canwhile ganking is a wanted game mechanic the security loss is as well when you had your fun at cost of others its only right that you take your time to enter high sec again  in the end the carebears have to replace their lost stuff as well and that takes time toofurthermore there no advantages to player with high sec standing why then should people with low standing be pampered
well this would enable people to endlessly suicide gank people in empire just using good sec players to transport more ships to safespot or something
working as intended htfu
pvp is a core activity in eve it needs to be facilitated but in a way that avoids grief playendless suicide ganking might become an issue but i think that might be solvable some ideaskeep concord responding to aggression as per current system however make suicide ganking an economic action that is what piracy is supposed to be about captain kid did it for loot not laughs this means no insurance for concord losses the rewards should be entirely about the prize stop concord responding to just negative securityfaction police respond to negative security but modified by the pirates standing with the sovereign factionso a pirate with good say 5 caldari standing can fly safely in all caldari systems less safely in amarr 80 of 5 and be unsafe from npc police in gallente and minmatar space true privateersthis would even give pirates a career choice privateers with defacto letters of marque via standing or true prize pirateseconomic
not supportedthere are already too much high sec grieffing pussies wardecking without reason just because they hear in 00 its a matter of numbers so they can flip a few hours get an orange skull over the head and thats it theyre piwates and they own eve also you choose to kill players and accept the ss reduction you can also kill bss rats and see your ss raise a lot faster than any lvl4 mission in high sec will ever give you just work for itgetting 4 ss is not rocket science
there is no such thing as a pure pvp area in evethe hell they do but concord would still respond to an illegal act of aggressionright but carebears dont have any real shot of getting revenge under the current system unless you really believe they will go to low sec for itif there are no advantages why should there be disadvantages remember you would be able to shoot a low security status player in hi sec of your own volition without concord intervention antipiracy would increase in popularity on a massive scale what do you mean concord wouldnt change at all with this idea or did you think concord were the npcs that hunt down outlaw players in the wrong part of townit is impossible to avoid grief play since the entire concept is relative there are miners out there who consider it griefing to mine the same roid as themsuicide ganking wont increase with the lack of security status enforcement but your idea should have been done a long time ago anywayconcord doesnt respond to mere negative security they are only triggered by acts of aggression outside of their roeit sort of works like this already except that low concord standing is universally reviled by all factions regardless of your faction standingwhat does any of that have to do with the idea fronted in this threadthe entire point of the idea well from my pov anyway is that hi sec dwellers should have a shot at antipiracy bounty hunting and random pvp without having to step into a low sec gate gank camp 100 pirates already frequent 10 space to buy things or just to show off this change would let other players have a shot at killing them
suck it up mate you and your pirate scum buddies deserve everything you got eve is all about consequences remember that doesnt just go for carebears you know you made your bed now lie in it
truth be told there is very little that stops a pirate from going all the way to amarr jita or rens for new ships or supplies whether they are 20 or 100 all it takes is a little forethought and paying attention what this idea does is stop npcs from forcing pirates to fit for escaping instead allowing other players the chance to do the pirate hunting themselveshonestly the people against this idea dont even know the current mechanics enough to make an argument nothing in this idea will make any change to concord
what you are missing is the current system doesnt protect players in highsec concord doesnt work except to shoot down gankers who have calculated losses to account for potential gains aside from that the system is useless players would prove a more effective means of controlling highsec entrance and egress though gangs of pirates may be largely uncontestedall this plan is really doing is allowing them to enter and use highsec without being contested by concord player fleets will develop to counter the pirates and much fun will be had by all this doesnt allow negative security status players to gank without being concorded or attack players in highsec until they themselves are attacked with concord functioning as usual in such events where they doit flags those negative security status layers for attack negating security penalties and concord for players who want to oppose them making for a much more effective means of countering their activities while removing the need for them to spend time ratting to avoid npcs with mechanics of this nature they will need to spend that time ratting to avoid the players if they feel like itthis flagging system also appears at 2 and would carry over into lowsec ideally so players entering low security space would have the option of legally aggressing known pirates to potentially save their own hide should they need to this essentially removes the need to give the pirate first strike in lowsec which is a handicap for aggressed players who are outnumbered and outgunnedotherwise aggression mechanics would work as usual
and let me reiterate concord will be working as intended in response to suicide ganking
so you want things to be exactly as is but without police interference have some urge to camp jita 44were you aware of the consequences prior to killing the 50100 people that 10 needs unless you pod peopledid you for some reason not get the constant warning messages that appear every time you are about to shoot another in empirefail pirate is fail
maybe you shouldnt kill those defenceless cyno frigs after alloh no you blow up someone wait some mins then transport the loot in front of the police to sell it in jite  yeah totally finepirating already has too low consequencesfail pirate is fail
not supportedif you like things player run without concord shooting you go live in areas without it low sec or null sec you dont get rock bottom sec status from shooting people in the badlands you get it from suicide ganking in highsec which is all to common enough you should be happy concord and the empires ever forgive that kind of stuff though work and effort and not be blacklisted for lifeif this is put in effect people are going to suicide gank 10 times more often in high sec no repercussions whatsoever it makes no sense to ever have fugitives walking right into proper society if concord is not going to do anything about them that would remove the who purpose of concord leet pirates can live on their own outside of concords securityand add to that even with 10 sec status you are actually allowed in highsec you can use gates you just cant fly any ships save pod or shuttle past security checkpoints without losing them cant defend yourself well tough  empire police sure as hell dont want you having fair fights with all your fancy toys
yea after the fact which dont make a dam difference if the target is blown up and all the loot gone concord police hey i see a wanted felon at the gate bringing in dangerous ship into the system let em pass and go about on to do whatever we are not going to judge him until he suicide ganks and pod kills again
hmm i wasnt aware you had to have low sec status to camp jita 44nobody is suggesting any changes to concord at allhow does a suicide ganker get to 100immaterialwhat are you smokingconcord as always will do what it does shoot people breaking the roeconcord wouldnt be protecting the pirates is this confusingsuicide ganking issues are separate issues suiciding is not piracysame as now
do you even know how mechanics work or what suicide ganking isyou get a ship with high alpha and kill enemy before concord gets in concord gets you but not before you blow up hauler full of ziongoldtech3 or other billion dollar shipgolden rocketspecial edition ship you take security drop proportional to the sec status of system for blowing up ships thats what makes gankers hesitant about doing it very liberally unless it is a one of kind target that makes grinding back up sec status worth it suicide ganking is doing any act of piracy in highsec which makes those uber security drops it is also suicide to do it in any ship with concord rapidly responding as it always does and instapoping the gank is if you have high enough alpha to get the kill before you dieif you dont believe me go try shooting people in high sec see how long you last and how your sec status goes if no changes to concord then have em keep shooting wold be leet pirates with negative set status coming in high sec trade hubs with gank ships no problem no change needed pod travel if you want to visit
and no concordempire fleet shouldnt be so stupid to let you walk into a system or out of station with a gank ship with negative sec statushey concord can you guys wait to shoot me in my arty malestorm until after i go on another killing spree again today ok d i dont want to lose it before i am doing another suicide gank got to get into position again in jita 44 with another hauler with jewgold can you guys also let me do high sec missions so i can bear in safety while being the most wanted man in 3 regions of spaceyea i am sure this new mechanic of porous borders and lazy concord officers will not be abused it will allow you to freely float in empire with that horrible sec status that you supposedly got in low or null sec you didnt get low sec status for pod killingblowing up freighters in jita 44 right that is that other person who will be magically exuded

quoting the ultimate carebear
i think ive stated in about 14 different ways that im happy with the direction eve is taking it does seem everyone else has a problem with it lots of requests for rollbacks here
sorry that was meant to be a more general statement  not directed at you per semy apologies my meaning was less than clear
appreciate that
the facts are that everyone is not made equal yes we all can get a car but some of us are not poor and can afford some luxuries for that car so here is my proposalallow us to add more calibration to a ship at the cost of some aurum the bigger the ship the more aurum needed i am thinking it should be no less than one hundred 100 calibrationthis is not some game breaking advantage like an extra module slot just a bit of wiggle room for rigs
it does allow something that would not be possible normally hence  advantage with rl cash noand lose that red text its horrible
no and no aurum for pure esetics is barely ok  anything else  no
why not this  ships should need fuel to warp  jump  let that fuel be aurum constant income for ccp  everybody happy
you can use bubbles within zero of these things why cant you use smartbombs eve is supposed to be hardcore i dont see why you cannot smartbomb within zero of stations
thats only shipdeployed bubbles you cant put anchorable objects within 2k aka anchorable bubblesas well bubbles wouldnt negatively effect a stationgate a smart bomb would probably do a little damage to the structure derp
then there should be a possiblity to search you then take all your stuff and perma kill your char in one go
not to bash any of the idea above me what i am going for is that super low hanging fruit it would only take minutes to adjust the timerswhat i am asking for is the equivalent of putting on a small spare tire on a car with a flat tire until you get the car in the shop for proper tire ccp we are tired of driving with a flat tire dramatically reduce the timers till we actually you lol get the pos to the shopyou could easily get this done for incarna with a matter of a few key strokes please we are begging you
if you want smaller corps or allainces to get part of the graph then all your realy need to do is add moon mining to wormhole space becouse of were it is it makes it much easyer for smaller numbers to hole over larger numbers
if you build anything in nullsec take sov or put up a pos it is published on the web within an hourhow the hell is having everyone with web access able to see that smallcorp010 just built a pos or claimed sov going to help then get a footing when nobody even has to visit the system to find them before forming a quick pos bash partywh space doesnt have this so small groups can build up there but sov nullsec either cough up the isk to a landlord or expect to lose anything you try  even if nobody has been to the system in the last year theyll make a special trip out just for youreally sorry  it might be nice if they could but the game just isnt designed for smaller groups to get sov  not with afk monitoring tools across that space
except that worms are not technically null and that they already have access to some of the best revenue streams in gameif you want smallfish to thrive in shark infested waters then you create an environment where agility speed and coordination has valuesolution eradicate ehp as the main mechanism with regards to sov ie what ccp presumably meant to do with dom before they got distracted by spacebarbie result allow small tight groups to make their markpermanently kills off afk empiresrewards intelligence coordination and managementmost importantly neuters the blob
only via a new mini profession explorer
i think some new 00 regions would be good for the game only can get to them via a wh only have what you bring with you no poss no stations no vendors etc you have to build stargates put up poss and build stations for you to use so exploration of the new regions would be slow going a lot fighting over what little resources that is there to build up some infrastructure i think new regions like that would entice many to head out for the fun pvp and trying to build up something new nothing is there but what you build
now we all heard that in initial stage ishikune whathisname scorpion will cost only aur and not regular scorpion as part of price csm stated that its ok since it will not affect market in large way and since it is only temporary thats understandable if it infact will be temporary please be it sohowever it may be used by 00 alliances with a lot of plexcash to spend to do this in this initial step  get tons of aur  easy part for them  get tons and tons of those scorps in some remote operation base that dont have sufficient supplies  reprocess  profitthere fore it will give them option to create minerals anywhere before ccp will activate scorpo for scorp transaction for example how long it takes to mine minerals for titan how many plexes you have to spend to get them instantly in target location probably a lot but it can happen
its very easy to balance aur purchases with potential profit in game as a result of reprocessingreselling the product of those purchases all you need to do is take into account the plexisk conversion ratio on average no consideration for the past month here which is about 350 million isk value that against the plexaur conversion ratio and price the ships in aur accordingly always make any reverse conversion of shipreprocessing to isk a minimum 30 loss
bumping good ideago go carbon ui
i support this ideal fully
very nice idea to help out and a tutorial on that portion of the ui would help them understand weapons a lot betterleave the current overview functionality put an option in to disable this effect but set the option on to help new players out older ones can turn it off and mutter about it  no big
nice idea i think i mentioned something similar in the csm threads on ui improvement anything like this to help people who deal with visual queues better than spreadsheets of raw data would be nice bring us one step closer to flying our shipsedit supportalso i think the icons should extend to all targets rather than the current one and could also include signature radius and other factors purely optional these could be detailed using currently existing tracking icons and the like while displaying the appropriate information beside the icon out of range targets should grey out the appropriate iconscome to think of it that just sounds like more clutter even if its optional clutter as the overview is tactical huds would be nice so we could switch between one of a few options we premade at will say a hud for tackling another for sniping ewar etc just a button click and the overview swaps out id love thatthere has to be a better way of doing what you suggested but its not really occuring to me right now too much data to account for which is why were all using excel spreadsheets in spaceim almost tempted to say move the icons to the overview and put the color shift there which would significantly reduce overview space requirements switch on and off as desired even that though tends to simplify things too much id still like to deal with numbers for tracking and the like i just have an issue with clutter and ease of use i also dont think it should be too easy to do this with players just going for the green that would also lead to many other factors being ignored which happens sometimes anywaysomething that should really be fixed as well is the default overview which really has 0 functionality aside from basic navigation
hell the whole vector trajectories should be an option to be toggled in the tacital overlay i have high hopes that with the carbon ui the tactical overlay gets the love it deserves to be the most excellent tool in fights

i dont think donation driven free sites should require commercial licenceshowever if you put 100 ads there and charge money or isk for services its obviously commercial service with aim for profit which should require a licence
i could agree if ccpd make ingame appstore and take some percentage from license sales would it be real cash or isk but in current form it looks ridiculousat least appstore endorses 3rd party devs to use it  it gives easier access to apps for all the eve crowd

look at the list above those who voted for people not listed there are to blame for the delay
fun is subjective not objectivejust because you dont find mining fun doesnt mean that others dont ive had corp mates that loved nothing more than unwinding from a stressful day by fleeting up cranking tunes and munching rocks while shooting the  while you could be right in suggesting that the majority of the fun for some may be derived from chilling with bros you can neither assert that this is the case fore everyone involved nor the notion that they would even be chilling with each other without the mining aspect by making macro mining a feature you would be punishing this playstyle as macro mining is by definition more efficient than doing it the oldfashioned wayin short screw you and the macro mining horse you rode in on
yeah stealing mission loot is kind of ish and is its own separate problem but it doesnt really make trading kill rights that broken i could just go loot scooping mission loot in my main goad them into shooting me and then jumping them later in a nice t2 fit hac build for ganking mission runnersand you only get kill rights on you for shooting someone and if you shoot someone there are repercussions thats life well thats evelets be honest the people who get ganked outside jita are probably hapless carebears who have never fired on anything other than npc pirates in their eve career why not let them sell their kill rights to someone who plans on taking advantage of itill be honest i havent done a lot of fighting in highsec but id assume that the phat lootz id get from blasting someone apart would make up for the cost of the contract so when browsing kill rights on contract you could look at the persons record on the battle clinic killboard if they are just getting in groups of thrashers and jumping retrievers then its probably not worth itbut if they have regular kills in one system jita rens dodixie in my timezone and they are flying a battlecruiser or something bigger id definitely be willing to pay a mil or so for the chance to camp outside a station and wait for them to get gcc assuming they are in a wardeck and dont get concorded right there or float outside the undock range then maybe i could get 5 mil or so in loot drops depending on their fit plus salvageyeah id definitely buy 20 kill rights of people who hang out in jita then hang outside the undock ganking the gankers and scooping their loot sounds more fun than rattingspeaking of that i hear they patched the way aggression effects remote repping that would really change weather or not kill rights are a feasible thing station games are annoying and id hate to not be able to take out their logi for fear of being concorded
the problem isnt the ship its the fit youve tried to bolt onto it the sins bonus is actually very good if used properly equivalent effect on agility of having 2x nanofiber fittedreally the only major problem with the sin is the same as the others  not enough jump range to realistically do the sneaky beaky stuff oh and blasters

this idea makes some sense it could be even simpler  08 to 10 is a safe zone period ie concord does not respect war decs in those systems or perhaps the defending corp in a war can ask for safe haven in one particular empire so only 08 to 10 of gallente space would be safe for examplethis would serve the same purpose as my proposal which is that playermade corps with mostly inexperienced members would have some relief from constant war decs your idea is to provide that relief by location rather than time which actually is appealing if that is done high level agents should be moved to 07 and lower systems so that players under war dec face a riskreward choice when deciding if they want to move up to better missions
yes for the love of all thingsme and my mini 7 friend corp got war dec by this hole in a navy gedon so we all fit up drakes and a black bird along with 2 neutdriantackle ships to see if we could take him with minimal loss we had him dead to rights with hull damage till a nuetral repper domi showed up to bail his sorry hide out neadless to say we lost that battle but he droped the war decplease fix this

thx but no if there will be a hybrid change it shouldnt be a copy of projectiles make them different
apart from ammo size changes i would rather prefer a nerf of proj ammo to kinexpl dmg only in order to level the playfieldanything else should rather be changed on the guns and most of all the ships to bring them back in line
i see nothing wrong with this i particularly like the volume counter idea as that would be enormously helpful for setting up these contracts thats plaenty of filters but i suppose they might be neccessary and theyre all relevent lastly i think the corp role for courier contract acceptance is great and would help immensely with making courier contracts a shared corp activitygreat idea 1
as it stands the ncc new character creator was designed for creating new characters which required us to create a portrait at the end of the process and was then shoehorned into allowing us to recustomise our chars to update our portraitshowever in cq it is the mechanism by which we change our clothesdo you retake your passport photo every time you change your makeupoutfithairstyleno so neither should our eve charsplease support for the option to be able to change your chars outfit without having to redo your char portrait
supporting my own thread 1please do remember to click the support button if you do respond favourably to this
it is realy anoying to be forced to take a new portraitphoto when you change your shoes work something out because this is unwanted and unneeded
thats a great idea
no  pointless change  would just make things worse
there should be different types of missions offered by an agent at the same time with dynamic rewards depending on how many of a given type he has assignedyou can do this kill mission for me but dont expect much payment there are 50 more people outside waiting in line to do kill missions for me however i have this courier mission nobody is interested in id pay you a nice bonus if you could do that real quick
imho i think its more important to add variety to the existing npc corps the agents belong to rather than the agents themselvesright now there is little difference between working with one corp and another offering more unique benefits for working with a specific npc corp might help right now the only ones that come to mind are station refinery tax and station location
only if players who rr the pirate player also get concordedthat would be broken
there is a difference between pirates and griefers though it may not always seem that way and sometimes the lines are a little blurry for those of you that havent figured this out yet ill point something out to youany griefer suicide ganker or pirate almost always has one weak point his killboards and battleclinic rankingsthat means that the most effective way to deter suicide ganking is actually very simple and will actually assist you in achieving rankings on battleclinic or otherwise prevent your from becoming too low fit a gun load drones use a sensor booster train signature analysis to 5 and shoot backnpc kills dont show up on most killboards or battleclinic but one shot ecm drone or other attack by a player even from their own corp alliance or fleet will post that ship kill to battleclinic and drop their rankings just make sure you wait until they have aggressed and fired on youput your sesor booster in f1 slot ecm in f2 and guns in f3 and carry on about your business when someone tries to suicide gank you align fire up the sensor booster wait for them to start firing hit f2 and f3 spam warp if you need it if your ecm jams them they may get concorded and you may loot their stuff before going on about your businesshulks can use drones to the same effect along with ecm unfortunatel no guarantees the ecm will work but its worth a shot especially if theyre flying t1 cruisers and frigs make sure you set your target back to 3cheers
confirming that sec status is not designed to produce consequences to your actions and you cant just go to null to shoot stuff also confirming that ratting is hard work and there should be an easy button that removes sec hit consequences
yes but do youand your point is which has what to do with the idea put forth i am well aware of the way sec status works you still havent made a relevant pointconcord doesnt shoot non gcc players no matter how low their security status is you can be 100 in amarr and orbit a concord police commander and it will continue playing pocket hockey with the gate as if it was a glazed donut the imperial navy armageddon on the other hand will try to kill youthe only reasons pirates dont brave high sec are few1 they dont understand how concord works2 they do understand how concord works but realize players will kill them if the npcs dont3 they just plain have no idea how high sec works beyond they jump in and dieyet they do all the time it makes no sense for anyone to be able to fly around empire space heavily armed but concord and the faction navies let it happen anywayconcord already works like thatwhat exactly do you think is going to happen jita 44 is camped by a bs pilot outlaw why do you assume the rest of the people camping jita 44 wont just shoot the dumb bastardyou dont understand the mechanics yourself maybe you should fix that
why wouldnt they or do you mean rring before the pirate has gcc in that case it should happen for all rr
quote by stupid just make sure you wait until they have aggressed and fired on youdo you understand what suicide ganking is you use high alpha and blow up target in one shot one shot one kill they use arty malstorms and megathrons with blasters you dont get to shoot back you die in one volley before the drones even leave the hanger bay if you flying a freighter their is no defense you can do suicide gankers tend to fight a ship that cant fight back and if even if it is one that can like a tech 3 ship they still go kill it in one shot using as many of them as it takes what the maybe even stupided topic maker of the thread was suggesting is after having become a infamous murderer in high sec that the person be allowed to walk right in with no repercussions free to go dock up pick up and fit a new ship then repeat it again with no long effort work or redemption npc kills dont show up on most killboards or battleclinic the hell you talking about serious noobs should not speak of things they know nothing about if players are shooting npcs who cares thats ratting sec status gets bombed from ganking and pod killing in high sec of players more then anything else im not checking no dam records and neither should concord you do too much clowning they shoot your ass no waiting for you to clown again dont like concord keeping certain people out and oppressed dont fly in high sec plenty of regions without them make your own market hubthe markets which leet pirates want access to flourish in high sec hubs because clowns like that are deterred the whole market is player driven btw save a select few things remove any deterents from swarms of assclowns and it will be all asscowns in jita 44 no need to hang out in low sec if you can have a ganking free for all in the richest of trade hubs haulers full of all the most precious loot the whole thing will decline then the only decent trade hubs are going to be in heavy controlled null to be really blunt its really stupid to expect the best of both worlds you cant have a decent market you want access too or safe level 4 agents with unregulated ass clowns butthatery of them docking up whenever they want getting new ships and then gunning down random people whenever they feel like rinse and repeat over and over with next to no repercussions then high sec basically becomes low sec where all enforcement of law is basically players on the same note its kind of stupid to be expecting the break all the rules pirate and fly freely in battleships in empire controlled space you like being a outlaw accept responsibility of it and reap the rewards of living in space with no rules freedom cuts both waysif you want travel high sec do it in a pod just be careful of 5 day heros instapoping yea blasting your precious implants to bits if you not quick enough in warping around i guess kind of makes you defenceless and unfair fight which more the likely what gives people low sec status in the first place doing to others now they get it back to themselves
you really dont have a clue a 100 pirate can fly safely from 10 to low sec in a battleship already they just cant hang around long enough for a player to attack them and most players never even consider trying
the point about suicide ganking which is the only ganking you can do in high sec if people are free to reship and suicide gank any industrial and freighter without concord or pirates shooting them on sight for having atrocious sec status they are just going to keep doing it over and over again all the time  nonstop forever because their will be no repercussions whatever current sec loss mechanics make life in high sec impossible for people who have done much or any high sec pillaging pod killing or ship blowing up taking a long grind to be able to walk freely again in high sec makes a person think twice about that kind of stuff remove that and people will not just shoot anything for profit they will do it for fun trade hubs in high sec will be blood baths that collapse because no one is wanting to going to bring freighters full of items where every butt pirate can dock up and stock up in ships and resume instapoping people with a paltry 15 min cooldown i spoke of what the current mechanics are which do make sense which the topic maker is suggesting is making npc police wait till repeate offenders on the most wanted list commit crimes and let them walk freely to commit them going in station getting another cheep fit fully insured alpha bs and doing another one shot volly before anyone can respond making a thunderdome in jitaplayer police can be done already with current mechanics in low sec and null sec go do experiments somewhere else
concord and navies one shot shoot you havent you heard of global announcements of a criminal entering system and them starting to shot youbelive me i talked with priveter alliance about killing freighters if they could be shooting people in high sec all they wanted without any long term repercussions beyond loosing the gank ship they would do it all night long with no wardecs the current system works quite fine dont break it with stupid like the topic maker suggestedyou try ganking and pod killing people in high sec all you want and see how long you can do it without long term pentaltys
you are frackin dense concord only engages when gcc is triggered having too low security status does not trigger concordperiod the npcs that hunt you down when you merely have low sec status are the faction navies and they do not instant kill you
im not sure that allowing every single person in the system to attack you with no consequence other than your retaliation could be considered pampering if you dont think its fair to have pirates in high sec then shoot them pirates attempting to acquire supplies from high sec would do so at great risk the main issue with being neg sec is the inability to get ships as you would have to train an alt to fly such ships thus taking up more training time thus costing you more money which none of us want this small game mechanic would not increase ganking someone please explain how the two even relate if i a 10 pirate want to destroy your precious hulk mining away right now i could do it for under 5 mill thus nothing would change the only thing that the introduction of this game mechanic would do is encourage pvp in the game and dial down the punishment for wanting to play the game for why it was made pvp interaction
as stated many times beforethe concord mechanics would not change regarding aggression as it stands if you do any sort of remote assistance to a flagged player you receive a global and thus get shot at by concord
this post also seems to have taken a turn for the better as suggested by other people right now if i want to take my 3 billion isk vindicator 10 jumps through high sec to get to another low sec area you cant stop me the faction police lock me web me and allow me to warp before you can get a point unless you are waiting in an interceptor which is highly unlikely this game mechanic would allow people to catch pirates in empire and the amount of pirates in empire would increase as a result of the change now a vindicator is a nice ship and not a lot can stop it but all it takes is an interceptor with a point to catch a pirate in one on a gate then you can get the whole system to come help you kill him for all the carebears and good doers in the game that think this would be pampering the pirates and neg sec players you are sorely mistaken in fact it would create an extreme inconvenience because we would no longer be able to travel through high sec worry free we would need to have a scout to get through safely however to us pirates i think the loss is worth the gain
you do understand that by aggressing first in highsec that makes you the ganker and concorded and in lowsec it means the gate guns fire on you rather than them right maybe you dontalso id like to see the maelstrom fit that can alpha a freighter
yes atm they cant hang around to keep suicide ganking indefinitely nonstop and yes carebears dont shoot them when they come across them at gates in their freighters you know why it would break the game but apparently wants it broken while pretending to be ignorant
what i dont understand is why you and the other mental midgets dont know that an outlaw is shootable by anyone without concord aggression this change would let players get their revenge how can that not be a good thing do you honestly think suicide gankers will change their mo not really they will still grind their sec back up to do it again because the entire point of suicide ganking is to not get into a fair or even losing fight the idea that suicide gankers will roam high sec as outlaws is preposterous
i think you are failing to grasp how insignificantly small this change would be you wont see outlaws hanging around empire because that would be too risky for them believe it or not most pirates are poor and cant afford to lose a ship by getting blobbed in high sec the only thing that im proposing is to have concord and faction police not shoot at outlaws when they are in system nothing else would change i hardly think it would break the game
even though i am always on the receiving end of piracy i support the proposal high sec players can currently sneak into low sec to do their business if they manage to avoid hostile players the proposal would place low sec pirate players in the same position they can come to high sec to do their business if they manage to avoid getting shot by high sec players we dont really need npc police for this
precisely my view ccp is always iterating that eve is run by the players this change would only solidify that perspective
bs pirates can do this already with alts anyway
not completely true sure i can bring supplies with a hauler alt and a few cruisers or a battlecruiser but for battleships i need to get it myself or have a freighter bring it which is risky business also if you are a pirate there is a high probability that you will lose sec on all of your characters not just your main
still feigning ignorance or are you the mental midget that you referred toeither way ill spell it out for you nobody will shoot you if concord doesnt i dont even bother warping pod after suicide gank just scoop loot asap and dock up its whats valuable sometimes i just forget about it and leaves it at gate while checking out loot in station it lasts the entire gcc and always stay alive this is on a major pipe and theres bounty youd think some passerby will bother but no everyone has somewhere to be and something to do anyone who wants to remove concord is either disingenuous or have no idea how highsec works so no for breaking the game htfu and get ratting
nope i know well what i am talking aboutif concord is shooting you who would have the chance to shoot youjust so you know your pod is protected by concord once your ship is destroyed by them i would have thought you knew that i guarantee if there was a red flashy pod sitting somewhere everyone and their cyno alt would be shooting at iti personally go after every flashy pod i can do i catch them never really because outlaws know better than to sit still in a pod in high secnobody wants to remove concord at least in this thread anyone who knows how highsec works would know that you are a fracking ignorant tool stfu and gtfo
for the love of god this thread is not about suicide ganking first of all has nothing to do with it the change as proposed would not increase nor decrease the amount of suicide ganks and ffs this thread is not about removing concord please stop commenting if you cant realize this
ah so its feigning ignorance then it is about increase suicide ganks as i will no longer have to choose between ratting up sec or end up with a useless alt nonstop ganks anyone
fail troll is fail
nothing to say heh you already know nobody is going to bother shooting you if police doesnt if you get shot anyway there wouldve been no point in suggesting it this facade is paper thin
nah im fairly sure your argument is paper thin you are suggesting that it is pointless to allow pirates in empire because no one will shoot them clearly your perspective is from a carebear point of view and your too lazy to engage in such pvp i mean i cant credit you enough to know such things when youve been in a noobie corp for more than a year this change benefits both neg sec and positive sec players equally and im sorry you fail to see that
lol leave pod at gate see how many hours it takes to get shot by some passerby in my case theres even bounty on the toon and nobody bothers i always end up podding it myself once it reaches 30 mil relatively low sp ganker spec you either already know that and is making a fool out of yourself or you are an actual fool
let us consider for just one moment that a ship is in fact different from a pod you cannot speculate on whether someone will or will not go to the trouble of shooting you if you are an outlaw in empire because there is no previous evidence with this change in mind your being rather hasty if you suggest that because no one shoots your pod in empire no one will shoot your ship maybe at first that would be the case but im certain that after a while people will be aware of the change to the point where they will go to the trouble
its unlikely they would risk shooting a ship that can fight back if they wont even pop an afk pod and collect the easy bounty while at it
i understand thats and educated assumption but you still have no way of knowing that would turn out to be the case half the point of this change would be to encourage pvp so it could in fact prove to increase pvp actions in empire
then well have to keep wondering because ccps not going to let this disruptive change to ever see the light of day
i said concord and police in the ambiguous terms referring to npcs that shoot you people be shooting you up and make it difficult to reship in more gank ships if you get gankedthat on top of this
oh bull the robberserial killer comes back to the bank while on eves most wanted list this time he is making a honest deposit and transaction please let him in and dont shot emyea i am sure that only honest pirates will use it they will enter high sec and behave when they say they will why not give a text option with empire navies that they convo you and you have to say you will behave this time or they resume shooting youman it up and get a alt if you too soft to handle the consequences of piracy never do it eve is a harsh universe and it runs both ways
i can kill anyone in empire i want right nowsuicide ganking would noooooooooooooooooot change ffs this dumb idea is about allowing outlaws to retrieve supplies from high sec stations without the use of alts i never said we had a problem traveling through high sec and btw a suicide ganker is not a pirate just because i shoot everything thats on my overview doesnt mean i cant fight a fair battle also it is impossible to get a cruiser or bigger ship out of a high sec station without an insta undock
well see
responding to suicide ganks is not the problem which will stay the same the problem is the ease of fitting and bringing in characters who have done it and in the ships to suicide gank along with removing just about any repercussions of doing it or any heinous act hey concord and navys are going to wait until after i commit another crime ok that is fine cheap suicide fit again i will have a extra alt in a fast locking frig pop the pod after i blow the ship my stuff gets blown dock in station fully insure and then repeat in another cheep shipnow stupid changes to outlaws not being shot for walking in highsec have all sorts of repercussions for for any crime being done in highsec suicide ganking included which is pretty much the only ganking one can do with concord responding so yea it has allot to do with ganking in highsec you cant let in one outlaw freely without harassment without letting them all in the leet pirate who is poor with only a few ships who does fair fights got rock bottom security status with the high sec suicide ganker who can afford hundreds of disposable cheaply fitted ships
get supplies in other words ships with guns with full insurance sit right on the undock of a station in the cheepest fit possible with no tank waiting until the perfect target comes then shooting themoutlaws cant hang around gates and stations with current system new one they canif you can shoot people all yea want in current system then do it i see you either hesitating for facing consequences of your actions
reaching 10 sec status should result in char delete btw
you clearly dont know much about the game other than suicide ganking well not even much about thatwhat pod is that an outlaws pod just for your information an outlaw is 50 and below any other pod unless kr or war is involved is a suicide gankyet when there is a clear distinction about which ones do what you cant be ambiguous which in this case made you utterly wrongi know full well how security status works but thanks for the info anywaywhy would anyone have to wait to shoot an outlaw they are already free game for anyone the problem is taking advantage of an outlaws vulnerability is nigh impossible from a pvp standpoint granted it helps in low sec but that is a marginal advantagenobody said it should be otherwise we just want players to be the police as much as possibleit would add more excitement to eves empire pvp dynamic honestly it sounds like you would like the idea
i really dont follow how emptying jita of traders and players from wormhole spaces is a good thing heck why is a fresh start a good thing is it so that you will have a whole bunch of noobs starting up an economy all over again so that you can race to be the first with a raven battleship againhow is this good sounds like the have nots are just wanting a chance to be a havesthe world doesnt work that way sorryand jump starting a whole economy that has taken 9 years to get almost completely self sufficient with npc seeding all over again isnt what i would call progress by any standard
youre right of course forget i ever brought it up i realize the rebuilding of an entire economy would take some time and effort no need to seed it with npcs im sure as everyone pretty much knows how to use blueprints already some needed drops from combat sites would be neccessary of course and they would have to make a few changes to starter ships so they have a little more functionality in the game all part of the deal of course the hardest thing would be getting past the first mining barge construction after that i suspect things would go much smoother sure would be a neat ride though
on the note of forcing players into pvp its the reason i play eveive been a wow player for over 4 years and the reason i keep coming back to eve is because there is actual danger in this game you never know whats beyond the next jump gate or whether or not the random pilot that just showed up is going to try to kill you or help youwhile blizzard and subsequently other developers keeps nerfing world pvp in order to make it fair ccp is one of the few out there that understands true pvp nothing is unfair if you dont want to pvp stay in highsec risk vs reward is the name of the game in lowsec and nullsec
derp
i have a better idea why dont ccp give you free kms
why should ccp hold his hand for him he can fake his own kms if he is so desperate for them it isnt that hard to fake a km
dont make gates own system
still be a regular stargate not a corp  alliance one where they can set who uses it or not but that one still has to be built to get to the next system
i think you missed a point which is ability to spawn ships anywhere with that you need scorpions or tons of resources in some remote drone region puff you have enough minerals to build a fleet of carriers and a huuuge credit card bill pas for long term solution what you say is absurd eve is manufacturers world if you can buy ships without someone building them in a first place you are screwing with eve economy i just hope they will do as promised and introduce ship  aur  painted ship approach
do try to keep up
make the aur ships not reprocessableit will create a good isk sink too
thx havent seen that 
uh uh uh 1 scorpian  some aur  new skin scorpion  aka the new primary in pvpyour and all arguments for the current mt are null and void until a game changer is introduced such as buying modules bpos or ships directly from ccpso far other then plex nothing announced will impact eve in such a way that one can have a significant advantage by paying rl cash for the gamei mean makeing a bait scorpian will now be possible  that thing would be a juicy killmail but its not like warping in with 10 of them in a capship fight will autowin
i would have liked a longer subject field i assume this has been brought up before but its very difficult to find anything in the forums i do a lot of exploration and missions and i would like to see exploration expanded in a similar way to the incarna walking in stations i would like to be able to explore and find various items in the various structures encountered in the sites and missions not just shoot the structures to loot a cargo container it would provide an opportunity to make the content that already exists in concept more interesting in addition to functional items varying rarity decorative items for if we get permanent homes not just temporary quarters rented out by the station could be an option might be problematic implementing viewing of these items by other players im just not sure how this exploration could be implemented without significant risk to pilot and possibly unmanned ship given how dangerous eve is to pilots in ships any ideas or forum threads requesting the same functionality
actualy suported mostly because i hate that my tangu flys backwords from what it looks like it should
no btw would be cool to fake my ms to an ibis for enemies  they would get a nasty suprise on agressiond
how about a graphic like how your modules cycle and the white bit circles around the module reloading be a red bar that goes in reverse that way you can see how much longer reloading is going to take hybrid buff how about hybrids reload like a shotgun it still takes the same 10 seconds to fully reload but it goes 1 at a time so if im only half empty on the reload its 5 seconds additionally you get the option to start firing again at any time
ill rather prefer a no loot option on ganked ships in high sec if pirates cant access loots they will gank no more in empire piracy should be more effective in low sec however
i think this idea about mining module has merit i quit mining because i found id rather read or quick mish than spend every 2min checking cycle how much in roid til i switch roid a mining module that gave x yield or x cycle time would be fine id even train a super long skill that only reduced the negative impacts by 5 per lvl but the fitting of it would have to still allow use of cargohold expander modsrigs or the mod is pointless and itd have to be able to fit on a t1 barge as well w out losing cargo space if im not cheating then a module to help me mine hurts noone especially since lasers shut off if i let cargohold fill up anyway someone mentioned ppl use the macro tools to unload from miners to orcai dont know how to stop that but theres no reason not to focus on ways to help make the experience for those who play fair more enjoyable ccp wants isk sinks fine make it a 10 bil bpo someone will make them or make it only a 5run bpc inventable from 1k mining drones and some mod bpc that has super long copy time for a full run and takes mercoxit to manu ppl are still using 7 accounts w macro tools if theyre not and are able to cycle 7 toons scanclick roidsunload to orcawarpunload orcawarp backcycle and set hulk follow distances again while orca slowly crawls to right spotand cycle thru them all every few minutes and do it for 423hrs then they deserve the isk and paid visit for wrist surgery but its more likely theyre goin off to work sleep or wally world and able to stuff jita w 100s of billions of units of trit over multiple orders a little deflation of min prices wont hurt especially if new population keeps a steady rise then the risefall of prices will be normal as ppl go inout of mining profession
first off nosecond bots have existed since 2003 release year yesthird if it would be legalized i would surely leave and i have been using this toon since 2003im sure many other long time players would do the same
hey guys any update of progress with those minutes
i appreciate the concerns about transparency its a bit of a difficult problem because a lot of the discussions we have with ccp relate to giving them feedback on stuff much of which is nda but we are very active on the topics of the day such as the sparklescorpion for aur the api developer monetization devblog etc i would say internal forum activity is up a bit compared to csm5 but not hugely as was the case with csm5 vs csm4the current status of the minutesdelivered trebor 7 mittens 5 vile rat 2 two step 2 elise randolph 3assigned but not delivered diagoras 1 intro session noncontroversial almost completedyet to be doneccp comments  csm reactionfinal editing style conformation  my jobfinal draft reviewi am pushing for a release date of monday june 27 but a big question is whether the people at ccp have the time to devote to their pass on it given the impending release of incarna
i think i see there point now though lets say you comment on a large issue sparkle scorpian you shuold make a sticky in this forum section explaing your stance on the subject also make a sticky linking all podcasts and blogs youve made so by having a easy place for eve players to find all of youre blogspodcosts they can keep up to date with whats going on and by making public statements as its own thread and not just as a post inside another thread people will be able to see oh our csm thinks this about this subject good to knowlike for instance the archived fireside chat should up ina sticky of archived csm announcements then with the new forums we can rss feed subscribe to the announcements sticky and always be up to date when the csm has a collective opinion on a major issue
there is literally no advantage for the csm representatives to do anything that you guys want them to dothey already won their election they no longer need you appeasing you has no reward and failing to do so has no penaltywhen it comes time for elections again the csm bloc candidates will be elected as always and as always there is nothing the disgruntled people on the official forums can do about ithave a nice fathers day

i am flying redeemer and widowdont know much about the other two blackops but i assume they are compareablea bit more fuel space would be fine but working with cloaked hauler buddies pretty much makes this a lot less of an issuepeople have been asking for adding a covert cloak to the blackops and as a blackop pilot i have to disagree a covert ops cloak would boost the blackops way too high it allready is a good ship for its purposealot of people seem to be complaining about buffer dps output or both to those i can only say learn to fit a proper setup blackops can 1on1 most regular fit battleshipsthen there is the ing about the jump range  guys remember that the blackops is no capital ship and can use regular gates aswell the jump drive helps in its role as a suprise weapon but it shouldnt be its primary means of moving arroundi believe that most of the blackops need a changeboost comes from a crowd that in itself has not found a way how to use the blackops yet  the same people that fit cargo extenders on it and use it for a simple bridge blackops ships as they are are good they just need to be used in the right role

thats a good point and interesting scenario here are my thoughtsdo periodic searches on darth vader in theory running a search on the old name will bring up his new name set darth vader to red and when he changes his name youll be surprised to find a strange name in your standings hell still be red and not an immediate security lapse but youll need to notice which leads me tosomeone once mentioned the idea to have an automatic mass mailing wherein everyone either linked to or linked by the character think character to character standings block list etc would receive a notification in the event of a name changebut if youre serious about being an escaping reputation activist look at the existing ingame feature of character transfers which provides no records escapes reputation and no ingame rational destroys immersion im just using ideas and arguments mentioned in this and other name change threads  which i can see are becoming more confusing and cumbersome as the op ceases to amend hisher opening post  should i just open a new thread consolidating these points or would it just be excess clutter

i would hate to see the hangar view lost forever i believe ccp is making a very very big mistake
far as i heard youll get a fixed ironically also called stationary image of a hangar when you choose not to load cq no more spinning in station boys and girls 
no brainer supported
1 to optional cq button to decant old hangar view remaining
yes please if the test server is any indication the current implementation of captains quarters is just useless fluff
this tbhyou should dock normally as you do now into the hangar view you see now and then have a second button to exit pod and go into your cqdoesnt sound unreasonable and gets round two issues1 the foolishness of getting out of your ship every single time you dock oh i need to get out of my ship now cos i left hangar without my repair paste and had to go back for it sorry that is daft2 people who do not want to or cant run the cq or are running multiple clients are free not to unpod
this why teh hell do i need to get out of my ship to unload it what a stupid idea
what a great marketing slogan for eve why dont they just put that on the box play our way or gtfo
i think their slogan is actually welcome to eve online heres a rubix cube go  yourself
so what do you think the response would be if you went into a game like wow and suggest implementing the ability to war dec another guild on any server
wow also has its contingent of elite players who despise anyone they view as having inferior skills they would think its a great idea the other 90 of players would hate it though
inferiority complex much christ all i was pointing out is the community in those games would probably have an issue with peeps trying to change the game play
something that would make wardecs a bit more sensible is a 1 week cooldown for new war decs against same corp after one ends no constant wardecks ytali convention provision or whateveralso have the war dec cost scale like the author suggested police officers looking other way demand more to cover the flack they getting as gang war and ganking goes on longer

how is this even close to being the same your solution to the fact that i will lose the ability to instantly uniquely identify a person with a method where i can only identify a category of person how many reds do you have marked in your contacts not enough to grasp how broken your solution is not doubt and what elephant in the room character transfer has a big legitimate use moving from an alt of one account to the main of a new account because i want to play both at the same time now in fact the reason that toon transfer is allowed is even more reason to never allow name changes i like the fact that i can tell a toon that was bought from a farm by the silly names they have the stickiness of names is one of the reasons ccp allowed toon transfers
i dont see a problem with allowing characters names to be changed not sure that harsh conditions need to be applied  it could simply be listed as another entry on the employment history tab perhaps even highlighted to make it stand out for recruiters limiting the number of changes eg once per lifetime or the frequency of changes should prevent excessive misuse by griefers
i dont see the issue with a name change people are always defending the under handed side of eve by claiming its sandbox or it meta gaming so why put a penalty in place for a name changeif we all truely believe that anything goes in eve how hard would it be to believe that someone paid for a new clean identitywould it make it more difficult for counter intel sure but hey its eve anything goes as apparent with the latest tourney
i support the tuskers idea heres whyright now id say navy faction and t2 frigs are about the same level whereas pirate faction have an advantage such as dramdaredevil over both of these classes if you bump all faction up to make t1 frigs relevant again you pretty much might as well stop flying them except for ganking people who arent in caracals if the lowest sized plex your faction frig can get into is for cruisers you still have the same issue as before with navy faction still being allowed with just 1 plex size if you allow navy and not pirate on the cruiser level all you will see is sfi instead of cynabals and on the frigate level you will just see people still flying faction frigs so the point of trying to give newer players a chance is moot i support the tuskers idea of making one t1 frigs edit dessies are in a bit of a rough spot newer players could very well afford and skill them just as easily as a t1 frig so the first size could see dessies only then t2all factiondessies and below for two sizes of plexes a similar model could be applied to the medium plexes t1 only and then t2faction and below and well for majors i would leave them as they are since there really is already a similar system in place gatedungated majors i believe cruisers are being looked at this winter as far as rebalancing goes so maybe you will see more than just caracals stabbers ruppies and blackbirds for strictly t1 plexes

make that 5 see problem solved
then you kill them i mean ffs dont be such a h about it so an outlaw is sitting outside the undock waiting for the perfect target apparently according to you all you can do is cry about it and wait for them to go away such a carebear perspective i can see how you would assume that suicide ganks would increase because outlaws can get into high sec and then wait patiently for a good enough riskreward situation but most suicide ganks that allow you to profit can only be done in trade hubs which usually have tons of people sitting outside therefore it would be almost impossible to for an outlaw to wait for the perfect target cause everyone would be shooting him
oh ok so i should have my character deleted because i want to play the game for why it was made such a carebear
youre right i dont see how suicide ganking would be any easier under your proposal if anything an outlaw ganker would be at a disadvantage because hes shaded bright red on overview  as soon as a potential target sees that hes going to be more cautious also an outlaw wont last 30 seconds hovering outside the undock at a trade hub as you saidthats my opinion as a carebear
it is good to see someone gets it
pirate ships fitted with weapons should be blasted on sight by concordfaction in 5 low sec is just factional standing rules
i think one way to discourage suicide ganking would be to make it so if you shoot someone in empire without provocation ie they arent flagged to you then you cant enter the system without being shot by faction police for like 2472 hours or somewhere around there this would make sure outlaws and suicide gankers are given a harsh but temporary punishment
even easier  contract your goods to an alt and have the alt assign you a courier mission your cargo is now in sealed containers so suicide gankers have no idea if its worth ganking
thisfaction navys are lol tankable they shouldnt even exist for what they do has dmg or confiscate drugsand yes any players with 10 ss can perfectly fly any ship from 10 to low its a matter of knowing how witch i dont but already followed one friend doing it frequentlythis is an issue since high sec names so lol already and another reason to remember low sec players that shooting other players ships in empire has consequences those consequences are easily erased since not killing the rat bss escort makes them pop faster change system pop another rat and miracle your ss raises really fast a lot faster and every fuUFFFDkng pirate knows thatplus the same pirates crying about ss are the same yelling at ccp to bring lvl4 missions to low sec while theyre not even capable of run some lvl5 for their standing and ssget out silly kids go play another game where you can dl hacks and bots and all you have to do is hit i win buttonheuminmatar doesnt count right so this thread is a complete troll no
well thats the problem right there isnt it you tried to make highsec into your personal pvp zone got slammed down by navy and negative sec status once too many times and now you want for the negative consequences to be taken away from youwhy heres the deal highsec wasnt meant for unbridled pvp sure its allowed but at a cost you lose security status you chose to ignore that consequence until it finally caught up with you and now youre trying to weasel your way out of it nobody in their right mind should grand you your wishes though if you didnt like the negative consequences you should have thought of that before its what you tell the guy who got ganked in his freigher carrying 3bil worth of stuff and now youre on the receiving end of the mantra suck it up dudeend of storyoh and pirate tears are the best really  keep em rolling im thoroughly enjoying this
sighyoure not helping this bs about soothing your righteous ire over pirates by having them limited to lowsec and preventing people from engaging them in highsec is actually counterproductive try to imagine what would happen if players could engage pirates suicide gankers and the like in highsec what that would mean for the game how that would balance the way people are affected by pvp etcfor you nothing would change because you would never engage them for pirates they would get a good fight in highsec once in awhile or even more often and they would have the ability to fly into even 10 systems uncontested by npc mechanics for players who wish to fight back against the pirates they would have highsec as a direct counter to lowsec space and they could engage pirates with some measure of tactical advantage as opposed to having to engage always with no tactical advantage giving that instead to the pirates they would also be exempt from security status loss and eventual piratehood for engaging in such activitesall antipirates become indistinguishable from pirates under the current system you cant tell them apart to look at them and fact is after awhile there really is no difference as they eventually all engage in the same activities if people think youre a pirate treat you like one then whats the point in being other than one
so your telling me that if a freighter jumped into you in low sec you wouldnt attempt to kill it come on now dont be ignorant
really have you had to rat your sec up from 10 to 19 before i think not its not as easy as running back and up a ratting pipe killing a bs in every system i spent almost 3 weeks in a vagabond running through one of the best ratting pipes in game to rat my sec up and this was doing it for 4 hours a day more on the weekends it takes a ton of effort to regain sec once youve lost it and a carebear like yourself would have absolutely no idea what it takes so stop pretending we can fly a ship through a 10 system but we cant undock from the station with a bought ship which is the goal here you clearly have no idea how this mechanic works so stfu about it and the faction police might be tankable in your 3bill missioning ship but not a pvp ship
see choice and consequences working as intended btw rat in sb not vagaboundregardless of the amount of rage and whine ccp will not break their game by removing intentional and working concord mechanics i would like cookies which is coming soon
oh i know its hard guess what its supposed to be hard you know the old saying if you cant do the time dont do the crime simple as that and its not like you got banned from highsec after merely 1 offence nope it took you many many repeated offences  in what you believed to be lulzsec at the time pardon the pun  to finally reach the point of no return oh wait you actually can return  you just going to have to grind for it that is working as intended for you at its finestps still lovin the pirate tears btw 
dear god how did it take you 3 weeks to fix your sec a highs fitted  cyno cloak neut probe launcher 2x dual 180sb only killed frigates you know to not scare the spawns offc died 9 times a night every night to the same gatecampd spent the first 60 hours of the 85 you claimed it took you shooting a veldspar ratand yes it is as easy as running up and down a pipe killing a bs in every system
you wanted to be a pirate you reap the consequences not supportedin fact i say we allow any player to attack any other player with any kind of pirate standing at all not just the ones with the worst standing that the npcs attack anyway piracy should not be easy
so now that i know what the carebears opinions aregoose99 there is no better ship for ratting up sec than a vaga its fast tons of dps tanks the rats with ease
so what is the consequences of being a hisec carebear leach this will end well nor should leaching isk in hisec
you get ganked in your freighter or other shiny ship and concord to add insult to injury picks up the tab for the ships lost by the pirates how is that for leaching
sounds like acceptable game play to me
that statement makes no sense nobody pirates in hi sec space unless you count wars or somethingeverything done in high sec is pvp at some pointwell pvping in high sec never leads to loss of concord standingspeaking for myself that isnt the case but i cant speak for anyone elsewhich negative consequences are you referring towell any freighter traveling through low sec unescorted deserves to be attackedjust so you know for the nth time concord already ignores outlaws in high secand your point is still invalid anyway since concord didnt exist originally in eve anywherenot even the crying pirates are asking to be released from the consequences of low concord standingwhy you dont think the victims should have another way to get their revenge is a little beyond me tbh i mean who wouldnt show up to an outlaw gank in high sec even other outlaws would jump in on iti smell more carebear tears actually which even sweeter because they dont even understand what is being put forwardof courseas long as they have a correspondingly high sec status why not antipirate players should be getting nice standings boosts for their work and this would be a buff to thempiracy isnt but piracy is dead for the most part
so waithigh sec is for care bears they live there doing fluffy stuff getting positive sec statuslownull is for pirates they live there doing pewpew stuff getting negative sec statussometimes pirates make the mistake of getting too low of sec status in which case theyre officially stamped outlaws at which point everyone is free to shoot them player and npc alike because they are evil bad guysand youre upset that you cant play in care bear land while still being a bad guy in your free time
gosh i think i might have to start pointing out each individual fallacy in all of your arguments against this this thread is not about why pirates are bad and why they deserve to have a less fun game experience than everybody else this is about balancing the field for all players its not a whine fest as to why i cant go into high sec i really dont care too much tbh i have alts that get me what i need and other than that i have no desire to go to high sec its just one small thing that would enhance the playing experience for everyone imo valdore makes an excellent point carebears and high sec players really have no way of getting revenge from pirates other than to go to low sec and god help you if you do that  this would even the field for everyone and add some much needed excitement to the game imo
agreei think it would be fun if someone had real human players that they can attack in hs without concord getting involvedone thing i think i would add to your suggestionlets say you have the low sec and come to high sec and i shoot at youonly you should be able to shoot back  not your corp matesi like the idea make it so ccp
i definitely agree not allowing corp mates to aggress would discourage outlaw fleets in high sec supporting my own thread finally p
tldr supercarriers have ruined 00 warfare there is no paper rock scissors to a fleet of nyxs whoever shows up in the most nyxs winsit used to be that before fighter bombers came out in january 2010 whoever had the better fleet composition with battleshipshacslogiscommand ships would win the fight with better tactics unless it was a lag fest but 400 vs 400 man lag fests werent the gross majority of battles so what did that really matter hello all long time lurker but decided that something needs to be said its probably been said quite often but this really needs attention i used to live in the now dead northern coalition here comes the haters lets not get side tracked with all the rmt throw outs and bull but lets address the real problem the last time i actually had fun fighting in sov defendingtaking fights was back when it and atlas were pushing the nc fleets consisted of dreadsbattleshipsahacs and the now dead except for bridging fleets titan i knew nc lost the last big war when i saw 50 nyxs show up to reinforce stationsihubs in 23 minutes i ended up moving all my ships out around that time and still fleeted up hoping for something other then a nyx stand down the response to this sort of fleet is well you can always show up in 50 nyxs but that isnt really an option for almost all players if you wanted 00 to be accessible to small alliances and create conflict you certainly went the wrong way to do so this makes it so small alliances cant even compete unless they get a whole bunch of super carriers sov defensetaking is now relegated to whoever fields the most super carriers wins thats the bottom line there is no more our scouts say they have 40 abaddons with 5 guardians so well show up in ahacs  its now 20 nyxs cant do i just want to see an alliance of 20 mill sp players in battleships able to actually have a decent chance at holding some space with tactical skillabout the poster i didnt want to post my main to avoid alliance drama i hate that  ive been playing eve since 2008 religiously and started in 2006 but part time training character in high sec while playing wow im ashamed of that i like playing eve since its not catering to the pussies i started played mmos in 1997 with ultima online used to run around napa valley server murdering people and taking their things so naturally eve is a game i like i fell in love with 00 due to how the rules of eve work but now i cant stand it due to the sov mechanics logging on to ctas where you cant even fight the guys isnt fun at all
agreed furthermore the ccps supercarrier fetish feeds right into the botters wheelhouse 16 bil isk isnt generally available to the pvper who rats to replace his zealot its the uber alliances with great tracts of insulated space that are able to create a generally bot safe environmenteve has essentially degraded to supercarriers online if you fly anything smaller than a nyx youre just a cyno 
if you cant beat the enemy head on you use your brain and exploit any mistake made by them if they split up bridge on one of the groups kill it and get out before the rest can get there if they dont bomb them or try to separate them with smart use of drag bubblesor if you prefer watch for the hostiles making a mistake with aa few supers and kill it while the rest are bubbledout of capdont have a cyno to get to the tackled super withlast time in venal we didnt have the backup we do now and still managed to win quite often despite being outnumbered in both supers and actual pilots the problem though is that its pretty risk free to deploy a supercap fleet if messing up and getting tackled in a fight youre loosing meant that every super you couldnt clear tackle from would actually die youd have to put actual thought into it to decide if its worth the risk and there would be way more of them dying
the whole idea of this whine is that you need to have supers to kill supers those who dont wont be able to kill supers and thus wont have them
while i agree this is how you slowly dwindle your opponent down but it does not work unless you dont hold sov you being part of pl which doesnt really hold space you can argue that point quite validly i used to love fighting you guys you would show up with 60 guys and take on 150 due to sheer tactics and well disciplined pilots this is something i always wished i was apart of yet when you guys started fielding 50 supercarriers with 60 t3s due to a couple hundred billion pay outs it was a no contest fight infact no one even showed up to fight you from that point on supercarriers are the new battleshipdreadcarrier all rolled into one and its destroying the game destroying itso in closing pl is still having fun
why cant my arazu scram as nearly as far you would think 10 less range like web2 vs scram2 as a rapier webs falcon ecm  instant jam on frigsarazu 20 rangelevel for scrams baseline scram  9 km  18 km l5curse 40 rangelevel for neuts baseline neut  126 km for medium neuts 38km l5 rapier 60 rangelevel for webs baseline web  10 km  40km l5 proposal increase arazu warp scram bonus to be on same order as rapier web bonus or at least as far as curse nuets
ecm needs to be removed from the game or an effective counter measure needs to be created you can say eccms are a counter measure but they are not a falcon will still perma jam you even with 70 sensor strength the fact is every other ewar mod in the game does not totally shut you down for instance sensor damps screw up your targeting range and resolution however you can still target up close and it just may take a bit longer to lock something tracking disruptors suck but if you know how to fly your ship right you can counter their effect fairly easily and drones are still usable ecm on the other hand is not the same drones will only attack if they are out before you get jammed and nothing else has aggressed you almost everything on a ship offensive wise needs a target lock to be effective and some defensive mods like nos need a target lock as well ecm totally shuts out your ships ability to function and it is essentially a death certificate when a falcon lands on the field eccm either needs to be boosted to the point where a falons jam chance is less than 10 on racials when you have an eccm fitted or it needs to be completely removed from the game
there are already effective countermeasures to falcons  eccm remote sensor damps neuts or simply bringing your own ecm
falcons are fine the second the lose lock on a single target they are dead end of they are edly papper thin an alpha from a frig could take those things out
no they are not only in ats where eveyone brings equal fleetsever flown a falcon u declaok and u are insat primairy not ideal ships to bring u end up warping off more or dieing more than jamming at is not representice for fleet fights stop crying start trying and than u see what i mean
many of us explorers and have old really old bookmarks that just arent relevant anymore because they point to old wormholes or complexes that despawned 5 months ago i propose to simply allow an optional expiration period for bookmarks in the bookmark creation window allow us to put in how many days the bookmarks remains 1 days is good enough for most wormhole a few days might be good enough for other exploration stuff then during downtime cleanup all old bookmarks if keeping track of bookmarks in real time costs a huge performance hit the days can be approximate so if you bookmarked something 5 hours before downtime for 1 day it would still be there until downtime the next day so 1 day  5 hours this is so the server isnt continuously keeping track of everything and can do mass deletions during downtime maintenance while still keeping everyones bookmarks clean and fresh d
so long as its an optional expiration turned off by default  otherwise its going to inconvenience pilots who use bms for safespots tactical spots etc
of course added to main topicalso supporting my own idea
imo implementing this change is gambling wwwaaaaaayyyyyy too much to fix a minor inconvenience i have several thousand bookmarks for gates and stations all over nullsec it would take several hours to copy them let alone the time i took to make them i dont want to risk them expiring or ccp deleting them so you can save 5 minutes a month deleting the bookmarks you no longer want if it takes you longer than this then you need to learn to organize your bookmarks better use a naming convention and learn to sort by name region date etc i just dont see why we should bother with an expiration on our bms the time your saving is sooo small that the aggregate time saved by this would be dwarfed by the lost time if only one person like me loses their bookmark collection the only time i want one of my bookmarks deleted is when im actively choosing the bms to delete ps changing bookmarks so they can be group copied in a timely fashion would be of much greater benefit for this game

i suspect the jita market node would explode if these sorts of things were designed alot better then i suspect they are this wouldnt be a problem however market improvements and a lessening of the regional limitations can only be a good thing imo ive always thought it a bit embarrassing just how many features of eve such as prices in other regions are only accessible from outside it
im going to dissagree on the grounds that this allows the newer future industrialists and marketeers find areas with low market activity and sell there goods for a much higher price to those lazy sods that cant be assed to go a few systems over to check market prices or even ask there friends in other regions so they can get there stuff

you seem to think youre entitled to a gewd fight at the end of the dayhowever this is eve you are entitled to nothing in this game and that includes the alliance tournament
competethe mere existence of your favorite game is not powerful enough to alter the definition of a word
making the assumption that everyone reading this knows what your gnashing your teeth over is your first mistake
do not derail also  the counterpoint to your own statement would be that you believe a collective understanding of a topic is a perquisite to being relevant essentially going against logic and 2000 years of philosophy you can disagree as i am sure some will but no derailing please
not supported you cant make rules about throwing fights people will just make it less obviousif ccp wants to punish hydraoutbreak they should hold a lottery 1 ticket per account awarding 1000 500 each of the alliance tournament ix prize hulls or 1run bpcs that would also be within the rules and would discourage this sort of behavior in the futureim not saying they should do this the whole thing was lamestupid but not that big a deal imo but ymmv
throwing fights isnt uncommon and is completely allowedwelcome to eve get over it

because in the old days when supercaps were overpowered and could not be tackled people would sit on a station undock in a titan with a rack of officer smartbombs in a bubble guess what happened to everyone who undockedthese days of course we dont need to worry about such broken ships
i demand the right to smart bomb jita
i would support smart bombs on whs theyre just a cosmic event in spacehowever setting them off within reach of the station or gates is asking for trouble like drawing aggro from the owners kind of troubleso i guess if youre willing to get shot at by the local navy because you wanted to bomb the undock that might be funny to watch
thisi wasnt talking about restricting anything if you feel like convincing a bs scale mwd onto your interceptor go for itall im saying is when you search the market for a small beam laser for your frigate what comes up is medium beam laser iand when you see something linked in a contract for instance you dont have the market categories staring you in the face telling you what scale its typically meant forso again not talking about restricting anything just talking about making a medium beam laser and a medium armor repairer both cruiser scale
i support this idea
no point to bring this back this was only free intel for pirates and for those who complain about this because u wanna know what standing got your corp members i would say if u cant trust them so is no pont to act like police maybe u shouldnt stand in same corp not nice to spy your corp members

more worthless systems that will just sit there completely empty since the changes to anomalies and other mechanics mean they arent even worth holding anymoreim all for expanding the eve universe but perhaps ccp need to decide what to do with the hundreds of systems that are now effectively pointless before they add more content that is only going to serve to fill out the number of jumps people have to take to get anywhere

i googled it upwhat the  guys you got serious problemsbut yes for nude exotic dancers without s of course
but what are they actually doing  theyve made no meaningful communication with the wider player base shockingly less than we are accustomed to from even ccpall the recent initiatives to make ccp rethink stuff has been grass roots on the forums by rank and file players api micro transaction etcso aside from what theyve been saying secretly in their alliance channels which mainly seems to be bragging about how good the lobsters and night clubs arewhat are they good for
the csm6 members are enforcing a new concept on how to execute their council of stellar management and doing so it can be said that their ways are in all fairness controversialbut they have the right to do sowe cant judge on their work and efforts yet and until then its just to sit and waitextreme csm2
csm6s internal communication methods are more organized than any iteration of the csm before it postsummit the csm is always kneedeep in minutework sorting filing and checking the summit minutes and prepping them for release to the public given the number of things we covered and the depth at which we covered them the minutes are taking a little longer than expected so were sorry about that the csm are not impossible to reach hell if you mail me ingame ill respond to you if anyone mails me ingame ill respond to them a lot of people are standing around going why isnt the csm communicating with us and were standing here going hey hey were right here hello can you hear us helloi dont know what you mean by this ok well i dont know of any instances where weve basically sat in our secret alliance channels and patted eachother on the back about how we wined and dined on ccps dollar but im not going to sit here and tell you that iceland wasnt cool i know a lot of people on this board seem to literally hate fun but im going to be a rebel and strike out against nonfunhavers and have fun whenever possible so this is a good questionweve done spotlights and fireside chats this lets the players listen to us in a semiformal setting and we take questionsweve propped up time dilation which is now going to become a feature in the gameweve gotten a dedicated ship balancer ccp tallest assigned to the game something eve has never had despite what you might have heard the first summit of csm6 was extremely productive
still shouldnt take 2 months to get notes out though should it
theres a lot of notes and both the csm and ccp have been busy the production of the summit minutes is not just a csm task ccp also has to review and sign off on the minutes dont worry we should have them out soon were more or less done with the drafts and ccp is checking them now
srsly you certainly dont want all the players to send you evemails asking the same questions over and over agin do youyou guys were elected to represent us you are the one with information now so i really hope the minutes will be released really soon  and that theyll be worth waiting
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck this idea you want to legalize macro mining you know they make people in chinese prisons do most of this i will not be privy to this idea if only on those grounds alone
actually the chinese use prisoners because the bots keep getting caught by ccp if macro mining was legal then china could just run a bunch of bots thus giving the prisoners enough free time to go frolic in nature brilliant
well after the ndacensorshehmmndafilter was applied on the minutesscripts nothing interessting was left to be published
with the exception of one session being done by ccp diagoras all first drafts have been completed and sent to ccp for review we have not received any response as of yet though this may be due to them being a wee bit busy with incarna
curious how long did it take from the last day of meetings in iceland till the csm sent their version of the notes to ccp i am looking forward to see the notes
and an update to the update ccp did their first nda pass now we need to go back and forth on editing for style plus we still need that last session but ccp xhagen is going to write those up shortly the notes will probably be out next week since ccp will be busy with incarna deployment this week
its nice to be kept up to date on your progress as im really looking forward to reading the finished report
well there are delegates like me who dont really have a bloc vote who do have a vested interest in sucking up
its working
this shows what a waste this csm is you can not represent the players views on issues that the players have never even heard ofwhy dont you spend the time talking about issues the players do know about and have given their views on not only would you be actually representing players views but we could actually hear from you because it wouldnt all be blocked by nda
this just about sums it all up
delete pleasesorry
i approve of this necromancy quality rage thread that looks even better now that the goons have dastardly stolen the csm
i was the one that mentioned that in the event of a name changer every person who has that character on their contact list should receive a evemail stating that so and so character has changed their name to such and such also for all of you that cry about name changes saying that you can escape a bad rep and yada yada open your eyes and realize people can just buy totally new characters and sell their bad rep characters at no loss of isk if your smart and you would never know this happens all the time with name changes they will still have that good or bad rep and all would know about italso with ccp trying to turn eve into a modern wow with walking on station  other things that will follow giving characters a actual identity it is only fitting that we get the chance to change our names to something we like rather than a name that really meant nothing back when a name was really just an idccp is all about micro transactions with plex and now that new store for your characters and lets not forget character transfers so not to allow something like this is just silly ccp says characters are our identityreputation and yet we can just trade that and thats ok but we cant change our names logic just went bye bye
i totally agree yes i have an 08 cos some one beat me to the name but i still like it dude if your going to come up with a name like that childsupport stuff you picked it dude either live with that rep or get a new toon
once again your logic is flawed if your character has an identity and your not allowed to change your identity says ccp then why can we just trade that identity to anyone and not have to keep your reputation people infiltrate corps and alliances this way but your saying thats ok cuz its just a trade and no one knew it was a traded character but we cant have name changes cuz everyone would know about it riiight
so everyone whose name begins with the letter a or z will change their namesits a pain being top of the list and first primary in combat change a name but the new name must start with the first letter of the old name
i support this also i just want to change my bloodline atleast i am willing to pay with money isk or plex but i do not want to pay with another five years to train a new me

strongly supported just give us the hangar and add a new button next to undock  make it unpod and upon clicking it loads cqi really dont get why my pilot would see the need to leave his pod and get dressed everytime he docks just to reship or loadunload cargo all rp aside the hangar view is the most practical for your typical everyday spaceship action needs and there is no good reason to remove it
rightclick  leave podright next to the leave ship itemits not that hard for s sake
1 to the option i dont want to have to  around with 30 second load times when i want to switch a ship out quicklywhy this is being forced i dont know because its certainly a downgrade on what we have currently
sadly youve made 2 errors1 the disable option is not disable its have a nice brown wall paper it should have been disable bring back old hanger for which the models still exist2 resource hog making my pc use more juice while afk in station than the most intense fleet fight is bad my alt sped much of its time afk in station increasing my power bill by a factor of 45 is just not viable for me  for laptops its simply not possible this complete oversight will cost you subs before plex increase is factored in3 who likes brown wall paper i mean of all the colours a designer could choose brown
supported keep wis optional and bring back spinning in hanger
game play changes all the time in eve and every other mmo like the recent change to give bpcs a different icon than bpos  nobody was against that community reaction depends on how each player is affected the proposed change here is that war decs against the same target corp get more and more expensive as time goes on if youre a high sec piracy corp all it means is you find a different target one that has not been at war as long if youre a high sec industrial corp it means you get a break from war every once in a while why oppose that
this proposal does remove certain aspects of the sandbox elements to this gameto the original poster id recommend you revisit your original proposal after all this would ultimately negatively affect a certain portion of players in eve namely roleplayerstake pie inc for example one of the oldest pod pilot corporations in eve still existence today they are hardline armarrians by nature and are obviously at odds with the republic and the federation they also are in perpetual service to the empire and prior to their establishing of cva they constantly had ongoing wardecs against pirate organizations within empire space whether they rped or not how can an rp organization and many others like 1pg kotmc dia core clrgy gns uk em eg kg the list goes on legitimately operate wars which are in character for them against hostile entities who may not necessarily entertain a mutual declaration until this is taken into consider i would recommend leaving things are they are in the sandbox unless you can think of a creative way to accomodate corporate freedom in war declarations
this is a genuine reason to rethink my proposal that i had not previously considered i dont have a good answer at the moment but will certainly give it some thoughtedit on further thought the unwilling targets of rp wars are really no different than any other unwilling target it may be in character for a corp such as pie to desire endless war against their rp enemies but that doesnt mean concord would necessarily sanction it
good if everyone cant have easy infinite isk no one should
a catergory provides you with the information you need immediately to get to safety and further identify them how about a scenario to help clarifyoh hey hes red he must not want to prance in a field and hold hands ill go dock up and then concern myself with who he is as opposed to i know this guy i know this guy i know this  omfg im being shot at because im reading everyones uniquely identifiable name how many names do you have then not enough to blah blah blah i can also say name changing has a big legitimate use too that would be an assumption although someone already suggested a harsh solution to that along the lines of name changes should not transfer in the event of a character transfer reverting to the first name andor no character having been transferred will ever be allowed a name change personally i dont like itwhat is that name sticking to the reputaion of a completely different person a nefarious person buys a skilledup lamb of a character and wreaks havoc meta game immersion shattering no regulation no paper trail no preservation of consequence or reputation

nice idea
this or tsubutais idea in post 4 would be a major improvements to plexing pvp or maybe the gates to the fw plexes for a concordsanctioned war have special restrictions allowing no pirate hulls granted thats an immersion solution to a gameplay issue which would result in pirates flying less pirate hulls thus breaking immersion anything to break up pirate frigs dominating minor plexes is fine by me but i do think navy frigates who arent that overpowered versus destroyers would be interesting
this idea as updated to just exclude the pirate faction and tuskers idea would both be an improvement

bump for post patch visibility
first off for those who run missions with others its not pointless in any way shape or formsecond unless you can elaborate on how it would make things worse your objection is mere negativity and objection for its own sake to only be contrary making it just as pointless as you believe this proposed change to be
1 dont see why not
wait stop the press proteus could use a change or pretty much all gellente ships for that matter so its more effective in missions and not just good for pvp as it is now its just for pvp legion is fine the way it iswait never mind buff the legion in fact i support this change and should be done as soon as possible  cant wait for all the crys to get the legion changed back xd after it gets super nerfed
10
come to amarr youll see plenty of people flying legions but usually only by necessity pie inc one of new edens oldest pod pilot created corporations flys amarr only hulls beautiful sight when organizations like them take to the heavens in a golden fleet however the fact that some people actually do fly legions is moot because even those of us who fly legions on a regular basis would agree and support this i for one do
looks like it didnt go through from the patch notesedit nevermind wrong ship
it is wrong for a ship to sit cloaked and probe down other ships there needs to be a balance for this my solution is that no ship that has launched combat probes can cloak up until those probes are completly recovered this way pvpers cant just probe someone out with no risk of losing a ship its bad enough that its extremely easy to probe someone out also combat probes should be targetable so that you can shoot them
1 you should be looking for combat probes in your dscan instead of raging 2 take a covert ops to a safespot and point it towards another ss while running your ab and 34 racial eccm mods even with the new patch its going to be nigh on unprobable more so if you use some sig radius implants
1 no 2 so what at least the bastard is uncloaked and i have a very small chance of probing him downi want to be able to target and attack his probes if i come across them too
reduce seige and triage timer to 60 seconds and reduce strong used by a factor of 10dreads and carriers have long been bumped from the top of the food chain where their past supremacy required the ten minute timer to balance them now that a hot drop of only 5 supper carriers can kill a well fitted carrier in about 30 seconds there really is no reason to keep the old 10 minute timersa lot has changed since there imposition
while i agree that a 10m siege cycle is out of place in the current scheme of things i think 60 seconds is too short theres almost no drawback to siege then remember it takes a hotdrop 30s to load grid 5 minutes is a reasonable siege cycle
faire enough but the last hot drop i was in saw a well fitted carrier pop within about 45 to 50 secs from the time the cyno was lit it did not take the supers 30 secs to load grid i would say drop the timer to 60 secs but max 120 secs there realy is no need for such a long timer or any timer at all dreads and carriers are much weeker than they were when they first came out
simply put the tengu offensive  magnetic infusion basin or the socalled railgun tengu sub is a complete joke not only because its main weapon system is underpowered and obsolete but also because it does not even have the right bonuses to make it semifunctionalbefore going further i would like to note that most useful offensive subsystem have bonuses that are worth at least four regular ship bonuses5 damage 10 range 75 tracking 5 rof etc fitting bonuses or augmentations that worth as much as ship bonuses such as a full compliment of light drones for example accelerated ejection bay 5 kinetic damage1 10 range1 75 rof2 40 cpu liquid crystal magnifier 10 laser turret damage2 10 range1 10 laser turret capacitor1 projectile scoping array 75 projectile turret rof2 10 falloff1 full compliment of light drones1 turret concurrence registry 10 projectile turret damage2 10 range1 75 tracking1 hybrid propulsion armature 10 hybrid turret damage2 10 falloff1 full compliment of medium drones1 and so forththen lets have a quick run down of the bonuses of the subsystem 5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level 1 20 bonus to medium hybrid turret optimal range per level 2 365 base powergrid  450 base capacitor 1as you can see the fitting bonus for the magnetic infusion basin is assigned as a ship bonus thus reducing the number of actual ship bonuses by one although it may look as if its balanced out it is not because the fitting bonuses simply fill the hole of the deliberately crippled engineering subsystems augmented capacitor reservoir power core multiplier that are the only thing preventing the missile tengu from being even more overpowered than it currently is therefore the fitting bonus must not occupy a ship bonus and another ship bonus must be in place to get this subsystem back in linetherefore i propose to increase the bonus of the magnetic infusion basin as the following 10 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level 2 20 bonus to medium hybrid turret optimal range per level 2 475 base power  450 base capacitor taken for grantedat least the changes will allow the rail tengu to fit 6 250mm turrets mwd and one lse with nearly maxed out skills and increase the dps with that setup from 210 to 250 with spike not much but a step in the right directionthere are other subsystems that are similarly lacking the full number of bonuses or simply underpowered but it will take another thread to explain the reasons and justifications for changes so ill cut it shorttldr buff magnetic infusion basin increase damage to 10 and base power bonus to 475 ccp has to work on t3 ship balance
i have two things to sayto prevent the highsec ganking we should permajam the pirates this will prevent hulks mission ships etc from being ganked if you want to buy ships i have no problem with that be my guest however the second the pirate gets agressed by someone else the jam goes away and the pirate can defend themselves carebears are safe pirates can buy shipsthe next thing to make things fair to both sides have logi assisting someone in one of these fights be considered agression that way there will be no other logi ships assiting the pirates or the pirate hunters riskfree
considering that i do not know much about how difficult it would be to implement such a mechanic i have a feeling that perma jamming only outlaws and no one else would be quite the task also people cant rep outlaws already you receive gcc and get concorded
i think there are some minor details that would need to be worked out eg preventing outlaws from basing out of high sec to make repeated suicide ganking attempts difficult but the overall effect would be increased pvpsupported
i support this it would still be very risky as a pirate to go into high sec if this were to happen but at least it would give us the option to move around a bit more freely even going a few jumps through highsec to get to another lowsec area is currently a pain in anything bigger than a cruiser this way pirates have a bit more options to move around and those carebears and antipirates out there get the option of blobbing lonely reds passing through highsec in big ships whats not to like
supportedand to any ultrabears wanting to jump up and explain how this is a bad idea please only do so after completely understanding both how the system works now and the proposed changes my iq can only take so many hits per day and ive read this entire thread
not all bears think alike my carebear self thinks the idea is great  kos pirates flying around high sec who i can shoot but who cant shoot me except as a suicide gank best of all  the more of them in high sec the fewer in low camping the gates i want to jump through
you make a choice that has consequences you assume themyou need 30months to get your ss back its your problem you should think about consequences before actyou want to buy ships in high sec when you have 10ss deal with people of pick an altworking has intended and has no valuable reason to be changedmoar tears please my cup is empty
no you wrecked your sec status live with it this is part of being a pirate now go be a pirate not a carebear
i dont think most outlaws want to get away from the consequences of being one sure it can be annoying to get chased by faction navies everytime you enter a 05 system but it isnt much of a consequenceor lose it to another player with this changehow would faction navies not hunting down players with low concord standing make them carebearsdoes it really make sense to be 79 with minmatar republic and yet still be hunted down by minmatar high commanders just because your concord standing is 50 no not really
just to clarify aggression mechanics would not change for players if you aggress me an outlaw in high sec then i can retaliate but me and only me not my corp
yup thats how it works it still gives the high sec player an advantage in high sec since he can decide whether to start a fight or not the low sec player cant start a fight since hell get concorded thats plenty of disadvantage for an outlaw in low sec even without npc police which is why i find your proposal fair
long range minmatar projectiles artillery received a massive boost in alpha but no corresponding decrease in dps this along with the fact that projectiles use no cap and have selectable damage have made railguns obsolete since nearly every other stat is on par with rails example 720mm artillery has 29 times the alpha of 250mm railguns but only 1 less dps what since their alpha is so much greater than any other long range turret artillery dps should be correspondingly nerfed these should be one shot weapons systems designed to rip through active tanks they should not perform equally well at grinding through large buffer tanks
i too support nerfing other random things down to the crappiness of railguns the worst weapons in the game
artillery would still maintain their role of pure alpha machines
facepalm
you are an idiot and there will be a fix for hybrids coming up in the future i believe not sure when
um you have destroyed your own argument by stating that 720mm artillery does 29 times the alpha of 250mm railguns but only 1 less dps thats balanced mate as dps is nearly the same but alpha is the difference between the pairby the way love the fact your whining about the minnie boost that only just makes their dps fractionally above railguns that means for yonks their dps was less than yours the issue is not with railguns if dps is marginal the real issue is that now that scrams shut down mwds blaster boats die in a fire before they can reach their target that is what happened time and again in real pvp and the alliance jokeument
very minor 1 less dps does not compare to a massive factor of 29 increase in alpha
first and last bump if nobody else wants this thats cool
i dont know what i think about this its an interesting idea but its still a little to much coding for not much gain people will still play the 01 isk war so they can sell all their stuff first besides i think your suggestion would create a situation where the major suppliers of materials could form an opec of sorts and i dont think that would be beneficial to the game
this is pure greediness skirt for 1 plex  34usd disgusting
they belong in belts not on gates very annoying if your camping waiting with roam on gate whatever
no they serve a good purpose
theyre there to scare trolls awai
you could try shooting them until they explode it would give you something to do while waiting for your next pvp capable opponent helpless victim
or add video blog that tells exacly the same on this way stuff doesnt get mis interpertated and its moar fun to hear about shiny stuff being added to the game than to read it
pretty simplemake incarna something you active through hanger view like another station service this way those of you who want it can have it and those of us that would actually like a functional interface can have that tootldrcq optional hanger view available
why not reduce the amount of supercaptials per system excample each side could only have 10 per system if you wanted to have more in your home sustem the the ihub would have a mod that would allow you to have 5 per level should make things more intersting side not this change would not inculde carriers dreads only supercaptials
ive thought about a system like that for years about the system cap for lag the problem is you can exploit that for example if you wanted to turn the tide in your favorif you had 5 friendly supers allowed and 5 allowed for neutralsetc an alliance could just park 5 neutral supers in their system to block the system out for the attackers this is not a solution
not only that but if you can as he said increase your teams max by doing x or y then that just means that once an alliance holds sov they wont lose it because they will always have more superslots then the attacker so it still comes down to whoever can field the most supers and in this case it would always be the defender unless they just went broke or were attacked as soon as they caught sov but itb would still leave many systems uncapturable making 00 an even more broken system
cyno jammers
the ops argument makes sense though ive never fought supercarriers myself of course supportedmy naive first thought is could a fleet of dreads take out a supercarrier its a big slow thing so a perfect target for big slow guns maybe even in siege mode surely theres a reason this isnt workable  can anyone shed some lightedit its an issue not a proposal
yes they can in fact subcaps have accomplished it before at issue is to kill one a fleet that doesnt have supers has to be fitted and have the fleet composition for killing them it is like paper rock scissors bomb where the only thing that can kill the bomb is complex and requires the psychic ability or meta gaming to expect the bomb
interesting alternatively is there any way to neutralize the fighterbombers so that the supercarriers effect on the battle is mitigated if there is no such ship or if the current options for neutralizing fighterbombers are too elaborate maybe a specialized antifighterbomber ship would balance the scs
1 or 2 supers are easy to kill with a mixed fleet of even subcaps the problem comes when there are like 50 scs on the field unless you can field more there is no way to winanother problem is when you do field a superior force of supers hostiles field 50 you bring 75 the hostiles can just log off and only loose 5 or 6 by the time they disappear saving the majority of their force to try again instead of either fighting their way out or dieinga couple of suggestions i believe might help would be 1 if any ship is tackled in a bubble or warp scrammed the only way for it to disappear is either for it to be destroyed or tackle is lost 2 pos warp disruption batteries and warp scrambling batteries should be able to hold any ship including titans and supercarriersthese changes wouldnt fix supers but would go a long way in making alliances think about dropping insane size fleets if they arent 90 safe it would also not completely fix random hotdrops on idiots but would make some think twice about dropping in on a cyno pos
fighters have 20k ehps and fbs have 30k ehp they are the size of cruisers orbit well outside smartbomb range dont take much bomb damage and go several hundred ms they cant be scrammed and be nearly insta recalled when they take damage additionally by removing 1 fb in a sc you can fit 200 ogre iis with 5 scs on the field each fielding 20 drones and having a drone bay able to hold 4050 fighters they easily have 3 million ehp in fbs 2m ehp in fighters and 3m ehp in ogre iis by removing a second fighter bomber you can add 200 hammerheads and 200 warrior 2s per sc they essentially have unlimited drones to throw at targets declawing a sc is rarely an option in the current environment note its not the fbs that really make the supercarrier so dominating its the combination of invulnerable to ewar 30m ehp lots of highs for rr no siege timers nearhighest dps in game and most versatile dps in game they can field the right drones for the job this last point insures that they can pretty much kill any ship thats a threat very quickly the only thing that can stand their firepower is other supers
they dont do  show up when most of their time zone is offline and put that thing offline in 20 mins it needs 2 reinforce timers to be effective at all  he completely understands the problem
not an option unless they have maybe 23 nyxs when you get into the 10 range then its not even worth it 1 nyx will eat 35 dreads solo
ok sorry just had a better idear so simple should have posted last night cpatial smartbombs that can take out the peskey fighter bombers fitted to dreads given them a new rool on the battle field
perhaps an ewar capital ship something strong enough to jam other capitals including sc and which also disrupts its drone control functions  maybe a reduction in drone bandwidth
the problem goes beyond simple supercarriers the current system in general rewards blobs more than anything elsetheres no need to really develop tactics beyond quantityive always thought that designing ships for a fleet enviroment would be beneficialadding active defenses to the mix for instance it would require a fair amount of work youd want todrastically increase the range of missiles and the ranges of projectile and hybrid weaponsdrastically reduce the range of energy weaponscreate a new layer of active defense slots these would include counter missiles for taking out missiles and point defense emplacements that could be set to intercept and degrade incoming fire from turrets or missiles or could be set to attack drones in range but only one lasers would be immune but thats why theyd need the range reductioncreate new classes of ships dedicated escort ships that have larger numbers of active defense slots and could fit a high slot module that would allow them to use their active defenses to protect nearby friendly vesselsnew settings for drones space superiority will hunt down and destroy all hostile drones on their own and alter the defend setting so that they will act as little mobile point defense unitscapitol level command ships for leading fleets a new warfare links one that would improve the effectiveness of active defenses one that would allow all ships in a squadron to defend each other with their active defenses if in rangeit creates a situation where you need to develop formations and coordination to use but it would give you a significant advantage over those that fight willynilly
ironic seeing you are one of the alliances that are massive sc blobbersbut to the op i totally agree eve is a mess now i remember the good old days in tri when all we did was nice roaming gangs with 50 bs but now even in low sec its become about whose got a super then ppl wont even fight its rather sad eve has become like thisi mean even titans are no good nowperhaps make titans be sc killers rather than just capital killersscs should cost the same as a titan now and titans should cost triple the price now but then your stopping average jowe having onei dont know the solution but eves pretty fecked now
this is a great idea should make your own topic for more indepth discussion and balancing of the idea
please forward to ccp that they eighter need to get their updates worked out better so they can update tq within the time they specifyor they should announce longer extended dt from the start this will stop all the people like me complaining and getting fed up with waiting
let me explain this to you in the easiest way i knowits ccphope that little explination helps
soon
danger zone
sentry drones pick up speed and start moving towards their target at up to 1 ms this should not happen
from downtime to downtime they could potentially move over 80km very imbalanced clearly matters very important yesedit for that matter i imagine micromovement is possibly the method they use to align sentry drones to the the target theyre firing on rather then send a orientation tranform type command in any case it scarcely matters
in my short time playing eve ive come across all kinds of players who have all kinds of feelings about pvp some are disgusted by how much of a funhouse it can be for the well experienced pirates vs noobs some hate the way it caters to genuinely cruel people who love nothing more than to ruin the fun of new players some of them are those players some of them rationalize the current freedom of war and pvp as a game mechanic that they want to explore for years there have been proposals about changing the mechanics of war adding conditions and many other thingsbut this idea is different and very basicwar disparity mechanics  a system by which the expense of declaring war in eve would be scaled based on the disparity between the combined skillpoints of the two involved corporationsskillpoint total of corp a  skillpoint total of corp b  price of war in isk if the total is less than 0 then the cost of war is freethis price would be shown to the wardecing party with an option to pay of course as a means of deterrent for bully corps to harass new players this would encourage more enjoyable conduct among all corps and help players not interested in pvp to feel that the system in place is less biased toward bullies because now they have to pay for the difference both corps should be shown the war price this would make war less about steamrolling and more about sportsmanlike play of the competitive part of eve
note  yes this will make some war completely unaffordable and some of the most gigantic alliances in the game will find it out of the question to declare war on a small corp as a whole which might be an irrational disparity i think for my idea to work an option would need to be added for an allied corp to declare war independently from their alliance
i think i can summarize the general response to this in a single overused phrasewow is that way 
i dont say this often but the above statement suggests to me that you arent quite fit for eve sportsmanship and competitive are not terms you can simply throw around here metagaming subterfugesabotage and bribery make very certain of thathell what happened in the alliance tournament ix recently shows that both terms hold little weight in this gamei must add though that it is possible but you have to make it possible with others and be willing to enforce the spirit of those terms red vs blue is one good example of this somewhat
additionally using the raw skill point totals of the two corporations is not a great ideafor example corp a a hardened merc corp with only a few members who have spent all their time training for pvp declares war on corp b a bunch of industry bears who have more more total skill points due to their higher number of memberslets assume that corp a has 5 members with an average skill point value of 20 million lets also assume that corp b has 30 members with an average skill point total of 10 millionthis means that the cost of the wardec ab  100 million  300 million  200 million would be 0under your formula corp a could simply farm corp b for kills indefinitely and with no war dec fee as long as they kept the total sp less than the industry corp they were attackingfar from decreasing the amount of bullying as you put it i expect it would actually go up since now the cost to wardec a more or less helpless but large corporation would be even less than it is now if not freeto counter this industrialists and miners would eithera move back to npc corps or b move to tiny corporations with only one or two membersor alternatively incidents of corp hopping to evade the wardecs would risewhile its true that the current wardec mechanics arent great your proposed fixes would make some of the least desirable aspects of the mechanic even more prevalent
i agree with the goal but not the specific proposal total skillpoints dont measure war disparity very well since targeted newbie corps tend to have 1 lots of people and 2 lots of skill points in mining industry etcmaybe something like  a corp cant be war deced in the first 90 days of its existence yes there would be some who recreate their corp and shuffle members to evade war but players can do this to avoid war even now
interesting idea but not practical a small corpalliance can be a real pita for a large alliance that the alliance should have every right in the world to dec them without having to pay billions for the war a war mechanic change seems reasonable as its pretty much dirt cheap to do it now an escalating cost sounds like the best option ive heard
so what if i create a 1 man corp and war dec you i have 10 million sp and combined your corp has 100 million you have a lot of people so this war is free and once its active i invite 20 friends to join my corp
you got the formula wrong if corp as skill point total is 20 million and corp bs total is 10 then20000000  10000000  10000000isk to wardecim not saying my idea would make it impossible for s to keep being s im just saying it would cost and it would influence corporations to be more practically structured piling 100s of noobs into a corp wouldnt work out well the safest and most successful corps in pvp would be come the ones who were more well rounded and actually prepared
actually the numbers i stated were averages per member as it says in my post not totals go back and reread my post carefully and youll see what i meant
ah ok  well my proposal isnt really intended to deter wars from being waged among highly experienced players be they all combat or all indy trained this is to keep that same small corp of 10 pvpers from steamrolling on the newer players who are just trying to enjoy missioning and corp mechanics without harassment
so what is stopping corps currently recruiting to be more practically structured now
well intended but the proposal would fail to achieve what it sets out todecing corps already quite often are much smaller than the victim bear corp anyway because it gives them more targets and many bears are harmless even when in numbers mostly for lack of organization and bigger wardecer corps could just split into two or more to cut down decing costs by your logic decing could even pay out if the total skillpoints of the victim corp is larger than of the attackerfinally looking back getting deced was one of the best things that happened to my first empire bear corp it made the corp get organized and focus on beating the agressors which we did eventually and quite successfullycompetitive and metagaming are not mutually exclusive you just have to accept that if you dont metagame you are handicapping yourself
it was suggested in my original thread on this idea that i put this in the assembly hall 
problem with dumb fire is that you will see many of these ships fielded to counter even a small subcap fleet and with all those missiles being tracked by the sytem for vectors and whatnot would put a great deal of stress on it though if they could only be shot from like 10km or so that might help
first the idea behind eve gate is awesome though due to it being a pain in the arse to get to it kinda fails my idea is this integrate it into the client when you get a status update from someone on your contacts list or corp it pops up at the topbottom of the screen for a moment then vanishes on that same thread have the ability to post updates from within the client both features should obviously be toggleable so as to avoid forcing unwanted features on those that dont want to use the feature
basically a very simple thing allow to leave the char customization wo taking a new photo by a simple saveexit buttonreasons1 i found it annoying and time consuming to pose the char again if you just want to change pants to a skirt or something like this to test how it looks in the qc also i am quite comfortable with the look on the picture for my chars however some looks kind of strange in qcmight be the lightning so i would like to change the cloth to something that suits the environment in qc better without changing the picture again2 the picture of a char has quite some value to recognize the char again not any kind of cloth hairstyle look good out of any position so the appearance of chars can change a lot with the new options you just added and makes it harder to recognize them when they want to play a bit around with the options and change her appearance often3 it is optional if you found something that you like and that you want to show on your picture you can do it if you just want to try something out and keep your photo like it is there is also a option for this
hybrid users rejoice the buff is comingrejoice
omgso they head us i just wonder about the when how far down the list is hybrids i wonder will it get done the year oh i hope i just started training minnie on my main because i didnt want to wait any longer is there hope dont i have to drop gallente please dev say i dont have to drop gallente training
its actually a decent idea and probably well balanced minmatar could still neut the cap hungry gallente hull to death and youd see more webs on minmatar hulls to help them keep at 10 km outside most blaster range whatever ccp loves minmatar so gallente is screwed
that is impossible the best jam strength you can get is somewhere in the midteens which is enough to permajam a cruiser or perhaps a bc eccm doubles your sensor strength making it far less likely to work the check for jam is jam strength divided by sensor strength so for every active jammer you would check at 14 racials on a dedicated and rigged ecm boat  70 using your number so exactly a 20 chance to jam for every 20 second cyclehardly permajammed you probably fly a hurricane with no eccm base sensor strength of 16 and tried to solo said falcon which was likely sporting at least one minmatar racial jammer in that case 1416 you could very well get permajammed
falcons jam from waaaay beyond warp scrambledisrupt range all u have to do is warp outsounds like a good defensive strategy to meif u actually died 1vs1 to a falcon id love to see the lolmail

all frig class npcs to get web and scramthis means tripple bs chained spawns in belts get at least a couple of scrammingwebing frigs included in the spawnall anomolies get couple of frigs with scram and web per spawnim only proposing for a couple of such basic scramwebbing frigs per spawnwave this change would not solve botting but it might reduce it by just a bit
i would like to see the number of scramweb frigates boosted but i dont think it needs to be all frigs especially in lowsechisec i think that under most circumstances most higher bounty 1m bs spawns in belts should have more scramweb frigs and anomalies can definitely utilize more
how is it a gamble you think a server mix up will happen the chances of that happening are about the same chance of the server deleting youre most prized ship by accident its not a feasible case scenariois it a gamble because of user mistake expiration would be off by default if you change it its your own fault just like if you forgot to turn on your hardeners in a mission and lost your ship this would be a great thing for people who live in wormholes or otherwise explore

the market regionality is actually one of those things that makes eve feel big if anything they need to be separated more
 thistopic not supported the different regions allow for interregion trading to be profitable
im gonna have to disagree with this as well on the grounds of game and realworld implications game implications mean that there are whole occupational fields set up because of this mechanic from traders to couriers huge sellers markets like verge vendor derelik devoid and genesis exist because of this discrepancy and likewise buyers markets like sinq liaison and the forgelet me ask you how many rubles or yen does a big mac cost its the same idea  people dont know the prices of items on other markets or else have to do research to find those pricessorry not supported
its a feature thats in such high demand there are 3rd party applications and websites for checking markets in other regions arbitrary counterintuitive restrictions will always run into trouble its the same as people making bms when there were no warp to zero on gate or people using travel macros atm because ap dont warp to zero its in high demand its a reasonable and intuitive function its going to happen one way or another
seeing orders in other regions maybe but rather notunifying all regional markets absolutely not reasons were already posted it would basically kill most of the traders or at least make their life much more difficult by increasing competition that used to be distributed over regions increase 001 isk games eliminate the characteristics of regional markets killing diversity and trading activities
i think this will not kill regional markets because nobody will make 40 jumps to buy his ammo or other stuff there are hotspots in the universe where the missionrunners are lvl 4 agents where fw is etc and this is where the traders should sell thier goodsthe only reason for partial crazy margins is that the non traders only want to get thier goods and not spending hours to find good offersa traders job is to transport goods where they are needed or to organize the transport and the sell them therein real world the markets come to the peoplein eve people come to marketseditthis is how markets work if someone in emolgranlan want to buy ammo for the double price why not serve the order some players do 10 jumps to safe 3isk and others donta universe wide market will present the buysellorders in real time not like evecentral and a trader can serve them or not maybe with much better marginswhat the eve market is like amazon and amazon provide me all sellorders they havei dont need to travel to america to see the sell orders that were made therein eve i need to
i think this would be a lovely tweak and as a trader i have to say that this wouldnt affect my trading in any negative way whatsoever if anything it would be beneficial those items that are profitable but hard to come by would suddenly be sitting in my hangar much more often
marvelous idea training level v is the ban of my eve existence
thisentitlements for vets drives noobs away the current specialization skills are already op as is since they allow cheap t2 guns to outdps vastly more expensive faction guns t2 guns do not need even more unbalancing when you unbalance stuff that are cheap it creates problems as everyone and their mother go for it everyone will train lvl5 specialization for this insane bonus curve theres a reason ccp dont use  anywhere and use only flat values in formulasin that case remove specialization skills problem solved

competemetagaming is a valid mechanic and therefore hydra competed beautifullybut thats obviously a metalevel too high for some i guess the same crowd would also support bans for jita scammers then griefersalso since its illegal to fix matches in rl sports they cant possibly be arranged right

always thought it was a good ideawhy not hope some agree ali
bpos research is more productive the bpc is one time use mechanics so any time invested is wasted when its done you can still research for tech ii of course but that is best achieved with copies of an unresearched bpo me and pe make no difference here with no effect on the end result a tech i bpc is basically just a photocopy and tech ii bpcs are photocopies with writing in the margins and scrawled diagrams and material lists to assist with the creation of the tech ii item why any of that is necessary after the hundredth time is anyones guess
you said it yourself mars you cant have everyone in the same place and happy with two shards there will be a breif lull in the complaints before they start back up again
quite possibly but at least it would take a couple years seriously though the changes to aggression mechanics and allowances for highsec to directly counter lowsec and open up a more versatile form of pvp might help things many pirates are pirates because they want to pvp without being in blobs in null or being subject to the big alliances station games are dull for the most part and that leaves lowsec and wardecs for the most partof course there are groups like rvb but that is limited to those two corporations and those like them so really the options are limited and when you get in with a group of hardcore gankers with fcs cursing and shouting all the time plus ship losses and isk from kills as a limited resource it becomes more viable to gank the helpless than actually take risks yet somehow corps like rvb seem to do it and that may have to do with that they collect the loot and salvage for recycling honestly think high vs low would work well in many respects open up opportunities for rp for some players and generally create a more dynamic and healthy pvp systemcurrently theres lots of problems and not much fix
ccp dont listen to the nc  exnc csm anyway if you look at their future planned changes you will see that they are opposite to mittanis grand vision in fact the second the nc  exnc csm got power ccp changed 00 that directly affected themit was kind of ccps way of slapping mittani across the faceit is like winning miss usa you may have a crown on your head but dont think it means anything you will still be the girl who thought europe was a country
please elaborate im sure you have references to support your hypothesis also what future planned changes are opposite to mittanis grand vision
please please please can we have a transcript from these i cant listen to these and am currently excluded because of itbeing discriminated against in game because i cant use team speak is one thing and i can live with that but also by our official representatives to ccp is a bit muchive asked for them in the thread from the first fireside and ive been ignored
dear lord youre dumb what are they supposed to do when ccp asks for their opinion on topics which theyre not allowed to talk about in publictalk about it in public and breach the ndarefuse to give counsel at alldiscuss it with ccp and represent the player base as good as they can for the good of the gameyou decide no wait you dont decide  which is good because you have no idea what youre talking about
or maybe they could make sure they set aside some time for the concerns voiced by the players which they supposedly represent

noccp should heed peoples righteous outcry the pricing of aurum items displays quite frankly contempt for your player base u obviuosly sat down and thought what is the maximum we can get out off our players if not was 1000 fielded for 12 pair of glasses will the fish tank cost the same as a small bungalow in iceland pixelated cloneable clothing should not cost more than its real life equivalent period quite frankly im disgusted by this play i can oly hope it was a accountant that suggested these prices cause it certaily was not a gamer
no 
no no et re no 
no not ever

no
cosmetic onlyi dont mind having cosmetic things to look more awesome when in a station just the pricing at the moment is insane a monocle that does nothing costs more than a dreadnaught somethign is wrong thenredcuing the prices by a factor of 1050100 would make it far more appealing to buy stuff
after watching cq and the aurum and overall a lot of wasted dev time id liek to bring this back up
incarna makes this the most hilarious thread on the forum except that monocle ganking one
both of you must be thinking of character transfersas described here name changing will not allow you to evade your reputation reading comprehensionif you lived with everything as is in eve youd be back playing the castor expansion your name is not your reputation it is a name your name doesnt leave you and go out and do stuff er without violating the eula or character transfers reputation is the sum of the actions of the person in control this is why character transfers are badits refreshing to see an argument and a solution in one post well i personally dont like the solution and question the middlealphabetapocalypse but its another one to the list well played dont forget to tic the support box
this seems like a good proposal
people will just leave them cloaked indefinitely with a pc running 237 relog recloak although you could also make them unable to cloak 
sign
sounds like a good idea
signing this again 
so it makes sense now they want to rmt fittings for our convenience
i like it ill probably leave it turned on with one or two of the machines i play on but want to keep it disabled on my laptop for performance reasons i want the option to go ship spinning back too
make it really optional dont force everyone to use unfinished crap which burns out graphic cards or sit in front of an ugly wallpaper
cq is fail i want to spin my ship and turn all that stuff off
plus ing 1there needs to be a commitment from ccp for a permanent solution to this nonsense in its current form a nongameplay element in influencing gameplay docking loading times number of clients running this is not acceptable
thanks ccp now instead of paying ccp for eve i have to buy plex and save up to buy new gfx card to play eve well done and for that 4th account i was going to open all ready thinking of liquidating the 3rd account and going back to 2 to cut my electric bill when docked
yes please make this rubbish optional
i would love to be able to opt out of cq for the old interface it brings nothing to the game that i can see and if i uncheck load station enviro i have to open fittings to see what ship im in disappointing at best
bad cq is bad
1 account because my barely 1 year old computer struggles to run 2 eve clients at the same time i think ccp will be saving lots of players rl cash when there is no sense to most people running more than one with one expansion ccp have turned eve into a
terrible make optional
please keep your crap expansions away from the actual eve gameplay
i want to ship spin again
hey ccp im not living in north alaska i dont need something to warm my flat my mcbookpro will melt because of your crappy cq useless powerconsuming laptop killerwant my old hangar view too 
id rather have the old hangar back even if i can run it smoothly or not 3 old hangar
captains quarters need to be optional my computer may run it fine but the controls are clunky as hell and my whole computer runs so hot its ridiculous give me my old hangar view back this stupid fixed image is annoying
should be an option after docking imo
please make cqincarna optionali want back my old spin ship view and this is spaceship game mostly walking in station is nice add but that all
i dont know why i even have to ask for this
thisgive back ship spinning
because of team awesome
captains quarters need to be optionalit negatively effects gameplay and is terrible
please stop wasting our time our money and our patience
on top of everything else in getting rid of hangarview theyve disabled drag and drop to make active on a ship adding an extra unneded mouse click every time i docki want a depod button right next to undock bring back ship spinning
i agree with what has been said we should have the option to use the previous view even if it is not the default an unpod button would also be a decent fix but still cause a bit of annoyance for people
i want my station spinning back this static picture is a half arsed solution that you ccp implemented because you couldnt imagine why on earth people wouldnt want to use your 2008 looking 3d system that frankly needs a top end system to multibox without burning it all to hellmy sandbox dosnt feel too sodding sandy

i support making cq optional im on a budget and cant afford to keep upgrading my computer every time ccp improves the game if ccp makes the game unplayable then my two accounts walk no point in paying for a game that doesnt work
as primarily a trader i really miss being able to spin whichever little frig i decide to sit in for the day im not going to burn 3x the gpu power to watch my avatar scratch the back of his neck over and over so now im stuck staring at the door

i totally agree with op its not that we want a static background its that we want to dock but stay in the ship it doesnt require any new code just one condition an option and a button1 option do not load station environment is fineif its marked load the static background2 option do not autoleave the ship after docking needs to be added if it is marked load old hangar view if not load cq3 button leave ship and go to cq needs to be addeed to neocomif it is clicked go to cqthis will let us to have ship spinning which is a part of entertainment that eve provides and you very well know that however silly that sounds its true that its fun thing to do and we like and want itthis will also allow us to notautoload cq every time we dock sometimes we just want to grab ammo drone or the forgotten courier package and undock immedietellydo not force your visions down our throats just give us choice thank you

ninty percent of the threads in this topic are written by a bunch of whining clowns
i want my old station view back 
cq optional supported if it becomes mandatory you lose another player simply cant play it on my laptop with the station loading requirements no whining a simple fact of hardwarei remember the eve causality trailer i watched on youtube which got 
fixed
it was interesting for about 60 seconds now its just an annoying resource hog
please make it optional
1 make it optional please im just here to fly spaceships if i wanted to walk around i would play wow and hang around org
there isnt a good enough reason to make this mandatory until something substantive arrives for incarna this new interface is simply causing systems to utilize more resources to do the same thing as the older interface did
eve players arent opposed to new content but when the new content is mediocre and is released and integrated with all the subtlety of a sledge hammer it is not appreciated
optional or bust
ccp please make the cq optional let us go back to the old station view what first drove me to the game was its freedom it was basically a universe where you could do whatever the hell you liked and where everything was optional you could run your own corporation or just sit in jita 44 and scam people but now it seems some of that choice has been taken away from us not to mention some features that allowed for less clicking in contextual menus such as being able to drag your ship into the hangar and have it activate instead of having to right click and hunt for the make active button not to mention spingate as i liked to call it honestly i cant tell you how many times ive spun a ship in station and with each rotation grown to love it a little morei must say this is the first time in my ever career where i seriously thinking of just cancelling my subsription and going on to something else i honestly thought that ccp was a good company that listened to its audience but now i fear that i was wrong

i like the cq it loads and works fine for me i like where ccp is going with incarnaeven so i do support making the cq and everything that will eventually come behind it completely optional allow people to dock and only see the hanger even if it is eventually an update hanger interface allow people to interact with a station as they always have been able to without loading any 3d environment from the hanger after you dock you should have a button that says enter station if that is where you want to go and i also support being able to adjust 3d environment graphics setting separate from the space environment graphics settings
done i wrote to them
make it optional
station hangar  spinship standard cq optional 2nd step after docking
i agree this ought to be optional id rather have seen more new ships and modules and less paper dolls
i dont need to see the amount of aurum i currently have right below the amount of isk i have on the wallet tab i also love how you think by putting it in turquoise to pop off the screen will make me think i need to get some aurum because the balance is zero nice tryunder the settings tab there should be an option to not display the amount of aurum you have also put the isk amount back on the left
i will never have aurum i know i have 0 aurum and i dont plan on getting any because to me 400mil for a plex is a lot to spend on vanityafter seeing the prices i know for fact i will not be buying any eve isnt my hobby that ccp thinks video games are a cheap sources of entertainment i play eve because i can have fun for hours for only 15 a month
also put my balance back on the left side
1i never intend to use aur and i have no interest in having my wallet cluttered up with useless infobuttonsmove crappy aur wallet some place else the bin would be good
honestly im not sure why they added yet another currency to the game rather than just making everything cost isk considering isk can be converted into aurum either they didnt think it through or they did it as a way to trap rm money in the same way a 5 store gift card is trapped money except this is a store that only accepts gift cards and the gift cards are for amounts different than the prices of items in the store assuring that anyone who spends money in the store spends more money than the price of anything in the store in a permanent way so youd really have to want something to take that plunge or see a bunch of stuff worth buying with only 8 items and a history of lack of iterationedit forgot to support
someone has to buy that plex and put 15 in cpps bank account for that aurum to exist thats the difference between aur and iski support the proposal i dont plan on acquiring space barbie moneies

i never want aur and having it showing is distracting when i look at my wallet

i would like to propose that loot log exporting be brought back as it was before incursion 15 or incorporated into the api in some new way so that we dont have to spend a large amount of time figuring out the loot shares for fleet membersthe removal of this feature has caused a lot problems for myself my corpmates and many other people who have been discussing it in this threadthis feature saved a lot of time for opcoordinators and fleet leaders by allowing us to export the loot logs and input them into a 3rd party program to determine who deserves what share of the profits now we have to go through the ingame loot logs manually and determine shares manually or manually type out a document with what the exported loot log would have been to input it into our 3rd party programsif this feature were to return in some way it would save countless manhours for opcoordinators and fleet leaders by allowing them to easily use 3rd party programs for dividing loot shares again i also feel that ccp has ignored the players by removing this feature and only giving us a pathetic response telling us it was removed because ccp soundwave isnt a fan of export features in general then completely ignoring the thread the response to the player outcry on this issue has been pitiful at bestafter saying that i would also like to include in my proposal that when and if this is brought to ccps attention our very deep disappointment in their response to the player outcry is conveyed to them and ask that they try to respond better to issues like this in the future or at the very least if they only post a single reply to an issue like this come up with a better more detailed reason for the features changeremoval
i too would like this feature brought back i know of 2 people which had multiple accounts each let the game go because of this feature both were indy pilots like myself running mining ops is what we do how do we divy up the payments if we cant export the loot log and run numbers into a spreadsheet yeah its still possible but it is unnecessarily complicated i would like this feature to come back to the game asap it was not hurting anyone before and all it has had is negative effects since it was taken away please bring loot export back asap lenny
i used the export feature heavily i even wrote a web service where i could upload a loot log and get payout amounts in seconds now im back to entering the loot information into a spreadsheet by hand i dont even care to lead pve ops anymore because of the removal of this feature just not worth the hassle
yes is would like this back as well
i rarely use this feature but removal of something so obviously useful to a large set of players seems rather ridiculous how much code did it take to simply export it doesnt degrade performance it doesnt exploit the game in any way it allows players to function more efficiently in game1 for putting this functionality back in
please get this put back
yes seconded this regression brought back a significant and unwelcome burden for anyone who has to calculate splits after an extraction or sleepers op record looting after a roam or whatever it should be reversed as soon as possiblewhile of no concern to many loot logging is a daily concern to some  and those are people whom other players depend upon for their enjoyment of the game it does not help eve when you reinstitute a banal punishment duty on op leaders for no apparent reasoneves feature set would be crushed if minority interest were reason enough to remove something a features failure to thrill a particular developer isnt a good criteria either  at least not unless he explains why it doesnt ccp soundwaves bewildering response on the 20th of may certainly didnt contain any explanation though i would be fascinated to hear what if any reasons he can produce now

currently there are 4 movement shortcuts move forward move backward which doesnt actually make you walk backwards   move left move rightmost first and third player games allow you to do more more specifically most games have wasd bound to move forward move backward strafeturn left strafeturn right the current mechanics are wonky and make moving around feel very unnaturalthis proposal requests ccp to add 4 more shortcuts to the collection of movement shortcutsturn leftturn rightstrafe leftstrafe rightadditionally it would be nice if a toggle would enable my forwardbackwardleftright to be relative to the current direction my character is facing rather than the current situation where it is relative to the way my camera faces a toggle because maybe some people like it the way it currently is
id really like to see this too theyd probably have to add strafing animations before this could be implemented something like this would become more important when the stations open up common spaces for people to interactitd be nice if they looked to games that really do 3rd person controls well personally id suggest dead space i always thought that game had great controls

hi i just wanted to throw a wild idea at you guys for the eve game play as i like to go mining often i notes something rather odd like most miners i like to drop cans as i mine and as usual we often get them robed so i was wondering when we the miners will ever get are revenge as in a bran spanking new booby trap can in the real world i do believe that miners would start to do stuff like thisspecswhen ejecting cargo you get the choose of the regular container or the booby trapped container18k m3 can only be dropped by mining barges exhumers and industrial ships can only access by you your fleet corp alliance if access by someone els will blow up that ship 50 of the time a kind of caned russian relet ore industrial skill 5 grater chances of explosion per skill level
supported make it 100 instead of 50 miners get lol exploding griefers griefers get instant aggro timed at their convenience and auto switch to pod for faster swap to combat ship back at station everyones happy
its the only thing in the game which is essay money all the other ways to mack isk mining rating missioning salvaging all have some kind of challenge time risk of getting your ship blown up
awesome idea explosion radius 5kmdmg all types cargo amount x 800 cabouuuum hihihi
id leave it at 50  skill bones or els whats the point if the can jumper knows hes gana get popped no one will try to steal it just nulls the hole idea of the boobm can think of it as a russian runlet
am i the only one ed off with this expansion this aurum and exchange rate thing is such an obvious money making ploy its sickening i thought ccp was better than thisguess not
who cares just undock problem solved
its not thatgoes way beyond
it doesnt end with the few articles of clothing currently in the shop many planned customizations are likely to revolve around the noble exchange free expansions start to lose their meaning when half the content needs to be paid extra for
i do agree that the prices for those items are rediculously high 60 worth of plex for a monacle one that is destroyed if you are podded sorrythats not a microtransactionthat is a wallet  those items need to be drastically reduced in price unless that monacle actually gives some really cool abilities like its description statesit is not worth that much
so the vanity item price list is now known and we all now know that a space monocle the pinnacle of ccps investment in walking in stations costs a miserly 12000 aur which in effectively 3 and a half plex i shouldnt have to tell you what a plex goes for in isk but if you dont know that works out to about 14 billion isk lets list out all the things you could buy with 14 billion isk to start offfour hundred and twenty thousand copies of pax amarria
hmm i get those for free as im the best and greatest amarr rule supporter in eveconvo me to trade those for a space monocle 
i could get bunch of real quality tshirts with price of digital internet spaceship tshirt
so 3500 aur for a plexplex costs 400m or like 18 from shattered crystalthe monicle costs 12000 thats around three and a half plexalomst 14bn isk or 61what on earth were you thinkingthat is fUFFFDg outrageousif your going to give vanity items out at least make them cheap enough that they dont bankrupt people
that jsut shows way that aur brath in the gamer to make anormus amount ioff money for ccp and increase drasticly plex prices
reduce all aur prices by a factor of 100 tia
or eve more actualy i dont see point to have atall aur in game eny way  in game geting seled in isk and need to be so no aur at all ingame
be honest vincent did you buy it thinking it was 1200 and not 12000 now your emo ranging ed off
i tink hee didnt bath but lloked on prices i to loked there that is 12000 aur that ing expansive
i have not and currently will never buy anything in the aur store unless they change the prices the prices are clearly ridiculous it shouldnt cost over 100 days subscription costs to purchase a useless monicle has anyone actually purchased this monicle if so send me some free isk while your at it you must be loaded with cashthis could be a decent program maybe 120 aur for it would be more suitable a little fun but nothing game changing
space monocle vs rorqualspace monocle vs two kilometer long transforming flying space ore factory that that can jump between star systems
i too agree 3 and half plex that would around 60usd is quite much for a monocle for one mmo character jesus christtheres other name for this crime its called extortion 2 years prison go now without going to start square
he doesnt want to be protected from the prober he wants to kill the prober as a prober himself which is perfectly reasonableyes probing should not be risk free whether its combat or core probes supported
this would break scanning mechanics in whsabsolutely not a good idea
uh no this is almost as bad as the people crying about afk cloaking and the carebears wanting local removed this is a whine about a vital game mechanic probers are completely useless if they cant actually probe
suported good idea if if that gos only to combat probes not to usual scan probes if you wish take some one down put in efoce there and teka a risk not sit hided behind cauckthis not breaking usual probing but only combat probing makes a litle bit harder and risonable to give defender or defenders time to probe you out until you probing them out
a little excessive if you ask me and makes coverts all but useless for the taskat most make actually running a scan with probes require you to decloak and in exchange cut the reactivation delay to 10s or soif possible being able to move probes while hidden would be optimal but requires the movescan functionality to be separated so not sure if doable
i agree with kamikaze jihawt on this the prober should have the same risk as the target making them uncloak to accomplish probing sounds like a great way to do ita few additional points probers can make safe points nothing said they cant warp around while probingcovert cloaks are for travel they do nothing to add to security while probing hell i can the same thing with a t1 cloak it isnt until i want to warp that the covert cloak is important
not supportedthe presence of combat probes in the system is visible on the directional scanner if you are too lazy to use it then thats your loss
yopu see only probes not ship if its able to see ship and warp to it and kil it then itsoki but now its only probes wath i see that notinaf to kil that freek ko truing to scan me down more risk for such types need to be ion game not only safe scanintg waroping to target 3 sec lock scram and cyno up victime dead tath safe for enganging force no risk at all 
omgifucantproperlytypeonyourmobilepleaseuseyourpcinsteadcausethisisjustplainunreadable
er why do you think that the prober is probing you out if you want to gank the prober just sit still for 30 seconds and youll get your chance
this only helps those who want to hide we dont want to hide we want to kill the prober which is currently impossible
no there should be a warning if you are being probed down less stupid scanner spam  more fun  less lag
well i cant one shot a titan maybe i should petition that too its about as rediculous as this suggestion
dont be rediculous any prober who launches combat drones to gain intelligence on the position of a target is in fact engaging in an indirect form of combat all other ships are required to be uncloaked when they engage in combat so should the prober
i support this idea as well
what about locator agents and passive targeting and ship scanning theyre also in the realm of information combat heres the thing in all of these examples they havent attacked you for all you know the prober could leave the system and do nothing with the information obtainedas was pointed out wait 30 seconds and then youll get your chance to kill the prober lets not forget that by default probes are at a disadvantage while probing because theyre on the map view and dont have their full attention on whats going on around them hence why cov ops got the scanning bonuses
locator agents dont pinpoint your exact location and passive targeters dont cloak waiting 30 seconds means you have to wait on their terms to fight if you can probe them down as they probe you then its a more even battlefield imo like the second poster in this thread pointed out there are other measures these probers can take to stay somewhat safe but it gives you a fighting chance to get them at least and no this wont destroy combat probing
i find alot of my targets using just the directional scanner i suppose that should make me drop out of cloak too then following your logic offcourselolz
that doesnt follow my logic since the directional scanner doesnt pinpoint a targets location
get out
the sames wining about improbable tengus are now wining because they want to probe free riskno that shouldnt even exist since you forced ccp to admit that nothing should be improbable witch includes covrrt ops bos recconsdifficult yes impossible noyou wanted it youve got it
add the option to easily switch to a firstperson view and have more traditional fps controls in this view id much rather just point the mouse where i want to look than have to drag this would make me much more comfortable navigating around as im al
good idea current movement is very unnaturalofcourse faster walkingbetter walkingwith time not criticalexactly just make old hangar defaults state after docking then allow to enter cq from therei know rightget us the old hangar backexactly get that crap out of my face
i think it is fine as it is hold the leftmouse button and pres w you will walk in the direction the mouse is pointingdont run indoors youll only break a leg i think it is fine as it is looks natural especially for someone who is coming home pits coming for each race in one of the next patches they even hinted at being able to customize your quarters in the past sotheyre probably working on itthis a common complaint that is being discussed in thousands of threads theyll probably add it just to get people to stop complaining i do agree though from an rp perspective it doesnt make sensei agreelets hope they fix the inconsistenciesthats because it is and isnt the same thing its the same style and layout but rendered in different ways to get that docked view you would have to load up the engine that drives the captains quarters anyway i have also noticed that area where your ship is located in the captains quarters is the major performance hog of captains quarters i get higher fps while looking through the door into the room than i do looking through the door out towards the shipits even more unrealistic to be spinning the ship if you absolutely need this minigame just open a ship or turret preview windowit would be nice but they already have some pseudoradio chatter in some station i wouldnt want too much unless i can call concord to tell the announcer to keep it downi think it is fine as it is my carrier looks absolutely huge from the captains quarters yet i can still see the details on my shuttle phehi would rather they fixed other things such as the display of iskaurum in the walleti have given support as some of the ops suggestion and ideas are good but some need to be tweaked or reconsidered
id like to see more immersion and functionality in the cq in particular the auxilliary monitors that function as a corp and pi button should get their own overviews like the main monitori think id like to see the pi panel when your planets are active to show up details like time till extrator depletion on planets amounts of stuff youve already got etc couple that with a nifty little view of the planets or something and itd be greatas for the corporate panel having it show various details like events placed on the corp calander would significantly increase ops exposure for corps making it easier for their members to spot random ops placed up wardecs and dec info could be shown things like thatalso customizable quarters with purchasable furniture would be nice or normal ingame items with the option to import them into your quarters like protitutes or those sansha head things
id like to see the aur prices for all items reduced by a factor of 100
the most constructive feedback for cq isturn it offor you could always leave it on and use the excess heat generated by your gpu to reduce your annual heating bill
i have an eye condition that makes it hard for me to focus on lots of things moving in my field of vision at the same time when i still wanted to play eve and needed to read stuff or deal with lots of chat i could do that just fine in stations but not so much anymore i have disabled station environment at the moment but ive heard that will be removed later oni beg you ccp please please make some or other option where you can stay in your ship like the suggestion above or go into a sleep state or something of this nature that will remove the overload of information and bling and blinks for those of us who cannot play this way as i get extremely nauseatedi appreciate that the new stuff is cool and it does look nice and on my good days i might admire it but i dont play fps or car games for this very reason and the having to try to use it wont improve it for me since i have very little dept vision and my eyes cant focus i love eve though and have for 5 years i want to keep playing it and be able to make a difference on leadership level of my corporation and alliance but this is making it really hard for meplease consider a way of fixing it within the frame of the system im fine with it for everyone else but if cq will be all there is one day i fear i cannot play the game very well  any means of turning down some info and not having to move around in person would be so deeply appreciated sleep go to bathroom to escape have a wrist watch and just flip to that one get back into ship and leave it if you want but not be forced anything please
 considering the vast wealth of pod pilots it is rather disappointing that we exit our ship to chill in a broom closet i hope that will either change or we will have an opportunity to pay for a nicer place to chill considering our supposed status in t

soi think this entire update is moronic i dont play this game to play house i play to get in a spaceship and go kill people however this is an issue for elsewhere1 why would you even want to have furniture and crap to decorate your cq  a captains quarters isnt a perm living space its a reserved temporary housing unit for visiting ships captains which means it is generic before someone even mentions it captains dont carry around their furniture in my opinion letting things spin out of control and the more ccp brings to the inside of stations the less people are going to be in space maybe most people dont think that is such a bad thing but like i said this is a spaceship game i will say however it would make since to have a few different types of generic captains quarters having each race if different furniture and walls and the like would make a lot of since instead of just the actual dock being race specific i mean really does england and china have the same decorative tastes when it comes to furniture and paint  no so it would stand to reason that amarr and caldari dont either also since this update is here and i have to live with itcorporations should have restricted conference rooms limited to corpalliance members only perhaps based on the alliance or corp size as well small medium or large conference rooms obviously pl would need a much larger conference room than some corp with 20 peoplei really hope that ccp is very limiting or at least extremely cautious with what the are going to allow players to be doing inside station if you are ever able to kill other players inside station my accounts will be unsubscribed that very day i love eve because of the concept of the game what the focus of eve has always been lets not go crazy and make this another game entirely if i wanted to play mass effect id load it up
adjusting a dreads siege cycle to 5 minutes seems ok reduce an industrial cores cycle time to 5 minutes as well while youre at itshortening siege cycles because of supercarriers seems like treating symptoms instead of the problems root cause go after the root cause instead
indeed and one of the problems with supercarriers is that they dont have to commit to a fight but can disengage easily in fact looking back the ability to not have to commit to a fight and to disengage too easily has been at the heart of far too many of eves problems  everything from stabbabonds ecmdomis and nanoed everything a long siege timer is good because it discourages frivolous use and punishes mistakeschanging dreads siege timer to 5 mins doesnt help when the supercarriers primary you doesnt address the true problem supercapitals and just makes it easier for hostile dreads to escape from you when they should be being punished
this would make it pretty much impossible to overcome even just 3 or so triage carriers with a sub cap fleet it would be extremely easy to drop out of triage and get reps from your triage buddies if you get primaried and once that happens youre not breaking unless the other side drops supersand if they do youre dead nomatter what
changing to a 5 minute timer for siege is something weve been asking for for a whilehowever it doesnt need to go shorter than that or its simply stupid
but isnt a scarrier supposed to be able to kill a carrier or a dread i mean a carrier can off a couple bs call it 41 so it would make sense that a scarrier should be able to accomplish the same ratio against carriers the problem is that a scarrier can also make mincemeat of 30 hacs or 100 frigates as well scarriers lack a weak point they are like deathstars without blatant exhaust ports just asking you to stick two torpedoes down them
the underwhelming response from ccp to take ownership of the very large issue of rmt and botting in eve is a source of great frustration to myself and many players articles are produced on a regular basis that discuss the impact of rmt and botting and yet ccp remains quietly passive on addressing the threat as a player i see the impacts of botting and rmt often and i think many of us do ie characters that are logged in virtually 24  7  ratting  mining  trading if botting and rmt continue to grow and in time reach epidemic levels it could very well break the player economy under a flood of illict isk and items csm please take this matter to ccp and demand answers on how they are fighting the black market economy that is a blight on every legitimate player in the game
1 ban those that rmt  bot ccp have taken action in the past unholy rage 6200 accounts banned august 2009 but perhaps those days are long past i have long been suspicious of the market botting that i suspect goes on in jita only ccp have the tools t
no  we should have built in bots for those works anywaybtw banning paying customers  thats totally against ccps policy
while its true that the railgun tengu sucks you really should fix the underlying issue of hybrids needing a boost before you start trying to fix them on a ship by ship basiswait for the hybrid buff and if it doesnt do enough bring this up again
easy to say to wait for it those hybrids are need for a boost for at least 3 years by now
ill just say theres a reason why i have 100 runs of untouched magnetic infusion basin blueprints in wh space
yeah so fix the hybrids instead fixing all hybrid ships rather then trying to fix every single hybrid ship one at a time
create a new server where all the nonspaceship garbage will go such as dustincarnaetc people who want to fly spaceships and do all that garbage can play away from all the normieskeep tranquility as a spaceship game

when you talked about plex to aur conversion i thought you could actually buy some stuff for the amount of aur you get from a plex now i see that for one plex i barely get a shirt  how can that be 4 frakking fitted armageddons are worth as much as a shirt loli recommend ccp to rebalance aur asapif i could buy at least 10 items or so for a plex i might even do it just for the lulz but i hope people wont forget that theire basically paying 2530 euros to ccp with every plex they convert to aur dont forget that you can buy a very real shirt for the same 30 euros the price of a virtual shirt please rebalance ccp and what now a completely useless purely cosmetical virtual ocular implant is worth 100 euros i bought a very real leather jacket 2 shirts and a pullover for the same price just this morning
best thing to do imo is just not to use this crap
my point lol still its completely stupid typical ccp scam
the first small but important feature ccp decided to remove to make our lives better is local fittings storage after that change we now have ability to store fittings on the server but only 50 of them what is good about that decision adding the ability to store 50 fits on the serverwhat is wrong about it removing the ability to store infinite amount of fits locally now every time i want to save new fit i first need to pick one of my existing fits preferably the least interesting one and delete it first because i have 50 of them already there are numerous threads on the forum about this issue the blog post introducing the change stated that we will be able to store fits locally but thats not the case at least there arent any options for it in eve fitting management toolat the moment we can save fits to personal or corporation database if we could just get a third option to save them on local machine it would be a perfect solutionsecond example of a feature ccp decided to delete is the fleet loot log export option which allowed you to save your loot log as a file and then parse it with thirdparty appsscripts to for example calculate total loot valuethere is a forum thread about this issue
please consider adding not removing our choices eve population is diverse there are hardcore pilots with hundreds of saved fits who always use the same pc and will never want to walk in stations there are also hardcore traders who never leave station change shirt every 10 minutes and parse exported mission loot logs for their corp oh waitthere are also people who do a little bit of everything and thats cool if you give us more choices eve will stay a perfect habitat for all those types if you try to push us down the pipe you will get to the point where people will leave because of the changes even though the content they love is still there but they just cannot use it the way they always did you can add stuff while still allowing us to live the old live some of us have older pcs some of us have hundreds fits and some of us found daily use for that obscure feature you have in some dark corner of the eve interface dont delete features  parts of user experience  choicesthank you  not ragequitting yet not giving out my stuff either
i agree to all youve said rho1 also my pc is a littler old now wont be able to log on untill i can swipe the kids laptop or totally replace my desktop shader 3 unsupported i hope the corp can survive without their major scientistproducer
so i like the way the tv works in cq and shows all that nifty info in a neat little rotation nowmake it so we can sit on the couch and then get an option to fullscreen the tv so it is all we see on the screen nothing major but thought it might be cool for those boring afk times when i have eve on but am playing something else even bettermaybe use it for stuff like broadcasting the live streams of eve events like the alliance tournamentbtwgood job on this expansion and the deployment of it ccp very nicely done this time i have experienced very little in bugs or glitches thus far do this every time
1 thisi was just sitting in and waiting for a trade and thought the exact same thing as i was watching the screen would be good to have a fullscreen or zoom option for the tv
definetly because you would think that if someone like a big tournament or super battle was going on the news would have it on vid aka your television would be cool maybe broadcast faction warfare ok maybe not not much exciting stuff there or at least if there is ever a major battle or war going on that is big enough to get peoples attention broadcast that too
the only thing in cq worth mentioning the tv also let us choose what we wanna see examplebounty hunting in this game is worthless so lemme turn off some random guys bounty poping upi would like to see ships for sale battles taking place sovernty changes and quafe commercials
unfortunately tvs have never worked like thati would love to just get local news disney scify discovery travel and cartoon network but no i have to have all the other junk too i agree with this though would be pretty awesome and immersive maybe even tie it to another service like eve radio so its live all the time tv
i like the eve radio ideahow about we just have a radio we can turn off and on for that i thought i heardsaw an advertisement on the tv for a corp looking to recruitsupporting my own thread
serious problem with this proposal is the fact that a pirate could just sit in a noobie system in a very cheap ship popping other noobies all day long same goes for miners pirates would simply gank them more and more because the consequences for these actions are not harsh enough to stop them doing soi like the idea of eve being more pvp orientated but a lot of people dont play it for pvp so yes they should be protectedlow sec is far worse than npc 00 in terms of pirates only engaging with many many more numbers and they also have the ability to pvp with very expensive implants with little to no risk you have your advantages take them or go to npc 00having said this i believe concord should strike once in a while giving everyone throughout eve a taste of pvp
unless im mistaken concord has no spawn delay in a 10 system and frankly it would be a waste of time and effort pirates pirate for money civilian shield boosters dont sell that wellwhy i mean why do you think pirates will spend money on thateveryone is pvping in eve it is impossible to avoidso you wouldnt want the same advantage against the same piratesthat is a bad idea it will set a precedent for removing concord entirely
the post you responded to is not really talking about pirates but griefers and there are plenty of them in eve one of these types hanging out in a starter system ganking new players until they get to 10 sec status is not beyond imaginationthing is starter systems are not just populated by newbies  veteran players pass through starter systems all the time for missions trade etc so the griefing rifter would be popped in short order by someones t2fitted missioning ship
really well if this change goes through id definitely check that out and see about hunting some of those griefers in my hound
and again in this game griefing is bannable what you consider as greifing verse what the reality is two different things i am afraid
explain to me how an outlaw could sit in a noobie system and pop people all day once you kill one person you receive a gcc which lasts for 15 minutes who the hell is going to sit in a noobie system pop an ibis dock wait 15 minutes then do it again nobody
i used griefer in its conventional mmo slang meaning a player who makes virtual attacks against other players mostly for tears ie in order to see them complain or argue the terms of service that it comes closest to violating are and griefing that stays completely within the game system does not rise to the level of any of the examples the tos cites as long as griefing does not involve exploiting bugs real life threats frivolous petitions or other similar misconduct it appears to be permitted by the tos
so if anything decrease the alpha and keep the rate of fire but then they wouldnt be 720s would they720250  288 if you havent calculated that alreadyheres how it works big shell good range lots of damage slow reload and fire small shell okay damage fast reload and fireand no im not trolling you just pointing that out in case you missed it doesnt make it right but needs to be pointed out anyway rails suck because they shoot super fast and do no damage wasting ammunition quite quickly while theyre at it artillery has a sweet alpha but is sodamnslow
pretty dumb discussion thread  artillery is balancedyou seem to be arguing all guns should do same alpha dps etc dumb whent the rebalance of artillery occurred some time back ccp lookedat balancing all elemnts not just alpha strikes so the good news is everything is performing as intended
op actually has some merit but it is more due to railguns being pretty sucky and extreme range being bit useless at the moment due to fast probing
even without probing artillery owns rails bcs never fire outside of 150 kmsame dps artillery never caps out selectable damage type and huge alpha advantage whats the downside to artillery
the incredibly slow rate of fire that gives reps plenty of chance to kick in for one thing
big picture here is huge alpha on artillery which totally s anything without some buffergo figure whats wrongim pretty sure theres plenty of people who think instapopping stuff even without bonused ship is fine though
false putting out same dps as rails means at best reps work equally well against both artillery puts out more damage over time because it can select damage types and it takes a long time for an insignificant 1 dps advantage to overcome damage from alpha shot  usually longer than it takes for rail to cap out
it takes well over two times the number of rail boats to alpha a target than artillery boats it should therefore take more than 101 as many artillery boats to grind through a buffer tank than rail boats rails also suck because they run the risk of capping out and good point about ammo reload taking time away from rail dps for longer fights as well
well something has to be best and if artillery is that something then so be it i dont see it as a point to whine over and im not neccessarily certain it is the best in every class of module in the game there is a best item and a worst item dependant on what you are trying to do the way artillery works in game now is a feature that makes it distinctive from other weapon types high alpha slow cycle time and pretty poor tracking its not over powered if you find yourself dying continuously to artillery vessels then its more than likely pilot error ie putting yourself in the presence of a hostile gang with poor intel or a failure to establish transversal or getting tackled  imobilised or just plain old fail fittings on the vessel u r flyingcertainly i do agree galente need some love as the game balance over time has left them deprived in some areas specifically rails blasters and some of their ships  bonuses if the intent of the topic was to highlight that then perhaps the topic should have been galente love wanted instead of the omg nerf arty approach
there is no downside to artillery compared to rails edit for the nitpickers  artillery is better than railguns in 1920 engagement scenarios
imho boost hybridshybrid ships first then compare the 3 turret types
lasers ans missiles are also better than hybrids in 1920 engagement scenariosperhaps as the above poster already said the answer is to buff hybrids rather than nerf everything else
1 plex  3500 aurum3600 aurum  1 shirtabsolutely absurd
agreedplenty of threads on this already though
agreed reduce by a factor of 100 should do it 36 aur for a shirt
the aurum market is for the elites ingame and the incredibly stupid in rl
so you wont help me decide if i should buy a full fitted machi or an eye implantthx
how about36 aur  1 virtual shirt3600 aur  they send me a real version of that shirtof course theyd first have to make me a shirt any proud minmatar would wearnone of this gap bullchitedit forgot to support
if i see anyone in my corp wearing a monacle that doesnt already own a fully fitted carrier they getting the boot
microtransactions as a whole are fail but if we are going to have it please keep the prices civilized not this insulting cash grab
i agree prices are crazy
what market there are like eight things to buy and none of them stand out compared to what is available during character creation as for it being expensive who gives a if you want a haircut you can go to a fancy salon or take a razor to your scalp only difference is looks  same as this  vanity items are for the vain
the shirts should be 3500 if the conversion is 1 plex  3500 au unless they want to just ditch that and allow direct rm to au conversion i dont want change back in au thats like getting change back in the form of a gift card when you purchase a car if there were more items for sale it would be different but there would have to be a lot more items to make a gift card worth having
would this be a good time to remind everybody of the selection of clothing etc that used to be available with the old character creatori think it would ccp
gunna be hard considering noone else is going to be seeing it for a long long while p
any change you make requires a new portrait it seems i got my quafe shirt and had to switch my portrait if i wanted to put it on
thanks gizzniti think youre right that opecs are a very real possibility considering we already have them its just much more difficult to organize on the other hand market prices would be significantly more stable in jita 01isk is fairly common but in the backwaters of amarr people will drop the price by 1k isk or more causing entire item ranges to become poorly traded until everyone gets bored and leaves the market or someone resets it
though your idea is sound in practice it would not happen when people want to sell stuff they either wantit sold nowvery soonit sold at a high priceif i see you have an item for 30isk whats 2999 isk for the chance to sell first my profit will drop but the cash flow will increasealso whats a few isk on say a freighter i approve of your idea how thought out it was your post construction was good but the idea itself would not give u the desired end result
35 bucks buys 2 plexsthat said the item prices are rediculous indeed but that has nothing to do with this thread

honestly eves a players market like the prices or not ccps actions wont destroy the plex market basic supply and demand will balance out there are people out there that wont sell plexs on the market because they dont make enough they climb in price and youll see them sold seriously dont assume something you have no way of knowing watch and see how the market adapts over the next couple months
prices for plex its allready to highh 400 milj per 1 now in jita araund that insane was in some months ago 320 if price wil climb up to the 450 than i wil tink about leave the game complitly i not alone on that madure to leave game for this reason all ready need farm araund 7 hours to get plex that for one char i have 4 accounts and i need them if i play game if i not play than afcors wil not play them up to all i closed allready 1 acount so that makes araund 28 hours off farming if i can play only 34 hours per day that makes araund 9 days pure farming i not play weekends so its wil meke for me araund almost 2 weeks i not counting that i need skil books ships for pvp etc
not supported the purpose of aur was to reduce the stockpiles of plex that were accumulating the price will even out after some speculations most likely crashitd be nice if the noble store used isk and aur and did serve as an isk sink
even if you separate plex from aurum it wont matter unless you also make it impossible to trade aurum and the stuff bought with it separating them without doing that will still decrease plex supply since people that want to convert rl cash to isk will have 2 different ways of doing so some will choose to buy plex to sell some will choose to buy aurum to sell so less plex entering the game short term it has a pretty significant impact due to speculation and an initial rush by the people that really want this stuff to get it but long term it will be much smaller when speculation calms down a secondary market of second hand items has been created and demand has been lowered as most people already have what they want
if your pvp fleet cannot deal with the rats on a gate you should probably just go and dock back up
errr overview settings perhaps
i guess it would require a bit of gm babysitting but when you consider that only longsov holders would have this capability said gm wouldnt have to worry about having more than 1 or 2 names come across his desk a day or the occasional 20 from we took all of it space in a weekalso supporting myself d
doubt anyone that has serious knowledge of 00 would support such a change fcs for example rely on names not changing it reduce the tactical effectiveness of pilots and to be honest that isnt something we need less of its something we need more of
1 and have it displayed on this new cq monitor thing in front of us and i might actually swith cq back on again occasionally
erm try my already 7 page petition here
there are tons of petitions and threads regarding this subject the vast majority of them call for making cq optional
and we do support them all
i believe the csm was already actively pushing for this one of them actually unsubscribed over it not being optional teatime or something similarso dont get your hopes upfound itteadaze blog
1pi is good example for optional stuff those who want use it and make some isk out of it  those who not have never even try it like my
now that incarna is out we have been waiting a long time time to fix factional warfare i would say almost everybody in militia can offer a item in militia to be changedfixed with logical steps this can be accomplished relativily fast
supporting own topic
why does ccp hate fw
this looks great and stuff but my computer cant handle the station environment without going into seizures sopretty please with sugar on top can i have my shipview back instead of that door cheers
yep new patch sux balz  turing of station enviroment speads game up again but its a bit dull  ship spining is an art in eve bring it back
i have to agree with roonia nice work on the changes only thing i would like to see back is the ship view when in station if you have the cq off
supported and bring back ship spinning
i agree there is no counter to nyx fleet except more nyx fleetthis is the uber blunder ccp did with fleet balance the whole ship class balance and strategic option was destroyed with the supercarriers as they are unkillable en masse eve is seriously messed up from both a tactical and strategic point of view balance wise and options wise its all about moar pilots moar nyx moar pilots moar moarforgot to mention we had the same problem when we realized that moar carriers moar carriers moar carriers was unkillable as protoss and we came up with the emp  thor soyahfix it please
theres an official recording of them available
there was more than just the one time i was under the impression you only did one of each i must have missed the other ones someone please link me the other fireside chats and spot lights thanks in advance
ive been working for a longass time to get my sec status up from 48 to 29its ridiculously difficult for me and i think i only podded 2 peoplethe problem imo though is not the sec status gaining method its the fact that you get penalized so much for fighting in lowsec people need to learn to pvp somewhere
i agree but most people fear that this will eventually lead to mt for nonvanity items and i agree with thatthe moment i see a nonvanity item for sale i will end my sub however this is not the case right now i could not care less about 80 eyepieces they dont influence my game and i will not buy them i
i agree im not going to get involved w items that change game mechanics ill be done as well
fyitrebor on twitter 3rd draft of csm summit minutes completed
hey you dont like losing ship and cargo go play star trek online your ship just re spawns there
or just change the way mining is conducted in its current form its a handsoff activity that requires minimal imput from the miner this is why its so easy to automate with a bothave any of you ever played the smartphone game called galaxy on fire 2 its sort of like playing a watered down single player version of eve but the mining in that game is fun and engaging how mining works in that game is when you start mining an asteroid a target with several ring layers appears along with a drill cursor the cursor tends to wander off in random directions the severity of the wander depends on mining drill quality time ticks down and the target gets smaller and smaller to continue mining you have to keep the cursor within the target or the drill breaks as long as you keep the cursor within the target your cargo hold continues to fill with ore i cant find any examples of the mining in this gameits a great mini game thats fun i wish ccp would do something similar with mining
your idea may be good in theory but remember that that would require the miner to focus on just that minigame if they iomplemented something similar to that meaning you couldnt hit multiple roids at once and any kind fo many game would make the miner unable to respond to npc or player pirates who may pop in to cause some damage and even if you say they could just close out the minigame thats still one more step between them and responding to a threat so on that note unles you have to do a minigame to target lock and fire i dont see it being plausible for a miner to have to do it simply on the basis that they wouldnt be able to react afst enough tot heir environment while mining
apparently you do sir kthnx bai
client side security implementations would remove a lot of botting software that actually determines what is running on a users equipment to actively and aggressively attack bottersccp dont care about botting anyway they give users 3 warnings about it so thats 2 times ccp dont care how many warnings do isk sellers get oh wait none once they get caught they get an unfair ban while botters get to carry on 2 more times
eve is a game known for its complexities in practical terms if you want to play eve you login if you want to play it right you need evemon eft excelcalc and a group of fellow droogs on a forumhistorically theres been a push to homogenize certain aspects of the game bandwidth is one particular example where certain ships such as the myrmidon and the guardian vexor lost a significant part of their utility which absolutely destroyed their functionality missions have been changed to force pilots to move farther out to get to mission zones and people complain about the overall power of larger ship classes at the expense of many smaller ship classesstarting with shipsif ccp wanted to homoginize game play further theyd sell ships prefitted with static modules that could be upgraded but never removed leaving one or two slots that the player could fit theyd integrate this into the cost of the ship the market would be preserved by leaving it up to the builder to produce the guns and fitting them onto the ship prior to marketing them and making it so they couldt sell the ship without the weapons in the holdand this is my proposalin short lets revolutionize the market in eve and improve the new player experience instead of overwhelming players with 647 slots lets prefill 4 of the six top slots 3 of the middle slots and 5 of the low slots lets preload the cargobay with whatever kind of drone the player buys from a drop down package of options the market will be preserved by forcing producers to create suitable modules to fit those slots and the player will still have the option to add additional modules if they see fit a variation on this idea will fill all the slots in advance but depower the lower moduleif a player wants to use a named variant they simply buy that module and install it over the original module if they are using that module when they die the cost gets added to the insurance payout this has to be decided when insurance is taken out on the ship however changes invalidate the insurancethis will also eliminate the situation where a player feels stuck in a station after returning to eve after a long timecynos for everybodygiving every lowerclass ship access to a 1ly cyno that has an hourlong cool down aggression timer would also compel players to travel more freely at the expense of caution since theyre hot for an hour they have to take extra care to survive in their destination system if a fleet hotdrops on another the target fleet could simply jump out but theyd be within 1 ly of the original fleet so it would effectively force the two fleets into a fight and chances are that if its a target fleet theyre looking to fight this 1ly jump could happen inside of empire but shouldnt happen from 00 into empire or viceversadont bring your guns around here unless you plan to use themthe battle bridgewith the new walkinginclosets feature introduced with incarna i was thinking that having a quick way to see your ship from inside the ship would be popular since were all capsuleers this would appear as a static grey round room that were suspended inside and unable to move wed see wires and tubes but maybe also lifebar indicators for our ship using the slick new ui technology ccps given us we can see our ships pewpew before the go poopoo if you bought the monicle it could be in redcyan 3d to add immersion if they add coloured monicles  i can be like sollux captormore ideasthats two ideas that ive got that are designed to homogenize pvp in eve remember the idea is to create situations where all of the ships are given a predetermined selection of fitting options to make teh game more enjoyable for newer players and to force fightorflight fleet mechanics im sure someone can improve my own ideas or propose some great new ways of making eve universally more entertaining
might make it more enjoyable for new playersbut i suspect all the old players would leave
okay incursion 10 is out and doing well the new interface system is awesome i never thought station spinning could get better in game i had an idea watching the news stream what if we could have our own media playing on the main screen imagine watching a tvstream or anime without having to hop out of eve or use a second screentaking this idea one step further what about tv channels that are player run and supported we could have eve sitcoms training courses all sorts of things it seems like the infrastructure is mostly there already it just needs a push the future is now and i want it on tv
yeah wouldbe cool to be able host something like evenews every one h or something like that as well as run something in avi or other basic video from own disk
some sort of eve radio where users could create some sort of radio show based on current eve events a radio show that would be looking for djs right now not only to play music but to host news shows about eve onlinewe could even put it on the domain wwweveradiocom dam its already taken
seriouslyyou sound like a you know what denierso what its just a pile of old shoes jackets shirts hats gold teeth bones passports and omg they actually are bots
what makes you think that they dont
agreed we shouldnt have to scour the internet to find information and the location of any additional information podcasts should be referenced in one location these forums
the csm has a clearly defined purpose as set forth by ccp that purpose is to provide csm with feedback to inhouse ideas this interaction with ccp is protected by a nondisclosure agreement which has reallife ramifications should it be breachedthe csm serves at the pleasure of ccp the csm can be dissolved at any timethe csm is not a rebel group fighting for the ideas and rights of the player base it exists to serve a function on behalf of ccp not on behalf of the player basethe release of minutes for public review is a courtesy it is neither a right nor a privilege nor an obligation the only reason it is done at all is out of the goodness of the individual csm members hearts and of ccp staffstop complaining that your free handout sometimes doesnt occur in a timely manner
this couldnt be more wrong if youd tried what you are describing are beta testers csm are representatives of the player base whose function is to provide their constituency with a voice as ccp stakeholders
i propose that the csm officially adopt charlie the unicorn as the departmental mascot and that all correspondence between ccp and the csm occur entirely in classical latin written on official charlie the unicorn letterhead i believe that this change in policy will accomplish two positive things oint the first the inclusion of charlie the unicorn as the official mascot to be featured on correspondence letterhead will promote an atmosphere of lighthearted fancy tempered with cautious pessimism which should work to frame all ideas in the appropriate perspective suitable towards the construction of an even better eve online point the second the transition into classical latin as the official medium for correspondence will aid in decreasing the amount of ambiguity which sometimes accompanies official correspondence it is my belief that these changes will promote a happier player base and a clearer message on behalf of ccp and the csm so that all participants of the social contract shall become better aware of all situations this is especially important when one considers that i just has a chocolate ice cream cone and it was delicious
yo dawg ive heard that you like to pirate so weve put a pirate tracker into you pirate rifter so you could pirate while you piratesincerely yours pimp my flight

pulling this one out for one reason  i came across botting issues a week or so ago and it still sticks in my headsomeone was talking about this batch of bots operating in a system  they reported it i flew out to see this for myself because i generally dont spend much time poking around highsec mining areas any morei get out there find a batch of ships mining i sent a tell to one of them and waited a bit a couple minutes later i get a reply back so i chatted with the guy some f jerk saying i run bots again guy was afk mining with multiple accounts but was being reported a lot for bottingit makes me wonder how many real bots are being run versus multipleaccounts being run by players who do things like afk miningunderstand i dont doubt for a minute that botting isnt an issue nor that its happening but when i chat with someone whos a bit tickedoff because their multipleaccounts are always being seen as bots it kind of begs the question on how many assume every group of ships afk mining are bots so scream bots everywhere
im certain ive given my 1 to this thread before and i will do it again because this is far too important for ccp to continue to ignore maybe they will for once admit to their nonsense and do something about it instead of writing a devblog and ignoring everything weve screamed about
come on ccp people will still play just as much maybe more if you do this
personally i really want the navy comet to have the gfpd logo on the side again yno make it more police like
checking out the new store and an ingame shirt should cost imo like 12 max right now it costs the same as a real shirtif they sell great ccp can roll around in their rl money and laugh if they dont sell maybe reduce them to a price that is secondlifeish where i am actually tempted to pony up a few hundred million isk for a new outfit or a monocle or some bootsare there really fanbois who will pay that much
tell eve marketing to bend over and kiss their own ass post pictures of them doing it and then i might possibly forgive them for this monstrosity
security ceo and directors have full access to all functions at the pos corp members have access to a pos only if their based at property is set to the location of where the pos is if based at is not assigned access to all corp poss is granted members are given a role based on what stations are at each pos  ie if research stations are present giving a role for research access would grant access to the research stations this would grant all access to all functions at the research station  ie if corp hangar role is granted access to a public corp and private hangar within the corp hangar would be grantedetc any station which could store items would be private to that toon ceo and directors are the only ones that can have anything to do with a tower feed the pos via corp hangar or a fuel bay or even a special type of silo the tower itself would have its own fuel bay but filled optimally by the external silo this way if your fuel technician runs off with the fuel the pos would still have fuel to function ability to set what percentage levels the tower should maintain would be great and notification when the levels cant be maintained daily would be ideal api to report what is available in the external fuel bays and include the location of the fuel bay each pos can only have one external fuel bay corp hangar would have a tab for public corp access and another tab for private use m3 shared amongst all users only ceo would have access to to all personal tabs to clear things out in case a user leaves the corp and forgets to remove items in case of role removal while items are still present at the pos the toon would be able to remove their property from their own hangars but could not place anything in equivalent to a take only permission
something i would like to see is the removal of all scienceindustry in stations in the same change allow pos owners to make some of their installations public and charge a fee equipment assembly array mobile laboratory etca change would be necessary to the way materials required for production are handled you would have to be able to store the materials in station as pos owners wont want people flying up to their arrays and putting  in from therethis change will make the hisec pos a much more important place than the place to put personal labs function it has now

i already voted no so this is just a reason for ccp not tofrom a monetary view mt seems a great prospect for ccp but as players we hate that micro transactions are bad not only for players but also for ccplets say eve has at minimum 100k subscribers i estimate at least if ccp is lucky 15 will quit if mt is introducedccp loses 225000 a month 27 million a year to implement micro transactions not everyone will buy these items most of the remaining players wonteven if people do buy aurum it is a one time purchase not a monthly purchasemt will result in a net loss for ccpfrom a buisness standpoint and gaming standpoint mt for items that give in game bonuses suck

cosmetic only 100 if ccp wishes to charge outrageous amounts of rl money for idiotic ship paintjobs or even the monocle they can idkif they start implementing any changes to the system that go outside this vanity set then i can not stand by that plex for remap is too far in my opinion and it shouldnt be allowed we do not play a f2p game where they need to bring in the mt income because its how they keep the servers up nor do i really want to have mt in place so you can fund your next projects i am playing eve because i love eve
no remove the existing ones and fire the person who came up with this ed idea
the money they save from that could replace mt revenue winwin
no  micro transactions in eve

noi used to be ok with vanity items but seeing the prices of those and the how much ccp is taking the  i say remove mt completely no vanity items we pay a subscription that should cover everything available in game
i say no to all except cosmetic only itemsi do want to say there is another post with a great suggestion regarding these items some items should be outrageously priced as they are vanity items the value of vanity items lying in the fact that only a few can afford thembut there should be more items that are affordable so all pilots can enjoy them for example the monocle should be expensive i plan to purchase one and would prefer that less than a hundred or so others had it what good is vanity if everyone has one right now its a rolls royce people are suggesting it become a hundai i say no to thatclothes however should be affordable to everyone jewlery pershaps should have a range some affordable some other unique pieces more expensive

im going to self quote here because its the best phrasing ive come up with and then go on to explain in a wall of text now that i know ccp is watching this threadi dont like the vanity items i think it introduces a completely unnecessary element to the game i actually like cq more specifically its meh in its current form but i like where its headed i want to walk in stations not because ill be doing a lot of it im a pvp nullsec player but i love scifi games and i love the idea of a completely scifi world where i could walk around my ship etc the new nex market i think thats the name of it doesnt add anything though except money to ccps wallet you really want a market for stuff like that make it player run and items are destroyed if your capsule is that would add something to the walking in stations experience imohowever even in its current form i say whatever its like i say above i may not want to pay for a bright pink fairway but if others do then so be it its a completely different story if you start talking about paying or being paid to hold sov get faction standings or store more ship fittings something that we were originally able to do i think the community has a right to be outraged by it especially when you previously told us this wouldnt happen and the players expressly said they didnt want it now you are getting some really bad press coverage over it and a lot of players say they are leaving i guess only you know if they really are with your metrics basically we told you so when we voted against all of that mt business you had a great vision for this game total scifi and player run economy im not marketing expert so i dont know how this mt business will turn out ill say it like ive said before though i dont want to go in this direction with you and it seems other players dont either with the bad press i dont think new players will want to follow either

cosmetic only dont want to deprive anyone of a chance to wear an overpriced dress
yesi do not care if a week old noob buys 200 million skill points and a titani do not care if somebody has 3 monocles in their face and a golden cowboy hati do not care if the scorpion i just killed has a different paint job than othersi do not care if people remap their attributes with every skill changewhat ever they do they will not have an advantage over me merely be up to equal within less time and does not change my game play in any way what so evera ccp with more money is an eve with morebetter hardwaredevsfeaturesfixes

cosmetic only
no
no
vanity items only please nothing else better yet no microtransactions beyond plex at all but im realistic so vanity only at least
buying a titan cuts out the titan builder in eve and effect their gameplay tremendously this is why this should only be for cosmetic stuff
no
this is assuming that theyll be able to buy a titan that was never built with ingame resources which i believe they already agreed was a bad idea when rolling back the free scorpion dealedit they want to make more money of their game which is the opposite of destroying it what ever game hurting issues arise will be dealt with and balanced change is good ccp is good props to them for sticking with this space game vision for so many years while all other competitors both lasting and fleeting have had much higher playersubscription numbers

no thats my preferencebut i guess its ok for cosmetic only because then i can tell who the douchebags are

nocosmetic could perhaps be added but it would open the door to the mostdreadfull thing a game can see coming  microtransactioni have seen to many free mmorpg going very bad with micro transaction and not protecting them from any black marketi have seen how startrek online has gone bad with micro transaction and stopped playing it the very moment they started adding ships in the marketi have seen how voyage century online has sunk into the worst nightmare of game with fully open transaction and how it got litterly highjacked by people with too much wallet and no brains  the high number of game hack and stolen accounti have seen how battlestar galactica is turning in a nightmare where you have to pay real monney to be able to compete in battles again too much wallet with no brain playersactualy the only game that has micro transaction that i support is lotrobut they are not making it a nuisance to the game and withouttrouble like pvp in every possible ways and very controlled areasmost of the players who enjoy lotro will mostly pay monthly suband enjoy the whole of the game instead of just buying it part by partim ultra feed up with 99 of the transaction ideaseve online has been the best game until now because of the very way the dev kept up withgiving good material and not letting themselves in the greedy way most of the other company had let themselves goactualy if ccp realy need a boost in money i am more than ok with a little upgrade of thesubscription i would much prefer to pay a couple dollars more each monthseven if that make 25 to 40 dollars more a year and avoid completely microtransaction in the gamebut one thing is sure the day a microtransaction is set in eve that get further than the vanity cosmeticon the incarna parts i will cancel both my annual account subscription and i will surely go furtherby asking a reimbursement from the month of the micro transaction insertion to the end of my subscription periodthey can count on thatand im not voting for my friends who plays but they are thinking like me about the microtransaction issueseve with micro transaction  no more subscription and stop playing eve

it is understandable that ccp wants the users to appreciate the new features the company as a whole was working on for the last few years it is a huge accomplishment that every single character in new eden now have the ability to move out of the pod and walk on hisher own feet for the first time in eve history however by forcing the users to abandon the previous ship spinning hangar in favor of the captains quarters ccp has already cost one of the main goals of introducing cq in the first place immersionimmersion simply put is an emotional state achieved by interacting with a virtual world that consistently makes sense immersion is a fragile emotional state that can be broken by any number of things that does not or feels like it does not make any sense the lore and events that take place within the world should coincide with previously established lore and events without stretching the logical progression events that are deemed physically impossible must be prevented from taking place at all maintaining immersion is a difficult task but it is a task ccp has performed remarkably well until nowthen what does not make sense about the cqit does not make sense for a capsuleer who is always protected by shields and armor plates even when inside a pod to willingly get reduced to an easily replacable carbon based piece of meat every time she docks up to a station to get more ammo or switch to another ship this directly contradicts ccps own stance in 2009 as shown in this fanfast footageit does not make sense for a capsuleer always submerged in ectoplasm while in space to get out of the ship in a pod open the pod jump out of the pod climb up the stairs wash out the ectoplasm and perfectly suit up in less than 5 seconds after the ship is towed to the docking bayit does not make sense for a capsuleer inside the cq clearly outside of the ship to receive a message that she cant use jump clones because she is still inside a shipall these seemingly minor issues stand out as glaring inconsistencies that hurt the immersion rendering the captains quarters as nothing more than a replacement to the previous ship spinning ship hangar and the full body avatars as nothing more than wasdcontrolled puppets something the new target player base has already encountered countless times beforethen how can this disastrous situation be salvagedmy answer basically a fourstep process1 bring the old ship spinning hangar back make this hangar the default environment when docking a ship allow jump clone usage only when user is in pod and in the ship spinning hangar2 add station service buttons that is used for enteringexiting the cq3 add a cutscene that depicts the capsuleer being ejected from the pod play the ejection cutscene when the player is entering the cq while loading the cq environment at the same time utilize preexisting art assets4 add another cutscene that depicts the capsuleer being inserted to the pod this cutscene will be played while the original station environment is being loaded and the cq resources are being offloaded edit both cutscenes can be skipped in case the user will be redirected to a loading screen that has more incharacter messages such as readjusting sensory input etc similar to the intro movie and some typos fixedonce this is done the station environment will look like thislink

agreed the current immersion makes no sense
10
why is it that ccp has so little selfconfidence they always feel they have to stuff new features down our throats instead of making them optional i certainly do want the hangar back wis might be a nice feature for some but not for me im not alone with that am i i know the game evolves etc but if ccp keeps forcing me to like their new features simply because i can not get around them then our ways will part sooner than lateri could get around that new pve content called incursion by not participating in it why cant i just toggle that buggy walking in stations expansionregards lax
1i fully support this cut scenes should be optional though makes much more sense and allows incarna to actually be immersive
1ccp please give us back ship spinning option i dont want to look at my avatar all day ships look alot nicer
indeed although eve has hardly been immersive before now with ships magidocking and the entire session change system being basically a pop up message box
1current implementation of cq aims to increase immersion and fails miserably because of this immersion breaking issue completely at odds with backstoryi could easily accept it with no cutscenes give that there are none when dockingundocking or changi
me wants
thank you everyone for your supportthe cutscenes i am proposing serve two purposes to add a reasonable time buffer during the transition between the hangar and cq and to explain how capsuleers are different from the humanoid avatars of other mmos once the user knows what it means to be a capsuleer it would be cumbersome to watch the same cutscene every time she gets into the cq so the cutscenes should be optionalin order to accomodate those who choose to skip the cutscenes the loading screen must be revamped as well the current loading message is uninspiring and out of character ie you dont load the environment when you get outside so the screen should show messages that makes sense ingame such as decontamination in process adjusting to sensory input injecting muscular stimulants and so forth add the sound of flushing out the ectoplasm and give the sound department actually some stuff to do to give some more fluff the end result will be a million times better than that obstinate loading messagei support myself as usual
i could care less about the eve lore i incarna and all mt should be restricted to wis and incarna which should have no impact on he game itselfeve and incarna are 2 differnt things one is internet space ships the other is a laggy piece of fluff that should be optional at all times
well slap me in the face with a stabber and call me a fedoa thread about cq with an actual logical and fully fledged alternative to the current messsir i applaud you for not exploding like a faulty piece of cheap nuclear xl ammuntion in the storage bay of a shuttle bravoi must support itsigned

supportedthis is a ui backslide no longer can you doubleclick for cargohold or drag and drop for ship changingive never messed with the test server before so i never know much of what to expect with the upcoming expansions i assumed that the way it would be is old station environment when you dock and you can select leave ship to allow you to go to your cq this is a major immersion problem captains dont leave a ship every time its docked if youre just dropping cargo
i like cq but i want to be in my ship while it is active i think cq should be an option when you dock with your ship in old shipview example you can select enter cq as a right click menu option

i run multiple accounts and mandatory cq is inherently flawed and just creates extra problems with no net gainwith the current setup my comp has to load cq for every toon i have or i have to stare at that stupid pic i have heard that this stupid pic option is only temporary the hanger view was removed which is annoying in and of itself and we were forced into the cq with all toons even if i want to use cq and walking in stations i should be able to choose which toon gets out of thier ship and let the others stay docked up and save my system resources does ccp think that i am going to move around station with all my toons like some pop star and his possethe old hanger screen was useful or interacting with your ship and removing it is just detrimental there is no need to have to load cq if i have to dock for ammo or to grab a missionthere is no need to have to load cq on all my toons if i am only ever going to walk around with one account at a time  forced cq is a horrible idea  give back the hanger view give a button to go to cq

signed what a trash direction they are taking eve at least they arent breaking the part of eve that is in space
since my gpu is overheating using the cq and the option disabling it didnUFFFDt allow to us the old hangar view ship spini support this thumbs up
get rid of cqs or at least give me the option to unpod which i still doubt ill want to unless im spending hours in station otherwise leave me in my ship inside the old docking bay so i can tell at a glance wtf im flying pleaseincarnas cqs run far far worse than even five year old 3d games and whats even more appalling is those five year old games look much better than cqsincarna isnt even beta quality yet and ccp is forcing it down our throats and punishing us with a bare metal wall if we dont want to load it what fantasyland are ccp living in that they think this is acceptable behaviour
 1 forced decant to grab some ammo or switch a module is beyond stupidoptional decant makes ingame sense and would make many players very much more happy especially those running multiple clients and it will not upset anybody who is excited about the
i prefer the hangar view
for now i see cq as pointless and have disabled it but now i miss seeing my shipi agree cq needs a hanger view first like pre incarna then a depod button to enter the cqin other wordssigned
so many of the problems that people have with cq is the mandatory walking in stations switch it to optional and about 90 of the winerscomplainers are happy other problems are that strip miners look tiny now and you cant really hear them and the fact that all turrets look similar all the same color schemeseriously ccp fix those three things and you have an expansion that i can supportjust to reiterate here are the three things1 make the old stationcq view optional ie you can switch between them seriously the software is already written for the old station view2 make mining lasers have sound throughout the processmake the effects similar to the old ones3 make the turrets a little different please dont give them all a dark grey color scheme give them different colors say projectile gets a brown color lasers get a golden color and hybrids get a grey color hint you can use the same models those look great just change the color schemejust to make this seem like it matters about 95 of my corporation have turned incarna off after viewing it for 510 minutes the other 5 turned it off after a half hour

good idea  or at least make aurum a different tab in the wallet i never have to click on
why would a secondary currency used for vanity items only be highlighted and made to appear more important than normal isk sort it out
supporting this and the return of the larger wallet balance numbers when you hover over the wallet

that pesky 0 aur makes reading my isk balance more difficult supported
at the very least get rid of the ridiculous turquoise i know why its that color but that doesnt make it any less obnoxious

agree
this i use a program called loot calculator that requires those files to run

supported not because i use it but because ccp doesnt care about the players just themselvesi mean on one of the topics they said they didnt like it so that was why they removed it screw the players as long they are happy right
please bring this backas far as i can see there was no reason what so ever to remove this from the game other than and obvious move to try to force players into pvp because pve had now become such a hassle i dissaprove and it has kept me from creating more accounts yes ccp you are losing money from me because of this
i would like to see the loot log brought back also
i agree this is just basic tools the game should have in it by default i dont see the need to remove it at all
i agree bring it back ccp
i am yes for these stuff

as it stands after customising your character and going to the portrait screen your character maintains the previous position lighting and background as it had previously therefore creating a new portrait is as simple as pressing done so the only real cost to this is that you have to press one more buttonthe downside to the change would be that people could buy vanity items make a new portrait with them then sell the items off but keep the portrait
its not as easy as pressing done since you have to rearrange camera zoom and tilt levelsfully supported
i laugh a bit about this i didnt see anything being discussed on the char creator being launched to change your pants with cq on the test forums yet it was one of the first things i noticedhopefully theyll fix that mirror part to let you change outfits  without having to load the char creator and take a new portrait
ive changed my portrait a bunch of times never had to move camera or change zoom levels its always exactly where i left it previously
final release on sisi forgot your pose every time howeverwhen you change your outfithairstylemakeup your char looks different whether in the same pose or notif you carefully constructed the look you wanted in your portrait why should you be forced to change it because you changed clothes in incarnait is literally like being asked to create a new passport photodrivers licence every time you got out of bed in the morning and got dressed so it showed what you were wearing today

the release on tq rememberif your such a fan of your carefully constructed appearance then why change itas i said earlier the main reason it needs to work this way is for vanity items you should not be able to keep the benefits of purchased vanity items after you have sold them
makes sense supported
i shouldnt have to change my portrait because i put a different shirt on
am i the only one who dislikes that hotkeys for example opening your wallet altw only works to acutally open it to me it would be alot more convenient and i would actually use the hotkeys if you could close the wallet with the same hotkey instead of clicking the tiny cross at the top right corner
supported would be nice
how this slipped passed me is a mystery supported
up to the top
the issue of pvp being focused more on groups of 20 players blobs depending on your definition is the current norm these groups are currently getting bigger and bigger as eves subscription base blooms i want to propose a mechanic that will make small 28 people based corp groups a reality once again i propose that all lowsec and 00 gates have capacitor this capacitor will recharge at a steady rate costing a certain amount of cap per jump possibly based on mass the higher the lowsec security the faster this cap recharges or the more cap their is 00 capacitor would be able to jump lets say 1012 people through without interruption all at once but the recharge would be fairly slow compared to lowsec systems capacitor recharge can be upgraded via the sov system by now your probably saying but khutulu how are we going to have blob fights epic 1600 man battles that sort of thing well like everything else cap can be transferred to these gates giving existing logi chains something to do while traveling making it harder to move massive amounts of people and balancing out the overpowered status of attackers in the sov game i know there are a lot of lacking details but i guarantee that promoting the kind of combat eve was founded on the concept of grabbing 48 of your buddies and getting some equal fights is going to draw in a lot more people than space barbiesfubared monocles i am aware there may be more pressing issues but a return to this kind of mentality would be a great one allowing lag to be diminished and splitting up engagement zones instead of everyone pile on the supercap bundle and unleash fire jump bridges would defiantly have to be looked at to balance them with this proposed gate mechanic change
an intriguing ideaperhaps with some fatal flaw but right now i cant think of one it seems worth investigating supported

why does everyone hate this ideait took me 21 mins to make a 16 jump destination by doing the point and click method which is good but your so busy you dont have time to do anything in transit except click the gateclick warp totarget and click the jump button rinse repeat fall asleep on auto pilot it took me 50 mins to make the same jump which is way more time than needed to cruse the forums chat in corpfleet etc check the market etc etcthats what i do on auto pilotthe real thing that gets me is on autopilot im vulnerable to even starter ships for 30 mins in that particular jump that means anyone can just gank my stuff and theres nothing i can do if one could learn to keep the time exposed down during travel time this would act as a defense for passive transit ships and increase productivity that would mean that gate campers would have to be fitted for the task and not just be there w a civilian laser and take your slow  ship out cause most shields wont last more than 052 mins max against a player characterno they would have to be fitted for it knock you out of warp and then jump you i wouldnt even mind being podded so much as long as someone had to work for it as long as i gave them a run for there money but as is its too unfair and it doesnt make sense i mean if you really had a transport ship i mean in real life wouldnt you figure out how to make your autopilot the most efficient it can be i mean time is money and are there to gank youi mean it just makes sense to have it both from a meta point of view as well as in game ps i wrote this in autopilot and im only 9 jumps in on the same run and i type  15 wpm

micro  if someone wants to pay for a pair of pants who am i to tell them no i dont care what kind of pretty new shiny they add that can be obtained by micro transactions as long as it has no ingame impact purely cosmetic eve already forces us to use multiple accounts in a way that no other mmo requires if we didnt have to have a separate account for cynos supers and normal ships i wouldnt have a problem with paying a bit more for my subscription but right now just to use the stuff i have in game requires over 40 a month thats already a rather high monthly subscription if they touch the subscription price id better see an enormous improvement in game play to go with it the higher the monthly cost gets for tools required to be in null the stronger the incentive to use bots in null becomes
microas bad as the current prices are you do not have to buy them and are given 0 zero advantage to having themyes they should be cheaperyes its absurd that a monocle in game is 80but face it if person a wants to try and be cool let him its like buying a tournament ship isnt it epeenas long as the mt are kept to incarna wis and wis is completely optional its fine the way it isno i would not pay more the 15 to play eve its hardly worth that much
yes
yes
yesyesthats 1 yes for each of my accountseditthanks for making this poll to try to give ccp some real factual numbers on community feedback
no if ccp wants to hang micro transactions over our heads as a way to charge us more subscription fees im not playing ball ill speak with my wallet and give their competitor money
no but mostly because its would stop new player from trying the game when you know the game paying more his not a big deal but most people will not try a game who overcharge
no
yes
microim fully open to paying more if needed but i would prefer to have to not i mean if people want to look pretty that can but i dont want to but if worse comes to worse yea i would pay more to play
your missing some of the replies pointyour can blows them up  agro timer  they dock and get some faction bs that your hulk will instapop againstthey undock and warp to you or their wreckyou blow upthey feel great because you feel crappysuch is life in eve
true but still the basic ida is good
a 50 chance concord will spawn and take out the stealer gets my vte no aggro and you still get to see them go poof
good one hadnt thot of that but would that work in lower sec space
you mine in lolsec where ill come over and keep you companyhe wouldnt be going after your can if its in lowsec
i dont mine in low sec i just thot that beccia had a grate idea with concord but wouldnt work in low sec sins well its low sec but for high sec i think beccias idea works beter then a bomb can unless when it blows up it would not cause agro to its oner
i like the idea it could be as simple as jettisoning an item that can be made with pi or purchased dynamite lets sayif you jettison it the dynamite it is a can that wont implode for 30min to an hour or somethingif you open it  it blows up on youif someone else opens it it blows up on thembut i like the initial idea

dont say that what if they do start giving awesome abilities and then because only people who fork over money for it can win in pvp more people buy it prompting ccp to make more gamebreakers dont even jokingly hint at nonaesthetic noble exchange stuff
how many real quality monocle could you get oh wait you wouldnt want one
when people have cybernetic optical implants is there really any point to a monacle
perfect price for decorative vanity item that is supposed to make your character look more uniqueas a bonus the high price keeps demand for vanity items down limiting their effect on the game and more importantly limiting their effect on the price of plex
a fully fit carrier or dread of your choicea faction fit t3a fully fit machariel
wtb contract one fully fit machariel with faction tank will pay one 1 monocleedit the above was meant as a joke i am not paying a monocle for anything a si am not daft enough to spend that much isk or rl money to get one
thats the beauty of eve you get to pick 
for that much the monocle had better do something like give me 7 perception so at least its not totally uselessoh wait nobody wants rmt to affect gameplay welp
you could almost buy a faction apoc model
or a faction mega having said that if youre the kind of idiot that would buy the faction mega with that terrible color scheme then youre probably exactly the kind of idiot that would buy a space monocle at the advertised price
ive bought both o painted both to pure blackpink
well if you buy your plex with isk then if you consider the exchange rate based on the testserver prices which i thought were resonable 1  3 aur per item then if 1 plex costs 390mil then 1 aur is 12580645isk per unit in the real world that is still a very expensive pair of shoes but i would be happier paying that  even at 100aur per item it is still more reasonableas many people have stated the current system is just stupid as it stands it is only open to idiots with too much isk or  i might have supported this new currency if it had stayed at the test server prices but it will be a very long time before i might consider getting anything if at all ccp would have depleted any of the excess plex better if they had lowered pricing as more people would have bought them to buy cool new stuff it is a shame as the items on the exchange on the test server were very good and would have opened up the market with a new commodity instead it will now be slow and possibly a waste of effort
their called vanity items for a reason prices are just fine as they are just right to put most of the population off of buying themthe best part if you dont want to buy vanity items then it doesnt effect you in any way shape or form
but what if we do want to buy them but dont want to spend more on a monacle than we would on a carrier or a skirt for more than the price of a faction battleship
what if i want a titan but i dont want to do whats needed to get onesimple answer i cant
if they can sell 100 monicles for 60 12000 aur they make 6000if they can sell 100000 monicles for 060 120 aur they make 60000considering each subscriber can have 3 chars per account and many have multiple accounts they can still make more real money selling for less to more people
so quite clearly their primary goal is to add unique and rare vanity items to the game and not simply to make as much cash as possible if the were just after maximum cash they would have made them cheaper
the point is that its paid dlc and as such 60 is way too much for an ingame bit of clothing that does nothing other than take up space in your virtual wardrobe 60 is the price of many a full priced game heck most of my actual clothing costs less than thatthe point of paid dlc is to raise money for the devpublisher the best way to do that is through microtransactionssell low and sell lots 60 is not a micro transaction its not far from being the price of a full game people sencible people are simply not gonna pay that and the store stagnates and ccp loose a potentially good revenue stream if they boost the plexaur conversion rate by a factor of 10 and so you get 35000 aur for one plex that would put the monicle at 6 and that nice skirt for 18 which is much more realistic and will generate many more sales and more revenue than leaving the convertion rate at 13500 at 6 and 18 that is cheap enough for people to not care about the purchace and buy more than they normally would at 60 and 18 people are gonna laugh and walk awayseriously someone at ccp has either lost the plot big time or is having a joke
there in lies the problem if they are cheap enough that people would not care about the purchace and buy more you have a lot more people who will be willing to buy plex with isk to convert to aurem that would cause the value of plex to go through the roof and deflate the value of isk screwing up the rest of the games economyif you look at the in game economic ramifications of the aurum prices this is the smartest move ccp could make
another part of the problem is that there just isnt anything in the damned store so it has to cost a lot or people will get bored of it very rapidly i am hoping perhaps in vain that once more content makes it into the store either the prices will drop or the exchange rate will adjust or perhaps a combination of bothas it is right now ccp has made two fundamental mistakes1 they released the store without enough items to support continuous interest and long term purchases and 2 the items they did include are priced so high that most people will walk away thus cutting off some of the interest they would have generated even accounting for number 1as it is im not about to spend that much money rl or virtual on cool factor id much rather buy a dozen hurricanes to pew pew
they are called vanity items for a reason they cost money  dont really do anything for youits not like youre being forced to buy it or anything
hi id like to propose a few new related items for the incarna backlogthey are related to the hangarfirstly i used to be able to drag a ship from the ships window into the hangar to make it active now the only way seems to be to use the rightclick menu is it possible to restore similar functionality to what we had beforesecondly it would be really cool if once a new ship is made active for the old one to be moved out of view and the new active one to move into view currently they just fade out and the new one fades in im sure there wont be any timing issues since you have to wait for the session timer anyway after changing shipsthirdly i cant spin the ship can we have it just spin slowly automatically is like to see all sides of itlastly there is a pod at the bottom of the stairs but there is an invisible wall blocking me from walking down invisible walls are just bad design also id like to see the pod up close why not put the undock button down stairs
i must apologize it seems the ships do spin just very slowlycan we make it a bit faster
so its been about 48 hours since the release of incarna and heres what im seeing i used to play eve and still play on my laptop system along with my custom built desktop when incursion came out i could no longer use my laptop for dual boxing now that incarna is operational i can no longer use my laptop at all as the video card crashes i know of a fair number of other people who have this issue now as well not being able to navigate in the captains quarters open bps or smoothly move through different windows that used to be effortless or the game just plain locks up the thing that bothers me the most is that all this stuff is not needed to play the game if i had my way id disable the captains quarters you may not be having trouble now but remember that this is just the first base layer of code being added as the incarna expansion is fleshed out more people are going to have problems with this as more layers of code are added it will begin to seriously interfere with game play and to what benefit is it eventually the only two choices will be to quit playing eve or buildbuy new hardware or complete systemsso who benefits from this nvidia intel ccp technology partners yeah it looks really cool if you havent been touched yet but thats all just window dressing and i dont need anymore social interaction if i was looking for that id be on facebook retchi came to eve to play internet spaceships not walk around in a virtual static environment that i could just as well get with the simms i like the new turrets and im sure there will be other positives that will make their demands on computing power but will lend themselves to the core focus of the game so far this isnt one of them and i for one am not happy about it

in the wake of prolifieration of supercaps and the obsolete dreads i have figured out an idea to fix the issue capital smartbombs15km radius900 damage of whatever damage type20 second cycle timesiege module will give bonuses to smartbombs100 bonus to radius625 bonus to smartbomb damagethis will require capital energy pulse weapons skill that requires energy pulse weapons to level 5 in order to train and will reduce cycle time by 5 each level energy pulse weapons skill will not affect capital smartbombsthis weapon will give the aoe weapon that eve needs in replacement of the doomsday change supercarriers will have a more difficult time destroying dreadnoughts but dreads will mostly likely not be able to destroy a supercarrier when only fit for using smartbombsdreadnoughts will have a role in managing blobs while keeping the ability to destroy structures when refitted
 no this game was even worse with aoe doomsdays lets not go back to that era ever again
thats great but i wasnt quoting you now was i 
it doesnt matter tbh logic is logic if its correct logic than it all points to the same resultsconclusions
how about some constructive suggestions regarding captains quartersrollback
constructivelower the graphical quality by 50 and use the dev and art effort saved on the maniacal detail to do the following  if youre going for immersion give us bars stores the whole nine yards not some day now  support lots of characters at the same time in one place this is more important than anything else jita should be a riot of people all the time  loud crowded inconvenient if its technically unfeasible then abandon incarna  eve voice for ambient sound in public spaces silence in station is just as ridiculous as sounds in space
i dont think run is necessary but i do think the walking speed should be increased slightlycustomisable screens
all valid all good
my post was constructiveit clearly stated what i would like to see and what i would not like to see concerning captains quarters as well as further interstation development im not really sure why people are so excited about removing eve from space and bringing it into a station as of yet i have found the load time upon docking completely inconvenient if there is going to be this awful loading time then i think ccp needs to consider removing the countdown timer to get into another ship as it stands right now it takes me twice as long to load into a station than it used to and i still have to wait for the timer which effectively doubles the time it takes to switch from one ship to another
i mostly support the opa couple notes my cyclone should not look half the size of my chimera likewise my hawk shouldnt appear tallergive us a jump function  i so want to jump onto my couch from the raised platform behind itallow me to law down on the bedmake hanger view have other random ships off in the background for example a minnie station might have a few rifters canes a bs or two and a fenrir in the background various races will have racial equivalents  presumably from the various traderspilots docked in station change the pi screen to be more customizable for example i would like if it listed time till completion on my planets a list of who else is docked in station and maybe a scrolling list of my ship inventory  just a thought
im really liking cq as well great job ccpthe op hit a lot of things that came to my mindit would be nice if the apartments were a little larger and a control inside them that you could turn the lights up or down with when im walking around i would like it to be lighter or if im messing around with displays then it would be a little darker also to maximize my area of view i started minimizing the station service window coming out of the character customization window it always goes back to the default settings if you have a window minimized i wish the client would remember that also as the op mentioned having a first person view would be greaton the main tv screen in cq you should be able to switch channels rather than waiting for the transition for the agent finder tablet on the desk make that multipurpose include people  places email and contracts as well the science window should also be incorporated with the pi screen the new corporation search window is very nice it would be welcome to see the same thing for alliances looking to recruiti know a few others spoke about it but id like to have my avatar picture and current likeness separated if you just want to change clothes you should have the option of just saving your new look and leaving without updating the portrait a lot of time is wasted in the transition when you dock i certainly dont have an apartment at every station i dock at ill often dock just to pick up drop off an item or to swap out ships i think when you dock you should go to the old hangar view then in the right click menu indicate you want to enter cq i think this would make a lot of people happy it could bring back ship spinning and if someone doesnt want to experience cq then have the old environment insteadthe balcony view is real cool but im all alone amarr stations have the small transportation vehicle traffic in the back ground and so often a vehicle buzzes your ship id like to see some type of activity in all the stations random ships docked in the hangar with you maybe a maintenance team working on a ship in the background someone loading unloading a freighter also the singing in amarr stations should go away hangars should sound like what you would expect and have so ambient sounds in the backgroundi dont know if it was the intent of the expansion to do away with the warp effect or if its a glitch in the expansion but id like it backthats it off the top of my head thanks again
1 give us the option to stop the ship from spinning outside the docking ramp better yet bring the ship closer and let us zoom out further so we can really see how big that ship is compared to our little bodies like in ambulation video from 20072 more clothing options that dont cost a fortune again note how in ambulation video you saw cloth options based on cultural lines like the amarr and caldari etc3 streamline how you control your avatar so we can use the qwes keys to move them around easily
this was what i was hoping to see when i docked after years of development we have a broom closet that requires more clicking to do everything we used to do i have high hopes for incarna im just worried that there wont be any iteration for it like many of the other cool concepts that have been introduced and never touched againships should have a gangplankwalkway coming from near the player out to the ship if only to give perspectivefrom the backstory stuff and my general memory of scifi moviesgamestv i expected an attendant to be standing there when i exit the ship maybe a hologram of aura someone i can right click on and access different menus quickly reducing my time commitment for accomplishing tasks like an assistant
whilst i wouldnt necessarily disagree with the 5 min siege cycle being reasonable i wouldnt call a massive reduction in scan resolution and tracking whilst being immobile almost no drawbackimho scan res and especially tracking need to be tweaked especially tracking so you dont get speedtanked by supercarriers
simple solutionsupers must seige to launcher fighter bombers 10 minute timer
remove supercarriers give back motherships
bump for more input  support this is a serious issue that devalues everything a legitimate eula abiding player does in eve a simple google search for eve bot produces an extensive list of suppliers seeking to destroy the game eve bot macro suite tiny miner roid ripper npc hunter stealth miner evebot etcccp must have the capability to infiltrate these botting programs to analyse their footprint in the ccp server logs then perform a raw data pull using the footprint asa filter to catch out offenders a quick investigation of each case should then highlight if botting has occurred ie players that never log out out or that perform tasks endlessly in same click patterns or that manage 20 trades with perfect precision for hours on end etc hold ccp accountable for shutting down rmt support this topic please
the trouble isnt finding them and banning them its how getting rid of all of them will affect the market if you take out all of the botters who just mine all day you lose those cheap minerals and with that demand will rise with no supply rifters will cost 20 mil and drakes will be over 100 mil
total bsif mineral prices were that high ppl would actually go out for mining instead of running missionsbtw ccp should introduce new high end ore with plenty of trit etc
thats pretty wishful thinking i highly doubt a few thousand people will start mining 237 just because mineral prices go up sure more people will start because of potential profit but it wont make up for the loss however a new mineral with high yields isnt a terrible idea for a potential fix
it would bring balance back to the game in the form of decreasing the huge construction projects due to financial constraints ie supers a small increase in the price of tritanium is a much bigger deal with those than with a battleship edit support
where is our powerful railguns roman
the main screen is by far the best feature in incarna which doesnt say much about the contents of this particular expansion having to stare at a still picture because captains quarter needs twice the resources used by the old client is arguably the worstloading up the main screen on top of the background picture would go a long way towards making logging in for a quick chat checking mails or simply keeping eve running in case something interesting happens more enjoyable than it is currently right now being in a station simply makes me wonder why im logging in at all
until recently there were three major exploits affecting riskreward ratio in pve1 unscannable setups2 stealth bomberanyothershipwithcloak l5 farming3 distance control vs npcs using leash1st method was based on the broken scanning mechanics which allowed you to be invulnerable to scan thus ignoring anyones attempts to probe you down and kill which is major safety benefit in lowsec and 00 was fixed in recent patch by placing hard cap on scan size scanstrsigrad ratio which now cannot be lower 112nd method was based on npcs which didnt aggress you when you decloaked within their awareness radius they aggressed you when you aggressed them though while it triggered aggression from npc ships npc turrets eithet stayed calm at all or 1 of them would start attacking you and its not a problem at all if one cruise missile sentry attacks stealth bomber absence of additional neutingdps from sentries made level 5 farming cakewalk in absolute majority of the cases also ive seen other guys using cloak to avoid sentry aggro on other ships  like ishtar was fixed by forcing npcs to aggress anyone who decloaked in their awareness radius3rd method is based by pulling npcs from their originating location to enough distance so they start to return fly some distance back then notice that youre attacking them try to engage you again hit max engage distance wall rinse repeat this method is usable in multiple cases but primary broken area  dreadnought wh c6 farming while sieged dreadnoughts cant move they have attack range long enough too keep npcs on a leash use something to pull sleepers away from anomaly make spot for dreadnoughts siege enjoy your farm safe from any npc damageneuts and yes it wasnt fixedim not telling how it can be fixed although i have few ideas im just telling that its one of the exploits which makes farming easy even for single person with several accounts as c6 sites are intended to be run in wellorganized group like incursion sites such approach to farming enables more people to run them with less characters and less real people reducing income of real corps specialized on thisif you know more exploits which affect income balancing  feel free to share
if they make incarna a whole new game then that would mean even more of your money would be spent on it than now either way your money is being spent on incarna incarna and spaceships are run by the same company or had you forgotten
complain complain complain
your money is being spent on dust coming soon to playstation
to the opstfu and gtfo of eve if you dont like it quit ing and whining about ccp improving the game to entice more people to play your ignorance in the matter is astounding shut your face and play or gtfo adapt or diethat garbage is what keeps eve from falling behind all the other mmos out there if you dont think sothen as i statedyou are simply ignorant to the issue the normies as you call them are actually the people that enjoy things like incarna youare the minorityrage post
hahaha bieber fever lol you fail
why talk like that are you trying to say that my money isnt really mine
they are not improving it  just add eyecandies for lesser pplhow does this keep eve from falling behing this is an adult space mmo or supposed to be atm it has no competitors other than some dumbed down arcade shooti shootisthis only make is similar to other mmosgood luck to compete with 305year other mmos now i bet no eve player will see them as alternatives check out star trek online it has both space and land battles  huge fan base and still failed hard i bet subs are less than 50kjust check out the mmo marketthere is wow and 23 mostly asian crap others with good subs then there is the forgotten rest do you realy want eve to just be like thoseoh and btw why eve needs more subs anyway  current numbers should be more than enoughimho incarna is a byproduct of dust anyway
you gave your money to ccp its no longer your money its their money and they can spend it how they see fiteve is not just a spaceship game from the very beginning ccp has talked about eve as a full scifi simulator they started out with the spaceship part and now they are adding more this is what eve was always intended to be
there fixed it for yah if you dont understand how this whole incarna thing works then im really sorry for you and frankly surprised you can even play eve1 the incarna graphics engine is not being designed for eve its being designed for world of darkness you know that other mmo that ccp is working on the one that they are probably being payed large sums of money by white wolf to develop yeah thats right someone else is paying them to develop the engine were not paying for it they didnt have to give it to us but they are accept the gift and stop ing2 sure you dont care about barbies in space thats fine alot of people dont and your entitled too your opinion on that but heres the thing alot of us do care about it and on top of that this will help bring alot more exposure and players to the game and do you really think that none of these second life in space players are going to start flying around hell even if its as simple as getting from station a to station b because thats where their friends are roleplaying that day its still another pilot in space lets be conservative with our estimates here and say 90 of the people who want that garbage never undock or play with the space aspect of it and lets say that this new system brings in 5000 new players a rather small estimate in my opinion that still means 500 new pilots in space and 500 more people for your bitter ass to shoot attldr shut up harden up and get on with it this is something were getting for free that can only help the game out in the long run if you dont like the new station mechanics dont use them if even thats not enough then leave
but you gotta admit its a fancy pancy shirt eh but yeah seriously id rather buy the shirt for real for that price instead of virtual

i liked watching those live feeds of random places in eve jita undock a sleeper site in wh space chribbas veldnaught during fanfest some of them were quite pleasant even the ones where there was nothing happening
did the csm get told about the price range ccp was looking at for vanity itemsits not the price as much as thinking thye didnt have to tell us that bothers meand more so if they didnt tellthe csmseriously someone from csm tell me they were told so i can gain a little bit of sanity back
the csm was not told anything about the price range check the blogs of trebor and seleene
becouse the csm has not done sohere are the links to the csm blogs published so far
actually many of us have posted in the various threads here on eveo as well as on fhc or kugu we dont currently have any sort of official response as we are still talking to each other and ccp
it makes me wonder if ccp is intentionally spiralling eve into the nearest public toilet the aur store prices are insane and thats been discussed to death i understand that people consider eve a hobby  i do  and will pay a little out of proportion for things but when you get down to it why would i drop 70 for plex to buy a monacle when i could turn it into isk and either make more isk or more fun and im someone as seleene says about herself that can more than afford to do it that puts me probably better off than most eve players and i still wont fall for this crap it boggles my mind how ccp thought this was a good idea we already have plex that are directly convertable into isk you can then use that isk to buy ships or whatever else you might as well just sell the objects in isk but then it would be ridiculously obvious that the prices make no sense so ccp why not do this make more ships and modules make those have to be manufactured people will do it and they will sell them on the market with more variety the volume of the market will increase industrialists will be in higher demand as there are now more things to produce with all their little quirks people also have a tendency to buy things and keep them in their hangers how many millions in ships do you have hanging around that youve forgotten about so this would strangely actually be an isk sink of sortsthe only thing that i can figure regarding the aur and nex system is that they thought that they were going to pull thousands of plex out of the economy therefore increasing the isk cost of a plex and therefore increasing the number of people who convert gtcs to plex and sell themseriously ccp just admit defeat roll back this crap a few days after deployment and raise the subscription rate 1 a month
hey ive only had game a month and id quit personally the game is all about learning you learn what to put on your bship to counter what if you can only upgrade statically fit guns then that would pigeonhole alot of ships into certain roles and would make even more ships useless because always once pigeonholed one ship will do better in that tactic then another and will always be chosen
there will certainly be issues of metagaming but the reality is that they cant pick and choose who will be affected by certain regional developments that is they cant pick which gates affect which players and having such a system in effect will force players to carefully decide on which options benefit them bestif you divide the reagions into smaller segments such as constellations as proposed that will split the vote up further creating an environment where people either collaborate better or suffer perhaps this can be gauged on the economic and traffic performance of the region  if it invites more players andor creates a more vibrant economy in that area they get an incarna clothing item  mayorial top hat as their golden watch for the success of their term in shaping eve if they perform poorly they cant wear shoes since theres coal inside of them i dont think people want to be stuck as shoeless joes roaming around their eve closeti like that people are warming up to the idea and i think that with the next expansion this idea could really gain traction lets keep it up everypony
i agree with akitathat said the incarna concept is not what is the most demoralizing part of this patch for me its the presence of microtransactions and even more so the plans of selling ships etc directly that was in the newsletter

crazy idea but hear me throughchange the 510 variant ores to 2550 for 00 ores 33100 for lowsec ores and 100200 for high sec oreswhat this means before mineral price changes come into effect that will be discussed laterin high sec players still can expect about 100 iskm3 for their ores no significant changes the 510 variants are gonein low sec the high sec ores will be present but in a 100 increased yield variety as well as the low sec ores in a 33 increased yield varietythe high sec ores present will yield about 200 iskm3 and the low sec ores currently about 150iskm3 will be 33 higher or 200 iskm3 as well add some risk double your iskin 00 the high sec ores are present in a 200 increased yield variety the low sec ores in a 100 increased yield variety and the current 00 ores are increased by 50 this will mean that high sec ores will be about 300 iskm3 low sec ores about 300 iskm3 and 00 ores average at 200 iskm3 the balance issue of spodumain and dark ochre is a whole new problem will get a 50 buff to 300 iskm3obviously some ore redistribution issues would need to be addressed but this will help with nullsec independence because nullsec miners will mine lowend minerals id be willing to bet that its not the zydrinemegacyte thats being shipped from jita to 00 its the tritsome problems this will create however is an abundance of lowend minerals in high sec as the market demand will drop dropping prices with it a solution to this is to increase the mineral demand from ammunition especially battleship and smaller ammunition reason being ammunition would soak up more of the lowend minerals and leave the high end minerals alone and increase the overall highsec mineral demand to partially compensate for the 00 exportsfurthermore the idea of owning a 00 system for a smaller industrial alliance would be significantly more attractive given the massive increase 3x in profits possible encouraging more smaller players in 00 even if it is not a very low truesec system the 00 environment will be more desirablesince i deal mostly in t1capital ship production i cant speak for the t2 modules and related issues in terms of logistics but a few more manufacturing lines perhaps 12 additional lines for every station would be almost necessary to compensate for the increased industrial activity in 00 perhaps also an opportunity to have datacores uploaded to wherever you happen to be located instead of only at the agents base that could help t2 production in 00 and reduce jita dependence as it is now either you go to jita for the t2 module or for the stuff to invent the mod and the materials to build it both need to be accessible in 00 to make things practical
dunnu if this is too old but i would like to see centralized storage putting the right items in each factory is a time consuming pita
hangar divisions in smas simple change that goes a long way toward preventing ship theft in wspacemore control over security there is effectively only one role that can be used to give players extra access to modules at your pos above full corp access this is the starbase fuel tech and it also allows access to your fuel bay which might not be what you want lets have some more roles that can be assigned to module security settings so directors have better control over who can do whatalliance dropbox the cha settings are horrid when it comes to setting up a space for sharing items at the alliance level last week i had to click a stupid warning dialog 50 times while dropping minerals from gscs into my orca into a cha belonging to another corp in the alliancerepackaging at a pos my orca can hold nearly 50 gscs if im in a station i can just drag them all to the station hangar repackage and stack at a pos i have to access each one at a time to get to the contents enough to drive me insane

cosmetic onlyi believe in give and get ccp is a company and obviously wants to perk up that bottom line with this mt stuff and there are people in game that want it and will buy because they can more importantly for ccp it will bring in more potential subscribers for the long haul ccp getsnow ccp needs to give give us all the damn fixes in the game weve been wanting for a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time now and preferably before the end of this year at that
cosmetic onlyactually cosmetic as in does not mattered i shall be if i hear more about buying sp or standings with this

no no noso csm how does it feel to know that when ccp said you lot are nothing more than pr in a recent blog it was for this exact reasoni was really ed off but was marginalised and laughed at now its come to haunt you lot now you are nothing more than pawns through which ccp will legitimise everything i will never vote in any csm election again but will support this you want to be relevant refuse to go to meet ccp you are achieving absolutely nothing anyway other than seeing corporate secrets which will totally ruin the gameccp can go die in a fire now they are destroying the game once we start down the road of mt there will be no end and it will end in tragedy as its hardly ever done right
notheres nothing wrong with cosmetics in themselves but theyre a slippery slope its easy to see that ccp is treating the introduction of cosmetic items as a way of getting the playerbase used to paying  for ingame stuff in the same way as plex has been lets not allow this to continue because eventually they will monetize our social acceptance in eve

cosmetic onlyi dont mind the idea of cosmetic only either you want to spend cash on it or youve earned enough isk to treat yourself to something frivolousadding anything advantageous through rmt ruins the entire appeal of eve for me we work hard to get our stuff and someone worked hard to make it that is what made it special
no

cosmetic onlyi dont really care if people want to play space barbie it has no effect on my gameplay other than to provide another channel for trade profitpay to play or pay to win schemes are spawn of satan
cosmetic only if you must have themthe second they introduce something that gives any kind of game advantage then ccp has lost me as a paying customer
noi am not comfortable with any form of microtransactions in eve online currently it is a pay to play subscriptionbased game and if the subscriptions are insufficient then the ccp management either needs to scale back its investment in non eve activities or raise the subscription fee i want to see cosmetic stuff avatar dress up manufactured by players for players in respect to the current sandbox economic environment

cosmetic onlyif ccp wants to make some money off of cosmetic stuff only that is fine by me i dont care how my character looks but if others wish to pay to look pretty let ccp make a bit of profit off that for all i care anything other than cosmetics however is unacceptable to me i refuse to pay for advantages in game and i refuse to play a game where you can buy advantages in the game with money

too late the day the sold the first plex that idea went out the window
nowhile a reasonable argument could be made for cosmetic only its really just a slippery slope to pay to win
nothe cosmetic stuff so far is bad enough but i can just choose to ignore that becuase the vanity items dont give the player any advantage however the day i see an item in the aur store that gives any actual combat advantage is the day i quit playing eve i have come to really enjoy the game universe i get to experience in this game the reason that eve has been around so long and has been a source of so much enjoyment the player base the initial reason that i was drawn to play eve was that it is as far as im concerned the only real player driven mmo out there introducing microtransactions to eve will absolutely ruin it changing the dynamic from player driven to plex driven and when that happens it will be a very sad day
no i would have been ok with cosmetic only changes but the internal newsletter thing shows that this is only the beginning only way to be sure is to nuke mt from orbit now that and an apology for lying to the csm

no i do not want micro transactions seems like your trying to get as much money as possible from your existing subs doing that could end up costing subs im already not happy about the cosmetic ones but i can deal with it i recently came back to eve to check out the new changes and start playing again but after hearing about microtransactions and the direction you guys seem to be heading in im starting to think i should have just stayed away
no
nomt has no place in eve
no
seriously noccp you can either be p2p or f2p with micro transactions  you cannot have it both ways
no
no no and no
no
nooo
 thisso my vote is no
no
nono microtransactions i believe they are a great way to retire an mmo once its beyond development  but theres no place for it in eve stick it in dust but dont muddy the economy in eve which has been a major staple in providing the game with its community of experts and appeali was going to type more but this really isnt the place and there have been far more eloquent responses to this issue whichc i prefer ccp to read to my drivel
no
no
cosmetic onlyand purely cosmeticvanity shipsetc via mt with new appearance are ok if they require the normal ship or whatever as part of the payment maintaining the craftingeconomy swg did away with decay killing the crafting and destroying the entire economy generating ships without components mining etc will lead to that
no
no however cosmetic only if priceses were much lower no way is is posable to say ud spend more on some shoes or a shirt than a battle ship

vote no  you think that because you pay a set fee each month that you should have access to all the options and features in game that everyone else getsyeah that should go without saying that if i am paying eves 15 per month fee i shouldnt have to pay real money for anything else in game except the plex as a way to get more isk for cash
no
noi do not want any microtransactions in eveif they insist that there must be mt then they better damn keep them cosmetic or ill fly my ass over to their office and drop kick each and every one of those lying scumbags in the face

cosmetic onlyi view cosmetic micro transactions like hats in tf2 its more like a donationi think using plexes to pay for them is actually a good idea because you can buy a plex with isk or money but only if the things for sale are nonpractical thingslike hats
no
no
nocategorically no
no
no
no
no
no
hell no
noi want to say cosmetic only but it really is a missed opportunity if they go that route new clothing or vanity items could actually be something created by the player via planetary interaction or industry creating a whole new profession so to speak instead they are rolling out with having you purchase a plex with real money and exchanging that at a ludicrous exchange rate for clothes while true this way will make ccp more money the other way adds another layer of depth to the deepest and most complex in a good way mmo there is
cosmetici understand you want to run a business but you can not control the botrmt in this game which give people an edge over others next you want to give people the another avenue to pay their way to over their peersvanity items are one thing

cosmetic onlycosmetic microtransactions are fine ship colors tattoos clothes hell mounts to drive around the station are fine sparkle trails for ships animations whatever just not creating items that affect game play or altering stats sp etc
we pay lot of money over many years to let you grow ccp and now thats your way to say thanks to the old onesno no no

honestly my thoughts on this can go ether way but more likely im a middle man hereit would be nice to have unique mid tech shipsmods like faction ships within the noble market but those dont give much of the socalled godmod idea of ships rather its just something different normally a slight advantagelike the differnce between a faction tempest and a normal tempest its not too large to be game breaking but it can be felt depending on what you do with themfor me the idea of having shipsmods within the nex isnt that huge an issue that players need to band against eachother and the game they love rather you should suggest ways it work out well for everyone ccp needs money to make this game great but pure vanity items for costs that would normally be used to get actual things in game that are of real use ie ships mods rigs etchonestly if this idea from ccp is done right it could work out well but if they dont ether no one will buy anything or it could destory the eve market as we know it though the pure idea of buying aur with rl money alone already is here you just buy a plex and convert it would also be nice to see the ablitiy to outright by aur with cash too rather then needing to buy a plex all the time just to get it
noand also no to wis and the whole concept wth is it with ccp
no
i vote nooooooooooooooooooooooo as well
no
no for the love of god nowhy the hell do we pay for full accounts if we have to pay more to get actual full accountsif they go through with this ccp can have their internet spaceships back i wont be needing them
cosmetic onlyi really dont mind if some herpderp wants to spend his real money on a monocle but if hes using that money to get advantages over a player who has given their time and hard work and subscription fees to ccp for years hell no
cosmetic only
no no no no no no nono mt thats final i think its clear what the customer thinks and i know for sure that i wont be playing eve any longer if they go though with this preposterous idea

first off i could care less if ccp sells vanity items you know what let the monocicle be 150 bucks doesnt bother me in the least but that leaked memo suggested that there would be elite ammo sold on the store as well as ships and other functional things this is a game breaker the whole awesomeness of eve is that everything is player made or player earned not simply traded for 1495 if they turn this game into a pay2win its over for me i will cancel all of my accounts and wave goodbye keep the vanity stuff hell i might buy some when it matriculates into the normal market if ccp is that brokeadd more value to the game attract mroe peoplehell use microtransfers to support dust as there wont be a sub model but leave eve alone allus

no i do not agree with it
this account speaks for following projectswwwspacepoteuwwwevetradepilotprotcwwwevemetricscomwwwevecasinowsand we say no
nountil i saw the nex market i would have been in favour you seem to have completely missed the word micro in micro transctions  this is completly ill conceived please pull it and if you still think mt are the way to go after the widespread reaction please come back next year with a well thought out proposal on sisi and have two way discussion with players first
noa few months ago i would have said cosmetic only but ccp has demonstrated they arent going to be held down by their own word on that so it is in my humble opinion a trust issue now i think that if mt is allowed to continue at any level there will inevitably come a time when uberships are available for cash only i was wrong before but now i dont tink the players have a say anymore its donesubscription to log inrl cash to buy spaceships and ammopretend insuranceeditplease visit your user settings to reenable images

nothing too belligerent just the option to check out my sexy hangar from time to timealso aforementioned skippable canned cutscene to cover up the captains quarters loading screen would be nicesupported

spoken like a true capsuleer 1
1ccp should not shove new content down players throats i wasnt forced to enter a wormhole or join an incursion and i shouldnt be forced leave my pod the players should want to get out of the pod and into the incarnia environment if i can be diplo
the old hanger is good in that it is much less lag or slowness of performance currently the barbies in space makes my game run slow so being in a ship is much less laggythis becomes more of a problem when you have multiple account running and one of them is in station if it could be turned off or not turned on on chars it would give better performance when doing important stuff on multiple accountsmaybe have it default that you are inside your pod and the camera hovers around it until you hit the enter captains quarters button
although the recent turn of events is discomforting i continue to hope that ccp will listen to the voice of reason and make things make sense the users including myself care for the game and keep writing on forums to show that otherwise they would just quit and buy more beer with the subscription feejohn turbefield was his name go forth and let it be known

do you really want to have to wait and watch while your large breasted female avatar has to take a shower to wash off the ectoplasm every single time you dock oh wait
definately a yes
agreed a perfectly sound comprimise whilst theyre at it fix the damn avatars in cq shadows are projected where a light source is present the textures look like im made of clay when wearing a jacket your arm magically apears through the sleeve and to top it off i walk like ive a pole stuck up my arse i like cq i like the potential it brings i just dont like the fact its not fit to have been released in its current state
incarna was a great idea just not for eve it doesnt fit with the whole ethos of the game and has ruined the game imho as the intro says we are gods gods shouldnt have to walk around to do common tasks a large part of your player base is not at all happy with the changes you made a large part of your player base cannot play the game anymore this is not a in line development this is a change to the game that in no way improves the game play its merely a gimmick that at best is a attempt to draw in more casual players and a worst a change to a more world of warcraft type of game
wolf i just hope you are wrong about what u sad anyway i belong to the people who have to buy a new laptop for sth i dont want incarna i was playing eve perfectly with nice grafics argh whatever wrong topic1nm
supported in memory of faction war
ah back from vacation and look at all that i have missedokay lets break it down logicallytrue character transfers can be abused but surely you cannot use the fact that there is an existing loophole as a justification for adding a new exploitable loophole thats as silly as saying that deadbolts can be lockpicked so might as well not lock your door at all zzzzzokay so lets examine these exploitable loopholes it see if they really are all comparible as the proponents of this thread seem to take as an assumed factreputational leaking exploits1 simplest of all just open a new accountalt presto chango all the your identity is sum total of your actions arguments evaporate pros clean slate scotch freecons you have to start a new character no standings no skillsmay cost you a new account 15 a month or free if just an alt2 buy a farmed toon pros clean slatecons may not have exactly the skills you need may not have the standings that you have may have a stupid name that makes sense only in chinese also getting one that custom suits you may take time for that custom farmer to make one takes a lot of time costs you 30 to transfer plus more to pay the farmer real 3 name changepros almost a clean slate will avoid most casual neg standings even with a mail out to all people who have them as contacts only those who really hate you will notice and even then those with many reds in their contact list will not notice a random new red with a strange name showing up once again people who think they will notice have not played long enough to have a contacts list 2 pages long with over 30 redscons a one time cost of 50  not sure if that was decided what it should costso i leave you to decide if we need yet another potential reputation leak and whether the pros outweigh the consi dont follow the whole we are going to be walking around in station therefore need new names argument its not like the names are going to be hanging over our heads in a glowing label ala the sims maybe you can elaborate in this need some more
quick reply tell me if i missed a vital success anyone short of who you really hate doesnt really matter do they i mean if you cant be bothered to take an extra step for them odds are you wont even remember their exact name at warpin anyway this is why the notes section will most likely have to transfer as wella list of 30 reds is the same as a list of 30 names in terms of unmanageability harsh words but name changing provides a regulated alternative that is definative progress pass i dont see that argument as adding anything but pathos but if you want me to argue on their behalf ill give it a try later its fridayyeah i dont plan on deciding anything i see this as a practice in feasibility and quality control my personal views differ
yes
yesi must say im particularly irked by this usability improvements are nice but the font in use was terrible years ago obviously and surely theres something better im not a developer but how hard can it possibly be to implement a new font these days
would love some more font options
oh god yes this so much 
signedgive me my hangar and ship spinning back please

i agree it wouldnt be hard to add an option to undock from ship into station would use alot less resources that way
signedoption to use old hangar or cq
want to spin right round
you spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round round  round
signedi agree to this i disabled cq and i dont wanna see just a wall pls give the option to use the old station feature ship spin screen
signed
woot im totaly for that make it optional either old station view or cq
this should have been from the beginning that wayso im totaly for this
make it optional and change the static view no station environment to show the ship and the same ui as we had earlier ie cq hangar or static
i love your pic
needs even more support
pls ccp give us back our beloved ship hangar and the option entering cq or not
signed
hmm there is an option in esc menu to not load the cq environment  whats up with you people
this is a petition thread why dont you take your bald head and cut it off with your thin man member
wow i didnt even know there was an embarrassing cluelessness skillbook congrats for training it to level 51 on petition
ccp make incarna optional i dont care for the silly image of the doorway to the corridor either want my ship spinning hangar back
signedalso find out whats causing the graphics card  cpu to overheat  i cant dualbox anymore without fearing that my freaking laptop will melt down
1make it optional at least untill its walking in stations and not walking in a tin caneveryone in my corp seems to have turned of cq  theres a reason ccp
signedwhy would i get out of my ship while it is being rearmed plus i cant run multiple accounts anymore so unsubbed the alts
making nonessential visual enhancements optional should be a case of good reasoning thus secondedthe doh edit let us simple as it is toggle between cq and the hangar view preincarna ccp should then collect the stats on who actually uses cq that percentage will be very small promised
pr disaster is starting to look like an understatement
give us back ship spinning and the old hangar with the option to enter the captains quarters and the rest of the station enviroment do away with this stty wallpaper business
1 for ship spinning
signed for optional disembarkcq is a tremendous letdown on every possible level please please fix this crap i want my shortcuts and my graphics card horsepower back
im unsubed over this two accounts
supporti dont necessarily need shipspinning back but removing an already builtin feature to diable cq for no reason other than ccps vanity is a slap in the face of paying customerscancelled my account over the fact the announcement to force cq on us wasnt taken back in todays devblog and will discontinue another paid for with plex

what i want is an option to attach a contact to another so if i remove that contact i will have the option to remove all contacts related to it also i would like the feature integrated into the application process that person can add his or her alt to it automaticaly giving you the option to set the alts standings to the corp while you are accepting the application i feel corpalliance managers need more time to play the game than to be spending time trying to figure out who is whored teufel
in hindsight i wish a waited to post this i hope it doesnt get overshadowed by the whole incarna debacle
interesting idea but for those who actually like blobstyle pvp roams not me by the way it would make their experience a bit tediousalternative when a gate is activated more than 5 times in 30 seconds an automatic alert is transmitted on some publicly visible channel big blobs could still move around freely but their location would be broadcast to everyone nearby small gangs of 5 or less would therefore have an advantage of surprise
i would tend to think that the result of this would be less roaming gangs and more camps i fully support your wish to find a way to encourage people to get out in a 68 man gang and go looking for the  but this could have just the opposite effect
one disadvantage would be that a huge blob can camp a gate and you lack the ability to bring in a bigger blob to deal with it this gives campers a numbers advantage that cant easily be mitigated and time delays would give them all the warning they need to know that a blob is coming after themi like the idea of discouraging blob warfare though we need more thoughts like this
noive gotten 100 kills in 2 days in 00 with 58 dudes while fighting a force of 4050 guys from an alliance of thousands in their home systemsif you want small gang pvp its out there the trick to small gang pvp was never fair fights it was learning to exploit the other guys weaknesses and still get kills no matter how many people he brought while not dying yourself
trinity made ships pretty incarna made turrets pretty made missiles prettyi for one am tired of watching blobs of light appear in the center of a ship traveling towards a target blindly going through whatever side of the ship happens to be in the way and the rubberbanding at the end doesnt seem very spaceaged eitheri have read dozens of threads and hundreds of posts over the years of how to fix missiles with all sorts of different ideas with some showing promise and others just sounding terrible or unrealistic nearly all of them would seem to require serious coding and testing and reworking on ccps behalf i dont know which method would be the prettiest or easiest to create and implementthus im not proposing any specific idea in how to update missile only to say that something should be done to make missiles look as nice as turrets do to show ccp that enough people care about this so they can give this the attention it deserves
i agree with jack you spend all that time to give us legs and yet you do nothing with launchers i am going to throw a wtf in here
i had a made a proposal on this a few months backimprove missile graphicplease use it as it is established and larger i also bumped it for your convenience if you have any ideas to add to it by all means please do it was written in the context of fighterbombers which at the time were causing massive lag and had been recently fixed with the advent of new turrets it has been announced missiles are on the slatebut keep supporting to push it higher up
no need to bring this up againsource
was that posted after this turret revamp or the previous turret revamp after which ccp also said missiles would soon follow
please reply with support to this statement i think this in large part sums up the frustration with ccp and incarna by giving your support to this poast you increase the impact of its words quoteoriginally by jade constantinesure when you have been playing eve as long as we have you learn to take the rough with the smooth but you do so with the general feeling that ccp developers understand and get what makes eve great  and thats the problem now this internal newsletter if real shows that one of the leading developers does not get eve does not care about eve and simply sees eve as a cash cow to be milked ferociously to fund other projects this is about keeping the golden goose of eve subscriptions on a drip feed if necessary while chasing and grubbing every little loose cent he can from the player base let me give you a couple of examples of how this can and does and has already impacted our enjoyment of this game 1 the captains quarters  its not gameplay its a display cabinet for vanity items and the price of this display cabinet for you and i is that multiclient performance in stations is now terrible  if you have a bad graphic card its a jerk fest  if you have a decent graphics card its heatfest i can run 34 clients with cqs turned on  i can run it smoothly  but do i want to hell no because my gtx 580 sounds like its melting my motherboard now so i need to turn off the cqs on multiple accounts and as a result have more limited functionality on those accounts and an ugly wallpaper no more station environment no more clicking on my ship to open cargo hold no more dragging ship to the hanger to board it the delivery of the cq vanity item display case has impacted my gameplay ccp could have made it optional and given us the option of keeping the old hanger view and added a disembark ship option to the ui but oh no to do that would have meant we werent being forced to look the vanity display case that marketing insisted must be front and centre if were to even think about buying these ridiculously overpriced items from the noble store2 if you read the newsletter youll see reference to saved fitting slots  and i dont know about you verone but in jf weve run out of saved corp ship fittings we want ccp to up the limit but is that really going to happen while the bizdevs talk honeyed words about how to squeeze extra income from players for such minor upgrades how long till we pay aurum for extra corp standing slots for wardec options for a usable corp management screen3 and who develops these vanity items yes thats right its eve artists and developers whose salary we pay with our subscriptions given the choice wouldnt you rather have engine trails and flashy cyno effect for all players rather than a bunch of overpriced tat in the aur store for a fleeced few because that is precisely the compromise being made here  ccp using our subs money to pay for vanity item production they want to sell back to us for greedy prices and it is something you should get mad aboutso heres the thing the time to fight for the game we love is not in six months time when these concepts have bedded down and ccp is feeling bold enough to start selling noble faction ammo and 9 implants the time to fight is now because this newsletter embodies everything that many of us feared but didnt want to believe ccp were becoming capable of it is a massive betrayal of the compact we shared as players and developers of this game and indicates that ccp is preparing to leap down a very dark and deep path of selfimmolation in the months to come i dont want to see eve online die verone that sounds dramatic i know but gameworlds die when the dreams and visions are extinguished and that can happen through a succession of bad ideas foisted on a community by people who really dont have much of a clue in business this is exactly what the problem is
support
everyone in eve should be ed off ccp has now shown its hand and it looks like dog  with that said i do think the incarna concept is cool but when the game is already broken with no hope in sight that past features will be fixed why dump so many resources into it the mts is a slippery slope to stand on and eve skipped the slipping part and jumped right off the cliff because you are right why spend time on making poss more functional or hybrids worth fitting on a ship that could improve a customers experiance when you can spend it on a fancy gold ring that will bring in the real thingas for me personally i will be leaving eve when my subs run out i have never bought into the whole virtual vaniety thing and that is clearly where eve is heading
i think its actually immersion breaking to have to leave your pod every time you come to the station also the performance of the cq is actually quite painful
amen brother
dear mannyim gonna support this but i am never ever going to forgive you for making me agree with something that jade long winded as hell and partially ed constantine saidedit supported but manny is going to suffer for it
supported
10
i was sceptical but this is very well worded
right on this is exactly where eve is heading instead of expanding the player base with more smart practical playable useful features ccp has created a platform for sucking money out of the existing playerbase compromising performance and the vision of the game while masquerading as an expansion which we should all appreciatethis is actually setting the stage as the original poster mentioned for 9 implants and uber guns for sale this will inevitably lead to the destruction of eve as we know and love it i think we should call a boycott for aur and all things plex except game time of coursethis bears direct relevance to the topic about ccp quality vs qty and other issues
10
this in every particulargive him hell grath
when the player base starts getting behind jade as their heroic spokesman you know you got it wrong ccp
actually hesitated in supporting this due to the source never thought to use it as an excuse for a personal vendetta  good call and full support
supported fully most importantly the rl money for awesome ingame advantage bit needs to be made sure to never happen
well they already have rl money for in game advantagethe advantage is that your isk is only limited by how much usdeuro you gotrealistically speaking
first off i agree that spending x amount of time and resources on such a large thing as captains quarters was perhaps was not such a good idea when there are other things in the game that need attention  things that players have been asking to get fixed ie pos corp management etcon the other hand i do understand why theyve done it at all  ccp has said before that their ultimate goal is to make eve the ultimate online sci fi experience ie more than just a spaceship game this new expansion is just a step towards that goal but yes just to iterate they really need to focus more and players needs and having my client crash with multiple accounts open is very frustratingsecond thingin regards to the vanity items  correct me if im wrongbut i feel the big fear were all having is that whenif they introduce items like 9 implants and other items that will actually give your character an advantage over other players the game will in fact mean that players will be forced to spend more money in order to stay at the top etc this would be very bad and would in fact certify the comments as mentioned in other replies to the op that theyre just trying to milk the cowhowever at this stage they are just vanity items  if you check the dictionary for the meaning of the word vanity1 the state or quality of being vain excessive pride or conceit 2 ostentation occasioned by ambition or pride 3 an instance of being vain or something about which one is vain 4 the state or quality of being valueless futile or unreal 5 something that is worthless or uselessmy understanding from this is that vanity items dont and wont in future either increaseenhance your characters abilities  ie you wont need to buy them to compete with others ie theyre not an issue if people want to waste their money on little fashion accessories then good for them it doesnt affect me at all it doesnt affect you either  and if it means that ccp can get a little extra money for all their hard work in providing eve to us theyve given us many expansion over the years and theyve all been free then great they deserve it game developers work long and hard hours and their pay is generally quite poorso until ccp introduces character enhancing items or any kind of item that gives a player some kind of advantage in which case they wouldnt be called vanity items there is no reason to complain unless youre just wanted to troll and you dont like people earning money they damn well deservefinal notesi agree captains quarters shouldve been a lesser priority to that of other items that players actually care about it is ridiculous that we cant run multiple clients at the same time now and the comment about having the option to turn it off is a good one our gameplay has serisouly been affectedbut i see no problem with vanity items so long as it doesnt lead to more microtransactions that will enhance playercharacter abilitiesadvantage or whatevercheers
it doesnt take much for the avalanche to start
the cq is basically beta testing walking in stations for multiple characters and taking eve beyond the spaceship to another level of immersion this is something that has been talked about a lot and generates a lot of excitement among the player base except apparently among bitter vets who run 9 clients at a time and complain when their performance slowsthe nice thing about the vanity items is they are stupid and you dont have to buy themand this may be a huge shocker but ccp is a company it does have to make money to provide eve for us and its employees expect to be paid i dont see why ccps attempts to make money is a reason for us to get mad some people will buy those vanity items good for them i wont be as for the rest of the charges speculating about 9 implants and noble faction ammo doesnt do anyone any good because its not based on facts
apologies if you dont want your real name used kris id prefer to use your ccp name but it wasnt brought up in the article also no hard feelings im sure youre a great guy and a hard worker and while i disagree with your decision to push mt in the direction it is currently going i have nothing but gratitude for your hard work on behalf of the community over the years im sure this sentiment is shared by all players who will voice an opinion in this thread yea or nay unfortunately weve all read the newsletter and as youre the driving force behind something that has enraged players and caused riots in game that have shut down jita well the question has to be asked so should the csm ask kris to resignnote i will not be voting either way i dont want to take a stand on the issue i just want to ask the question id like to be able to buy stuff and that means getting the riots to stop
yes he should be asked to resign from his current position i dont think it would be necessary for him to leave ccp entirely just get him out of game design as he obviously cant be trusted with it
yes mt is a bad idea and heads shuld roll 
he should go to dust or that other game they are working on do your mt over there not in eve
it is beyond me why people like yourself always makes a post about fireing peopledo you lack power in your real life or whats going on herethere has probably been way way worse ideas on the table at ccps that you dont know of  from people who in the end made features you are endlessly happy for you sir tell me that you would have fired them it would put a sudden stop to the idea making at ccp if you get fired for making a bad onei feel bad for you  sorry for the gramma and all im dead tired 
well i think that might be a little drastic mt for now are completely cosmetic and its for the idiots who want to spend money on them im not ed about that im ed at the fact they havent even attempted to fix the major problems with the game theyre just ignoring huge faults to bring us station walking i feel like i got slapped in the face by all the money ive spent on eve over the years
no and this thread should be locked
i dont want to cheat ppl that cheat like that should have there accounts shutdownif i wanted to cheat id decompile the ui in python and edit the 12 lines of code in the autopilotexyou know i see a lot of not supported for what reason type something or is the extent of your conversational skills dude no way
to confirm yes this is what im talking about
i for some reason do not like giant frigates that are not in line with the other ship types i know the original build had everything to scale and i enjoyed it the camera drone idea is for the ship spinner people i also thought it would help those that want to zoom in on the frigates so really the only new work i hope would be a zoom in option and returning it to scale is this doable
no to paying moreno to rmtmicrotransactions if its purely cosmeticif it changes the game in any way shape or form to give someone else the advantage over someone else scrap it
noi dont want vanity items and the day i have to pay more for garbage i dont want i will gladly find something else to do
micro micromicromicromicroif we want to count accounts see above for another of my accounts
microyou can already pay cash and get all the items in this game you can even buy a character with maxed out skills i dont see why everyone is so illogical about this mt issue
noi pay enough as it is if ccp wants more money then they shall cut down on their alcohol consumption from what i always hear about fanfest does there seem to be a lot of alcohol involved which is supposedly very expensive in icelandso how about saving some money instead of trying to get more in through vanity items saving money is the reasonable way to go those 600 employees cannot release a single patch where they do not mess up some ships bonuses in some way with each patch do we get extended downtimes that add up more and more the quality is getting worse and the bill is supposed to go upno no nobe reasonable they need to sort it out not us
yesif the need is explained coherently
notheres no reason to
micro with a caveat purely cosmetic and not for plex make aurum a currency you can buy with cashyou get the same subscription fee id pay to any other mmo no special treatment to prevent doing something you havent done for the last 8 years anyways it goes up i pay with plex until i cant afford the plex which would be fast considering an increased subscription fee would skyrocket plex prices then i unsub
yes with the caveat that a higher sub price will make me expect more in the way of content2 weeks ago i would say micro because i never imagined ccp would consider introducing gameaffecting items but now unfortunately i see that vanity items are just a starting point and as such they are a starting point that cannot be allowedits a shame because properly done microtransactions could be both a great revenue stream and unobtrusive almost every player in this game would pay for a ship paint job how cool would corp bomber jackets be corp uniforms but as of now i dont trust ccp with scissors
yes
no1 ccp are spending a major chunk of eve subscription revenue on developing dust and wod 2 the policy of rolling out new buggy content in eve is already a source of annoyance whilst ignoring older mechanics that are critial to gameplay 3 eve is designed so that many players need multiple accounts as a result its already one of the most expensive mmos on the market why should subscribers voluntarily pay more revenue to ccp that will not be used to improve eve they dont appear to be listening to the csm or the playerbase they iterate on crap that the players dont want all this proposal does is throw money at a problem that cannot be fixed until ccp change their agenda
micro cosmeticonly
yes account 1yes account 2obviously the standards of ccps updates and community service would be higher to accompany this higher subscription fee
yes
no
noi would say yes but im changing my mind eve is a great game and could get more subscribers if ccp fixed incarna to be what the players want if you build it they will come we the players will tell our friends and love this game forever and always as long as we feel satisfied with what ccp has produced the reason i left wow was because of the care ccp directed to its players not shown in other mmos currently i am beginning to doubt ccps ability to provide what we want and it doesnt have to do with how much money i give them
microonly if the microtransaction market is completely optional to the player base  to participate in it or not that is the question i personally prefer not toi didnt come to eve to pretty up an unrealistic virtual persona of myself  if i wanted to do that id go create a second life
this image i slapped together in response to the damage control post in the general forums review the bottom of page 62 for the description is a valid way to please all sides of the war on cq this couldnt take a week or two to implement with the resources available what say you
i say i love it youve got my vote
cool got mine too
a very elegant solution i support the proposal 100
indeed
yeah thats not bad actually  though tbh id rather it wasnt assumed we would disembark from our ships every time we dock more importantly this intermediate mode must not be the resource hog cq currently issupported
no dice sorry but no
open your fittings window spin ship right click on ship and open cargodrone bay toodone
no to what the idea of compromising on incarna one way or the other or just the idea itself
gameplaywise this would be acceptable but against the backstory its still lacking
this would not solve the all the art assets loading or the immersion breaking aspects that a disembark button could
start two fires with one post you know youd buy one too

well since you already take money for vanity items here are some suggestions on stuff i would really pay money forfirst i want the old jump effect for caps back that was just awesome whilst the new one just plain sucks that would be kind of pricelesssecond caps were way to small not counting the titan they have to be scaled drastically like twice or even three times their size they have right nowi think there were quite some others out there that would pay for that stuff too
supporting my own proposal of course
agreed its absolutely ridiculous to have this sort of walking when modern wasd controls are pretty well standardized sure were not talking twitch gaming here but we still need it to be functional
1also given that we stand up when we push the walk forward key while sitting on the sofa itd be awesome if the behavior would also work in reverse  when you stand in front of the sofa and walk into one of the seat cushions or nodes or whatever 
csm are our representatives to ccp itt my understanding that the dev blog that was shown was previewed by the csm and the response was are you fracking kidding me and ccp didnt budge and jsut went with it anyways the dev blog was a joke i respectfully ask the csm if they share the same opinions on the micro transaction as the masses that aur does not go beyond vanity items to take action the best way it can write a letter sign it deliver it to ccp and resignmy 02isk
ccp lost its way long ago they throw out one token patch to show they listen to the players after getting called out hard core on the 18 months debacle then they throw out this patch which is an insult to everyonebased on the awful graphics in station and the clunky behavior of walking and camera angles and adjustments its pretty obvious it wasnt ready but they had nothing else to offer i cant even figure out why in the character creator my toons look awesome and in station they look like morbid old hags and depressed beat up meni said this in our alliance  thread its like ccp doesnt have editors for their designs i wish so much theyd hire me to go look at their proposed plans and actually edit them so that they dont welp constantly if they do have editors fire them bc its obvious they arent doing their jobs if its not them then its their management whos fubar not giving the editors the right to tell someone their work is  and do it overccp needs to realize that the game has at least 15 major issues in 00 along with 100 minor ones they dont even address the 15 major ones til players are happy and were shocked and awed when they finally hit one of the minor onesseriously how do you guys go about setting an agenda i dont get how you guys prioritize patch work over there because its like you avoid anything thats relevantid be happy with the station stuff if it were part of a bigger patch but tossing this out without any significant fixes to 00 all the while telling us its 6 more months til we can hope for some relevant fixes to supers sov and other 00 fiascos and not even touching the other major problems more than likely is not a way to keep customers aroundi mean ffs dudes we told you supers would be a problem the moment seleenes ed ass announced it we told you exactly what the problem would be you didnt listen then and now you act totally ignorant of the problem that came trueshort of dreads no capital ship has any balance or role in this game carriers are a joke and have been a fiasco since launch scmoms have been an even bigger blunder bc theyre carriers on steriods but not really bc they cost too much so we have to give them more overpowered  titans are just everything that would make dreads overpowered if they werent balanced while tossing on 40x more hp and oh yeah a 1 shot kill weapon that every game ever invented knows is a failed ideabombers are a jokefleet warping in blobs is a fiascodrones are out of control fix it balance items that have no logic to their implementation on 90 of the ships in gamedictor bubbles last to long hictor bubbles dont stay up long enough and are too big for a movable bubblepos have every flaw possible for what they aresov stuctures are a joke in every fashionsov warfare is even more of a joketheres no balance between ship sizesclasses anymoretheres no sense of racestheres no reason to do mixed racial fleets its either all amarr all matar or all caldari missile spamming gotrywtf minmatar guns on almost every bs cause of a balance changewtf hybridsrange warfare really means between 40 and 90wtf probingwtf warping on gridwtf command  titan bonuses sitting in towers wo a risk in the worldwtf super cap bouncing aka go back to actually implementing formation warpswtf desynces were fixed oh waitwtf bottingwtf standings and standings changes blobs became bigger as a result of bluing being a 1 15minute change away and temp blueing omg even worsehow is it the only way to have fun in 00 is to become a nomad non space holding alliances sitting in an unconquerable station with jump clones and bridges to escape system when camped all the while destroying the space people hold while avoiding the horrible nature of sov warfare and making more money doing itand more
originally by jade constantinesure when you have been playing eve as long as we have you learn to take the rough with the smooth but you do so with the general feeling that ccp developers understand and get what makes eve great  and thats the problem now this internal newsletter if real shows that one of the leading developers does not get eve does not care about eve and simply sees eve as a cash cow to be milked ferociously to fund other projects this is about keeping the golden goose of eve subscriptions on a drip feed if necessary while chasing and grubbing every little loose cent he can from the player baselet me give you a couple of examples of how this can and does and has already impacted our enjoyment of this game1 the captains quarters  its not gameplay its a display cabinet for vanity items and the price of this display cabinet for you and i is that multiclient performance in stations is now terrible  if you have a bad graphic card its a jerk fest  if you have a decent graphics card its heatfest i can run 34 clients with cqs turned on  i can run it smoothly  but do i want to hell no because my gtx 580 sounds like its melting my motherboard now so i need to turn off the cqs on multiple accounts and as a result have more limited functionality on those accounts and an ugly wallpaper no more station environment no more clicking on my ship to open cargo hold no more dragging ship to the hanger to board it the delivery of the cq vanity item display case has impacted my gameplayccp could have made it optional and given us the option of keeping the old hanger view and added a disembark ship option to the ui but oh no to do that would have meant we werent being forced to look the vanity display case that marketing insisted must be front and centre if were to even think about buying these ridiculously overpriced items from the noble store2 if you read the newsletter youll see reference to saved fitting slots  and i dont know about you verone but in jf weve run out of saved corp ship fittings we want ccp to up the limit but is that really going to happen while the bizdevs talk honeyed words about how to squeeze extra income from players for such minor upgrades how long till we pay aurum for extra corp standing slots for wardec options for a usable corp management screen3 and who develops these vanity items yes thats right its eve artists and developers whose salary we pay with our subscriptions given the choice wouldnt you rather have engine trails and flashy cyno effect for all players rather than a bunch of overpriced tat in the aur store for a fleeced fewbecause that is precisely the compromise being made here  ccp using our subs money to pay for vanity item production they want to sell back to us for greedy prices and it is something you should get mad aboutso heres the thingthe time to fight for the game we love is not in six months time when these concepts have bedded down and ccp is feeling bold enough to start selling noble faction ammo and 9 implants the time to fight is now because this newsletter embodies everything that many of us feared but didnt want to believe ccp were becoming capable of it is a massive betrayal of the compact we shared as players and developers of this game and indicates that ccp is preparing to leap down a very dark and deep path of selfimmolation in the months to comei dont want to see eve online die verone that sounds dramatic i know but gameworlds die when the dreams and visions are extinguished and that can happen through a succession of bad ideas foisted on a community by people who really dont have much of a clue in business

now that the coalition of cluster s doesnt have the biggest supertitan fleet supers are op but they werent for the past 2 years uh huhoh now that your ty alliance doesnt hold space all of 0 is broken huh maybe you should have spoken up when csm vuk lao told us he didnt see any reason to push for a change in 0 sov mechanics because it would hamper his rmt empire i mean his alliance
really go research the post history of yaay luckyduck and im down nope never ever tried to get 00 fixes evarpl dev alts logging in to act like s once more
why are you so angrydid you  lost space  lost super  lost sense of reallity  lost fleets  lost blues  lost history  lost mind  all of the above
how about you tards add some content instead of just saying noi know its yaay and all and even i only agree with about 10 of what he ever posts but at least read more than just alliance ticker and reply with more than just brainless drivel
my comments in bold
again my comments in boldthis is how you make a post lol no and u mad are not content or appropriate replies unless the op is a completely drooling idiot
just to add 2c about some of the stupidity that is incarnai found myself needing to rearm yesterday so docked up and wanted to transfer ammo even that is now trickier the only way to access my ships cargo bay was through the ship list and right clicking on the bay why because the stupid incarna engine left my character stuck on the gangplank and would not recognise walk commandswhy force incarna it makes sense that people will dock reload change ships etc without ever exiting their pods not that they will always exit the pod while docked and the simple way to solve the propblem have a new button below the undock that lets you exit your pod into incarna that way those that enjoy the incarna experiance can and those that are busy with eve are not interruptedincarna is not a bad concept but it should be a expansion to the game and optional not a forced mechanic that ruins it it is the worst patchexpansion in eve that i have ever experianced
but he is
i guess you are too so mad you cant even think to reply with anything somehow winning made you more bitter somehow
good points op but you are only listing thy sypmtoms or sickness and not defining the root cause i usually stick to trolling on these forums as they are not a place for any reasonable discussion due to so many hopelessly immature pubbies hi pl posting here but ill do one exception and will tell you where i see the problem and only because of respect towars the love for eve my fellow rawrrians haveccp has serious lack of corporate maturity they have no clue what they have created which has been proven over past years starting with entire devs play this game and feed their alliance memebers with exclusive ingame items through lets change things we do not understand for the sake of change without consulting player base ending it with scrum implementation in their development teams most people here have no clue what scrum so this is directed to ccp management i have worked as consultant in 4 different companies over the last 6 years that implemented scrum it did not work it does not work if your fundamentals are bad it is not a silver bullet if your company is crappy it will stay crappy even after you hide it under scrum rug you should lynch whoever sold you the idea of scrum but again this is just a symptom of your lack of knowledge on what you have in your hands and saying that others are crappier then you like sony will not make you look any better one more sign towards scrum phails club is detoriation of quality and i think it is evident that eve has not bee properly tested in years nowbottom line is that ccp is acting as a group of 14 year old kids who came up with brilliant algorithmic trading app that could smoke global derivative markets but they keep using it to fix prices of bubble gums at local candy storehaving said all this i need to point out that eve is going down no matter what there is no saving it as in my opinion it has crossed the noreturnpoint 2 years ago and it is in constant decline i have not glanced at the code maybe i should consult some of me rmting slavic cousins for this as they seem to have access to it but judging by the state and complexity of the game im pretty sure that technical debt is huge and beyond repair and only a full rewrite can help here from that side resources to rewrite is are being used to add walking in stations overpriced monocles and mirrors for us to admire our avatars instead think of eve as a house of cards where each new card is piled on top it will collapse once you add to many cards as foundations can not be changed due great complexitybut it is not all that bad i give eve another 2 maybe 3 years before it starts going swg path and starts housing only hard core fanbois and rest of the population moves on there is also something positive about it as there will be no lag caused by huge battles as there will be no one to fight them you reap what you saw and ccp has not handles the sawing part very well lately so they deserve what is comingnow if i may ask my fellow aliance mate to keep serious discussion to rawr forums in the future as smackoad is not a place to share intelligent thoughtsps i predict at leats 3 umad posts by 9 year olds whos parrents dont lock their home pcs when they go to work after mine and at least 20 people who will google scrum after reading my post
its all about priorities you can prioritize enhancing your product thus giving your customers value for their money and you can prioritize revenue increasing featuresyou fail when you replace and with or and to be honest for us regular joes it looks like thats exactly what youve gone and doneshame i quite enjoyed this game
as for the poor graphics in cq for toon models  give them a break its v10im sure if they turned on the full render engine then all those whiners that complain about incarna being too intense for their laptops will have a cow im certain the graphics will be updated once the larger part of the player base gets new graphics cards as for why it looks great in the character generator and horrible in the cq take a computer graphics class 
stopped reading and considered the entire post a joke
obvious troll is obvious
ive always said you dont need to change bombers to fix the problem with bombing the problem is more alligned to fleet warping and bridging causing fleets to blob in rediculously compact format that just screams bomb the living  out of me before ive even loaded fleet formation warping fixes bombing wo touching bombers and achieves the ultimate goal for why bombers were implemented which is focused fire range dictation but ccp has not touched fleet warping for 7 years of promised remarks while bombers have seen three iterations so for lack of better fleet warping mehcanics bombers are indeed problematicbut you show the typical thoughtless remark rather than research or looking at outside the very small box
welli dont know about all this internal ccp stuff but i logged in a few back after i had to reinstall the entire game after the client wouldnt patch and the repairtool actually broke the client i checked my mail checked my skill training chatted somewhat in corp chat and was online for about 10 minutes and after all that time the station was still loading soooooo while many 3d game developers manage to get load times for 3d maps for games under 30 seconds ccp cant manage it under 10 minutes for just one room that is pretty epic failand for those vanity items if i want to spend real life cash in a space game for items i just use that money to get me a tough upgraded line in battlestar galactica online which i did btw not gonna pay for stupid vanity itemsrollback seems a reasonable way to go as far as i am concerned i like ship spinning and i want it back
apart from your epic rant all that really stood out here wasthere are votes up at the top of the forum for mt incarna and ccp overall direction most of which actually propose a solution and discuss the issues in some detail your post here is basically a tirade take it back to your alliance forums tbh wtf are you crying about temp bluing for or blob warfare ive never heard more spam your corps spam your alliances we need numbers from anyone as much as nc fcs seriously get your head out of your arse
not even cosmetic we should be mining silk to make those hats in game noccp harden up and realize this game is not for the masses its for us hard core mofos who actually want to micromanage every aspect of our virtual existence not casual lamers who work during the day for usd so they can pwn with all the pay for buffs that they can afford
good news everybody ccp has announced their plans to release a special can just for minersit will be called a secure cargo container accessible by only those with the password can robbers can no longer steal your goods i have the prototype blueprints to deposit in to select systems and can offer personal orders of 50mil isk a can these cans will never expire and most importantly only people with the password can access the can now who sets the password you might ask yourself well you do thats the beauty of it you drop the can and you set the password you are the only spacefaring pilot who knows the password to your can unless of course you share your password with other people miners rejoicetldroh look its this thread again
thats ridiculous if it was 100 even 50 nobody would bother trying to steal your loot how much is ore worth anyhow not as much as a ship im surewhich i guess is what you want nobody stealing your cans but then i must ask why havent you used secure containers achieves the same thing
then if your afraid to loos your ship dont  like you said ther not worth the ship right or grow a pair and take a risk 50 chans to loos your ship isnt that the idea of the game take a risk go to low sec go an a misson go rat go mine or risk allmost nothing and steel cans dont take it personal im not trying to  off anyone but im thinking you dont play eve because its essay and safe you go on missions low sec mining rating that i know those all have some kind of challenge so y not steeling
nonaesthetic game changing items you can buy in game with real money would be totally destructive to eve
its not the act of afk cloaking but the harvesting of the sweet sweet tears that comes afterwards oh and the expensive loot that you collect from destroyed faction fit ratting ships
forget the cost in isk i could feed myself for a couple of days on the amount it costs in  or pay 13 of my weekly rent
pointless discussionif you think its beyond your price point then exercise your god given capitalist right to protest it by not buying it otherwise hold your peacei wonder if vanity items are cloned when you get podded if not that could be the biggest loss in isk if you get podded wearing your vanity gear or maybe you only put them on in station and interbus sends them magically to where ever you go
econ 101 failhaving aur as a plex sink will not have a linear relationship to plex prices as people buy more plex to get aur it all depends on whether people use real usd to buy plex which will result in lower plex prices or if they use their isk to buy plex which will increase plex prices i hardly think that people stock up on plex i think it is bought and used or put on the market immediately its a brilliant plan as it allows ccp to indirectly control the value of plex by setting the prices of aur items of course they also have to come up with items that people may actually want to buyas for the prices in the nobility exchange no doubt ccp needs to test out the market to see what kind of flow they can generate its the noble exchange meant to be a nice isk and plex sink for rich fat cats if you cant afford the monocle thats because you are too poor to
i dont see the problem here ccp will no doubt release more items as they start getting data on who in the community is willing to buy what and at what price you cant expect them to start the prices low thereby saturating the market with luxury vanity goods uhhh thereby making them no longer luxury goods i mean you think lv bags really cost 900 to make no its because you are paying for exclusivity complaining that you cannot afford them is like a complaining you cant afford that birkin bag at any rate my point is that this is in no way a fail for ccp if they find that people dont buy much at the current price point then they will release the next batch of vanity goods for less to test out the waters at a new price point its not like it costs them anything to run the store like in real life so its not a mistake at all but sound business practice and its not like just because you didnt like the goods for sale now you will be turned off about the store and never check back i bet you next release when they advertise the next batch of new goods like quafe or kaalakiota tee shirts etc you will all go clamoring back to the store to check them out
silly ccp why break this window it is terrible now revert to old window pleaseloading the icons is terrible and takes up tons of space
hello ccpi want to know what happened to the drone ai my drones are suddenly doing whatever they want to do regardless of my commands they dont attack in a group anymore and they dont attack who i tell them to theyre also suddenly affected by the destruction of the damsel in distress stationwhat in the world is going on this patch was eye candy but it seems to have pooched a lot of the mechanics of the game dont get me wrong im all for wis if it gets you more subscribers but not at the cost of the game ive come to know and loveplease fix the mechanics and restore my love for the game
move all external effect modules to high slots sense they do apply negative effect to a target
yep no reason why all of these things shouldnt already be in this incarna patchccp just showing us how much they care about the level of excellence that they want to display and put into their latest upgrades to the game
you can already buy characters and all the items with money you just convert the plex to isk first i dont see the change as long as the items can be sold on the market for isk nothing will change
macro mining is not for me butyou should never regulate against something if you cannot enforce the regulation we all know of chars or alts that do it its here and you cant reverse technology ccps punitive holidays dont seem to be a deterent so how about this proposalaremove concord protection for macro miners  let them continue but at greater risk of losing their ships and illicit gainsbmake the roid belts spawn less often miners will have to travel further to find them possibly to places they wouldnt normally go and corporations will monitor and defend their local systems more closelyeve is a dogeatdog universe a little vigilante action wouldnt be out of place
this microtransactions bullt had gone too far this is obvious that csm still have not enough power to stop this madness but what can we do about it cancelling subscription is too extreme at this point forum whining is something ccp seems used too and immune what we still can influence at  is ignorance of those features we are not agree with so here is the deal  if you are alliance or corportion leader you have a new way to fill your corp wallet let those guys with monocles in their pictures pay for good fine them 3bil if you see them wearing that aurum stuff
sign up for the party d
kids this is what will happen to you when youve been in csm for too long
in his defense it is a mindwarping experience

im ix and i approve of this messageif i still played the game id charge per aur something like 1 billion per 10000 aur
i dont understand the hate towards microtransactionsi do agree that they are stupid however they are voluntary cpp will probably make some money off of this but that isnt a problem because someone chose to pay that price for a monacle
this is a communication desaster mt are not a problem i am not even sure that micro vs macro really is a problem  with high prices dreyjo can be sure that economy will not be screwed up by high volumes of items circulating all the sudden but the fearless leak is and the worries that theres truth behind it and i believe the csm have enough credibility at ccp and with the community so it is worth they try and fix it i am really worried when reading what seleene wrote about his experiences from working at ccp  it has grown into a big company of people doing their job  and fairly well so  but being fully disconnected from the veteran player maybe even from the average player i also believe that eve has shaped ccp to what it is and it is a profitable enterprise by the veteran players i also agree with meissas position in his blogi understand ccp is currently laying the ground work for a much larger game universe i appreciate that and i am willing to watch them build it but they are so failing in communicating the intermediate steps giving that terrible still pic when opting out of cq is a communication desaster the technological shortcomings are then only the spark to the oil barrel
im with you i plan on wearing no monocle or fancy pantsand using isk that would be spent on that toward fitting the right ship to accomplish my end goal taking over the universewhich i think might be the goal of us allreally folks instead of getting worked up over this lets get back to playing the game if you want microtransactions to fail in game dont participate ccps going to make decisions based on market trends just like we do when we decide what to bring to jita to sell and what to grind up to make things that sell in jita were not going to waste our time trucking named survey scanners to market when we can grind them up for the mins to make some ammo then swap those rounds with lp to get faction ammo to sell its supply and demand if we dont demand theyll stop supplyingand about cq yeah its a little bit of a let down and the novelty wore off for me in about 89 seconds but people have been asking about walking in stations for years and now weve got it well kind ofi think the integration with dust and possibly an expansion of wis will add a layer of complexity to the game in the interim ill continue to fly a virtual spaceship for relaxation and socialization with people
we will get the notes this coming week i hope hang in there yall i know i busted your chops on the notes taking so long but the general forum is rediculas cant wait
were concerned that ccp isnt coming to us with specifics relating to the deployment of content for example we knew about a lot of the content that was coming with incarna and we responded positively to it and truthfully anyone would have given the fine fancy and downright cool things we saw we had positive energy and a positive feeling about the incoming products shown to us however we werent told specifics about things like pricing or exactly how powerful your gaming system would need to be to run incarna or what sort of graphics card factory settings might interact poorly with incarnabut with regards to we viewed the content positively that positive energy we displayed has at times been misremembered we were excited about things that we didnt have specific details about and ccp remembered we were excited and then tied in the csm also likes this with their ideas and so if the idea goes down in flames we go down with it see the golden scorpionbut this also sort of provides us with a sticky situation in the sense that the current csm and csms in previous history were ok with the idea of cosmetic microtransactions so long as they were just that cosmetic the reason the csm was ok with it was because the community in general expressed that they too were fine with microtransactions so long as they were cosmetic and nothing else in fact im now confused about what were all supposed to be angry about specifically are we angry about the price of the monacle are we angry that ccp has added cosmetic microtransactions are we angry about the fearless newsletter or is it all of these thingsrealistically the current available items in the nex do not change the way you or i play eve i think the monacle is too expensive i dont need the monacle to be able to play eve the monacle does not make me a better pilot i do not need the monacle therefore i am not concerned about the price of the monacle id really love to hear someone say they need the monacle and thats why theyre outraged either way these are my opinions and do not necessarily reflect those of my fellow candidates 
actually somebody put up a vote with over 1000 participants and after the counting was done 75 of the voters were against any form of mt 20  said vanity only and 5 said they were ok with mti think slightly corporateythings like those stepby stepintroductions are just a way to get further and further to the point of no returnfrom there on out it is grab as much cash as you can and can get away with it is just sadseeing ccp going that routecommunication is the real problem here not the item store nor the monoclewe are way beyond thatand communication had been a problem ever since but you can see their form of iterating on it firsthand they had to install the csm but they gag it with nda or keep silent about vital info so what is the point of it if they do not know more or cant say more than a devblogas to the parley the request for it must come from somebody who actually is in a high enough position to negotiate for hisher partypoor showing from ccp to throw ccp pannor is it pawn in front of the mobto gain some timea year ago we were told by ccp shadow there would be no mt in evebut probably in dustor wodliesthe 99 gate was the slap in the face of the heroes of the community that mostly provided their services free of chargeand those tools just lack the typicalunfinished and poorly implementedlook and feeel that ccp calls excellencethe 18 month was a slap into the face of the average player who does not play lagging in stations but wanted lagging in space fixedand to be honest i think 500 welped tornados would have more influence on the plex prices than your nex shopjust a hint dont get me wrong i would like incarna if it actually works without melting my hardwareand would show my characters the way i designed themi never asked for dust or wodbut with the doubledipping i pay for both toowait those drinking buddies from fanfest plan to backstab methe fearlessleak gives me exactly this feelingthis along with some unpopular changes in recent patchesamasses to a quiet substantial amount of rage
op you didnt really get this eve thing did you
why dont they use concorde to populate the low sec and 00 sec areas more everyone in high sec should automatically be charged for being there a part of their wealth every week this will make jita less popular people will make more accounts then people will be forced to low sec where the people there cant handle the influx this ignites massive wars and tons of sup cappies will explode into shiny bits thus solving a bunch of issues then suddenly one day highsec explodes and there is only low sec left then we will no longer have concorde and everyone will live happily in a true sandbox
dont fly what u cant afford to loseno one forced u to choose what u fly or what u carry with u u chose to fly that hulk and u chose to carry that valuable cargo in a flimsy hauler so r u saying that its the pirates fault for blowing someone up in low sec00 as well therefore its your own fault for your own loss simple as that

cosmetic onlyanything else effects the game in ways that would mess up many things for many players indy for example hard work missioning and etc i dont see why some one should be able to skip all that time and effort ive put into my toon to get were i am just because they are better off then me other game changing things are just as messy as well i dont want to see a 1 month old toon bragging about their titan or what ever just because they have enough spare cash plex for remap meh but plexaur for factions guns ships or ammo no thanks ive also seen kids steal their parents cards to get into stuff like this so they can be better then their friend who plays it by buying all these in store things it can make you lose players that way as well you might have the kid being funded by the parent but they wont be spending money on the in store stuff am pretty sure most people dont want to be double billed either so youd have to drop subs for it to be actually effective but with that you open eve even more to bots and annoying 12 year olds granted you will get a boost but it wont be a good one and i dont think you would get more money if did free to play with a market supporting it either my UFFFD002 anyway

cosmeticvanity onlyif people want to spend money on cosmetic crap then good for them it doesnt bother me and it means the game devs get some hard earned money  game developers generally work long hours with poor pay they deserve a pay rise if they can get it from these vanity itemslet us not forget that ccp has given us many wonderful expansions for free and if we can support them further to help them reach their goal of providing the ultimate online sci fi experience for us then we should

cosmetic only no remaps
yes i vote yes there is a silent majority in this game that is not vocal and trusts ccp we are happy with the game and strongly encourage any and all changes towards this new and exciting direction if you dont like what ccp is doing simply stop playing  have a nice life
titans were originally aimed to be an item you would rarely see in the game  when there were only about 5 all up on the server ccp were very happy this has of course now changed and there are many titans ccp has openly admitted that them allowing this to happen was a mistake and that they would prefer if titans were still very fewso of course there will never be plex for titans and i very much suspect there will never be plex for 9 implants or noble ammo or any other crap you idiots can imagine

no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no noif you want to do it do it right cosmetic only and dont make it where a single item costs billions of isk that is ed to the maximum fix the price ffs if you feel the need to do this also fix the game before getting all greed happyi apologize about the caps i feel angry and frustrated and left out in the cold for too long with ccp i love this game but am beginning to dislike the company running it i dont want to quit but this can not continue the disrepsect for your players not really caring the reason you keep losing players and therefore feel the need to drown us in new content that only causes even more issues gaining temporary new subs is that you have so many things broken to fix please for the love of new eden fix things more thoroughly before drowning us in new content captains quarters suck for lag perhaps off topic but i feel the need to vent my frustrations
my vote is no but i wont unsub for vanity only
cosmetic only
no
cosmetic onlyi support ccp and them wanting to make more money but it shouldnt affect the game
noim playing 28 a month for 2 accounts and ccp wants me to pay more to access parts of eve online i dont like that idea
lol and yes if we all left ccp would be broke and you wouldnt have a game
no
nonot now not ever they took my money and promised to be nice now look at them just another greedy corporate entity ignoring the hands that feed obviously ccp executive management all went to the gwbush school of honesty and integrityi suppose we should look forward to an ipo sometime in the near future
cosmetic only
cosmetic onlyit would be great to see a game company make this promise to make mt items cosmetic only and keep it if any company would do that its ccp
no
i dont mind the cosmetic since there is no way to give another an advantage but to use it for ships faction and weapons would be over the top im new to the game and joined because there was really no way to buy an advantage
no

cosmetic onlyi really hate microtransactions but id rather have it be cosmetic only than nonvanity
cosmetic onlyive never posted in 4 years of playing this game
no
noi have been playing for over 5 years as of this moment my account renewal has been terminated i will not be returning due to my dislike of the current events also the posts and bs of some of the devs is a bit dishearteningit seems more like they just do not care about the majorityi use to be a swg fan and player but when soe took over and developed the combat upgrade i left for greener pasturesi see this happending here with the advent into console gaming with dust its no surprise that ccp would possibly want to change things up and make eve more console player friendly to try and get the best of both worldsit is fitting i got an email today saying the soe is closing all swg servers by december 15th this yearfuture of eve maybe
no  greed sux ccp pls dont be like ea and others
noim stubborn generally speaking i feel my sub should cover the game i realize however that rmt is the norm and the vast majority of people seem to say its ok if its only vanity so i usually just accept that but eve is different one of the major aspects of eve is its economy and even vanity only items will impact that economy why arent players crafting and trading these itemsplus there is always the slippery slope argument once it starts and the money is to be made the threat of nonvanity items being sold becomes ever present

nothough i do not believe ccp will ever remove them completely but the prices on the cosmetic stuff atm is just totally edcomparing virtual cosmetic item prices to real life prices shows how clueless ccp is about microtransactions
cosmetic only
noabsolutely not we have already paid more than enough for this game the rest of the ingame content should be freeccps view on self expression is simply self serving it provides the most profit people have already done this without your more expensive than rl clothes ever heard of faction fitted faction battleshipsccp has broken the golden rule video games never ever supersede real life not in importance and certainly not in value

cosmetic onlyi could care less about someones 1000 japanese boutique jeans in game or real life i do care if some punk comes along and drops enough cash to instantly instantly matchexceed my skill levels standings etc buying items or ships doesnt bother me as its already a mechanic by selling plex nothing should be done to alter the game mechanics to give one player an edge over another based on how much money they spend the game was not designed this way and making such alterations is a deep insult to the entire existing player basei appreciate and encourage the developers to see creative new ways to fund the development of the eve universe but mt that affect character performance and development are simply too unfair to be considered
cosmetic onlyif you want to buy stuff that makes your charactership look unique then be my guest you may get a that looks cool from me or other players but it wont give you any real advantage over any other players and thats the way it should be hell if it cost a buck or less id probably even be willing to apply a custom paintjob to a ship or two but thats where it stops

yes damned give us all the juicy stuff let us pay for every god damn thing its what we are good for in your capitalistic eyes more money to the stake holders keep on building more games on our backs that we cant use anyway as it will be on sony request to not release it on pc better why isnt it entered your brains yet that ccp should open their own rmt shop they dont care about this game anyway as they go on the money tourtime to cancel some of my accounts and look for another game

cosmetic onlyi can not stress this enough if actual game items that affect game play are introduced they can and will destroy the game as the game is focused on the market anything that removes iskdemandservices already provided via the ingame market forces will have severe consequences to the game ultimately resulting in a mass exodus of players because their investments in the game can and are being effectively wiped clean with the click of a few buttons ships or items which are being generated and added into the game will result in major market changesthe only way i would even accept ships with different paint jobs would be if the paint happens only to a ship that you already had to purchase or otherwise buildaquire ingame via current market and game forces to do so otherwise would affect the ingame value of the current itemsships for which you are selling via microtransaction by adding additional supply to the market via external mechanics ie you are waving a magic wand and instantly making something from nothing not using a blueprint or building materials etc etc this will have a butterfly effect on the entire market not just the specific item you are addingthe same can be said for standing gains i mean at that point why not just make it skill points oh you dont want to do what to rat or grind missions for that corpfaction no problem no more waiting for you you dont want to sit while you train enter race heres bs level v no problem fork over your credit card you dont want to have to have logistics in place to defend your 00 no problem with a credit card you too can have an instant ccpmt fleet arrive to blow up the enemy forces

cosmetic onlyi dont like the idea of mt but i understand eve and ccp need cash to run so if people want to waste their cash then go nuts ur a muppet if u do but thats ur right

noccp have lost my respect sadly it is of course inevitable that a small mmo company making a successful niche game will become a bigger company and lose interest in the project that made them successful ccp have entered that phase of their growth eve funds dust and wod development in several ways aside from pure income wis being a test bed for wod tech for instance it seems that it no longer funds much in the way of its own development greed is good with capitalist sheep like kristoffer touborg working for ccp theres not much hope for eve in the long run

noi would not oppose it if i could trust it stays for vanity stuff only but ccp already broke their promise of not adding microtransactions to eve so their word can not be trusted
hell no this isnt because of change we all want walking in stations but we want it properly not walking around in a box who doesnt want to stab your enemy in the neckbut microtransaction s microtransaction games are usually free to play not subscription you cant have both you greedy s
cosmetic only
no
noi like this idea
cosmetic only
noclothing should be free or obtainable via missions lp stores this way encourages people to play game not just log in inject lots of cash and look prettyps so plex for ponies wasnt a jokeoo
no

no f no if you introduce vanity items make the game free to play like teamfortress 2 did

no definately not ccp have a great chance here to create a new area within the eve internal market and theyre messing it up by introducing clothing items as an extremely expensive way for us to hand over more real life money to themwhat should be in game is a new skill and production set for players to create personal clothing equipment and weapons this would be a very interesting and could also be rather dynamic new area for players to get intothink special designs fleet styles etc

cosmetic only
no
i would rather not have any mt at all however for extra stuff that does not improve your gameplay i suppose it would be fine i say fine only because some people like useless garbage and if they are willing to pay for it let them fund it instead of using our subscription fees on vanity stuff as long as they can guarantee that it will never ever turn into providing an advantage to another playertldr cosmetic only would be happier with no but meh

cosmeticpersonally i dont care if some one wants to buy a pair of eye decorations for that much money however the day mt goes outside the following is the day i quit cosmetic  vanity items only no advantages whatsoever aka anything beyond purely cosmetic to personshipstation environment including no skillpoint gains either indirectly via  sphour boosters ie 2 sp gain for n days or directly via just buying n  or direct skillpoint increases direct being stuff like 500k sp  n aurum percent being n increase to total sp costing n aurum no remapping either indirectly by adding another remap point or simply paying to bring up the window again no ingame products purchasable with aurum that cant be made with bps aside from cosmeticvanity for instance if i can buy a megathron from this i want it to be the same megathron i can make with a blueprint vanitycosmetic aside no being able to buy extra active character slots ie i pay n aurum to make it so i can train 2 characters at a time no being able to buy increased sov gain or anything of the sort from aurum nothing related to sov changes alliance or corp operations will be effected by aurum the day an alliance can pay to win  i quitalso my use of the word aurum in this can apply to whatever micro transaction currency you want to come up withand this is just a suggestion but if these ideas really are just something you wanted people to dream up for a stupid newsletter then you should really reconsider its moronic at best to stick something that would  the community off so much in a pdf document that could be leaked that in itself shows a severe lack of judgement that should be a at table discussion only honestly
no no no pay2win means i unsub permanently even if you remove it later all trust that youre trying to make a good game will be gone

cosmetic onlya wide selection of reasonably priced cosmetic items say 1 plex worth of aurum should let you buy 510 items definitely no single item worth more than 1 plexincluding nonincarna specific stuff like custom paint jobs for ships would be awesome obviously id rather have them for free but i would be willing to convert a plex or 2 if i thought i was getting decent value for money and that should not mean it costs as much as an irl one wouldoh and edit to add that there should not be any actual benefit to any of these things at all looks alone
absolutely no
cosmetic only
no
no mt ffs

no
no
noif the question was answered would game changeing items be entered into this store at any point then we would know where we stand that statment has not been made so we dont know how far this will goso not acceptible
cosmetic onlyin my opinion there ios no probleme with cosmetic item theyre not going to change the awsome eves gameplay
plain and simply no
nounacceptable there are many reasons why but the basic fact is a game especially one with a recurring monthly subscription fee should simply not be so additionally expensive to play and by play i mean carry out all the actions within the world that are featured within it eg clothing acquisition neural remaps whatever i mean wtf does the 1999 a month pay for just basic server maintenance is that all we get for money loli came back to this game after an almost 2 year absence this month and if something drastic isnt done to remedy the situation ill be gone again with less justification to ever return you are welcome to try my resolve hilmar p

hell no to rmtbuying isk from isk sellers are band as it gives a player an edge in game if u have money spare in real life eula has been quoted so many times saying real money for isk is band now ccp want the real money its ok double standards me thinks there
no  hell no and bring more 00 content please u guys are slacking so bad its not even funny
i vote no to microtransactions i have played and worked hard the last several years i have been playing eve nearly 56 years now and have spent well more that i would like to think about in subscription fees i should not have to shell out more money just to be able to buy clothing for my character so that i can make them look different this i an mmorpg this isnt an htmljavaflash based web game you play on facebook btw if i find evidense supporting the mythbelief that ccp is considering allowing ppl to buy skill points i know of several ppl myself included that will mostlikely be leaving eve once the ability to buy skill points is allowed the fun and drive that makes eve what it is will be gone and there will be no point in remaining and to all those vultures out there no you can not haz my stuff if i do end up leaving eve my stuff leaves with me you wll just have to work hard and earn your stuff like everyone else oh wait no you wont just get a plex and buy it with rl money just dont get caught commiting rmt unless it with via plex with ccp
cosmetic only

no eve online is not a game where microtransactions should be apart of ever
cosmetic onlythe ablity to buy ships ammo and skillpoints is not only unfair to those of us that have put in tons of time and invested money over the yrs but also brings in an outside influence class  should someone that makes more money than others be allowed to advance faster through the game no skillpoint trades no ship trades and no advanced items trade

cosmetic onlyloyal ccp players had to earn their skill points over time allowing new players to obtain them in any other manner is just wrong the skilltraining is an attractive feature of this game for many adult players it is one of the reasons i enjoy the game to make this remap change would turn eve into just another star wars galaxies

cosmetic onlyi dont care if people want to spend 70 on a monocle just dont let people buy performanceenhancing items that give an edge im actually on the fence about if it should be used for sp too i think it could be a good extra revenue stream for ccp to allow people to accelerate training or flatout buy sp people already buy characters for the sake of saving time on training so maybe itd be alright to buy sp with the new currency dont make it cheap enough that everyone would do it but for the rich who just want to save time it could be a winwin for the player and ccpbut do not allow actual items to be purchased if i see premium shipsmodsammo im leaving and never coming back leave that stuff for dust514

hell no
at best cosmetic only
no
cosmetic onlyi am willing to let ccp expand their options and economic base but not at the risk of gameplay the shifts in plex prices would be enough i would prefere aurum being purchased alone and not convereted from plex a market well outside our markets so that only optional purchases can effect optional cosmetics
nowhy try to claw money out of ppls hands by bringing in a new currency system when enough ppl buy gametime to convert to plex and sell it on the market everydaythey always speak so proudly of the eve economy and how its all in the hands of the player so why not keep it that way and have everything cost isk like it shouldnow ppl are even discussing to increase the amount of the subscription fee to keep mt away but this is equaly disgusting to even suggest ithow about not being so fg greedy and stop trying to change the best thing in the game which was the stand alone economy

cosmetic onlyreasonably priced i might addi do not know how many of you know of lord of the rings online if you do then you are aware of thier point store and cosmetic system while the genres are different the premise is the same no gear that gives you an overt advantage and the prices are reasonable especially since you can earn points in gameplay i realize thier system wont work in eve as it has for lotro but its at least a template that could be looked at by ccp ok thats it take care
no
cosmetic only

the voting choice descriptions in the op completely detract from the value of the thread if you want to be taken seriously speak plainly vote cosmetic only with reasonable prices then again if there are those who care so little about money that they are willing to pay 80 dollars for pixels they dont own then sure go ahead and profit off them for the short time you can just dont act shocked when it blows up in your faces like it is now

cutscenes would be cool but they would have to be done properly  ie not generic cutscenes for everyone but actually have them rendered with your own avatar  for them to really work wellsupported regardless though
yes captains quarters needs to be optional  a player should be able to choose for his character to get out of his podwe dont need cutscenes however although they would be a nice addition for many players im sure
this is exactly how i imagined it would be1

well done post opi support this this is what needs to be done
1excellent idea
your points1 what if they delete the mail how many times have you read the concord notices or the insurance claim notifications plenty im sure so if people can change names willy nilly im betting you will get a couple of name change notifications a week now you can go on and update all your contact lists but the point is that adding anything to making the process of tracking people harder is a negative no matter how you try to spin it as not so bad it will never be good2 progress i dont see how adding a new loophole is progress regulated or otherwise the net effect is more exploits perhaps if you plug one of the other loopholes first before you add this new one then you can perhaps call it a netnet even stevenadd name changes with the existing toon transfers and you are only encouraging more toon farmers3 yeah no need to argue this one i threw it in there because it was mentioned by someone as a reason for needing name changing it is a digression from the main topic so not worth debating over
yes
yes
i support this
yes finally this unnecessary and rather useless change makes sense it was the first step to charge players for extra save slots shame on ccp for this
i couldnt understand why we had no response to this simple and easy to fix issuei even asked this question in the ask a dev thread and expected this simple question to be picked early as low hanging fruitlittle did i know they were considering selling us back this functionality we once had for free for mt thats macro transactions btwi request people sign this petition and tell ccp what we think about this ideawithout using crude obscenities pleasei would like to keep the moral high ground
is there really that many guys that can fly enough ships to need more than 50 fittings saved without being able to memorize their standard fits for alot of them i mean you tend to end up running a simmilar philosophy about most of your ships fittingson the other hand why put a limit on local storage guess i support thisedit and to be fair the thing about selling more fitting slots was on the page dedicated to yesno where 2 devs discussed their own oppinions and ideas
support or it wont be long before you only are allowed 50 bookmarks and pay for the restgot my vote
x for option to get ship hangar back even if its only for static view

optional cq needs to become optional and players should then choose to leave their ship and enter the cq and for future expansions other areas within the station thismany times a player will dock and then almost instantly undock for many reasons in such a case when considering immersion the captainpilotcapsuleer wouldnt have time to get out of his ship and go to his quarters just to get back straight on to his ship againbut immersion and rp asideccp must understand that many of their subscribers have multiple accounts  if these players are no longer able to have multiple accounts running at the same time then there will be a decline in active subscriptions and as thus a loss of income for ccpedit there is an option to turn cq off already and ive read that ccp already has plans to reintroduce the ability to spin your ship  due to high demand

thisalso find out whats causing the graphics card  cpu to overheat  i cant dualbox anymore without fearing that my freaking laptop will melt downand thisand it may just be me but there is something just wrong about undocking while your character is starring up at his ship
not that i think anyone really cares or should care for that matter but ive reconsidered my heretofore resistence against making this optional some excellent ideas have been mentioned in one of the latest threadnoughts and i now support the proposal
should be able to dock view ship as old times click button to climb outi dont want to stare at a metallic door or a poorly rendered version of my charthat being said i am waiting for my account to expire and will be back in a few monthsnext year to test the waterim keeping my stuff so no you cant have my stuffbeen fun ccp until now
not sure if anyone has noticed this yet but you can infact dissable the cq if you want the option to do so is in the options menu ingame
signed
im indisembark option would be nice
i agree
what ghurthe said says it allccp displayed a model where you had the option to stay in the pod or to go clean up and walk aroundthe option is what we supportthe option is what we want
there are people that dont minethere are people that dont buildthere are even people that dont ever undockwhy should anyone be forced to walk in stationsincarnaaschoice
i ll be brief as on cell reading all that is goin on far from home i have seven full accounts and believe me ccp if you don t bring the dream back the dream that eve has been until now you will loose me and my seven full accounts by d way i have a super gaming computer 8gig memory super graphic card and i cannot login all my toons and play and mine and give support with my fleet any longer since incarna what d hell have u done

i agree with the motionoption to not display aur is needed
supportedyet i would rather have option to disable the noble store altogether the extra button i have no desire to ever use while docked at station is also a bit annoyingso you disable the noble store it suppresses both the button while docked and the aur on the wallet

not going to get aurum no need for a aurum balance get this stuff out of my sight
that would be great also why must it have a different colour it looks awful in the ui imo
10
yes please
please bring it back and quickly
i do sincerely believe that the program should be put back in the game with mining ops and other loot based missions that the fleet leader is responsible for figuring out who gets what and how much it is the only program in the game to allow that to be done correctly and fairly for all concerned if the fleet leaders have to try to do it manually i am afraid that would be enough to cause them to either quit the game or quit running missions of any kind that involve a fleet and that would make a whole lot of people move on to other games which we dont want to happen so please listen to the people that play the game and reinstall it
agreed especially since it doesnt always close when i click that x the first timebut i think thats more my fault older pcbut yes as said before
agreed but then i also think itd be nice if you could hotkey clicks of the mouse it gets annoying after awhile when every time youre in space and try to hit something that uses control you lock a target
you can hit esc then go to keybindshotkeys or whatever it is and switch the bind warptomouse3 autopilotmouse4 i just wish you could assign two bindings like having ctrls or mouse4  autopilot
ive just spent the last few hours reading thread after thread post after post and there are a few things ive noticed that have caused me some concerni felt it necessary to point out to people that it is important not to mistake speculation for fact and also to be aware that there are clever people in these forums who will find some ways of manipulating information and making you see it how they want you to see it whats worse is that some people have gone so far as to make you vote in a situation where the poll was rigged from the beginning  the vote does not offer the required options available for selection for it to be counted as a fair vote the whole thing is biased and manipulative  the person who created the votes really does not care whether you say yes or no as both of these options are alternatives to what the op doesnt want  microtransactions if your voting poll is in fact fair then i am not referring to yoursi say let the facts be heard and let people make up their own minds without the deceiving  manipulationlet trustworthy information that isnt biased and hasnt been manipulated be available i will try to keep this thread updated and add your input to the 2nd post when i receive it  references and ways of verifying your claims appreciateddisclaimer i do have my own opinions however i will do my best to be unbiased whilst posting in this thread despite that you may have seen me rage in other threadsthank you to noriko for this ccp zulu blog  20110624edit new editi would like to thank people for their constructive responses including replies to my posts in other threads i accept that we must do more than just use words  however will still not think its cool to be just plain rudenastydisrespectfuldeceptivemanipulative like other people have beenalso i have a feeling after reading so many posts from other players that ccp wont be removing the vanity items as theyve worked so hard on it etc and many players are happily using iti do believe however they will be doing something about the captains quarters and ive also read somewhere that they were already considering adding a shipspinning feature before this debacle even begancheersedit
edit i have added 2 new entriesfacts ccp has introduced microtransactions into the game ccp plans to introduce more the items available thus far are vanity items only  they do not enhance character abilities or give players any kind of advantagefor those who may have difficulties grasping the english language i will let you know that these vanity items are essentially fashion accessories for your avatar vanity items have no direct effect on you as a player ccp has stated that they will not be introducing any character enhancing items or ways in which players will be able to purchase some form of advantage aside from trading plex for isk of course and i guess you could consider attribute remaps too ccp is a company and like all companies need to make money in order to survive and fund further expansionprojects  it has been quoted by many business experts that companies need to expand in order to survive this is general knowledge for anyone whos completed a business degree in recent years many of the game developers within ccp work long and hard hours to provide us with this game world that we all play  and the expansions are free it is ccps goal to make eve the ultimate scifi experiencerecently added it has been mentioned that ccp want to charge for 50 fittingsnew journalsarticles are often biased and will twist and manipulate information making you think the way they want you to think  be careful not to fall for this do your research and make up your own mindif ive missed anything then let me knowapparently there is a remap option and this is seen by some players as giving a character an advantagespeculation and opinions not fact many players fear that ccp will not keep this promise and that this introduction of microtransactions is the first step towards a system where character enhancing and advantagesuperior items will be introduced many players are accusing ccp as being selfish and greedy and that they ignore players needs game developers are generally on quite low pay considering the hours they work and many players believe that ccp is deserving of more sources of income if they can get it extra income sourced from microtransactions will either go to the well deserving game developers andor will go towards funding projects so that ccp may achieve their goal of the ultimate scifi experiencepossible indirect effects of microtransactions and vanity items the ccp ceo and headstaff will be able to purchase luxury items such as hotfancy sports cars and have outrageous items like selfflushing heated toilets and diamond encrusted chandeliers hanging from their office ceilings players might get jealous that their characters rivals can afford to have cool tshirts and fancy monocles for their avatar ccp game developers whore on less than impressive pay might actually get the pay they deserve for all their hard work ccp will use the extra income to fund more projects and create more awesome games for us to play andor improve existing ones
thanks for adressing this issueim so bugged of this sstorms due to insert trivial issueif you dont like this fing monocole then dont buy itif you want it then play eve make the money and buy it but please shut the fk upbtw ccp zulu blog  20110624
dont forget to support this thread if you do in fact support it  check the box where it says check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on which is found under the preview check boxcheers
hate to burst your bubble guys but there are some real problems betwwen the community and company hilmars email sums up his thoughts about the community
i just stopped right here and had a nice lol irl how players base or at least the winners can be so hypocritesplex is micro transaction giving you and advantage in game over some one not using plex hello turn your brains onwhile this plex has served all the multiboxing macro and bot users until now to play the game for free what do you think it will happen if over 50 of the available plex in the market just goes right in aurumim telling what it will happen youll see a lot more subs pay with real money thats whats getting mad all those whiners have to pay to use something
can you provide a link to this email thats what this thread is foreveryone knows this people are upset about ccp possibly adding more microtransactions and the possibility speculation that this will lead to more player advantage items etcyou make some fair points and it makes sense however you stopped reading the rest of the post and that is why you fail this is not a thread about that its supposed to be a use for players to gain legitimate unbiased information so they can make up their own minds without their decisions being hindered by othersif you have something useful to add then please post it and i will add it to the my posts at the top
i couldnt really decide if it was worth my time and effort responding to any of the hundreds of posts people are putting up on the forums mainly i just like to play eve and am satisfied with everything i am able to do in the gamei just wanted to respond to where you talk about the votes and pollsif there is one thing that i learned in my government class its that people groups and television stations can be highly biasedif you take the republican and democrat idea the republicans wont be looking at things that have a high democratic bias and democrats wont want to be looking at stuff with high republican biasi would have to say that with all this going on you are looking at just one group of people responding to those votes and polls while the other group of people me being one of them doesnt really even bother to vote or take a poll as its not worth the efforti would be interested though to see what the groups of people on the other end of the spectrum really have to say and what kind of support there would beso i am supporting this topic on the grounds of a good healthy discussion
en24 saysmake ccp take the lemons back
i appreciate the support but your thread clearly limits the proposed upgrades qt dont make turret missilelaunchers many ships dont actually have the hardpoints to support see drake i dont wish to make the issue of upgrading missiles to be narrowed right out of the gate i could imagine a future ee where serious hull changes have been made to ships notably caldari and missile launchers pop out of the ships in similar fashion to turrets now in truth im not sure i would end up enjoying that moreso than the status quo my immediate goal is to allow all ideas to be discussed without limitation and determine how many people actually care enough about updating missiles to want something to be done about it
well saidhowever in regards to the description of the cqs being like beta testing  i do hope they respond to players needs and reduce the graphics or at least give the option to turn it off at least until future expansions when not only has technology caught up but when the majority of pcs in the world are actually at that level and can actually run multiple clients some people with older machines struggle with just one client runningccp must realise that a lot of their subscriptions their income is generated from players who own and run multiple accounts this has now been hindered and if they do not address this problem quickly theyre going to see a lot of accounts suddenly go inactiveedit i have since discovered that you can in fact turn the cq off thus we can run multiple clients no problem and i have also learned that ccp is going to reintroduce the ship spinning feature due to high demand
wtf is that asshat talking about what does he actually know about the fuhrer and how does he dare compare himself with one im utterly dispised and wish this crap was known before the meeting in moscow so that i could tell him in person how ing wrong he is
this one is more sane but then again who the hell told him that the revenue is the aim the aim is to please people via providing them excellent services and the revenue is a mere consequenceffs i wish those guys have read henry ford
i ing loledthe question is not whether eve is dying or dying not rather  how long will it still last while being run in such a poor and nonaryan wayyou guys are disgusting
agreed with sideousjohn turbefield the king in the north he has my sword
i kind of smile seeing the word in bold being filtered stupidity is getting just overwhelming
i fully agree the noble store has got to go it is nothing more than a money grab if we let it live right now it will ruing eve ultimately down the road give a mouse a little food and it will always come back for more ccp is getting greedy

i cant believe im agreeing with anything even vaguely related to jade but right is right and must be supported
not supportedmost of what you are saying are just speculations at this point i really dont think ccp will make anything but vanity items in the nex if they did then that would be the day i would dosay something about it for now its all just hot air and fudi do agree that there should be a disembark option but i think certainly it may be added going forward but as they announced that they were going to release incarna on a certain day they really couldnt have squeezed in that feature in time so meh i cant blame them for that yet

hey i havent said anything either way on it im asking the question hes a good guy and id hate for him to be hurt but im also being hurt hereall i want to do is be able to log in and get back to game as usual if thats what it takes then thats what it takesedit plus if the thread goes with no and its clear thats theres not much interest in it either way then hes in the clear thatd also be good in my opinioni want to be blunt im not calling for his scalp i want to find out if his scalp will settle things its clear it wont so thats that thread can be locked yay
although i dont agree with the slight on the op i do agree with the logical part of the statement off with his head is not a valid tactic else all innovation stops it might be politic to move the offender out of the public eye but that would be the worst that should happen unless hs behavior becomes a trend
the op and any of the posts that support it are a disgracenaive and selfish playersgood work players who are flaming the opif game designers are to be fired for making poor decisions then creativity and all possible innovations for the future are doomedbut it isnt even a bad decision in the first placethe game developers have not only a responsibility to look after their players but they must also generate a sustainable income for their company  so that staff can get paid and put food on the table for their families there is nothing wrong with vanity items and microtransactions being introduced into the game so long as it doesnt lead to playercharacter enhancing items  ccp has said this wont happenthe amount of crap some people give ccp is disgusting ccp has worked very hard for many years to give us the game we all love and theyve given us many many expansions for free you have no right to start such a thread and you sir should be bannedpleas lock this thread
not supportedi agree with this post but only insofar as i have quoted itin general i am extremely skeptical of microtransactions to nonvanity items leaning towards opposition
agreed seamus i have also voted no to the whole mt thing but this is imo out of lineop  it honestly doesnt matter if you just ask the question
granted its a poo idea but he shouldnt get the sack for it we all have crappy ideas give him a break fellas
he should stay but you should definitively get an ipcc ban for this disrespectyou dont like it dont buy it
of course not the guy did nothing wrongpeople rioting in jita isnt even a significant event i mean this is classic selective bias just because 3000 odd holigans protest in jita because they have nothing better to do doesnt mean anything if you consider the 300000 people who arent protestingi feel that capitalism is under attack here which is sad
capitalism is for the noobs greed shouldnt be tolerated ever
in fact id like to sell a lot more than vanity itemsdont think he should be fired for this but hope he feels he has had a kick up the arse from players regarding it thank god we got a view of whats going on

if ccp wants another source of revenue they have a lot of npc corporations that could be used to advertise outofgame commoditiesfor a yearly fee from cocacola quafe corp could become cocacola including all quafe products becoming coke productsresearch corporations could become intel motorola nvidia etccourier corporations could become fedex ups etcdoes not affect gameplay and gives ccp another income sourcevote yes if you support ingame advertising of realworld items and corporationsvote no if you do not support ingame advertising of realworld items and corporations
yeah i was crying when i saw monster the monster frigates and minifreighters incarna is a complete cluster now 
i could be wrong on this will need to go and double check but i just saw the size differences as being a matter of perspective the frigates look bigger because they can sit closer to your balcony while the larger ships need more room and so need to be closer to the center of the hanger
i had pretty much the same idea for the ship spinner people mine implements a chair or a bench for the captain to sit upon at the console on the dock seated or standing there one can with the rightclick of the ship and the selection of look at resume the seemingly pleasing ship spinning viewpoint
as you walk away from the platform the ships get bigger but as you walk to your ship the ship gets smaller i think this is a bug
sick of the long wait to get your petition responded to id be willing to spend extra real life money on having a priority response to my petitions the fact that other individuals are willing to spend 70 usd on an ingame monocle leads me to believe that other people would be willing to pay for this too as it is a much more useful service the length of time it takes for a petition to be addressed is excessive and id like to be able to cut to the front of the linei propose premium customer service 5usdmonth or 1 plex3 months guaranteed response time of less than one hourit has been said that eve customer service works 247 as such they should be able to provide a simple line cutting service and respond within an hour without issue it would have minimal if any impact on the petition system as the people receiving the premium customer service would be making petitions anyway ccp makes more money doesnt use up anymore resources and the players who choose to upgrade can have their petitions answered faster regardless everyone will have their petitions answered even if they do not purchase this optional upgrade
okay i will admit that this idea isnt 100 mine as it was inspired by a post in general discussions but the idea here is having specific sets of clothing tied too your faction standings with various npc corporationsthe easiest and most obvious example for this would be the militias we already have our milita ranks tracked so how about adding a system where whenever we increase in rank we gain access to a new uniform complete with insignias and tailored to the particular faction we are fighting for starting out with something rather bland and utilitarian at the lowest ranks and moving on up to full dress uniformsthe same system could easily be applied to other npc corporations or just to the major factions after all it does take quite a while to grind up your faction standings so why not give us something to show for it or perhaps even opening up some of the bloodline specific tattoosimplantsetcyeah it would take some time but it would help to add some extra color to our wardrobes as well as making quite a bit of sense from an rp perspective an amarrian preaching to the matari starts going native and adopting their style an oddly pious gallente begins wearing a hoodi also believe that this might be an effective middle ground on the whole change of bloodlines proposal since ccp seems reluctant to discuss that i think i could probably handle not being able to change my bloodline a bit more if i could gain access to some of the other tattoos even if it meant a bit of extra work on my part to grind up the standings for it
dieslowly and in pain
microhowever this vote is flawed you need a 4th option for vanity onlyit is clear that you yourself disagree with mt and you have therefore cleverly designed the voting options for this thread so that people will be forced to choose yes or no which is exactly what you want them to do this thread is biased and stupid and should be either fixed or deletedthere are many players who probably cant afford to pay for an increase in subscription fees and there are many players who dont want players to be given an unfair advantage by buying character enhancing items via microtransations  you are taking advantage of thisfurthermore there are a lot of people who are misinformed and who have been fooled by outrageous speculations and rumors  no factsthere is nothing wrong with vanity items it will not affect you and your ability to play the game the only problem with the latest expansion is the captains quarters being to hardware hungry  this is another issue if players want to spend money on fashion accessories then good for them  its their choice and if ccp can generate some extra income then good for them they deserve itccp has worked long and hard for us many selfish players to provide the game we love and have given us many many free awesome expansions and improvements it is their goal to create the ultimate online scifi experience for us and if we can help them achieve that goal then we should
yes provided that it is reasonable
noeve subscriptions are already at the high end of mmos its obviously profitable evidenced by eve providing enough revenue to be developing two new ambitious titles simultaneously
micromany games that use mt are able to drop subscription fees entirely
yes and 1 to rin ji
noimplementing mt already and obviously they dont care about their clients and they are caught in the mainstream of we need more isk damned we need to pay for tons of stuff but i so want to see their annual balance sheet and see how much goes to their  investors 
nothey are using their revenue to develop cash farms like dust and world of darkness at the same time not many companies can do that one would think 1 title was enough and use the rest of the money to improve eve and get even more playersbut noooogreed is supreme
nothey already invest ourmy money in crap i do not want and doesnt even effect eve in a way i wanti am speaking of the dust514 bull  we are paying 3 4 years development of a game which will be paytowin wtf plsthey should use their ing money they get through eve use for eve
 this no
everyone please read
in a way true but seriously if we can stop this kinda behavior a few euro increase in sub fee is acceptable so i say yes x 3
nothe fee is high enough as it is
micro x3one for each accountif you want to spend 20 for your avatar to have a skirt then go for it if there is going to be more than just cosmetic mts then i would be willing to pay more to keep the mts out of the game
noi dont want to spread the extra money they want to get from vanity items across all of us in the way of subscription fees insteadmicro is fine as long as its only for vanity and cosmetic stuff the day that we get any kind of paytowin system is the day i quit heck i dont really care if i can buy a megathron from mt as long as its plex  aurum  megathron and as long as that megathron is no better statistics wise not looks than any other megathron i can make using bps seems like a bit of added redundancy since you can go plex  isk  megathron but mehi have no problem with ccp trying to make extra money but not with increased subscription fees or mt that involves paying for better stuff than the rest of us get
wow just wow youre like the beaten housewife making concessions and telling yourself he still loves you for the love of god grow a pair will youeve is already one of  if not the most expensive subscription based mmos out thereitt golden geese
nosorry but the world lets wow get away with charging for expansions while they recoup their enitre production costs for the release within a day or two after it lands then people continue paying subs till the next robbing takes placeevery eve player pays almost the full amount that other developers charge for a oneoff fully priced aaa title and they do that every 2 months that pays for expansion development that pays for the design and implementation of new features clothing etc and that pays for server maintenance and adminfor additional money to be justified for development or justified in allowing featureuse privileges ccp would have to explain what exactly we pay our subs for and also why their new content production pipelines are so inefficient to require this scale of recompensesorry but what is going on here is exactly the same  a total disconnect between the proportional value of commercial media in this case features within a game and its commensurate value in real world money
hell no to increased sub fees yes to microtransactions as long as they dont affect gameplay balanceeve sub is expensive as it is 60 days world of warcraft  30 60 days eve  35 plus due to stupid restriction of one training character per account most people actually pay two or more accounts i believe this situation is quite unique in mmo world where so many mmos struggle financially often resorting to free to play model before going out of business completely in contrast to that loyal eve player base goes out of their way and gladly pay for several accounts but that loyalty has its bounds
yes but i believe that some information about why they need more money and how they plan to use them would be useful
whats the problem with micro paymento
yes but to further fund eve not games not related to it
microi really dont see what the problem is with mt
noare you ppl insane you are all shifting the greed of ccp to the subscription systemhow about not being so fg greedy and keep it as it is enough ppl buy plex to sell it for isk as it is and every time they can they brag about more ppl subscribing to eve so i say theyre making enough money already
exactly what is your problem with mt for cosmetic only goods is it just that ccp shouldnt make more money is it purely just the fact that ccp wants to generate more revenue that is the root of your displeasure
while i had no intention of cleverly manipulating results you are correct that the vote needs to include a 4th option for the statistics to accurately represent player opinion i value these numbers as quantitative analysis is really all ccps decision will come down to in the end players who have voted previously can edit their posts to reflect the newly added 4th option thank you for keeping any perceived bias out of the poll and thank you everyone else for your inputedit remember folks lets try to keep questions and comments to a minimum posts in this thread should begin with a vote discussion on this topic can be posted in this thread
lets keep this short and simplenewbetter or old cyno graphics disappear and reappear graphic is awful and tacky with all of the new graphics introduced into incarna and you still havent created a new cyno graphic very sad and pathetic
just letting ccp know that i was looking forward to the wod mmo im a huge fan of the pen  paper books and the roleplaying setting itself but ive decided that along with eve too a standard monthly subscription fee should be enough and should not exclude me from any content even so called vanity items because its a world of darkness game you will want the choice of clothing since as we all know its been circulated that you be approaching wod in the same way you are now steering eve if true this will mean i wont be playing the wod mmo then no chancewhich is really sad cause ive been waiting for a wod mmo since i played masqueraderedemption wayyy back whenthe problem is im a control freak type of person if you have a noose around my neck you have to make sure i dont notice or i rip the noose off or my head to get it off sometimes it backfires a monthly subscription fee is like a light noose a softy fluffy collar on a elasticated spring lead its always there but you are able to forget about it and enjoy yourself with an ignoranceenabled feeling of personal freedommicrotransactions are a constant slap in the face a prod and a stern point toward the correct way to go everytime i veer off the path into desire after seeing something that looks cool that i want which in an mmo youd hope would be often well no when its microtransaction based lol me veering off the path would be me seeing it and then going online and looking up what quest has to be completed or creature has to be bested or components found to acquire this cool item even that is part of the fun of the game but no the slap in the face is you guys ccp directing me retail isle telling me to have my wallet ready once im done looking aroundi think a lot of it is a personality thing im quite assertive and i dislike repeatedly being bugged for  in this case ridiculous amounts of money but id feel the same if it were small amounts if im honest or anything like a stupid menu confirmation box whatever i dont discriminate ha ha those are two personalitytraits o minenothing personal ccp but if you do this to wod and if you continue to do it to eve our business will be terminatedps i dont expect any response in particular more just saying where i stand and what will probably happen unfortunatelyedited cause i realized the title was a little misleading sounded like i was breaking major news before no lol
hiits really simple what ccp have done lately pretty much is  in your faces i mean just look at the things theyve done look at incarna if you can sit there with a straight face and pretend that this csm matters or makes a difference then just look at what happened during the last few days and face realitywhat i suggest you do is resign and shut down the csm collectively do this to send a message to both ccp and the community as a whole do it to maintain integrity and responsibility you make not like this but it is the only sensible option right now you can either stand there and be ed on by ccp in front of the community rkelly style or you can man up and do whats necessary represent the community the way youre supposed topeace out
must agreeits obviously a fruitless and pointless excercise  the major cahnges are not even discussed with youin light of the recent material that shows the company disdane for the custoerms you really have no choice read purpose if it helps
i dont believe thats ever accomplished anythingbesides i think its a bit premature to shut down everythingthe leaked stuff is worrisome but right now theres nothing for sale for aur but overpriced clothes lets wait until something bad actually happens to go all chicken little
seems to me like you are focused on one minor detail herewhat about bad like a complete lack of customer service towards paying customers 
the captains quarters makes it difficult for people to run eve on their computer or to run multiple clients at one time  did you check to see if there was an option to turn it offcant spin your ship in station anymore ccp has said that they will be implementing a way to do this againthe new microtransactions allow people to buy little fashion accessories for their avatar omg im so jealous of people who have monocles right now no one is forcing you to buy themthe leaked newsletter things weve heard in regards to this are of concern but does anyone actually have a link to this can we prove that such a newsletter or email even exists edit ok i found it it does exist some people tell me its fake but i looks pretty convincing either way before or after reading it you should also read the recent dev blog ccp zulu blog  201106249 implants noble ammunition speculation rumor again there is no proofso until there is proof or until ccp does these horrible horrible things please stop crying and making all of these stupid threadsall this cryingcomplainingingraging and threatening to close your accounts seriously wtf grow upedit im going to lol if someone actually has the audacity to be so stupid and reply saying that there isnt an option to turn captains quarters off
its not really about nexthe last days have clearly shown some of the intentions and mindsets that are present within ccp in leading positions it is this mindset that has spawned the protest nex is but a poster child for the anger felt by the community in light of ccp openly giving a  about the concerns and critiqueincarna is a halfarsed excuse for what shouldve been the blockbuster expansion for eve online it is unfinished unpolished lacking content and to top it all off delivers the icing on the failcake in form of nexaurumnow with the ceo of this company being very clear on what his attitude is towards the playerbase in general do you think theres any grounds for a csm to stand and act on i dont
since youre such a big fan of dev blogs try reading zulus previous one found here
i am guessing you dont have children or ever had to care for one of the little monsters for any appreciable amount of timewhen a child throws a tantrum over x thing the only thing you can do is explain why x is in as simple terms as you can if that doesnt work you have two options  slap it around bad or let it cool down and find its composure in due timethird option is to give in and do whatever it takes to appease the little  but rest assured the little buggers remember the caveins vividly and will start throwing tantrums over the most ridiculous things imaginablezulu explained the situation in very simple terms but the emoraging continued  would you like them to smack you around a bit with some carpetbanning perhaps
im a paying customer and ive never noted problems with customer servicewhat exactly do you mean
every one of these thread just sound like whines from children has ccp really done anything that bad i dont think sois cq really that useful now not really but its been long stated that it is the first pass release of station interaction is your pc too underpowered to run the game now well guess better to upgrade now before more station features are added dont like that you have to upgrade well i have a commodore 64 that i wish could run wing commander 3 but such is life is the nex items too expensive for you too bad then earn more isk so that you can afford them we cant have too many monacles around the galaxy else it would lose its elite appeal perhaps you should wait for the quafe tee shirts to go on sale
yep bunch of whiners the only problem is that i cant spin my ship now  hope they will fix thisand missiles still no launcher grapics
i think the only thing that will change ccp right now is bad press the csm if anything has been in the press in the past due to eve being the only mmo with a playerran council providing feedbacka entire resignation would generate further press and emphasis on the overall disagreement of this vocal minority
wouldnt mind a ship spinning alternative to the door but eh nothing to go bomb jita about i can wait for it maybe a mini ship spin in the holo display in the cqmissiles what missile launcher effects there never were any so its not a problem just slated for the next graphics update no doubt
thats a cool idea simulates supply and demand real well too
i agree with the op simplifying agents doesnt change the mission grind but removes some interesting levels of complexityid like to see the quality back not sure about the mission type thing
do do something about the lag they are creating this is not game play its a denial of service attack
no its people expressing a viewpointgo play wow if you dont like other people actually playing the same game
they are just angry because stores run out of monocles before they could buy it mine is for sale starting bid 5bil convo me
wtf monocles sold out damnit i grinded the  out of me since incarna releasetrue story rly 
just imagine for the low low price of 25000 aurum you could get a small smartbomb that really is smart it will not only hit locked targets but anything in range that is attacking you this way suicide gankers could still use them though on a somewhat more limited scale while also being much more useful to carebearsupsized smartbombs should cost 25k aurum per size rank up to extra large smartbombs for capital ships at 100k aurum the reasoning behind this potentially steep price is how advanced the computer equipment and artificial intelligence necessary to create smartbombs that are capable of being smart actually are plus it also includes under the table bribes to security officials to ignore any and all ai technology that might bleed over to less than legal territory after all its just a bomb it wont try to take over the whole ship
im for it a good way to fix the speed issue is to give them all 98xx power and cpu need on micro warp drives then you could fit a capital mwd to itthis would be great on a prowler cloakfastshield extendershield rechargeer shield recharge rig power rig maybe an ecm burst or a targeting disrupter maybe a mining laser in the second high slot or missiles would be nice smart bomb or just a probe launcher im not sure if you can fit the missles or smart bomb to it though eft says you can
if you can call what they are doing to eve developing and not merely betatesting underdeveloped graphics on an unwilling playerbaseif you do this you can stop trying to double dipcut wod or dust 514 and you wont have to fuck your loyal playerbase
on the assumption that ur wrong i support disembark is another good idea though
thanks for idea this is better than what i had in mind cqhangar as a visual setting
somehow immersive good one
wow this is actually a really good ideabut it only works if the loading of all the qc assets etc doesnt actually happen until you choose to do so1
that is exactly what i am talking about the environment for the cq shouldnt be loaded until choosing to specifically to avoid the performance hit take me quite literally when i say upon entering the station one would not be able to discern a difference visually audibly the responsiveness nor the latency should be touchedit should be a separation of the two environments in question completely blended in a way that completely and effectively disguises the fact that there are two unique environments the old and new people need to feel like nothing changed but a brand new player or incarna fan should neither be separated from the complete experience nor feel like the old environment is somehow encroaching on its perceived spacea new player should not ever on their own conclude that this system was developed as a bridge between the two a new player should just dock say coooool hit the button and say oh wow sick and see it all as one gameinterfaceenvironmentfunctionally fans of the old stations should be able to play the game just as they had been with no increase in loading times suffer no performance hit while playing the old way and functionally have no change to speak ofi think it can be done and i think this is a quite workable and relatively speaking simple thing to develop if done with the items above as the requirement for success i could totally see this being live a month from now if that depending on resource allocation
1 make this pretty please the static door are a bit dull to watch on
if that can make all the winners close their beak im all for itunfortunately the major stuff is not cqs but how much the plex price will increase once people start using plex for this instead of isk all those false statements and false disappointment is only about how much it will cost them ig currency to keep playing the game for free nothing else or youre blindedit support
full support this is definitely one of the more elegant simple solutions ive seen for this cq fiascothis isnt second life this is eve keep it that way
lol genius
sounds good to me
please explain to me the reasoning behind making dust 514 a ps3 exlusive and announcing it right after a sony hack that pretty much explains itself making a mmofps hybrid on one of the worst gaming networks available its going to end up blowing up in your face not saying dont do it just not now and not on psn i would love for dust 514 to be made just not the way its being plannedoh and soor i placed this under jita wasnt paying attention i dont usually post and wont again so dont worry about it
unless youve missed it im deaf i cant hear the official recording
in case youve missed it im deaf i cant hear the official recordingedit wtf is going on with that i pressed edit not quote
the lack of information and communication with the csm is criminal unless you know the secret handshake lurk in certain blogs or run with the incrowd its deathly silence once in awhile i find a link to a website one of them posted on for their readers update yet the community hears nothing each of csms should visit jita park 2 or 3 times a week to keep us updated on your discussions or at least say hi you act like your a bunch of elitist shtheads
yes i missed it  you only mentioned that you cant listen to the fireside chats not that you cant listen to recordings in general
sorry i mentioned it in the fireside chat thread and presumed youd read it
an the utility of a recording for people that isnt so fluent in spoke english is there is a reason why people ask for written reports the csm can like oral discussions but the usefulness of them for a multilingual audience is small
although cash for ingame bonuses is obviously a desperate moneygrab by ccp as long as these items are subsequently resellable for isk on the ingame marketcontract system it probably doesnt matter in the long run even if noble items end up having more than vanity effects as long as players can buy them for isk nothing really changes nontransferable items bought with cash that affect game play would radically alter the game
the main thing about the aurum scam is that ccp is introducing some rl money sink where i personally would like to see some new game play or improved old game playalso it is harshly inconsistent with game lore why the hell do you need to turn in plex to buy a jeans that costs as much as a t2faction cruiserbc hull or can you offer me some roleplayish explanation whythe nex also means that there is a class of items that is exclusively accessible via rl money where in a sandbox you would like to have all items created by ingame player interaction eg i cant prevent people to buy a jeans nor can i steal them nor can i farm or manufacture them so the nex is a dead thing like seeded market items which by the way have been laborously removed vi pi dead because they dont involve player interactionfinally i see aurum as a redundant mechanism to the plex for isk mechanism and one that binds developer resources for designing basically dead uis and items without gameplay valueonce you introduce items with gameplay value into the aurum shop i fear eve might become a pay to win game where alliances will collect real life money from their members to buy a batch of aurum titans for the next campaignblend this together with some leaked documents bad comms from ccp employees and a long history of releasing halfbaked features and you get some angry emob with virtual pitchforks and virtual torches
greed is goodboycott ccpU25D8 do not buy plex with real cashU25D8 do not buy vanity items from nexU25D8 do not convert plex to aurU25D8 cancel your subscription if you actually pay cash for itU25D8 join the protest in jitaccp is scamming the eve online community and it needs to stopcapsuleers unite
this all is a pointless waste of ammunition ccp will do what it wants and there is nothing you can do to change that had we tried to resolve this matter like people with common sense ccp might have listened and change some things but now that is going to be next to impossible thanks to a few idiots ccp is also a business trying to make money just like any other business would oh and why the hell would you attack concord not the best way to get something done
q how many protesters does it take to change a lightbulb in jitaa ive no idea because ccp keep banning people before i get the answer
i got banned from the help channel for posting thatits crazy how today they have 1 gm 1 senior isd and multiple isds in the help channel who are handing out bans to anyone that dares to mention anything negative one guy posted that my name would be handed to the ccp gistapo for telling that jokehe too was bannedin chaos theory theres a concept known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions most people call it the butterfly effect in eve we call it the sandboxin eve they should call it the caveata warning or proviso of specific stipulations conditions or limitationsthis game may be a sandbox for ccp but it isnt a sandbox for the player base we do what they allow if we disagree we get silence is the ccp business model based on the novel 1984
it was a long time since i started to pay attention to eve and evolution of this game the start was great the game was hardcore and challenging new players and me as one of them had a value to the old players and eve community the first thing i remember about the game was the fact that most of the old players wanted me to join them suggested me a role in this virtual world was willing to help you at the start and find you useful at the same time that was not a charity  that was a cooperation of new and old players something i never saw in other mmo there were some minor balance issues in my opinion but the possible ways to evolve your character was also awesome almost every ship and item was useful for something opening you vast possibilities once you trained the skill required for it it is almost perfect  that what was i thought and hoped it will be polished soonas a player back in those first years of a game i trusted ccp that this game will be running forever the project itself was a success so i was sure that i will not lose my time and money training my skills and buying stuff in game if someone will just decide to close the project and shut down the game eula and ban policy was something scary for me i saw a lot of players was banned almost for nothing it was really hardcore tos with no obligations from the ccp side but i could live with that at that time hoping if i will not break any rules it will be fine after all i trusted ccp the first call for me that my trust is too optimistic was a snowballs nerf it was a rude in my opinion someone just made you a present than just takes it back i dont know if its fine in iceland to do so but in place where i live that gives you no respect at all the message was clear for me  ccp doesnt care about your ingame items and will wipe them just for fun at any time so why collect them my gamestyle had changed accordingly this new message there were no collecting stamps for me in eve anymore no trust in safety of ingame property still some trust about safety of char skills and isk later game had changed more there were lots of thing i like and dont like added to the game but it was somehow ok with me i was sure that ccp do know what are they doing after all the only thing that i was worry about now was game changes affecting my skills lowering my possibilities in this game with every not reasonable nerf and boost that devolves my skills i was losing a bit of trust in my skills safety especially when i had no explanation of what these changes are good for it was a time when metagaming made more and more sence for me and trust to invest my skills for training 1 profession i prefer was fading with a t3 introduction ccp showed us that skills are not so important anymore you can just buy isk and fly a better ship but i still hoped ccp does know what they are doing the bottom line for me was dominion for me  it was ruining the whole sense of what this game is made of it was devolving most of the ships and items in game making them useless the main unique feature of this game  new players that needed for community was ruined completely i was not so sure ccp knows what they are doing anymore i was trying to help ccp at that point applying to csm saw unfinished pi in failure but still hoped ccp will fix the situation asap and make this game fun again instead we were told that we have to wait 18 month before we possibly can play that good game again nothing will be done the trust was lost completely
now time passes by and we get more and more unfinished stuff but more than that ccp want us to pay microtransactions on top of subscription all that free expansions they were announcing as a feature of this game was a lie as a ghost training they were announcing as a feature before they fixed it remember that now answer me a question  can i trust this company that those goods that i will buy as my virtual property through those microtransactions are safe will not ccp just change their mind and nerf them as a snowballs after all what i should pay for where is any guaranties and can i trust them after all should i spend my time and money for nothing when this all can be devolved just for lulz by the company you dont trust sure it is not and everyone with a sense can understand that but we still have a kind of hope that ccp have a basic understanding what they are doing so what we can expect the only option in situation like this for a company  is to force microtransactions so vanity items only is just a beginning and whatever you say there is no trust there is only logic based on history of your actions and breaking your promises acting like a little girl that have no responsibilitiesso this is what i feel about this situation what can be done to solve this puzzle is another story that is starting right now but in any case any human relationships are based on a trust and if you want it to continue you have to make some promises that you will not brake after all
how can we trust people from a country that club baby seals for funcaveatexcept my icelandic mates of course
many things have now been made clearer such as why unlimited local ship fittings were suddenly for no good reason and with no good explanation moved to server and limited to 50 all done and planned months ago so they can later charge for extra save slots theyre limiting existing stuff and features so they can later charge us extra for it
its complete bull and im sad to see the game go down the toilet to me and my brother this game was like the ing promised land where you could cheat anybody out of everything where death was frightening because you could lose everything with a few volleys where if you were persistent enough you could end everything with the click of a buttonhell the guys in iceland seamed pretty damn coolbut the events that took place after incarna a patch that i waited for thinking that it was going to revolutionize gameplay i was so ing wrong what we were shown years before was amazing what we got was a pile of im holding on just for my old friends that still play and the hope that someone will change something or even acknowledge the game communities disappointment but as we all now know that ship has sailedi wont say goodbye eve yet this ones going down with the ship
swg all over again
a troll walks into a bar and asks the barman for a pint of quafethe barman replies im sorry troll but those items are only available to people through our micro transaction market where ccp charge additional funds for playing the gamehe then kicked the troll out and banned him from ever coming back in againthe end
pretty simple question
hillmar stated that all that mattered to him was actions not wordsremaining on the csm is agreeing with him
it would be pretty rad if the csm issued a statement that not only were they all resigning they were unsubscribing and encouraging other players to do the sameand no you cannot haz my stuffs im taking my rorqual down with me sucka
pretty simple answer noresigning is in nearly all cases a pretty weak ineffective way of protesting performed by people who deem themselves so important that they think their ragequitting will change anything
i think they should because yes actions would speak more than words and from the leakscsm cant do much about it
yes they should all step downbut that will not happen as at least mittani will stay to get personal benefits for his brownnosing
i think it would be pretty pointless regardless if you like it or not the csm are few and much more organized than the rest of the comunity even when the dialogue with ccp at this point seems broken they can still work as a focal point for the rest of us as a comunityi think in moments like theese is when csms should be more active than ever not just in the closed csm board but here on the trenches since the first thing that will die on this game if they take on the direction they want will be the comunity organization
csm quitting would be a bad idea at least being around they can put pressure on ccp quitting will just let them go and do anything they want
they need to stay and they need to work with ccp so that the nex is fixed and so that i can play eve this new patch overheats my laptop
quit were balls deep in fighting this  right now
if ccp consulted the csm about microcontractions then fair enough as long as they listened to the csm but rumour is they didnt ask the csm and went ahead anyway so the csm may as well quit since ccp have proved they dont respect the playersi dont want microtransactions hell i didnt want walking in stations either but ccp do what the hell they want it appears
rad if you want eve online to failure cascade and become the next swg perhaps
weve been posting reading talking continuously for the past 2 days to try and get everything sortedill be quitting when theres no room for dialog anymore as bleak as things may be ccp and the csm are talking to one anotherand yes the progress hasnt been what it should have been yetill keep you posted 
i dont support mt for anything other than cosmetic the pricing on current items are bad but i dont care if you want to spend a billion dollars usd around 45 canadian to make your avatar look different i dont care ill laugh at you we all will but thats your deal and this falls firmly into the whatevs campwe do not support mt for things that matter no gold ammo for scorpions no buying ships that are anything other than reskins must have original ship to trade in we dont want producers hosed we dont support any of that because it influences the competitive nature of the game we were never told about any plans for this type of mt and we were assured that this wasnt going to be the direction things go pay for premium play works well on games where you dont have to pay a subscription fee already world of tanks comes to mind but it just adds another mechanism where you feel you have to pay more in order to compete on a game you already pay for i dont approve of this were going to fight to make sure this is never the future of this game i dont think anybody really cares about pay for pretty everybody understands that its meaningless but people do have valid concerns that this merely opens the door and prepares the userbase to be comfortable with mt in general so potentially this dynamic might change the lack of clear assurances in light of all of these leaks is making me concerned politicalspeak for really ing ed offso for now stand by were not letting this one go
the csm quitting would probably be counterproductive even if ccp is trying to shut them out they theoretically have more access to somone important than we do and they are out representation with the devs if they quit who is left to represent us what we need is for them to be figting tooth and nail to get ccp to hear our views and what we as players need to do is be backing them up
first of all thanks to csm for fighting the good fight good lucki only posed the should they quit question after listening to the eve radio interviews where it became pretty clear that at this time ccp does not want your advice or share its mt vision they potentially have a much broader strategy of what they want to accomplish in their new store if you are in talks with ccp is it possible to at least have an open letter from the csm to the community that is what you are doing and outline your goalsi agree wholeheartedly with vile rat regarding mtvanity items and pricing i care not one bit at the price of the monocles however vanity can mean a lot of things mt for engine trails how about cyno effects how about the other three faction cqs when completed being only available via mt i think those are vanity dont you does csms vanity only mean all vanitymyself i really have only two issues1 will mt ever be used outside vanity will people ever buy weapons boosters or other advantages in the noble exchange will actual playable content ever be locked in the noble exchange such as a pilots license to enter some other part of space or mt a license to own a shop in a station 2 station hanger reading through the devblogs i think i have my answer which is gone forever i just want to know for sure that this is it there is absolutely no way we will ever get the hanger view back in its original form with an exit to station optioni dont want anyone to quit especially csm i would not mind understanding a bit more where the csms line is drawn with ccp again good luck in your deliberations
my personal stance is very clear1 i dont want gold ammo ships for  10 damage implants or any other form of pay2win im fine with tshirts ship paint jobs corp logos on ships  outposts that kind of non competitive thing i was ccp to stick with that stance2 i want nex price to be altered ideally between the 2 and 5 price range for the vast majority of the items so that everyone can participate as opposed to the to 10 richest plebs i dont mind 150 monocles as long as everyone can participate to a significant degree3 i want commitment that the option not to load cq stay in place until such time as the performance for docking  loading station environment becomes acceptable read 20 seconds on my machine subjective criteria i know p4 i want clarifications on the 99 program so that fansites are not milked if they manage to recoup even the slightest bit of their cost through adsthose are the things i want right nowim not going to help ccp sugarcoat things to make swallowing the pill easier a few csm members have spent the last 48 hours reading posting talking to ccp and basically doing nothing but serving as a bridge between everyone and ccp
so if this is eves new game enhancements moment then arent we all supposed to be jedi

no to mt
cosmetic
noi have at least 150 people who will leave eve with me if this happens  well go to star wars old republic or something if need be
nowhile im strongly against stuff that would let you get an advantage in game gold ammo etc i also think that it would be better for the game if cosmetic stuff would all be player creatable opening up new microprofessions the sandbox idea that ccp uses in their vidsps i hope when station environments come out all the puiblic station slots would not require tons and tons of aur
no mt of any kind there is a subscription fee in this game
cosmetic only
nosince the nex is already implemented its most likely here to stay however i do strongly wish for it to be removed due to the fact that from here on out it would only be one step futher untill nonvanity items are available

cosmetic onlyi dont see the problem with that nothing game changing nothing really negative at all out of cosmetics i dont see why people would quit over it yet i guarentee some people will pay for them so thats atleast some extra revenue i dont blame them looking at making more money because the fact of the matter is money makes the world go round also ccp has done more free upgrades to this game then any other they call them expandsions sure but if one were to be sold they wouldnt be worth much as a sole retail expansion so sure keep the cosmetics ccp deserves the right to make some extra money but when you literally pay to win such as pay for faction standings while the poorer person in no way shape or form can affordto get something instantly while another has to grind and work for their success is straight up bull i dont think any mt game actually lets you buy straight up reputationfaction perhaps a boost to the amount you gain which i still think in a sandbox game like this is too much one thing i have always loved about this game is you make a name for yourself typically by being an icon of work and skill or luck not your real life cash you spend and with there being only 1 server your name means more and i think p2w will kinda ruin that in a way idk eve is hard keep it that way thats why were here

no it will ruin this game
cosmetic only
cosmetic onlybut i would go one set further and say station only to allow ccp to further expand the game as pod pilots we can buy from the nobel store with plex which could be expanded to buying better quarters and furniture but could also be expanded to a different eve game where you play eve without the ships just play as a nonpod pilot in the stations using aug and a micro transaction system
no
ccp cosmetic only and with a decent prize pleasewtf with the item who cost 4 months of eve ive wanted some of them and would have bought it but damn ccp theyr is a ing limit

nomicro transactions threaten the intergity of the game a game with no intergity isnt worth playingit was one thing to sell plex so someone that coudlnt afford their subscription could do so also plex also made money making in game desirable to buy plex to continue ones own subscription mt is ccp double dipping making the first 2 even harder plex are going to go up making it unatainable for the little guy take mt out

originally i thought no however after much thought and contemplation of the impact that the new system will have on eve i thought in fact noi then decided that ccp couldnt be wrong so it must be me so i began my journey i walked many miles with little food and drink until i reached a mountain which after climbing i began on the peak of said mountain to fast and meditate days passed with visions flashing before my eyes and the mysterys of creation and the world began to slowly unravel to me allowing me to see the truths about life that i had never seen or understood before thats when i realisedno no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

yesyou can already boost your game play artificially with real money through plex what does the new microtransaction system change nothing excepted that plex price in isk wil grow up and even if thats not good for me personally it will make plex buying worthful for those who create them and therefore chinese farmers less attractive is that badother effects on the economy are too hard to predict as eves economy is such a complex thingim for the wait and see

cosmetics  vanity onlyi dont know what the big fuss is about this and why some people have to be complete aholes about itccp has expanded and with expansion comes great expense if people want to pay rl  for ship skins or clothes it makes little difference to the game overall and allows ccp to make some more  on the side why does ccp need more money if dust flops which lets face it wasnt the best idea to develop in the first place without mt it might well be a subscriptions price hike to keep the company on its feet none of us want thiseves micro transactions are different from other games for 2 main reasons1 these items can be destroyed2 they can be brought using isk through buying of a plexwhats the difference between buying a plex for 400mill isk and buying these items with aur orbuying a plex using rl money and buying these itemsans nothing different then eve today both is a loss of 400mill isk and isk can be brought with real  through plexgame changing items on the other hand would be tricky to implement if they are too cheap it would just screw the gameplay up it could have been done and i dont hate ccp for considering it but regardless it would be counter productive with the amount of negative feedback it has received for them to implement it now

big freaking no
nocosmeticonly sounds innocuous in theory but given the contradictions quoted in the beginning of this thread it seems too much like a platform for advantagegiving items for cash to be pushed into the game anyway

cosmetic onlyedit why not no because i understand the argument ccp needs to earn extra bucks now they are in hands of as i understand a venture capital fund and venture capital funds are not sated with steady flow of funds ie subscription into their wallets they want increase they want ebitda growth 152025 per cent per annum subscriptions wont give it to them will mt for monocles do i do not know but i would give it a try rather than see eve closed as a business without growth perspective

cosmetic onlywalk on station avatars and cosmetic items is a good idea for roleplay etc but introducing any other form of item that gives you some advantage for money is an offense for who already pays his subscription and for who makes his best to be a good player
cosmetic onlyi would say this includes things like additional character slots and perhaps a monthly upgrade that allows one additional character on an account to train skills during that month this would not directly affect gameplay for various reasons but would be advantageous none the less for those who dont want to payplay for multiple accounts simultaneously but want additional characters for different roles also for those who literally cant multiclient it would give us the ability to customize our subscriptionid also say having an option to pay for a jump clone might be good rather than paying for standings to allow one if they just have to have more mt options naturally traditional acquisition remains in place as an alternative but i dont see this as hugely impacting gameplay it cant kill my shipfor the record i multiclient and i dont like the idea that ccp wants to double dip from my wallet with game affecting mt options since im already giving them double the monthly allowance mt should always boil down to that would be nifty rather than how the hell am i supposed to work around that
no

cosmetic only
no if they needed to up the subscription for more cash they could and yeah some people might leave i wont be paying any subscription though for an mt game i mean think about it youre paying them in subscription fees to pay their programmers to create more virtual goods that you have to fork out cash for again in microtransactions to maintain the same enjoyment level out of the game that you had before incarna without them take your money and runi did it to soe when they displayed similar behavior and although i never thought ccp would lean the same wayhere they are greedy for more cash nothing but disdain do i have for them now
no cosmetic vanity items only no to pay to win
noit would draw resources to items that only a few would buy and thus not benefit the entire playerbase
noi say this because once you start on the oh well its cosmetic only path you leave the door open for gold ammo and ships later on keep that crap out of the sandbox

cosmetic onlyyeah no issues really with vanity items regardless of the prices that ccp set i doubt i will be buying any of them anyway but if they plan to start adding items that are effectivly going to detract from the ecconomy of eve then that would be a very bad move

cosmetic onlyi like a little differentiation if someone wants to look different then by definition they make my default look more unique if it helps keep our game alive and well then by all rights make cosmetic purchases available i dont care if the guy i just podded has 5000 in clothing on or is wearing freebies so long as he dies the same
no
cosmetic onlyif anyone does remember or sat thru the economic presentation at fanfast they hinted at adding more microtransactions to bring a bit more balance to the economy of eve now im no expert but the gentalmen speaking was its quite possible that this addition is meant to get ppl to use there plex on no consequence items to bring the value of isk up i think the last thing we want is for the game to fail due to our in game greeddisclaimer as said not an expert just looking at this thru unbiased eyes and taking all the factors into account on this topic flame on

cosmetic only  if ccp needs more cashflow so be it but i will not let it happen at my expense
no but since its been stated the nex is here to stay if it stays at vanity items thats somewhat acceptable but it would be nice if mayhaps instead of just getting the item you got a bpc or something and you have to buy some consumers goods via the market to produce themyou cant just have everything because you have money

no absolutely noti have no issues with vanity items that have no ingame effect but i have zero trust that once the mechanism is in place they wont start sneaking in pay to win items this is why i say no to mt if the mechanism is there they will eventually use it

yesi would love to see special ships purchased with microtransactionsi would love to see farming and botting activities ingame replaced by microtransactions think of all the fun you griefers can have by hunting them down and killing those ships in hisec i bet you are going to pod the poor pilots too for added entertainment valueas a matter of fact we already have microtransactions ingame camouflaged as plex so why all the whiningapparently ccp is not running an online game they are running a kindergartenbetter call it plex transactions instead so the kiddies can return safely to their game
noits much easier to draw a definite line than a blurry one do not have micro transactions at all
i would like to see the old hangar view again to spin my ship and easily open the ships cargo bay etc  i want to play a space ship game and not a walk around in stations game where you can fly with a spaceship to another station to walk around 
im trying to follow your point  but i believe the new hanger we have today is a good ideaits an anvenue you have when you have to station spin  or when no one is on to run with hopefully when we get to explore the station we are actually have things to do like sit at tables drink a cocktail or two  or just roam around doing buissness as usual  if you noticed  you dont have to walk at all when you dock up  everything can still be done by menue alone  you can undock from anywhere
step between space and cq is definitely a mustimmersion 1

1and also fix the messagesit doesnt make sense to change a ship and afterwards get a session change timer message telling youre already have way abord when in reality standing in front of the control pannel in your quarter
bring back the old station view
bring back old hangar view make cq optional
bring back the old hangar and restore usabilitymake cq optional the automatically leave the ship when docking is immersionbreaking as is the locked door on every station

supported up to points 3 and 4 cutscenes are uneccessary and should not e any longer than the session timer should they exist at all

main post has been edited to make it clear that the cutscenes should be optional similar to the introduction movie that is played when eve is installed for the first time

yessadly i no longer have any faith in ccp but i hope ccp wakes up in time to listen to the communitys input and save this game
1not sure if ccp cares or has ever cared to listen to this particular message especially at this point in time but that makes it no less laudable for all that it is worthy of support at all times
1why would ccp knowingly release a broken mac client issues were reported as best as could be possible given that the mac singularity client was also broken way before tq release and yet these issues were ignored this is excellence feels cold sm

then the email was deleted in negligence restrictions on frequency have been proposed alreadybetter than character transfers in which there is no ingame mechanic unregulated of tracking people the loophole of escaping reputation is what exists now and that is because it is unregulated name changing is a regulated alternative again better than character transfers since name changing is a regulated alternative instances which would have otherwise become character transfers may be diverted to name changing leading to less unregulated your exploits actions go for it name changes should not transfer in the event of a character transfer reverting to the oldest name andor no character having been transferred will ever be allowed a name change has been proposed already
because monocles also dont get destroyed when you get podded
yes
supportor just add benefits to monocles that are comparable ot those of implants  least you can expect for the price
needs to be optional i miss spinning my shipcq was interesting for about 2 mintues now its annoying enough that i already find myself playing less ill unsub 2 of my 3 accounts if they dont sort it soon i think being shown the door was a hint for those who turn off the station environment  like it or leave
good luck make work

1 to both parts of proposal
would make more sense to remove that crap altogether
best way remove aur completelydirty hack dont force me to see my aur balance  i am not going to buy this crap anyway
tamber has left out the option to remove it all together so here you can vote if you want micro transactions removed altogether and if the existing vanity items should be turned into actual game content ie as lp store rewards for the militia etcplayers will still be able to spend real money on plex and turn it into isks only will there be no additional code in the game for a secondary currency nor will there be a noble exchange isk will remain as the only currency players who want items for their vanity need to obtain them as before through playing the gamecheck the support this topic box and post yes for your support or otherwise leave a commentaryclarification why do i not want plex to be removed too because plex brought many new players into the game it is also the lesser of two evil with the other evil being the goldsellers but in return did we get a playforfree model and it allowed the eve community to grow what we bought with our subscriptions if you so will was an expansion of the eve communityi do not believe in any kind of gain coming from micro transactions for us so i rather would like to see the militia getting some uniforms with which they can identify and distinguish themselves with which then will likely been seen as a gain by a part of the community it will contribute to their game play and makes eve more attractive to all gamers and has got a good chance to increase the community and to provide a longterm value for the game this just as an example of what clothing can be used for items of vanity are not a gain i actually find it hard to come up with things to add to the game that are worse than vanity itemsedit corrected typingedit clarificationps please bump my thread on general discussion which links to this one

no i am not
i will not play a subscription game that also uses microtransactions the two income sources are mutually exclusivesuddenly introducing microtransactions to a game that had gone without them for the better part of a decade is even worse if ccp is in desperate need of more income of which there has been no indication i would rather support raising base subscription price by 12

sorry guys but you have to realize there wont be any turning back from ccp on that pointthere will be microtransactions including vanity items nonvanity would be a suicide from ccp as we can see for a few days and there is nothing we can do about it its pretty sad to have our dev team be some greedy crappy bastards but thats the way it isanyway sure ill support your topic but its hopeless 
yes
quitting eve but as long as my subscription is active for another two more months heres my support
no if microtransactions are removed so too is plex with the removal of plex we get back into the black market of rmt to pay for isk which brings more bots which effects the economythe developers have already said that aurum and their microtransaction model is here to stay so instead of voting to remove it which is hopeless and a waste of effort votes should be tallied and suggestions gathered on ways to improve the system such as voting to ensure it remains entirely vanitybased such as paint jobs for vessels clothes for capsuleers wallpaper for your captains quarters what have you or perhaps asking for differing prices for nex items right now all youre doing is setting yourselves up to get more angry when ccp doesnt listen to your demands when you could have realized in the first place its a hopeless battle focus the energy on bettering and improving the system to something you can agree with instead of wasting time physical and emotional energy
no microtransactions period
ok make the system bpc only make it so i have to use pi to get the raw materials and then turn them into goods using a bpc that i bought with arum make it so i have a store in the station where i can sell my items for iskjust dont have it log in click button then have it majically apear
i dont want to live with a compromised mt system and wont focus any energy into a system that is the antithesis to the spirit of this game my accounts are already unsubscribed and will stay that way as long as they keep pushing mt
with the new instation environment we no longer have the ability to simply right click on our active ships and open their cargoholds instead we have to either go through the ship fitting window or the ship hangerthe former being a bit unwieldy and the latter being nearly maddening open window  right click ship  navigate dropdown to find the cargoholdthis is a little thing granted but this is a heavily used processand the station services window has room for one more shortcut 
you are supposed to make the game more fun to play
hello csm membersi hope this is the best place to put this as i am not sure if an evemail could handle the wall of text i am about to type if the csm would like me to forward this to a regular email or different venue simply drop me an evemail in game and let me knowi have been following the recent protests and amusements here in eve and was told to get in touch with our csm members so that they could take our concerns to the meeting upcoming meeting in reykjavik iceland here are the items i would like to see addressedthe noble store and its futurei have no issue with the noble store as is other than the somewhat absurd pricing i really do not see myself using the wis portion of eve until there is far more content however the future of the noble market really has me concerned i am absolutely 110 against having anything in the store that can alter the in game world in any way whether it is items the gold ammo or services additional ship fitting slots skill remapping factions standing for aurum clothingbling no problem there ship decals still no problem need an additional remap of your stats problem the latest dev blog is not quite clear on this so i would like to see a truly clear statement from them on where this noble market will lead i need to know if no game changingaltering items will be available in the store if we decide to change this policy we will tell you our customers know that the plan is changing and why we are changing it this is my 1 requestcommunication and trust issuesevery bit of rage that has transpired has its root in poor communication from ccp to its players the problem is i have no idea how to solve this issue we have tons of resources that ccp has available the csm their own feedback forumssystems the dev blogs but ccp never seems to take them seriously a lot of the rage was caused when people who care greatly about the game a read communications from ccp that were poorly worded unclear and even a bit confrontationalcondescending or b gave their feedback when it was requested just to see it fall on deaf ears a prime example of the latter is all of the feedback given during the various tests on singularity there are so many issues that are known and reported that just get ignored when the stuff is released to tranquility it is hard enough to trust ccp on issues that they do ask our opinions on just to have it pushed aside as though it was never brought up now the player base has to trust ccp on those things we have no inputs on i think a good first step would be to have this round of csm meetings be extremely open to the eve populace so we can actually see if ccp are serious about regaining our trust and addressing our issuescont
incarna issuesi know someone who has a computer bought within the last year or so his graphics card was toasted by wis while he has enough income to handle that expense there are some serious performance issues with the wis portion of incarna there needs to be a way to adjust the graphic settings for the spacewis portions of incarna individually so that those who might have issues with wis can still use it without gimping the rest of their eve experience on the same note it would be really nice to know how long the temporary ability to bypass wis via the load station environment checkbox will be in game and if there is any plan to have some sort of minimal station environment in the long run i still have loading issues in the station which is really annoying when all i am trying to do is pickup an item and undock like many people have said a simple popup asking if i desire to disembark instead of entering my cq would be great even if the ship spinning deal is gone forever i miss that lastly there is a definite lack of polish to the cq environment i know this is only the first iteration but there are so many lighting clipping and clucky walking issues that it really detracts from the wis experience this is a more miner concern but it definitely adds to the whole why should i care about wisaka the aurum storefront if they seemed to have pushed it through at about 85 completethe 99 dollar developers feethis one is getting worked on by ccp but it would be nice to revoice our concerns that only the people trying to make a profit from ccps ip should need this license fan sites forums free to use isk donation or sites with ads should not have to pay for the fees and should be fine with a free one i see so many wonderful apps sites and features that our player base has created and it really seemed like a slap in the face to them the way this was put out i just want them reminded that this is also an issue that they cannot let slipthose are the items that i really want to see on the table when you talk to ccp hopefully what we hear back will start rejuvenating my lost trust in ccp and that of the other players as well

i dont have questions i have demands1 microtransactionsno microtransactions beyond purely cosmetic value that means paint jobs hats pants clothing ship decals etc if it is not cosmetic pure fluff vanity it is an anathema to the sandbox if a player can sit in a chair then players should make the chair if ccp wants to charge for a paint job for the chair then charge for nicer chairs that are functionally no different from player made chairs and require a player made chair to even produceno rental fees on bars store fronts etc beyond isk no gambling for anything other than iskno faction standings no rental fees for more ship fittings no security status feesfixesbribestheft2 cqmake cq optional by giving us the old hangar and a button to get out of our pod and go into the cq if we want to do that i look forward to walking in stations i do not look forward to walking in lag or being forced into a clothing store for 1000 pantsfix the damn thing  you are melting peoples hardware this horrific cpu and memory eating toy should not have made it out the door it has leaks i have watched them it is not good fix it quality matters beauty fades3 communicatei find it amazing how out of touch you ccp have become with your customers you thought we were mad about the cost of some silly cartoon pants we made a fuss because it is such a joke it just added fuel to growing skepticismyou may have very well done irrevocable harm to the trust of your customers get back in touch with your roots you are not microsoft you are not sony you are not apple  youre a game company we should not be seen as your customers we should be seen as your friends that is the power and value of an independent production house if you can not grasp this you are lost
1  unban any accounts that were banned for linking to  disseminating the fearless newsletter2  get confirmation from ccp that only vanity items will be available for purchase with aur3  get prices in the nex store brought down to a realistic level 4  establish a precedent for ccp to talk to both the csm and the playerbase before launching similar ventures and explain their stance  direction in detail
please do not take away my fun read my concerns
linking my thread aswell for completionhere
make cq optional by giving us the old hangar and a button to get out of our pod and go into the cq if we want to do that thats all  oh and stuff all microtransactions in the station reactors might have some use there
as per popular vote
whatever the questions asked can the csm push ccp for definite answersi dont want to hear the words may could or maybe in ccps responses i want answers that are factual statements not the kinds of answers weve received over the last weekdo not accept vague answers
im somewhat new half a year but love eve just the same as any the only thing i would ask of ccp is that they devote more resources to improving the quality and stability of their product before focusing on expanding and finding new ways to profit from it i have tried very hard to bring other gamer friends of mine to eve but have had no success due to what they all agree is an unpolished game i have also never experienced as many glitches and crashes with any other online game which really makes it a labor of love patience and irrational forgiveness to keep playing as much as i dowith the recent expansion and activation of the noble exchange store it appears to me that quality is taking a back seat to pursuing revenue through the ability to buy virtual property the way so many other gaming companies are these days dont forget that the best way to increase and maintain revenue is by having a product that is good and therefore attracts more customersi really hope this message reaches the ears of a company that cares your community obviously does thank you for any attention you give to my humble input
thatplease make cq optional with a disembark from the ship hanger view
in addition to making it optional could we please make seperate graphics settings for in space and in stations one setting doesnt appear to fit all
will we see mt for nonvanity items
fix glitches that ocure to me these are more impotent then vanity iteamshave good customer support when i need it i need itconcentrate on fixing then updating the gamealow us to lower station walking graphics lower end computers like mine cant suppo
im trying to adress all question you guys present but keep in mind that the question need to be related to the incarna patch or mt reason that t2 ships got a low insurrence is because insurrence covers the basic costs of the resources needed to build it as resource are player driven prices are alot higher then basic costccp wil prolly never change the insurrance policy towards t2 shipsfaction ships as it is ment to be a money sinkkeep putting your questions in thanks guys for helping out
i agree wholeheartedly with both that link and the replies in this thread so far up to post 21 as i write thisthe overall feeling i got from incarna was that it was a rush job to meet release deadline there is well established precedent for delaying a patch if it isnt quite ready yet an option which i feel incarna could have greatly benefited from as evidenced by 34 hotfixes being released within hoursdays of patch day but which for whatever reasons was ignored why was incarna not delayedthe communication breakdown as pointed out before was also evident in the fact that it wasnt until patch day i believe that the patch notes were released again theres precedent for releasing patch notes days or even weeks early and adjusting them as necessary when something doesnt make the patch or gets added at the last minute why was this not doneas for the nex personally i dont care the vanity items currently on sale are ridiculously overpriced ill just never buy one i do care however when even the idea of nonvanity items gets uttered i already pay a subscription fee which in theory gives me equal access to everything any other subscriber has access to i can live with the idea of losing a ship to a better pvper either through higher sp count better fitting better tactics more friends i cannot live with the idea of losing to someone with a bigger disposable income id like to hear an unequivocal answer to the question will there ever be nonvanity items sold through the nex
first this meeting between ccp and the csm is specifically to address micro transactions and second if there is time after that has been done then maybe this is relevant if they do have that time and its allowable then i dont see why they shouldnt briefly discuss other issues1 make the cq optional and bring back the old hanger bay make it so that we get the option to disembark thus reducing the lagloading times of docking up into the stationthis also make players with older pcs able to play eve againagreed though i could see an alternative to the hangar bay being functional and acceptable the point is not to break immersion while giving pilots a less graphics intensive alternative that is fully functional i like pod spinning personally inside my capsule in my ship2 is ccp planning to introduce nonvanity items items that will enhance the game in any sorti think the answer has been given if not completely the ability to get a bpc or customize a ship extends beyond simple vanity items in incarna related features that doesnt mean they will be introducing modules and items that havent previously existed and there is really no point in selling existing items through micro transactions3 communication we want ccp to communicate in a better way good communication will prevent a crisis like we seen in the past few daysa very good way is to open up a monthly question blog in this blog the most pressing question can be collected and answeredjoin twitter and follow the various devs they are relatively active there and its a far better means of communications than this is based on recent history and past experience i feel that it would be good if ccp incorporated a live dev chat into the new forums moderated and available at specific times4 what was the reason ccp inplemented the mt system and what are the alternative options for mtfrom what i understand ccp hired a new 3d artist to provide the player requested content such as new ship textures clothing and the like and micro transactions were brought into play as a means to help cover the additional development costs while simultaneously providing an isk sink for older wealthier players and corporation and alliance leaders and reducing the existing plex on the market to balance out subscriptions vs incomea large majority of the player base hoards huge amounts of plex while a greater majority relies on them and others to provide those plex on the market for game time conversion this means that yearly subscriptions and subscription income do not necessarily jive and balance out presumeably these changes may be expected to balance this out5 there is many hatred thrown to each other as a token of trust is it possible to pardon a few ppl this to open up a bridge betwean playerbase and ccpno opinion and its not my place to give one6 if microtransaction is here to stay is it possible to lower prices this to make it more accessible for less fortunate playersas i understand the micro transaction system will eventually have available items at multiple pricepoints you may not be able to get a monocle but a new pair of shades maybe essentially the design implies an evolving caste system which differentiates the rich from the poor in terms of isk plex and rl money need not enter into this equation given they are purchaseable on the market and the final use is up to the playerjust my thoughts
1 what about in addition to the check mark there is a drop down for station enviorment pre incarna and post incarna2 clothes or shuttles aka gold shuttles would be fine i think also a side note on this one the char creator seems to have less option then the old one i hope they plan to add more free clothes as time goes on6 i think the prices should be lower across the board67 yes a lot of other issues need to be address but before more content is added the slow deploy seems to work well with this game also being able to pre patch would be nice code is slowly added just not turned on as of yet
wtf is we
hii figure as the csm has now the opportunity to go to iceland and have a meeting with ccp to sort out current and future availability of items vanity or otherwise in the noble exchange now would be a good time to get the community response on the matterplease no chatter spam or offtopic conversation lets keep it readable with only ideas for or against specific availability and see if we can collectively come up with some resolution on this for the csm to considerfor myself it goes as follows with room for changeitems the could be available on nex limited run bpcs of items that can be used in game including painted versions of ships new shuttles and other essentially nongame altering content not including superammo modules or ships standard and vanity clothing for reference i consider the current selection to be for the ultrarich and supervain though it could be worse and even more extravagant limited use items like the cerebral accelerator which can be used to increase hourly sp gain for a limited duration and speed up skill training rather than replace it with direct injection of skillssp not strictly limited to new players but with a time limit on useitems that shouldnt be available on nex trump card items where p2w becomes an absolute reality ie defensive or offensive modules and ships that offer better capabilities than any available in game items in their finished premanufactured form direct sp for aurum purchases otherwise unavailable npc stocked items like ded connections or new skill books but not including limited run bpcs as mentioned aboveincomplete list but its just their for ideas this thread isnt intended to create debate i want you to post your ideas neutrally with regard to what you think should and shouldnt be allowed
x where needed maybe not perfect but i could live with those changes if the game were run that way
signedalthough i believe that the nex store should only involve vanity items such as1 custom ship skins if the ship blows up you have to buy a new skin2 clothes and accessories which are lost should your avatar be killed  hopefully they would allow avatars to be killed in stationwhat i dont want to see in the mt market or anywhere in the game for that matter1 anything that gives you a combat advantage by simply purchasing it with cash2 ridiculous prices  it makes no sense that a pair of jeans and shoes cost more than a battlecruiser
i have to also say that i am not happy with the current way that ccp seems to be taking the game with the introduction of the nex and the extremely over priced vanity items and the possibility of adding attribute enhancing items to that market i do not personaly believe that a micro transaction market should even be in the game the absence there of is part of what has seperated eve from all the other mmos ever since its creation and makes eve such and exciting game to play i personaly would like to see ccp take the micro transaction out of the game completely further more with this micro transactions market being in game and using plex to convert into the currency to purchase these items they are going to drive the cost of plex up therfore making it much harder for those that currently pay for their game play buy using there in game isk to purchase the plex if ccp is not going to listen to the players and do away with the micro transactions then i believe that they are going to loose lots of players from the game i have already heard from lots of players that they are already planning on not renewing there subscriptions once they expire until ccp removes these micro transaction from its content additionaly if they decide to keep the micro transactions in the game then it needs to only have vanity items and nothing that will actualy give a player any sort of advantage in the game for example if it only has paint schemes or clothing or eyeware etc then so be it if a player is willing to purchase these items then this is their choice but i feel that if that ship is destroyed then they should loose the paint scheme etc and if they loose thier pod and wake up in a new clone then they should alos loose the vainty item if they were wearing it just like implants i further believe that the prices of these items should be adjusted to a more reasonable value closer associated with the item currently many of the items in the nex are the same as or more then say for example and fully fitted large pos with all the accessories etc how in the world would a person want to purchase a shirt or monocal that cost them more then a comlete pos system i do no agree with adding items that give anyone and advantage since this will force other to eventualy have no choice but to also purchase these items in order to stay competative with the rest of the players that do purchase these items i hope that the council will be able to convince ccp that what they are currently doing is in the wrong direction
these are not vanity itemsalso  direct sp for aurum purchases and  limited use items like the cerebral accelerator contradict each other
i didnt say they were all vanity items i just dont believe that the store should be restricted to such an extent as only allowing clothes ccp is going to put ships with paint jobs in in one fashion or another allowing limited run bpcs of special items of that sort does 2 things it allows ccp to provide special content like ships with paintjobs and it allows for those items to be essentially economy neutral to quote someone elseyou cannot copy or research a bpc and such items are essentially npc provided while being completely dependent on player manufacturing requirements to enter the game that should satisfy both sides and i would actually like to see this sort of thing obviously i would also prefer ships like the tornado should they enter the game do so as available bpos in game to be researched and developed by the playersand items like the cerebral accelerator do not contradict sp for aurum as a cerebral accelerator only enhances the learning process marginally where instant sp for aur allows someone to theoretically create a 100 million sp toon overnight cerebral accelerators also already exist in the game and may be considered a preexisting mt item which required buying a new retail copy to aquire i did there is a big difference though you might argue over semanticsat any rate this thread isnt intended to create debate i want you to post your ideas neutrally with regard to what you think should and shouldnt be allowed updating first post to properly present this
in my opinion for rmt items to be fair and maintain balance they must meet 2 requirements1 anything that can bought with rmt must also be able to be purchased with isk as long as these items are added to the existing noble exchange this will be the case2 items added to the noble exchange cannot compete with items available on the regular market if this rule is breached then it will destabilise the economycurrent rmt in game meets these criteria if all future additions also meet this criteria i cant see a problem arising from rmtso lets how how the ops suggestions hold upvanity clothing  no competition with regular market this is acceptablecerebral accelerator  if this was added to the noble exchange then it would equally available for isk as it would for real cash therefore the addition of a feature such as this is not relevant to the rmt discussion it is simple a gameplay mechanics issue ie does this feature add something positive to the game or notlimited run bpcs of aesthetic variants  bpcs exist in the regular market you therefore force a player to choose wether to make a regular or stylised version of an item this fractures the market due unpredictable supplydemand issues this does not meet requirements a better suggestion would be to trade in an existing ship plus additional aurum and receive an aesthetically customised one back as long as their is no functional advantage to the custom ship this meets requirementsif anyone can thnk of an item that fits these requirements and still breaks the game please let me know 
the reason the first batch of items was so expensive was to limit the the effect they would have on plex prices if they had of introduced cheap items that everyone wanted in on plex prices would have sky rocketed instead they introduced items that only appeal to a small percentage of the player market thus keeping the initial demand for them low as they add more items for lower prices they can do so gradually which should have very little effect on plex prices overall
my ideas are presented on this threadno convenience charges for eve online
cerebral accelerator type items should not be strictly limited to player control like the old tech ii bpos or alliance ship bpcs these items are game breaking and in the case of old tech ii bpos should probably be removed from the game or reintroduced with added availability if such items are strictly within the realm of player control they essentially give one party the ability to control their existence on the market or hoard their benefits for personal use as an item available strictly through nex or player conversion to market they gain added availability and prices cannot be manipulated by players for personal gains such as is occurring with their current market presence in contractsre bpcs comment this in no way fractures the market it only makes it more difficult to specifically market an item of that sort because you have to determine what players are interested in your idea hands the players the ability to predetermine an existing market and target it without having to determine what players will wantan alternative to that is to sell bpcs that function like regular tech ii bpcs requiring a ship as part of the material list this still allows players to custom build their new ship while allowing you to target the market for that specific ship of course players can optionally just build the ship themselves then use the bpc to customize ithowever if the ship is built from scratch that means it does not target already existing controlled markets like tech ii bpcs do meaning nullsec alliance controlled moons and instead targets base minerals bringing the demand for them up that to me is the better scenariodebating this to bump the thread and maybe gather a little interest while presenting a valid argument
thanks for postingid also like to see some csm responses in this thread and get an idea of what they want with regards to these transactions it behooves the player base to know these things as they are our given representatives
disclaimer i posted this in general discussion but im reposting it here in hopes of getting csm attention and thus ccp attentioni think a problem many people including myself have with the current aurum store is that it bypasses the playerbased economy and creates stuff out of thin air now clothing for characters as an ingame item is completely new so there exists no precedent for it obviously most people are against the idea of nonvanity items being directly for sale in the aurum store also but lets talk about vanity items only for a momenti think it would be better for blueprints bpc or bpo for vanity items only were on the aurum store instead of items that way it would involve the economy players would have to acquire the materials and make them and sell them on the market and ccp can still make money from its megamicrotransaction scheme it would basically be another way for people to exchange real money for isk and would also add more choice for clothing for the players who dont have billions or isk or 60 to blow on a virtual monocleoriginal blueprints are already created out of thin air when bought from npcs so that wouldnt be any different the only difference would be that you spend aurum for them instead of isk players could even buy plex with isk convert them to aurum and go that route probably making a profit on it without having to spend real cashso for instance i could buy a monocle blueprint for some arbitrary amount of aurum manufacture monocles and sell them for isk ccp talked about players designing and making their own clothes and selling them in incarna this would be closer to that than a lame realcash store for ridiculously overpriced clothes and implants
the only problem i see with this is that every item that is created by players is destroyed by players this creates a constant need for production vanity items on the other hand are persistent once a player buy a particular set of jeans they wont ever buy another set of the same pair ccp could change them to be destructible on pod death but then who would ever wear them if they offer no competitive advantage cost real money and are easily destroyed there may be some but thats a very small crowd indeed and i doubt they would keep it up for longthe other reason is that vanity items by their nature demand a wide variety true there isnt that much variety in the store at the moment but im sure no one doubts that the number of items in that store will grow there simply isnt the market volume required to sustain a reasonable variety of player generated itemsas long as items in the noble exchange never compete with items on the real market i cant see how problems would arise
vanity items such as clothes nobut if ever you get ship paint jobs a bpc with part of the material being an orignal ship would workalso if exclusive ships or ammo does come out they should be bpcs also
i want to focus on one item and one item alone for thisthis is the idea of charging for convenience based microtransactionslets start with the ground workaur is here to stay one way or another and to be iterated on this is not changing but we can control what is appropriate to buy for auri am not discussing gold ammononvanity itemsthat asideconvenience based rmt are for charging players to enhance their game play by paying for convenience services provided by the game client or server an explicit example from the greed is good newsletter is the charging for more than 50 fittingsi want to say up front that is a poor and inappropriate item  as well as anything related  for the aur store the reason for this is simple that philosophy builds into the development of the game that inconvenience is a positive design element for the game and that convenience is something you can profit from through aurwe all pay a subscription and expect the absolute highest quality client and product we should all get the same client and noone should be asked to pay more for being less burdened by the software i was the very first to post a thread about the limited fittings saved and i would straight up quit if ccp offered me more fitting space for a price the reason for that would be that is the wrong philosophy to approach the eve client softwareany premise for charging for such a service as more fitting space would be very poorly attributedthe only argument that could be provided to charge for more fitting space would be your fittings cost us more server spacethe counter argument would be very simplewhat about all the items i have stored in hundreds of stations without limit and without exception including up to potentially thousands of individually identified ships shuttles and so forth that i could easily have manufactured or purchased that can be said to consume unreasoanble storage what about the infinite amount of bookmarks that we are permitted to store what about the infinite amount of residual data that we produce interacting with the servers every day that are stored for the future ccp has no issue with unlimited data with only one exception in history where they deleted an abundance of gate bookmarks from the age before warp to 0kmthe second argument is the ship dna code to store a fitting is documented in the wiki and is a very simple line of code and is very much not a large data chunk evelopedia ship dna entrythe third counterargument is that a method can be implemented for client side storage as it was done before the serverside storage meaning no server side storage issues at allto summarize the premise of convenience based rmt is intrinsically to design inconvenience and burden on the player this is not in the spirit of ccps promise to its clients to provide excellence it is also a poor precedence that can lead to finding other opportunities to charge playersthis absolutely must be clarified as an unacceptable form of rmt by the csm on their visit this weekendi will be evemailing this post and communication to the csm members as wellsupport this thread please
10
not to mention that you used to be able to store as many fittings as you liked locally
i invited csm to take part in a thread i created for the purpose of gathering player opinions with strict relavence to micro transactions in eve what you want and what you dont want id appreciate it if you posted something over there including your ideas and opinions
alright well i dont know how you do it but i cant get solo fights unless its 101 not everyone can be as cool as you guys
seems like a good idea butyou do realise that youre asking ccp to create more code more bugs and complicate the game even further probably cause more lagwhat if it bugged and then suddenly you couldnt jump through the gate at allwhile this idea is interesting and i kind of like it i wouldnt want it to be implemented until many other issues in the game are fixed firstand then i read thisyeah i think the op may make things even worse actually
alliance 1 we attack in 10 minsalliance 2 they can only have 12 ships come in at a time camp with 30 shipsalliance 1 jumpalliance 2 fire at will they are bubbled wave one is basically destroyedalliance 2 lol killmails reload guns for next wave
good idea  worth the effort to look into
read what he says again he tells you how
since it seems clear that ccp is determined to go in a direction we dont want we need to find a way to redirect the only way to do that is to come up with ideas that they think will produce as much revenue as theirs and hopefully for the sake of the community they will take the path of least resistancei have therefore the following thoughtsadditional character slots  like many other games you could buy additional character slots and in combination with the next suggestion the idea is potentially attractivecharacter training option  this would allow you to train a second character on your account for one month while your primary is still training it can be purchased multiple times for additional charactersthese two options in combination give us a customized subscription there are people who cant multiboxclient or dont want to play multiple characters at a time who never the less would like a few altsnothing needs to be removed and nothing is added to the game and it cant affect gameplay anymore than a second account affects gameplay which is already a time honored and condoned tradition in eve onlineskill transfer  this will be a hard sell and i fully admit that there will be those people who use it extensively it should be clear that i mean transfer not fast training not free training transfer again nothing is going to be added to the game this is the sort of nex item that should cost 80 dollarsthe way it could work is a character buys an item blank from the nex that they can then use to transfer a skill they know into the blank this removes it from that character that blank can then be bought on the market for isk which can then be used like a skill book with the same requirements to transfer that skill from the blank to the new characterweve added nothing to the game time has still been spent to acquire the skill points used isk has been spent to acquire the skill book by both donor and receiving characters and more isk to acquire the skill blank to transfer that skill to the new character these items could easily come in numerous varieties one for each training multiplier and skill level combination i would think from a lore perspective i think this fits perfectlyi do not see a problem with skill dependency on the part of the skill donor suppose the skill transferred is required for another skill that character has learned most items ships equipment dont merely list the end skill requirement but all the dependent skills that needed to be acquired to get there there are many scenarios of course where this does not hold true but i think it holds with the lore as well this will put intentional gaps into peoples knowledge everything is up for sale even literal chunks of your memoryall these ideas together i would imagine would generate quite a lot of revenue for ccp without affecting our gameplay on the whole or otherwise affecting our market
1no  sorry but im not goin to suggest other forms of mt when i dont want them at all
1 these are not vanity items 
no they are not vanity items but its seems pretty obvious that they are past that already id rather see this than people buying skills period and the ships to go with them this at least preserves the sum total
the player base drew a line in the sand this weekend one that the csm better not cross anything like this is completely unacceptable  mt should be taken out altogether otherwise just use for paint jobs and space barbies full stop nothing that adds any functionality to the game at all should be sold in the nex
then im afraid you are being naive they are not going to reverse course on nex theyve spent too much time on it to abandon it now so they are going to do everything they possibly can to force it through and it will be forced through no matter the cost sad to saybut we can change the course from here we might be able to hold off nonvanity items for a while but not forever once we have the nex its inevitable it will happen eventually so we can come up with better solutions now or let them come up with their own we both know how that will gowe need to establish early on some sort of guideline of what is and is not acceptable things that add game affecting material to the game is the big concern im trying to come up with things that will add options without directly impacting gameplay over all in other words we need a fallback position a plan bone big fear is that people will simply be able to pay real money for skill points so i tried to find a way to make the result possible without simply creating skill points out of thin airprepare for the worst my friends hope for the best
you an 34000 odd others drew a line in the sand some of us are not so restricted in our thinking and have a little room for leeway though i too disagree with the majority of the ops listthere are still some 289000 players who have not voiced their opinion over this the majority of which are still playing as usual despite your attempts at crowd controledit also like to include a link to a thread i have invited the csm to take part in and review at their leisure not even certain they will respond given past history of months now with little to no community involvement while they push their own goals little dig there i know
you take out mt all together and you and many other players ie players who own multiple accounts lose the ability to buy plex with iskin case you didnt realise what you were saying edit im the same as mars theran i dont agree with all the options in the op but i understand that we have to start thinking positively and stop acting like spoiled children who didnt get the birthday party they were hoping for
a suggestion for ccp if you are looking to make money from the aur store think of these options1 sell a complete skill point reset for real  equiv of 45this would mean you lose all injected skills including the books so there is a negative to doing this2 sell a complete faction standing reset for real  equiv of 45this would also mean you lose all standings so any factionnpc standings bar sec status get set to 0003 change the certificate system to have pilot quals ie interceptor pilot logistics pilot battleship pilot and then have some mixed categories ie spec ops master and so on where a number of single ship type certs are needed then when a player unlocks this cert it unlocks a uniform in their choice of color in the nex store for a purchase price of around 34 then people have a reason to show off and its not expencive4 give people a std wardrobe with 5 slots shirtspantsboots of which you can mix and match as you see fit then offer more wardrobe slots for 5 each5 give people fish tanks bed sheets picture frames pinball machines and even awards to hang on their cq walls6 have a larger range of clothes having 6 items at a major patch launch is a pretty big joke7 add custom ship skins not new ships so if guys want to have their scorp look cool they can buy a 510 ship skin that is then always even after the ship is destroyed every scorp you buy would be fitted with the same skin even have multipul skins8 add custom ship paint schemes that you could pick from a std list of color types for each skin9 add the ablilty to buy a bigger cq for 5100 where as you scale up you add a bigger room or add extra roomsthese are just some ideas of things that everyone i have spoken to has been talking aboutshipsammoimplants should never be sold a sandbox is a sandbox everything made in every is made by players or as much as possiblethese are just some ideas feel free to commentplease ensure you just add positive things to this post about what you would like to see sold and the basic price bracketcsm if other people post ideas in here please present these to ccpaur  nex is here to stay now lets give them items that we want at prices we want to pay the whole name micro transactions means exactly that micro ie dollar here dollar there not 60 for 1 item
to be honest im somewhat shocked to see this threadsomeone who isnt a hater  a nice change indeedjust an fyi  option 1 has been argued by some players as a form of giving a player an ingame advantage however its no more advantageous than being able to buy a plex for isk imhoi am not bothering to comment on the rest as im sure therell be plenty of other people to do thatbut hey1 for a thread that is positive and not a pathetic hatemail
due to the recent leeked document veterns of eve have had enough eve pilots do not want to be exploited so that ccp can fund other projects which wouldnt be too bad if the dust project was pc playable no wait its all a load of rubbish dust should fund itself and ccp should scrap this microtransactionsmany of my friends in eve have cancelled subscriptions to hit ccp where it hurts lets get eve back to how we all love it
leaked document was an internal discussion the kind thats common in alot of company practices to see the pros and cons of implementing what could be viable so not actual proof that there going to introduce a game changing mt store into eve
lets hope your right and eve stays as we want it after all we did pay for it to be this way
if only we could trust that ccp are not going to do what is most financially beneficial to them introduce more mts ones that would affect gameplay more directly but unfortunately based on their actions and reactions up until now that seems the most probable outcomeregardless of that even the low amount of mts currently available in the nex are unwelcome to alot of people ccp will have to accept or accept the consequences of inaction that to many of us the monthly fee we pay we believe should enable us access to all the games content if they want to charge us isk for actual acquisition of these items in the game so theyre not just handed out for free if you have a monthly sub which would be silly so be it but like i said even the tiny amount of mts current in the game at this moment in time are for alot of people considered unjustified and unwanted
since no one has asked here yetcan i have your stuff
maybe it is a waste of time but im bumping this anyway
yeah i like the idea of tweaking the ships so that its their unique abilitiesbonuses that set them apart rather than being simply superior in hp and resists etc
i definatly support the removal of the tier system i dont appreciate being herded into a certain hull to keep up with others i would rather choose my own path without having to swallow a whole lot of disadvantage with it
this proposal is entirely open for discussion however i will start by making my recommendation to deal with the current problems with the gallente battleship rangewidely it is believed that the dominix is a useful logistics and a glorious pve drone boat the megathron offers itself as a gunnery specialists wet dream great platform for railgun damage and like all gallente ships it has a decently sized drone bay for dealing with pesky jammers these are the kinds of things i hear regularly from both rookie and veteran players alike similarly they all give the same attributed strengths to each of these two ships rightfully so the dominix has the ability to use a slew of drones depend on the situation and has a decent amount of onboard firepower the megathron is a gun boat we all know and love for being very good at slamming people with antimatter chargeshowever when it comes to the hyperion the same cannot be said its drone bay is not particularly amazing and has no bonuses the bonuses of the hyperion are comparable to the megathron in terms of damage while the hyperion does lack the tracking bonuses of the megathron it does make up for it relatively by having a bonus to armor repair however when people describe the hyperion from their point of view its rather sad they describe it as an overpriced ship that isnt particularly better than any other ship at anything considering that the ship costs just over 3 times the price of a dominix most players will say that for missions and pve they will use a dominix over a hyperion because its not only easier to fly in terms of skills but it also is significantly cheaper the same can be said for the megathron its a ship worthy of its doubled price because with the proper gunnery skills it can rip apart npcs and players alikesimply put i feel the hyperion needs a redesign of its overall roles in combat right now it is a gun boat with tank ability i think it can keep its tank ability and be given another ability my idea give the hyperion the ability to use drone control units right now the hyperion is not particularly different than the other battleship in the gallente battleship range i think giving it an ability that is not only unique in the gallente range but also in all battleships would make it a much more useful shiphonest questions i asked myself why make another drone boat the dominix fills this role pretty wellwhile the dominix is a great ship i fly it regularly i love it it is much suited to sentry drones and some railguns i think making the hyperion capable of using drone control units presents a new possibility for subcapital combat ships whats to stop these hyperions from using say 10 tech two sentry dronesthis is a simple problem that i dont have an amazing solution to besides the dictatorship method of just saying no sentry drones can be used on it my idea is to make its drone bay small enough that you cant use more than 6 or 7 sentries so for example make the drone bay 170 or 195 m3 so it fits 6 or 7 sentry drones but then has 20 m3 left this means you have the choice of sacrificing your ability to use up to 10 drones to use heavy or sentry drones drone control links are relatively expensive when you have to buy 5 of themthe alternative idea available is to make its ability to control extra drones linked to the battleship skill so for example along with insert drone related skill here and 75 bonus to armor repair amount of armor repair systems per level you could add can deploy 1 additional drone per level or make it a role bonus role bonus ability to deploy 5 additional drones the reason i chose drone control units was because then the pilot has to make sacrifice in order to use more drones highs for drones what would the bonus to drones be on this ship besides just numbersi actually was gonna ask you guys if it needed any and if so what should it be
mission runners have paid a dear price for being loyal customers buying gear creating gear selling gear and using mission agents for years a few years ago t2 salvage items dropped on a regular basis while salvaging level 4 missions then for some reason this was taken away and given exclusively to pilots who lived in low security who could salvage t2 ships with the protection of their corps giving them and their corps the exclusive access to these items thus total control over the t2 rigs market this was a mistake level 4 missions are dangerous they require years of dedication to the game in training and practice to take away a prime part of the loot scheme was just wrong we the mission runners of eve the backbone of you pvp players who without us would have to resort to mission running to make money want the t2 salvage back in level 4 missions and dont even think of moving level 4 agents to low sec in exchange thank you for your consideration
i agree with this as well maybe as a comprimise make the faction stuff only drop in low sec but give level 4 missions every where the chance to get t2 items doesnt have to be an outrageus ammount maybe 1 out of every 400 wrecks has some or something better you come up with but this would stimulate people to get back to missions and less afk minning when they dont live in low sec alliances
excuse me but thats simply plain wrongproof can easily be found in the noobcorpswhere ppl skill asap to bs to farm lvl4s safelythat doesnt take years lvl4s are way too easymaybe you can please explain what you mean exactlybecause your wording makes it look simply wrongthats simply plain wrong too at least in this wordingof course mission runners are a part of the income of pvpersbut saying that they need you is wrongsee industrialists see other pvpers who get poppedsee those who marketpvp and shippvp etc
ohh yeah dont underestimate those lv4s despite the predicable behavior of the npcs predicatable reactions and ewar as well as being able to know the exact number of the enimies and location of them before you enter they are quite dangerous did you know they fire missiles and bullets are you those things freaking hurt i have to turn on a shield booster sometimes ok mabey not i fly a nighthawk but if i had a shield booster i might be tempted to turn it on to see my shield go back upt 100 from 98 as it really hurts my feelings when someone shoots me on a serious note if you consider a lv4 mission dangerous and you have been doing this for years you really should just quit eve now your doing something seriously wrong and may i suggest hello kitty online it may be up your alley i just hope its not too much for you and for the record this is comming from a mission runner
i invade lvl4s i scan down and run them in a cane no wait i ran them in a cane because im banned from highsec now  and i did it faster than most others in bs  and lol got even kudos for doing it instead of ing the runners off xd
csm membersplease take this with you to the meeting and remind ccp they have already been caught in the mt lie the image below shows that they ccp have demonstrated they will say whatever they feel they need to placate the masses much like hilmars leaked email we will stay the course
we do not have plans to in no way translates to we will never
agreed however this is the same message that ccp is trying to placate the crowd with now see their dev bloghowever just to prove the point of the fearless newsletter and give you a further understanding of what it is then there are no and never have been plans to sell gold ammo for aurum in fearless people are arguing a point which doesnt even have to be their view they are debating an issue this is another example of how information out of context is no information at allnow here is a quote from the newsletter note that this quote is from page 9 after the comments by the 2 devs the title for the article is evedelivering the goodsvirtual sales in incarnaread the page it is not their to foster debate it is a statement of fact for what ccp has plannedccp is in the process of adopting a virtual salesmodel for its game products while this model hasalways been intended for world of darkness anddust 514 you may be wondering how this willwork in eve online specifically how will this newstrategy unfold in incarnanot all virtual purchases willfocus on customization some willsimply be new items ammunitionships etc that can be purchasedoutrightone other service were lookingat is selling faction standingsso we might selltiny things or batches of consumablegoods for just a few microplex but we would have the optionto sell premium content andservices at a much higher pricepointthus we will not and cannot focuson virtual sales only within the incarnaenvironment nor build thatenvironment around such salesrather we will effect a universalstrategy of microsales throughoutthe eve experiencesure sounds like they have plans for it to mezulus latest blog is bs
here is a quote from the full version of the document not the stripped down version that was posted in eve24 seemingly for no other reason thatn to create a fuss and generate pages views classy establishment that onelinkage
thanks for linking the unedited document i already have it saved as do much of the player base for later i told you sos when ccp lies againthat statement is in damn near every company document on the planet and is used for a general escape clause for crapstorms like thisalso it is designed to apply to the inteviews with the devs such as ccp sound of your wallet draining and ccp john the herothe article on page 9 clearly states what ccps intentions for the future of mt is for evejust like it clearly states thisccp sreegs aka sean conover moved to iceland from theus east coast in september 2010 to become part of thecompany whose game hes played for the past 6 yearsseans favourite thing to do on a weekend is sleepthough you wont catch him snoozing on the job assenior security administrator he polices mischief makersboth within eve as well as at ccpand thisfirst we dont want to glut the virtualmarket with too many offersright out of the gate instead wewant to provide a steady stream ofdigestible goods and services overa long period of time allowing customersto sample and purchase asthey get used to the new modelwe want to cater to longterm customerswho will gradually acquirea taste for our warespretty damn clear the we means ccp as a company no get out of jail free card here ccp wrong game
so when you read an internal document taken out of context theyre liars and they are plotting against youwhen you read multiple official statements expressly targeted at quelling your fears theyre liars and they are plotting against youno wonder ccp is having such a bad day
dev alt newly hired pr firm employee or just someone who drank way too much of the koolaidthe useless blogs from zulu and pann said absolutely nothing as an fyi
massively articlea very very good read this is what other gamers are hearing about this debacle on ccps partthe article is titled the day eve died
i want to have the cq experience when i want to1 old ui  ship spinning  back2 like undock a button  go to cq
agreegive us the old ui and a disembark button to go to cqitll make cq seem like less of a money grab
there are at least 2 other threads about this just sayingsupported
yeah there are more threads saying this but gonna support this as well as this definately needs to be on the things to agree with ccp will also prolong the life of my cpg as it wont be working it so hard all the time
i really wanted to stay out of this but now feel compelled to say something take it how you will this is just my rational hopefully opinion of this whole situation im sure many will disagree and be filled with outrage at my lack of understanding of the big picture but here it is for whatever its worththis current crisis is pointless rmts are not a new phenomenon in eve has everyone forgotten about plex yes those things that someone with a lot of money can buy plenty of turn them into isk then buy themselves a nice fleet of supercarriers a titan or whatever else they want people keep raging that nex will allow people with money to unbalance the game because they will simply buy themselves superiority right plex its been around for a while not just as a means to play the game without paying a monthly sub but as a way to buy whatever one wants if they have the real life money everyone who is complaining about this new system and what it has coming seems to have forgotten about this its already there has been there for a while and everyone seems okay with it take it from me i came back to the game recently after being gone for a few years had a whopping 30 million isk in my wallet well i wanted a new battleship and a hulk and a carrier and blah blah blah so i spent two hundred bucks on plex so i could get all my shiny new toys without grinding for the isk in game is that fair to other players a lot would argue that it isnt but its there and no one seems to have an issue with it so why is everyone suddenly up in arms about these new changes i dont think its any differentso there it is agree disagree flame it doesnt matter it simply is what it is im going back to space now 
id warn others to consider before posting the link if they had it i went looking for it earlier and found links to threads that had been lockedapparently for viewing as well as posting id hate for someone to incur unanticipated discipline in an effort to be helpful
thank you for providing a link to perhaps the major source of all the ragei have been there and read it its mediajournalism  if youve ever studiedpracticedlearned anything about journalism youll know that you cant simply trust everything you read as it is often biasedmediajournalism youd think would be all about getting to the truth and letting the public know all the secrets that massive corporations and governments dont want you to know the sad and unfortunate truth however is that the media is just as greedy as everyone else and will publish anything to get a story and will spin it and twist it to their willmany media firms will even take payments from organisations in return for good exposure for their productsdid you know that something like 90 of all media in the us is owned by one man dont quote me on this im not sure what the figure is he controls tv newspapers website and more  just about everything you read hear and see is what a group of people want you to seereadhear as they slowly brainwash you into thinking what they want you to thinkfor example were lead to believe that milk from cows or other dairy products are virtually a requirement in order to have healthy strong bones etc the truth is cows dont magically create calcium they get it from grass we get enough calcium from other foods and we dont need it from cows the only reason were brought up in our conditioned society led to believe as it is common knowledge that milk products are important is because the dairy industry is an important industry which provides many jobs and peoples livelihoods and the government therefore supports them and gives them plenty of support by paying doctors and health professionals to support and advertise etc etc i know im getting a offtopic but if you can understand my meaning  the point is that you cant trust everything you readi will admit however that ccp doesnt seem to have done much in regards to denying accusations etc or maybe they have and weve just been too busy raging on the forums that weve forgotten to check other areas like ccp zulus dev blogscheers
on the contrary i think now its apparent why the last two new ships were called primae noctisim not finished before we let you leave your ceo must present himself before this playerbase put his head between his knees and kiss his own 
wow thats cleveri have read something very interesting on evenews24com and i will reference a line they use keep in mind that maybe eve news24 by posting this is being a peon to the well planned machinations of people wanting to destroy ccpi cannot provide the link to where i got this from as ive been warned that doing so may result in myself being banned from the forums or at least having this thread lockedclosedi can tell you however that evenews24com the media firm whom has brought you the leaked information and the supposed email from ccp ceo hilmar that evenews24com has openly admitted that there is no proof that the information is in fact legit and that it could just be generated from people bent on ccps destruction however evenews24 does claim to have substantial evidence im still a bit skepticalon another note one of ccp zulus recent dev blogs discusses the leaked newsletter not the email and he specifically says its just a discussion between devs and not the official views of the company in fact its a discussion on a topic among the mmo dev community as a wholei will highlight the key areas of zulus devblog which i highly recommend everyone reads  link is in the op that point out and support above statementsits worth mentioning that the topic of the issue was greed is good as a way to ask a question that would then be debated back and forth and often exaggerated purposefully to draw contrasts and make points the result of that is now widely available on the internetthe opinions and views expressed in fearless are just that opinions and views they are not ccp policy nor are they a reliable source of ccp views as a company the employees who submitted articles to that newsletter did exactly what they were asked to do write about theories and opinions from an exaggerated standand then thiswhile its perfectly fine to disagree and attack ccp over policies or actions we take we think its not cool how individuals that work here have been called out and dragged through the mud due to something they wrote in the internal company newsletter seriously these people were doing their jobs and do not deserve the hate and storm being pointed at themmy take on this is that the employees have been asked to take exaggerated stands ie look at the situation and think of waysideas and have views etc that arent necessarily their own  in order to get a good discussion happening
yeah thats a pretty obvious interpretation mattio and i wouldnt disagree with you on points raised about journalistic ulterior motivesthough you question the validity of what is actually known or believed to be known about this whole ing debacle id simply direct you to here 
i love and respect eve and its community on a level thats hard to really do justice in wordsbet he also loves the republic and democracy
you are missing 2 facts  in order of occurrence fact ccp said vanity only fact the first store type item to be put on the table  plex for remaps a functional changeit was removed due to player attitude problems with it for it to be brought forth at all required senior management to approve etcnow put those in with the letter and the rest of it what you end up with is we will slip them in  ignore what the users say and watch what they do the only way to get a message across when the ceo says they shouldnt listen and discuss is in some form of actionwhat you are seeing is a natural extension of words dont work anymore when that happens all you have left is actions and that goes in 2 directions exodus and rioting
i how my english i not very good but i just had to get this of my chesti joined the eve experience a little over one year ago and right from the start i was very impressed with the way ccp was involved in the eve community when i first read about the csm i thought that it was pretty awesome that ccp gave the player base the freedom to pick a group of players who could represent the communitys opinion on development of eveas the election of the latest csm came near i started reading more about it on the eveo forums and i found there was a lot of negativity towards the csm a lot of the critique had to do with only representative from major alliances had a chance of getting enough votes to getting a spot in the csm another big issue was that the csm was looked upon as mostly a pr stunt and that they had no real power to change anything i didnt pay to much attention to the negative comments and as many others looked through the list of players i could vote for read their points of view and cast my vote the person i voted for didnt make it into the csmnot to long after the election was over the csm gave a talk about the csm then new members and what the csm could do for the eve player base after listening the the speech i felt like what had been said on the forums prior to the election was true the csm was mainly composed of 00 players and all the current major problems according to them had to do with life in 00 at that point i didnt feel like the csm had any intention to improve on the elements of eve which i love and i basically lost all interest in the csm and that they where doingthen the incarna release happened and everyone was looking to ccp and the csm for answers ccp didnt saying anything and the csm said ccp didnt tell them anything and basically just tried to came down the situation ccp decided not to use the advice given be the csm prior the release of ccp zulus first devblog and as the ceo email was released it seemed like ccp had been keeping information hidden from the csm in regards to the mt strategythen ccp decides to release a new dev blog stating that the want to improve on the ccp  player relationship and they want to do meeting with csm and working solving the mt situation and the csm seems all happy and ready to help like everything is business as usualseriously this smells like the cms is so scared to loose the free holidays and what minor influence they have by ccp that when ccp says jump they say how high how can the players see the csm as anything else them a pr stunt the csm looks like puppets ccp can bring out now they need some one on one time with the player baseits funny how player gets banned from the game for posting leaked information on the forums and expressing their opinion while the csm sites passively and does noting only to spring into action when ccp offers a meetingthe next time the csn defends it self by saying ccp didnt tell us anything we know its because you lack the balls and motivation to ask the right questions i hope you enjoy the holidays on iceland
i ask the nex store be shutdown until the full ambulation experience has been built out this way people can manage their expectations after seeing the full ambulation experienced first hand after experiencing ambulation they can then buy things from the nex store with a proper idea of what ambulation game play is going to bring them and how much game play time they can expect to spend in ambulationif ccp does not and ambulation never fulfills expectations of the user base ccp is going to have another nuclear war on their hands similar or worse then they have nowthis time with tens of thousands that have each spent hundreds of dollars worth of virtual vanity items off the nex store in good faith that ambulation is both appealing and worthwhile to them
oh shut up i understand youre all very passionate about eve and dont want it to change in a bad way im the same but theyre just vanity items no harm done yetso until ccp gives us items that enhance characters or give players an ingame advantage you have nothing to complain aboutby all means have fear and give ccp plenty of warning and demand that they make a promise to keep it vanitycosmetic only but this  has gone on for long enoughget over itthreatening to unsub if they bring out the bad stuff as mentioned above or unsubbing like some people already have is enoughyouve all made your point already and i dont think ccp will forget itedit that said i also believe they might actually start listening to csm now and start fixing things rather than just adding shinyuseless things
have you bought anything from the store or plan tocopy paste response similar to the one above
no i havent bought anything should i are you accusing me of being a liar or someone who secretly wants there to be faction ammo etc wtf are you an idiotno absolutely not did you even read my post i clearly state that i dont want stuff like noble ammo etc if ccp introduces stuff like 9 implants and noble ammo and any other stuff you people can think of then i too will be quitting eve all ive said in my posts is that this storm has gone on for long enough and we should start trying to work together peacefully and come up with solutions and that there is nothing wrong with vanity items
csm should push for a ingame survey a vote on the splash screen so that all players can have there say and not just the people who visit the forms  this should go ahead before the csm go to iceland next week
supporting my own topic
so long as theres an option where i can say i dont have a problem with vanity items as long as we never see items that give character enhancement or player advantage other than plex for isk which already exists and works welljust to clarify vanity items are just fashion accessories that no one is being forced to buy and in no way affect the game we love ie there is nothing wrong with them unless eve does in fact break their promise and add nonvanity items to nex storecheersedit im pretty sure ccp wont be backing down on getting rid of the vanity items and the nex store as many players have already made purchases from it  theyre not going to drop it for a bunch of player whore honestly just a little bit unreasonable we all love this game and have immense passion for it and dont want it to be destroyed by microtransaction vanity microtransactions wont destroy eveit is possible that they might lead to vanity items as we all fear but weve all made our point and i seriously doubt that ccp will forget this stormlet us all try to move in a different direction ourselves as the constant  weve been giving ccp over the last few days has been more than enough im sure and lets start working on solutions to problems togetherim sure or at least i hope that ccp will start listening to its player base now theyve said it on the forums just in the last 48hours and perhaps theyll start fixing all the bugs and other problems that weve been asking to have fixed over the last couple of yearsthank you for readingpeace
ive recommended in game surveys before and found the idea met with general derision and generally an attitude that it was immersion breaking csm and their supporters in particular stood out against this as they believed it was circumventing their positions now we dont here from them at all and theyve clearly stated that they wont be paying attention to these forumsrelatively good idea though provided every question was multiple choice and the option to give no answer was available as none of the above
im about to write the blatant obvious but you are my voice and i want my opinion heard at your upcoming emergency meeting with ccpif play 2 win is introduced i will biomass all of my pilots and never look back this includes modules ammo ships standings ship fittings not so much and pretty much anything which can break the economy which is almost everything except vanity only items i still havent seen if these vanity items are destructible or not but they should be for the same reason plex are ie when you die you lose your clothesim sure the majority of the player base will agree with my above pointsplease csm be my voice make me heard
confrimign agreedalso this is a chance a chance to make the main issues heard as many see them stop introducing new shiny that requires fixing all the time fix the core current broken stuff first then make it shinyi typically dont agree with anything mittani says personal issues aside i truely beleive that both he and the csm in general have been aroudn long enough to understand the key issues and the csm meeting notes and issues list is one we all recognise tooi have faith they will represent i am uncertain as to whether anything they say will be taken on board by ccp as usualhelp us obiwanmittanireplace with any other csm you like  dislike youre our only hope
i understand youre all very passionate about eve and dont want it to change in a bad way im the same but theyre just vanity items no harm done yetso until ccp gives us items that enhance characters or give players an ingame advantage you have nothing to complain aboutby all means have fear and give ccp plenty of warning and demand that they make a promise to keep it vanitycosmetic only but this  has gone on for long enoughget over itthreatening to unsub if they bring out the bad stuff as mentioned above or unsubbing like some people already have is enoughthat said i also believe they might actually start listening to csm now and start fixing things rather than just adding shinyuseless thingsyouve all made your point already and i dont think ccp will forget it
after we get the new monocle emoticon for monocle owners i want the option to use two monocles for both of my eyesthis is really urgent and needs to be fixed right away

my monocle got a build in doomsday
theres a lot of heat about the noble store at the moment but a lot of people have issues with the mandatory nature of the captains quartersthe captains quarters should be fully optional because it doesnt have anything to do with the core gameplay of eve  flying spaceshipsi cant grasp that something thats a sidegrade to a game taxes my computer so much while the core game is easy on my computer one of the strong points of eve is that it runs on lowend hardware and i fully understand that you cant keep supporting old hardware cough shaders 20but what the captains quarters ask is top of the line currentday hardware
i agree completely most players have chosen to turn off cq not just because of the hardware issue but because it has nothing to do with the game its like buying an iphone and apple not letting you change the background picture which is displaying information competely irrelevant to the phone your life or anything that can possibly affect you and you cant turn it offthis game is about the ships not the avatar in most other games the avatar how players appear to other players which is what people customize in eve the avatar is just the link to your ship i think ccp failed here poeple care about their ships not the damn picture in the top left corner doing an expansion that would customize the ships futher would have been a far better endeavourccp needs to understand that most of us 1 do not want to look at the cq or have anything to do with it as its extremely impractical very user unfriendly awkward to access and it serves no particular purpose and most of us do not care what our avatar is doing we care about what our bs is doing2 do not have the money to buy a new videocard whenever ccp decides we should have a new one3 do not want to lower our graphics and sacrifice the rest of the game graphics because we cannotwill not buy a new video card4 think that a vastly improved ship hangar would have been infinitely betterthe pilots in eve are not the people who play second life 8 years of the eve business model and 8 years of players are in complete dissagreement with what you have done may as well ask boeing start building suvs and then ask its airline customers to buy themso yeahi agreew ith sjugar
not supporting this how it is worded as there are better proposals out there other than being able to select off or on namely to dock as per preincarna into ship spinning hangar view and having a disembark button for those that want to get out of their space ship gives people both options without flicking a radio button in settings is more immersion friendly as well
its not a bad idea for cq and later on station walking and socialising i like it and for all the hard work that has been done so far to bring it to life you cant just throw it to the junkbut1 graphics  display  load station enviroment to off show the old ui and ship in the station floating or something nice not a picture showing a door that eats little from the system2 improve its performance overheated and overloaded gpus is not a successful performance and your creation will soon become a no choice for every player especially all those who have 23 accounts in the same pc3 leave ship  choice for starters
i wont use the term microtransactions as the current implementation is anything but micro i should also point out that when i say rmt i am not referring to real money trading which usually refers the act of third parties selling assets earned in game for moneyeve has had rmt for a long time ever since the introduction of plex it allows players who dont have much spare time in their real lives to purchase enough in game assets to allow them to experience the game in the manner they wish eg the pilot who just wants to pvp all day can support his expensive ship loss habit with plex the flip side of this and the genius to the system if you ask me is that it also rewards the player who is able to invest more time in the game to support their gameplay without having to spend any real money to do so eg the industrialist who manufactures and sells the ships for the pvp pilot in the previous example to go get blown up inso what we have is a situation where anything that can be bought for isk can also be indirectly bought with real moneyintroduced with incarna was the noble exchange a new in game store that allows players to buy items with eves newest currency aurum aurum was introduced to allow plexs to be broken down in to more manageable chunks players can also use isk to purchase a plex and beak it down in to aurum to purchase items from the noble exchangeso now what we have is a situation where anything that can be bought with real money can also be bought with isk this is now a two way streetso for rmt to be successful in eve by successful i mean profitable for ccp without destroying the game which in turn is also profitable for ccp all items must meet two criteria1 items available for through rmt must also be available to purchase with isk no advantage should be available in game that can only be gained with real money as long as rmt items continue to be added to the noble exchange and no where else they will meet this requirement2 items available for aurum must not compete with items available on the eve market any item offered for aurem that offers an advantage over similar items offered on the regular market would destabilize the economy player sellers should not have to compete with ccp over player buyers iskcurrently all rmt items in game meet these two criteria so how would some of the suggestions being thrown around in the greed is good issue of fearless ccps internal newsletter effect the marketships for aurum  the construction of ships is a big part of the eve economy clearly offering ships for aurum would by bypass a large portion of the game and destabilize the economy this does not meet requirementscustom aesthetic hulls for aurum  trade in a ship from your hanger plus some additional aurum get a prettier but functionally identical ship back this is something that is not available on the player market and as long as they offer no competitive advantage over noncustomized hulls they meet the requirementsfaction standing  this is currently not available for purchase either on the market or on the noble exchange if it were to be introduced on one or the other it would not be an rmt issues as it could still be purchased with isk this now becomes a general gameplay issues and has nothing to do with rmtif someone can come up with a rmt concept that would meet those requirements but still be game breaking please let me know
what i said for a topic i guesssome of these topics i want to reply to some i really dont but why dont sent these things with a vote button in an evemail if you want to have a reply on your topics at least better have a time out on it so that after the voting period has passed my inbox is cleaned again hey now almost sounds like a workable email account doesnt it greetz
supportperhaps the saddest part about all this is how delusional ccp is i for example can afford to dump money into this kind of thing but im not going to why its idiotic and stupid it gets worse when ccp is clearly going to be sucked down the slippery slope of selling ingame nonvanity items if its just a monocle i dont care all having one does is show me who to shoot and laugh at but we all know it isnt going to stay that wayccp neglected to fix longstanding bugs and gameplay issues and instead spent thousands of hours and countless resources to produce incarna is it cool well it looks cool but after about 5 minutes i turned it all off part of that is i could probably boil an egg on my laptop after walking around the cq for three minutesi also find it extraordinarily difficult to become excited by something like dust 514 when ccp has already stated that it will require special hardware to use by special hardware i mean buying a ps3 just to play dust make hybrids work get rid of the dumb bump mechanic which is nothing but a pain in the ass and utterly worthless and so oninstead of blowing all these resources on incarna and ing everybody off in the process did you even consider doing something like adding features tooh the internet spaceships bit for less effort you could have implemented a better control system maybe firing arcs etc making it a little more than getting a good fit and pushing f1 and before someone says that it would kill the servers most of that can be offloaded to the clientsad
the point is to eliminate the speculation decisively speculation is what is doing damage right now people have every right to think the worst and yet also seem to be expected to think the best for no apparent reason and still some others dont even know what to thinknot everyone likes to be a lemming following an mmo off the development cliff many of us do want to know what is going on and why
yuppers

so you  yourself before you go to the bathroomsurely features should be realised when theyre ready not an arbitrary date testing on sisi showed that these issues would occur and ccp pushed on with it anyway
ccp could have made it optional and given us the option of keeping the old hanger view and added a disembark ship option to the ui but oh no to do that would have meant we werent being forced to look the vanity display case that marketing insisted must be front and centre if were to even think about buying these ridiculously overpriced items from the noble storei agree with you 100 manfred  but i dont think its meant for us to have that yetbut if you rich  why not i do like the option but you dont need to participate if you want to see your ship  just face the hanger bay when you dock  otherwise you can do any of the things you usually do from menu they are trying to increase the game play  keep people interested in eve  missions get old and some of us dont like to participate in other player ober fights

to ccp from the communityfvck you too 
if the csm goes to iceland which in of itself is a joke no trip is required prior to ccp unequivocally stating that there will be no selling of nonvanity items then the csm itself is a jokebut im sure you will be going so enjoy the trip paid for by our subs and monocles and pink ammo
hay i didnt buy no stinking pink ammo i specifically bought the omg ponies ammo it may be pink but dammit its the t2 varient of it it hits with a few more ponies behind it
the csm should refuse to go they are going there for nothing more than propaganda purposes they will look foolishand its a way for ccp to try to buy a couple weeks and calm down the protests wont work im afraid my subs are still canceled if ccp announces the removal of rmt from eve ill be back but nothing short of that is acceptable
well consider the fact that the csm is the voice of the community if the csm doesnt go then there will be people who will criticize them for not doing what they were voted in to do so if they go people will criticize them for being tools like those same people every year if they dont go people will wonder why they were even voted into those positions in the first placeso yeah its a loselose situation for the csm
well if they go they can party together in island if they dont they can party at home so winwin imho
csm must go if available forif ccp show no will to sovle this issue and give no words for fixing whats currently broken a huge par of the game then they should resign as a show of protest
if the csm gets player input for points to raise and sticks to them if they can get a removal of the nda or broadcast the meeting live ill eat humble pieuse tippia as a start for points to raise and add what ever else players ask forhowever ccp tries to spin fearless it should not have taken place evidence like the fittings limit and sp reinburstment tool and mt as a whole leads me to think they have futher plans for itpersonally i think its a pr stunt i also dont think csm represents us they just futher there own alliance or want a free tripchance to brown nose for a job prove me wrongstart a thread for input already get it in one place get organized spam it on mega threads get votes going for hotsore points
its a way to make fleet missions a little more interesting
paintjob for ships golden retriever hahahahahhahahapaintjob for outpostsplayer owned structuresengine trails unless they really get added generally some day of course  hahahhahaadvertisements on tv in the quartersadvertising on concord billboardsstrippers in quarters yes im serious  huge business opportunity clothes and accessoirescharacter recustomization sounds not so good but whateverchange of bloodline in line with the abovewell thats what i have thought ofany serious ideas to add 
i had a thread asking for ideas in general discussion
csm is not us  csm rapresents just some of us which is fine stillplease csm members given ur gifted with the privilege of speaking directly with ccpcan you explain us what are you goin to ask them on which points u wont bend yr knees to ccp given looks like the only way ccp is gonna deal with us is via you csm id like to be sure ur goin to represent our mine aswell of course interestsyou might aswell add a list of what csm should sayask to ccp
i already posted what the general protestors and populace wants  some on going issues that i thought of off the top of my head
is there a way you can record either by video or tape the meeting i know you will have to edit certain parts out but to help calm the situation fastest this would be the most efficent route if you cant you cant just a suggestion also more amarr ships like the malleramarr forever
hit this subforum expecting this thread to be here and started by a csm member will be leaving very disappointedi would like them to keep asking why 12 months ago ccp shadow said there were no plans whatsoever to introduce microtransactions in to eve this had to be on their radar back then you cant just pull this out of nowhere issues with the game are on their todo list for years before seeing attention if at all and were expected to believe they suddenly had an idea about microtransactions last month or something
companies that dont fear their customers dont have any ccp has fallen from ineptitude and indifference to entitlement and arrogance
the statement we require from ccp1 aur will never be used to sell items that in any way could even mildly be viewed as pay to win2 if during debate on legit uses of aur the topic of plex comes up as a justification for selling a certain item the item in question will automatically not be eligible for sale with aur plex in its current form already pushes the absolute limit and needs no companyexample saying plex allows players to accomplish xyz therefore it is ok for players to use aur to do xyz means that you automatically lose the debatethinking the existance of plex justifies a certain use of aur means you are already going to far
i like being able to control my ui please allow us the option of removing the aur display in our walletsthe other proposal has multiple issues in it so this one is purely for the aur thing
edit someone beat me to it
not supportedcalling for the resignation of any ccp employee is irresponsiblebesides ccp soundwave is a good guy and a funny as hell guy
i dont know how far kriss actual standpoint on mts are above and beyond vanity and quality of life itemsif what the newsletter says is accurate i wouldnt put it past him to be the one pushing for performance based mts in eveand if thats the case i want him out of ccps offices but i dont want to jump to conclusions at such a skeptical time in eve onlines life
the reasonable people seem to be congregating this thread all 10 of us
thou im against about 60 of this expantion he should not be sacked who in there own way hasnt made a balls up of something and moreso from that leaked pdf which was a hypothetic argument on the pros and cons of aur anybody of the other guys at ccp would be in the same place hahd ccp soundwave not do it so hes became somthing of a fall guy
to the op noand stop wasting forum space with terrible troll threads like this one
stop use alts to troll the treads ccp
no we all should have a second chance and ccp kris should also have a second chancewe all make mistakes be it in the real world or in a virtual world we learn for the mistakes we make and i think ccp have learned the hard way there are issues  pay  30 less was quoted  mt vanity  game changing items real clear and openness where they want eve to goso no ccp kris should have a second chance as we all make mistakes say andor type things we really do not think about firsti spent 5yrs listening to ccp playing eve and learning things i do miss are ouver in local and likes they used to answer questions in game etc etc  but not any morei also understand walking inside station is not easy task to build from scratch we have to give ccp props we have waited for nearly 5yrs they could have made us wait longer where ccp came undone was patchingreleases two a year is no good please revert back to one expansion a year this gives teams more time to give players what we require also allows coders designers and everyone in ccp to not be so pressed pay  this needs sorting so stop trying to do 10 things at once you and your personel are humans not computersso kris deserves a second chance in life like us all 
a game is entertainment not real life if you dont like what you see youre free to go stop acting like 8 year old
support  although i have moved on to flying lokis and proteus refusing to fly tengus cause it feels like cheating it would be nice to have at least one possible configuration for this ship that is worth its isksince i consider the drone and laser subsystems to be broken beyond repair at least add the missing bonus compared to the tengu to the ham subsys so the ship becomes a bit more than a 500 mill ham draek with a little more buffer and smaller sig
if this were to go id say warp to 5 instead of zero only worked on certain ships and only for autopilot not for manual warpingthis still gives time for ships to get ganked even though i hate being on the receiving end of that but its a way of life in eve for othersitd improve time going through gates in that if youre going to get ganked youre going to get scrammed andor webbed the 5km buffer would still allow for it wt5 would give an assist to the playerhowever for me im not much of an afkr and if i do its usually when im in a shuttle going a really long distance via highsec
when you get your heads straight id like to recommend clothes being sold in the lp store for example the serpentis would sell tight leathery clothes while the sanshas nation would sell robe like clothes etc etcor just make a blueprint and add some planetary commodities you need to harvest to create clothes
they wont even consider that it would flood the market and we will be seeing the cloths jettson all ove the systems lol
yes i vote yes absolutelythese specifics of how to do it in the op may or may not be how itll happen but its definitely something i think ccp should considerand all you guys should realisemore money for ccp means bigger budgets for them to spend on eve their customer service divisions and other projects or at least theyll be a little bit happieryou guys must all understand that games companies often struggle or are limited with money budgets when it comes to innovation and reaching for the sky so to speakand to all you pricks who say ccp is greedy youre either very ignorant or havent given it much thought  i know from personal experience working in the games industry that times are tough for many games companies i dont know ccps financial situation however but i know as a game developer your pay is often quite poor considering the amount of hours and stress involved most game developers ive ever spoken with agree that you can forget about getting a mortgage etc coz its simply too riskyits your passion for games that keeps you going however
no i think having 21st century corporations advertising in a game like eve is extremely tacky and immersion breaking i think there are services involving advertising that could work for eve like allowing corporations to advertise on captains quarters for a fee but i think it should be kept to the confines of the eve universe
doesnt bother me either way tbh but no it really means more money to spend on dust and wod development
thereby expanding the eve universe and allowing ccp to reach their goal of being able to provide us with the ultimate scifi experiencethough it would be nice as mentioned by many people before me if they could reinvest the money into resourcesstaff for fixing eves current and longstanding gameplay and ui issues
interesting idea but the eve player base is quite small as an advertising audience i think the revenue ccp earns from it wouldnt be much
interesting subject here when i first step foot in my so called hanger i noticed a big hd tv screen in it why dont they incorperate some type of rental system so we can watch movies and play mini games in it  that revenue alone could fund whats to come on the other side of the hanger  i want to explore the statiion  drink a cocktail while i station spin advertiseing should be kept to in game  people will get too confused otherwise this is just a game and the whole world plays it
i want to use the word partner but the relationship is more that just simple business players have invested quite a bit into the game as have developers from ccp the partnershipmarriage has had its ups and downs but this new phase feels like the last series of blowups before the final divorce the playerbase feels like the ccp partner has decided to take all the resources from the marriage and run off with them the ccp partner apparently feels that the player partner is a completely unreasonable partner and thus the player will no longer see the prior rate of participation without giving much more than heshe was giving previously im not sure if this parable has much life to it so ill leave it here for the csm and readers to see if they feel its usable
divorce ccp now and shes still gunna take half yourstuff as well as all the cash you spent on her anyways
ccp employees invest in the game is a no win situtation if i read what you type correctly that war is amongst them alone all you can hope for is that they are fair and play by the rules
itd be nice to be able to display this on two separate screens to cross reference your sales to your orderssupport for this does not imply any prioritization of thisie i dont know if this should be a high priority upgrade but id like to see people acknowledge it as an upgrade
harveybirdman esquire is the player responsible for the uncalled for highly offensive and disrespectful post about ccp staff member kristoffer touborganddespite constant replies from fellow eve players telling him that he is out of linedespite ccp zulu being forced to write a devblog in relation to the above said postdespite the fact that he is well and truly wrong about kristoffer who was only doing his job  which was being asked to discuss a highly debated topic within the mmo industry  and was really just speaking from an exaggerated hypothetic viewpoint for the pros and cons of microtransactionsdespite his hatteryhe is yet to apologisehe made an entire thread which singled out one person kristoffer touborg and virtually dragged him through the mud words of ccp zulu i therefore see it only fair if an entire thread be made about him harveybirdman esquire and that he make an official apologyand the 3 people who agreed with harvey if you guys wish to apologise youre more than welcome to reply with support if you think harveybirdsman esquire should apologise for his actions
are you afraid that harvey is going to pod you if you post on this threadpost harveybirdman esquire is probably just an alt anyway and perhaps he doesnt even care at least you can show some support for a man whos been unfairly treated
swynet i can tell youre one on the many idiots who need things written in crayon for them so here goes the logoffski trick whatever you want to call it goes for ships as well as pods and i was killing war targets in high sec not killing pods just for fun read the post next time not going to spell everything out for people like you id really enjoy bumping into you in low sec and see whos licking up whose tearsand for people who say that mechanic is there to protect you i simply dont buy that ive been playing eve for years and have never once magically lost my connection in the middle of a fight and if it did happen that still shouldnt give you a get out of jail free card maybe a power failure or whatnot isnt your fault but its not my fault either allowing players such an easy way to escape from a losing battle goes against everything eve claims to be if youre worried about power failures and losing your internet connection stay out of low secif you are not being aggressed and log offlose the connectionasteroid hits the earth and destroys the internetect then fine your shippod should warp out if youre aggressingbeing aggressed then your shippod should go nowhere for five if you loglose powerect its used as an exploit far more than its used as a safety measure or whatever needs to be changed that simple
you are an idiot lots of people have issues with connectivity to eve as the servers are in london and i hope your dumbass does get knocked off line one day and you can experience just what you are asking i hope your dumbass starts to attack someone and then all of a sudden you get knocked off and the person you are attacking turns the table on your dumb ass and you finally log back in to find yourself in a station
no
no
i was thinking of adding some kind of hover lift inside the station hangar so that the user can get closer to the ship than before just like the ones you see in clear skies 3 i admit i almost came to tears when i first saw the reborn clear skies what a glorious scene that will give both a sense of scale and a unique perspective from the traditional camera drone view not to mention making incarna actually more useful as the user will use the avatar as a frame of referencesince i thought that was going to be quite a lot of work enhancing texturemodeling quality for all ships new modes of movement to handle zaxis movement etc so i opted for this insteadedit forgot the support
i still dont understand why captains quarters are a station feature i may be mistaken but arent the ships supposed to have themdepodding in your ship also makes more sense
there are indications that ccp would like to break free of the vanity items model for microtransactions prevalent in the mmo industry ccp prides itself on being a trendsetteri think everyone agrees that microtransactions must fit seamlessly into the eve economy that they must not compete with the eve markethow to do thisimplement aurum in a manner similar to loyalty points i feel this would be a perfectly acceptable solution that serves both the purposes of ccp and the playerbasehow would it work like loyalty point purchases you trade some amount of ingame item plus loyalty points and receive a slightly better item in return in the case of the microtransaction replace loyalty points with aurumvote yes if you support this extension of microtransactions in the gamevote no if you do support this extension of microtransactions
nonononononononoedited for spam zymurgist
if the items available through microtransactions do eventually become character enhancing or stuff like noble ammo etc which will be a bad bad day this would somewhat limit the abuse of the system abuse by taking advantage of the size of a players own personal reallife wallet one would thing at first as they would still have to do some ingame grinding ie players simply dont use their credit card to get an advantage over other playershowever the fact that we have plexs and a player can simply buy isk with their credit card and then use that isk combined with their credit card again to get aurum it wouldnt workperhaps ive misunderstood something im not surebut either way i dont like the idea of having any items available by microtransactions other than vanity items and plexs for iskin the case that ccp sticks with vanitycosmetic items and plexes for isk only this proposal would perhaps make said vanity items like the infamous monocle more affordablei imagine people like the fact that having a monocle as somewhat a rarity is good thing kind of like titans when there were only a few on the server and now everyone has them 
first problem what hapens when you ahve 12000 people who all have this premium service and decide to file petitions within a 24hour period thats several hundred people minimum per hour so unless your also asking ccp to divert its evefunding to some form of expanded customer service division im afraid this idea is ridiculous realistically
not supported there shouldnt be positionable issues to begin with on the scale we are seeing now fix the code and less petitions will be needed
yes
and obligatory gold ship and i win button for everyone
im just going to assume that you havent read anything about the ordeal microsoft wont allow dust on the xbox because ccp wants control over the servers and updates to put it simply as for the pc well they already have a pc game and they want to make a console one ccp originally were going to put it on both platforms but microsoft didnt allow them too i hope i clarified things for you
the inability of the csm to appreciate the current rage shows they are just as out of touch with the wider player base as the ccp management
failhad you been keeping up at all with forum postings blogs and etc ie many multiple forms of communication it would be abundantly clear that the csm is engaged on these issues and in a way that thoroughly indicates they agree with and publicly espouse the viewpoint of the community which elected them that ccp are not listening  or have not been previously we shall have to see what may come as supposedly will be  cannot and should not be laid at their doorstep
incarna is going to happen whether we like it or not since the carbon framework is going to be used for wod anyway we might as well be able to take advantage of it frankly ive been looking forward to ambulation for a long time and think the added immersion is nicethis isnt up for discussion in this topicbut im sure there are things that we can suggest to make improvements to incarna as it standshere are my thoughts1 the use of the old ui in the new environment is clunky i would be happy with something new designed from the ground up for when you arent in your spaceship we have big pretty screens with very limited functionality i was really disappointed when i clicked on the pi screen and just got my si window open to the planets tab give us a cooler planet management ui that we can use in station2 hangar view lorewise it doesnt make sense to decant every time we dock its supposed to be uncomfortable and its kind of odd to plop out naked right at the edge of the hangar itself for anyone to see it would make sense to have a distinction between docking and disembarking this way we can still spin ships and stuff too3 this is sort of related to the first two we lost a little functionality when we got incarna its more of a pain to manage cargo and items between ships and stuff since we cant just double click and get into our ships cargo putting the hangar view back would fix that problem since you could just not disembark if youre doing a lot of shippy things like that people are never going to be happy if functionality is removed from the old way and put in so you have to use incarna however i dont think people would complain if new functionality was added so that people would want to use incarna see coming up with a nifty new window that actually uses the screen instead of a popup to manage and look at our planets come up with a new corp management ui and have that be used on that screen give us more control over the big screen and let us do cool stuff with it4 obviously we want to see the other racial cqs and to be able to do some customization i feel a bit like i live in a captains closet right nowim sure that ccp is working on optimization and stuff so incarna doesnt melt any more genitalsany other thoughts
hello i wanted to make a thread for all the issues for csm to bring up after the incarna stormanyways lets get started1 captains quarters  simply put we want old hanger view with an option go to cq we dont care how or why but cq is laggy on most machines overheats others and just isnt as functional as old hanger2 mt future  the only thing in the eve world u should be able to buy is ship skins no weapons modules or really anything that would change how the game is played vanity items are the only thing that can be sold in the wis world u can sell objects for rooms clothes other avatar accessories3 mt price look the monocle is cool and all but the first thing u release is never the most expensive item we need lots more cheap items for the nex store4 separate graphic settings for cq and eve in space cq takes much more processing then eve even on high detailthe next are issues pre incarna  storm that are still brokenmissions jamming in missions has become intolerable it can take over an hour to do a gurista mission simply because your jammed all day reduce all chances of npc jams be 50 at least as well as reducing number of jamming ships in all missionscontent and future lately many have questioned ccps future plan for eve address this pleasehybrid weapons are broken  personally not sure of this but i see threadnaughtssuper capitals online  eve onlinefaction warfare could use improvements more to come if needed
im under the impression that this summit is to focus basically entirely on microtransactionsbasically there are two particular circumstances where microtransaction stuff is unacceptable1 where it provides someone an advantage over another player in any way ingame this includes things like faction standing extra skillpoints but not things like monocles and ship skins2 where it competes with players in any way in the economy this includes things like skinned ships without input of something manufactured by a player
true to the nature of the sandbox anything purchased in the nex that is related to either your character or ship should be destructable ie when podded you lose your clothes when fancy painted ship is destroyed you dont get to apply the paint again to another ship
seperate settings for cq space is badly neededtest server forums needs dev feed back of some kind dayly expand the bug hunter program to atleast give a summery of there know issues and a ccp response to them weeklyeach team should be required to start a thread under there name in the forums with what they are working on and keep it updated and answer questions post there instatus of the last csm minutes when will they be outstatus of the q and a thread are we going to get more answers this week or do we have to wait another weeka clear seperation and clear communication about the pay to win stratagie that will be present in wod and dust and how to keep eve vanity item onlypay to win items should not be usable in dust eve combat or if they are they should be easily targetable from orbit dust on dust combat for planets can use the pay to win but have to take the chance that eve players will form up battle fleets just to kill pay to win items
well said 1  2 especiallywe want a commitment from ccp executive management that aur will not interfere in anyway with our player driven market and that vanity items remain just that no effect on game play nothing that can be used in game should have a means of procurement without including player involvement ie ships ammo control towers faction standing etc 1 fix cq so that those of us who mulitbox can continue to run multiple accounts without having to drop and extra 500 on a new gpu or run an sli ive run 4 accounts on my rig for the last 4 years this is not possible anymore give me the option to undock from my ship and venture into cq when i want even if you fix 2 youre still gonna lose subs from those that can no longer multibox as they used to im not gonna keep 4 accounts if i can barely run 22 although i absolutely hate mti can live with solely cosmeticvanity items that means absolutely nothing that affects game play as a side note you may find players more willing to accept mt if you offered some type of interesting accessories ie i would love to see some of my alts running around in a bikini or nice underwears
this i dont mind if ship spinning cant come back and im sure ccp would consider very carefully before they created any mt items but being forced to leave your pod whenever you dock is both ludicrous fluffwise and needlessly inconvenient to multiboxers
i understand the desire for lots of open communication but writing up daily reports like that does take time i would not approve of bugfixing time being taken up by reportwriting time but occasional communication would be nice
i fully agree with the op
 clarify ccps definition of gold ammo  are services like plex for remap covered last years csm summit after the plex for remap debacle did result in an agreement not to introduce nonvanity mts  apparently this didnt stop ccp from considering the introduction of nonvanity mts in eve neverthelesswhat can ccp tell us to make us believe them that this time is different the general attitude displayed towards the customers in both the fearless issue and hilmars email was pretty dismayinghow does ccp feel about this after taking a step back to reflect about their attitude any plans to adjust the corporate culture in that regard how does ccp feel about its ability to attract and retain top talent the glassdoor reviews are of course anecdotal and suffer from selection bias but the results of the employee satisfaction survey in the leaked fearless seem to confirm the broad story and give raise to concern some players only play eve for a few months others for years the latter ask for a degree of planning dependability that is untypically high for consumerswhat can ccp do to give them assurances without losing the ability to react dynamically to the marketi assume that ccp will agree that vets can be extremely uncomfortable but are essential for the metagame and the success of eve  can the csm be included in the internal companywide messaging of ccp  ie can stuff like companywide newsletters bulletins emails  be forwarded to the csm
full removal of mt store and bringing back ship spinningfixing hybridsgallente as bonus
these two are the most important to me regarding the first one it looks like some of the csm think that a simple option not to load station environment will do the trick they couldnt be more wrong old ship spinning hanger is nonnegotiable see my sig for reasons why
i second all of what this gentleman said and remind ccp that your profits and loss are determined by the players not your experts who think they know what we want the intolerance and deaf ear that youve shown to us in the past is culminating into the backlash youre seeing in and out of game no company has ever survived screwing its own customers with the exception of possibly microsoft and youd be well advised to note that youre driving players offthe best advertisement you have is word of mouth of satisfied players as the pio of my corporation im allowed to speak for our players there is not one without exception player in our corporation who is happy with what ccp is doing you have overburdened our computers nerfd the ship we worked hard to get and turned a total deaf ear to our cries as you keep going this route we will leave i have already seen players turn friends off from playing eve and a couple players have already dropped accounts when you decide to stop me from shutting off my captains quarters i give up you will loose another four accounts because i can no longer play as i wish please remember my words in the future when you need to apply for unemployment you have a good thing here please stop killing it
please print this out make ccp read it all out loud and address every point of it
please for the love of god dont even forget for a second that theyre the ones that owe you not the other way around dont go in there thinking you have to work or make compromises you dont right now you and the playerbase owe ccp nothing please please remember thatdont be turned simply by good manners and pretty words be perfectly willing to say no you may not have much power but you have the power to give them horrendous publicity work with that
full removal of the nex store is for me the only way to start restoring some trust its the only way to remove the shadow of p2w that will now loom over eve because actions speak louder than words
this
my message if i was on the csm1 option to disable  turn off  revert the cq content its a resource hog provides less functionality than previous content2 mt commitment that no core eve game changing items will be available so thats ships modules skills implants ammo bpocs3 mt keep it vanity and fluff and its fine actually id be tempted to pimp out my pve ship with a custom racing stripe 4 but keep working on incarna i get it i can see where youre going but one room no player interaction astounding prices buggy implementation what did you expect us to say
ccp is watching you boycott ccp
seriously increase youre communication with the playerbase asapuse youre magic powers to make a sticky post of youre blogs its by far the best way to see what your doing to protect us
i absolutely agree ive commented many times that the information flow to the community as a whole is spotty and scarce they act like its our duty to track them down and follow their blogs and postings well i thought they worked for us not the other way around if you insist on using only communications channels away from the the community then as the op suggests  get a stickied thread and post your link
start a thread for input already get it in one place get organized spam it on mega threads get votes going for hotsore pointsfs nows the time to prove csm is worth something to arms people
youre is short for you areyoure posting on the eve forumsyour is used to refer to things that are owned by another personenglish is not your second languagethis distinction is subtle but important english is a  of a language i assume its an honest mistake because your thread is otherwise perfectly normaland yes blogs are good
nah swg went down much faster and alot harder like the hindenburg eve is sinking gracefully like a fatguy with icecubes in his pants or the titanic
ccp probably could have gotten away with it if the leaks hadnt come out casting them as snidely whiplash
to the csmthank you for reassuring me that you guys are taking the fight to ccp on this but what the player base really need is information and reassurance mittens we need another fireside chat m8 where you lay out the csms policy and whats been going on
awesome thanks meissa
corporatesht management
proposal not supportedthanks to all csms who have been standing up and attempting to deal with this issue in a manner fully consistent with what the apparently far majority of your constituency is saying this is a great credit otoh quitting as suggested  unless it is in the eventual context of an overwhelmingly massive shuttering of accounts in face of total intransigence  can only be disenfranchising to your constituency and counterproductive to ensuring ccps understanding of this issue that such might not matter anyway is a topic for separate debatebear in mind since ccp has abdicated its responsibilities to properly communicate to and with us the csm are our foremost hope in this issue they are the only ones at this point who may be able to deliver in a moderate and neutral manner what each side  ccps and the player communitys  needs to know to deal with these potentially game and communitybreaking issues in a thoughtful reasoned and reasonable manner  instead of one driven by either timid and ongoing silence coupled with bursts of contemptuous hubris from one side or unchecked emotion and irrational fear of the unknown on the otheri look forward with strained but still intact patience to your followup reports and hope that some measure of sense can be obtained from ccp
i am not going to come here and say i speak for everyone like many others because i do not one thing that caught my eye that i have not seen brought up yet is the idea of adding more slots to the fitting storage tool and selling it in the nex store this should be part of a normal patch or an expansion and not sold to us imo if they decide to do it anyways or anything like that i will stop thinking of eve as having free expansions this is just food for thought i know that was a brain storming mail to begin with hat was leaked but i wanted to make my opinion known thanks
the recent inclusion of a mt shop in eve raises some controversy i personally dont like the way this plex for clothes thing is heading so i decided to propose an evolution of the current plex for isk system to become a more flexible and fair payment system because i want substantial player interaction for rl moneyintroductionfrom a game lore point of view most hard rules are enforced by concord the plex is a renewable licence to fly a spaceship so lets replace the plex with the more flexbile concept of concord influence in a ratio of 110 and be more granular about the things that concord may allow or deny youci cost  privilege0  you can log in and do stuff in station and use shuttles and your pod in space12525  you are allowed to use a frigatecruiserbscapital ship without getting outlawedconcordokken2510  the cost of a tech schooluniversity membership where 2 is for basic skill 5 for rank 4 skills and 10 is for rank 8 skills51020  cost per month for starbase charter for sml towers once the charter runs out concord clears the moon10  concord bribe to reset your sec status50  concord bribe to instantly flag a single player in space to outlaw for 15 mins75  concord fee for raising the sec status of a lowsov nullsec system to 05 for a month120  concord bribe to set any high sec system to 04 sec status for 24 hours limited to once a month240  concord fee to overlook cynos and capital ships in a high sec system for 24 hoursif you set old plex to cip to something like 1 to 10 with the above scheme a capital ship pilot will cost 35 plex per month a noob will be able to start his career for way less than a plex per month making eve more attractive for new players a very basic game play as station dweller would be f2pnew rl money sink would be the concord bribe system for the equivalent of 5 plexes you can seriously grief a player for a few more bucks you can turn jita into a ffa maybe this even has to be far more expensive to prevent excessive abuse travel advisory due to a sansha fanatics suicide attack on concord communications facilities in jita there might be a temporary disruption of concord services we advise unarmed craft to dock or leave system
i enjoy high sec ganking i do it very often however i think it should be made a bit more difrficult as its easier and safer then ratting in 00 imo at least
serious internet politician for president
nah this would be more like the combat upgrade we arent forced to pick proffesions yet though with the recent influx of whiney wow players along with the outrage of bitter vets i unfortuneatly dont see proffesions being that far off
hi allwill monetizing your apps and services be an issue also
1 mt can sell only cosmetic stuff for perso or ship2 pls ccp make a planification for all modification you would like to make in eve add planner on eve gate with this structure every player can see when the update will be ready and who work on them  exemple balancing pos et industry that will be more clear for everybody
good stuff
i was discussing this on our alliance forums and this is the basic idea i put across regarding the balancing of supersdreads and general stuffwarning may contain a wall of textsorry for double post i tired to trim it down i swear pall of eve is risk vs reward but to me supers are not at risk 90 of the time they are used due to the multiple things that are stacking in their favourdreads carriers and rorquals are capitals each of them has a type of siege that you use to get the most out of their designed role and they are all designed to be a risk reward deal by limiting things that might help you like jumping out moving rr and suchso to the pointscs should have a siege module add 1 high slot for a semiexpensive item say 300500mil that an sc can fit only 1 of reduce the stats on them from 3 per level to 1 per level of carrier this makes them a glorified carrier with fighter bombers unless you use this module all the usual stats are restored when the module is activated so we got the reward in the form of the crazy dps now the risk in siege the sc should not be able to jump for 10 mins and the log of timer should be increased to that full 10 also they cannot get rr in this time but everything else remains the same including the ability to movewarp and the 3 min log off timer outside of siegei also think titans should have the same penalties for using a dd and need a slight nerf to tracking nothing major if you want to hit that bs u got to compromise alot for it but it should be possible imo 10 mins is over 3 times the current log of timer and in theory you would require 13 the subcap fleet to do the job without nerfing the dps tank and prestige that comes with a super
next topic super blobs what dothe faithful dread killed so often it hurts to use them they are clearly the bottom end of the scale when it comes to the risk vs reward  so imo they need to keep siege but have a base damage and tracking upgrade aswell as siege giving a  5 resists per level of tactical reconfiguration 2025 resists the rev would need a balance here is enough to make you able to get a rep cycle off in siege making you last even longer aswell as make you less squishy vs a super cap and the isk vs isk numbers suddenly favour he guy with more friends in dreads to compensate they should also have the 10 min no logoffski timer a dread in siege cant hit subcaps so its already balanced their and it would make a group of them into a force to scare off a sc or titanbut this still leaves the issue of the current super blobs if they field 90 scs your gona need several hundred dreads even with the changes i suggested and even then 3 scs can insta pop a revelation that already has that 25 boost to resistsmy original thought was limit the number of supers that can be in a system which is a terrible ideaso my idea is this instead limit the mass that can jump to a cynothis doesnt limit the number u can put in system but means you will need a lot more cynos to get in a 90 man super blobthe next problem with the idea lies in ccps idea of size when it comes to capitalsan archon has a mass of 111 billion kgan aeon is 151 billion kgmake the aeon have a mass several times an archon and maby this is in businessheres what im thinkingfyi i picked amarr but the numbers can do all racesabandons should have a mass of 100 mil kg thats pretty damn close to what we got nowarchons have a 15 bil mass they aint tinyrevelation in at 2 bil because meh balance imoaeons have a mass of 5 bil huge hike up but its a super cry some moretitans in at 10 bil because they are huge in comparison to an aeonreferencethe cynos mass allowance should be based on the cyno skill or a new skill and possibly allow a t2 variant of the cynobasic cyno is 5bil mass  5bil per level of cyno or new skill up to a max of 30 bilto the skip types with my suggested numbes that is600 abbadons aka is not gonna really screw with titan jump portalarchons get 40 from 1 cyno i cant name the last time i saw 40 carriers in 1 cyno so no changerevs in at 30 possibly an issue but if they get the buffs stated it would balance it outaeons 6 per cyno oh boy now we hit the money this limits them quite extensively as to how they can get aroundtitans in at 3 per see above for oh  commentnext issue limiting supers like this means its easier to defend space which is primarily where u will see alot of supers so in response to that ide say remove at least a timer from the ihubs to balance that outide say the 50 armor timer because its just silly to meandmake cyno beacons have a mass limit of 20 bil aka 2 titans 4 scs every 5 mins they can put supers in faster but at a staggered pace and a set location in system to me this means that fighting in sov war will either be fast and big with multiple red cynos going up and a defence fleet is not gonna make the first timer or it would be slowed down with supers being added to the mix as time goes on and as it becomes safe to pop cynos either way its much more fun for subcaps with alot more chances of supers being denied access into a system or getting a case of the deadsalso imo cynos should either a go down once the mass limit is hit and the cyno ship can gtfo or b the cyno should break possibly taking the ship out with itta da you have the damage tank price and e of having a super aswell as the balance across subcaps having issues when they encounter one defending space and dusting off that old dreadtddr make scs and titans have a 10 min log off timer if they decide to go for a full on fight dreads get a tank buff cynos need mass limits tweak mass on ships to get less supers per cyno balance sov warfare to be less reinforcement timers to balance the added ease of defence due to this changesorry for the text wallthoughts and flames
to fozi honestly think that if ccp were to implement your suggestions eve would instantly become a better and more balanced game fully supportedlets hope this gets done asap
after weeks of a minor comeback all the way up to no 18 on the list the megathron has dipped back down to the 20th most popular ship on evekillnet on the bright side its still the no 1 gallente hull on the listnow that incarna feature has been deployed please abandon it like all other features you implement and fix gallente instead
whats also messed up is that 13 of the 20 ships on that list are minmatar hulls great balance
i dont play nullsec but i can tell you that until resources are distributed evenly then there will always be a jita theres no enough moongoo to saturate 2 markets though if 2 could be set up thatd be a real improvement ontop of that theres the different regional variations in ice etc they need moving and distributing from a central point as to t3 stuff theres nowhere near enough to saturate just the one market usually if you want to really do t3 get into a wh or just make friends with wh people and do some trade hiregarding the scorched earth ideas i really think thats something ccp should take a real look into currently the way 00 sov is fought seems to involve big blobs of supercapitals and all sorts of stuff yeh we in whs laugh at your supers with the addition of mini objectives to cripple systems economically based on a timercycle method you reduce the entry level to sov warfare a gang of rifters fitted out with the module probably a high slot item no cloak can be used when it is on we want fights not cloaks could then do some serious damage if it was organised enough turn off those ihub upgrades except the sov ones thatd be bad disrupt the asteroid belts do all sorts of damage you can fit it into the lore without much trouble bonus points

nomicrotransactions kill the sandbox we want more content if they have to raise subscription to do it so be itwith in reason repeat within reason meaning less than 5 dollars more  by content i dont mean just bull clothing i mean some new missions would be nice i have been playing eve since 2007 and i havent seen any new agent content in the last year have your non vanity items if you want just seed em on the market or better still seed the bpos and let us make the stuff thats how the sandbox is supposed to work either way there is better ways to make money than putting the squeeze to your loyal followers i hope you dont fill our sandbox with concreteseriously we are passionate cause we love this game and would hate to see it die
no it isnt with the spirit of a virtual game to sell virtual items for real money just because everyone else is jumping off a cliff do you join in
no
yesim all for the vanity items side of the new aurum system as it has no impact on the game  appart from the people who will be primary if you have a silly eye thingy on your portrait im even up for so called gold ammo and other such items but only if they come in the form of a bpo though i do understand that the leaked memo was a brainstorming memo and nothing more where i would draw the line is the sale of sp as it takes time and effort to get the better ships and the skill to fly them also takes time to master my 2 pennys

cosmetic onlyive been playing microtransaction supported games for many years now paying only occasional token charges not because i wanted something from the store but rather because i felt that a free game was good enough to pay for this will not happen with eve as the game is not free so there is no need for me to even remember what the cash shop icon looks likeeve has been dying since before i joined in 2006 and yet i am still playing it now in 2011 i will probably still be playing it many years from now shrugging my shoulders in a silent so what while the forums invent new creative ways to hyperventilate with every expansioncash shop so what goes to fit a new fleet bs

no there is a reason i cant play all the other mmos with cash shops for more than 28 minutes its the complexity of this game and a playerbase that take great pride in their game that no other seems to have remove the complexity by allowing shortcuts in exchange for real money and enjoy having a mediocre game full of people that cannot think for themselves and we thought local chat in jita has been terrible all this time just wait

yes this makes sense to me from both a performance perspective and an rpimmersion perspective toothe npe could still start in the cq then move on to either the hangar viewin space undocking directly from the cq should be an option as should switching back and forth between the cq and hangar view eg via a leave podenter pod button you could even make the pod on the cq balcony interactive so its possible to enter it from thereo7mag

i like wis i do but as a mission runner docking and undocking alot and being forced to get out of my ship to hand in the mission every time is just not neededa cutscene with the option to make it skipable to disembark from your ship and venture out into the station would be perfect
op i do not think ship spinning should come back for the station view if you want to spin your ship do it in space so i guess for number 1 i would prefer the old hanger view with load station environment offsome ideas to make incarna not quite opti

not sure about the cutscenes as it might increase loading times which are already terrible and make lownullsec station strategy greatly crippledsorry didnt finish 1 about the spaceship spincq thing though i think there should be an option to go straight from cq to space

i support this thread to except the part where i would need to watch my pilot coming out the pod and all that each time i want to enter the station walking enviromentas for over the shoulder fpsish view i think it is fine the way it is no need to throw out dev time just because some people find that still a pointno keep the fps view it is fine

personally i have nothing against the captain quarters and their loading all the time globally but im certainly against it been not optimized right now on my 2gb ram q6600 and nvidia 560 gtx it takes 2530 seconds to load  thats just bull and the bad part is not that it loads 2530 seconds its how it affects the performance of the pc itself during that time even the eve window freezes and thinks a while to execute my commands so practically i cant do anything during that time i have 2 windows usually and if i load 2 of them in space  i get 100110 fps at max quality settings including 8x aa for the 1280x1200 windowsload captain quarters and ups  we have 2 windows at 15 fps tops staring at the wall look at the interactive displays and it goes down to 10 fps on 560 gxt yr kidding me right its absolutely apparent that it is not optimized at all totally absolutely 100 not optimized it would be good to hear if the work is being done and what is the progress on that right now i just have disabled the cq because despite my readiness for the incarna  it just interferes with the game even if i play 1 window  its just hard to do anything while cq are loading and to say the least  why even bother to load cq when i just dock swap the ship and undock in 1520 seconds just that my video card spins its wheels up to 100 cranks up its cooling system and my power supply unit becomes hot as an oven 650w and cranks its cooling from 30 to 100 speed do you know how loud a 120mm fan is at 3000 rpmand i will not start with graphical bugs  10 minutes in cq and i get a few bugs and glitches witch just make it unplayable like avatar stuck at one place and not moving
its always been promised that incarna would be completely optionalthis promise has been broken this needs to be rectified

exactly make no mistake i love the whole cqwalkinginstation thing but the leave your ship button ie optional wouldve been a much better way to do things i thinkand hats off to ccp for making this game its what pcs were made for
cq off should return to spinning shipnot here is the door
yesspaceship spincq
absolutely thisi actually have no softwarehardware problems with incarna i actually like it somewhat aside from eve being a memory hog for some reason and the cough elephant in the room but thats not what this thread is about but a disembark button to actually leave the ship is a must
absolutly yesin fact i dont use it because its mandatory if i could get in the hangar and press a button to see my cq i would do it from time to time now i only see a wall with a door and never get to cq
give us our docked spaceship view back insert a button that says leave hanger to enter into cq wis incarna
damn straight i kinda like cq but i dont always want it not to mention the time it takes
please bring back the hangar and add a button for walking in stations
10
i would love the hangar back with a disembark option as i do miss the functionality and the fun of it it also seems more logical not to unpod for every little thing or quick hangar visit
supported
returning the normal ship spinning view with an option for disembarking would be a winwin situation for everyone
supported
i just have to applaud both of these quotes the first one is very true and the second one is genius
mt doesnt improve the game at all it just allows ccp to sc in cash from some muppets stupid enough to waste itno youre just mad because youve got a little blaster
that is a fantastic idea i could easily get behind that
ccp wants mt then let us keep mt demanding the removal of mt would be overreaching
remove mts and aurum completely
there are already plenty of currencies in eve  isk plex lp navypirate tags  imho everything ingame should be available to purchase for onemore of the above and should involve a player either miningmakinghunting for the item ie not bypassing the ingame economy we dont need another currencythats just my 002isko7mag
remove mts complitly witout eny retunvoite with all my 4 chars
yes
no to micotransactions no to aurium i have been playing since 2007 the gtc to plex to isk works fine dont go no further eve does not and will never need a secondary currency isk is good ccp i hope you dont fill our sandbox with concreteseriously we are passionate cause we love this game and would hate to see it die if you need more cash raise subs a few dollars  note a few means under five feel i need to clarify this in light of ccps idea of micro  and in turn give us some new missions im sure no one would complain if you were honest and said look our production costs are going up and we need to generate a bit more revenue as such rates for playing are going to 1995and the aur well it was a bad idea we will just seed these non vanity items on the market or put em in the lp storeor better yet seed the bpo and let us make em that is how the sandbox has always worked in the past

yes
1 to remove mt
why ruin the perfect system in place now this makes me feel like i play a cheap game
no microtransactions  none all items must be maid by playersremove aurm or my 25 accounts stay cancelled
yesive always been against microtransactions in eve its a subscriptionbased game keep the business model clearthey are also horrible for roleplayers who are into this for immersion 200 million isk for a shirt on the market only one place in the entire universe to buy clothes from with a fake currency called aurum for realall of this content should be tied into gameplay and enhance it instead of being used to milk players
you might as well ask if we want eve to be free and everyone at ccp to work for nothing but since that wont happeni would like to have microtransactions for vanity items only and a lower subscription
no microtransactionin all the games i have played so far the game breaking mechanicinvolved with the mt items has always being game destructiveand killing all the fun involved in those gamesand even if they stayed with the vanity onlythe very pricing of them is just stupidpaying the equivalent of some real life productfor your char to wear  what kind of world are they in 
yes get the poison out altogether
remove the nex all togetherthe reason i say this is that every p2p game that has added a mt store has always in every case started the way nex has so called vanity items within a year all these mt stores have so called power items for salethe company always states just vanity or no plans and yet they wind up doing itremoval is the only way that we can be reassured that it will never happen otherwise just get use to the idea that we as players are being slowly conditioned to except the inevitablei really do hope ccp proves all of us wrong

the noble exchange and vanity products are sickening bull of the highest order this game is going to hell like a rocket

dear csmcan we get a current dev roadmap for eve what features fixes and tweaks are planned for the next year or sotia
given the fact that the indevelopment pages havent been updated since fire was discovered id have to agree with this notion nothing set in stone of course but a general outline of what to expect in the coming months and yearssupported
right now the most limiting factor other than the learning curve for a new player to enter eve is the fixed rate at which skillpoints can be acquired even someone who wants to just go out and tackle in a t1 frig still needs to put a few days of training into it before they can do out and do thatnew characters really should start with all skillpoints required to fly and fit a t1 tackler but thats a different topic altogetherccp should sell skillpoints for rl cashas a rough estimate one can acquire 12 million skillpoints per year so go ahead ccp and sell 1 million skillpoints for 15 or 1 million skillpoints for one plexthis shouldnt jade the bitter vets any further since they didnt work for their skillpoints either they merely paid for them and waited for the training to be completed new players will have the option to skip the wait by paying up or just pay monthly and wait
it was brought up before and the community said hell nothat would give an advantage to someone for spening rl money we as a community do not want non vanity items being bought with rl money even vanity items should be made by players this game is a player driver economy keep it that way
actually what really is true is that there is a very vocal minority who rages against microtransactions on the forums eve has 300k accounts give or take and only a miniscule percentage of those participates in the forums and only a fraction of those who participate express their dismay with mtthis is just to put things in perspective the overwhelming majority of players is either not opposed or doesnt care one way or anotherits pretty obvious that your we didnt include me or people who think along the same lines so please dont pretend that theres any kind of consensus on the issuein addition player consensus is basically irrelevant ccp will do what they want to do anyone whos been playing this game long enough knows that mom nerf carrier nerf aborted capital ship overhaul to name just a few the csm is just a pr tool for show and has no decision making authority or influence over corporate decisions ccp does what it wants and during the few occasions where ccp did something the csm wanted it was a feature that ccp was going to implement anywaycorporations are motivated by money the eve population is stagnant at best concurrent player count has been flat for the past 2 years or so new players dont join eve because its simply not worth their time to spend two years of their life waiting to get into some ship and fit it properlyselling skillpoints would adjust the prices characters fetch on the character bazaar downward but other than that it wouldnt have any substantial impact on the game economywhy shouldnt people who are willing to spend rl money have an advantage gaining an advantage due to ones financial position is the whole point people who have rl money to spend irl have an advantage over those who dont players who have isk to spend ingame have an advantage over those who dontmoney buys advantage everywhere thats the natural order of things the only people who tend to be opposed to this are the poor and communists 
this is the ultimate for me they add skillpoints for cash im never coming backbasically it will allow new players to skip years worth of training training i have spent years on and subsim all for giving newer players a few more sp to player round with at the start used to be 225000 think its now a lowly 5060kstealth cyno alt nerf is stealth
i do respect pros and cons and there is no problem for me to accept other opinions but i have some questions to youi think your are talking about total registered users ever accumulated but how many are activeif you can give me a prove ill change my mindnot opposed ok  but there are no real numbers availablei talked to a lot of player ingame and they were shocked as we explained them the meaning of mt and the possible consequenceswe did it on a normal wayand they simply didnt know what ccp thinks about themthe main problem is some player didnt use their brain and do not think beyond their own nosejust to make it simple 1 you are going to pay twiceif its a f2p game sure no problem eve isnt2 addiding non vanity items will destroy the playerdriven economyim not going to explain this here againfinally it will kill the whole game the very good input given to the forum in rage has been done by vet player andor player with the keen intellect to recognize the direction our game is drifting to
true you have spent time and moneynew players will still spend the same or heck even more if ccp sells sp at a premium money so they are not getting a dealtime yes they are skipping the time you spent but so what arguably you also received entertainment value during the time you spent whereas new players have been missing out on the fun irl each generation has it easier than the previous one the argument that the next generation shouldnt have it easier solely because the previous generation had a hard time isnt valid under any consideration i saw some ccp video ahead of fan fest a couple of years ago where oveur was keeping track of every account and they wouldnt let him go to ff unless its over 300k or some such in either case lets say its only 20000 actual people playing this game its still just a very small percentage of people who are openly upset about this1 no you wont first there is no requirement to participate in mt you can play the game as you normally would and completely ignore mt not spending any rl cash on it second lets say you pay for sp you still arent paying twice since you keep continuing to accumulate sp even after you bought some third and perhaps most importantly you arent paying twice because the purpose of your payment for whatever nonvanity item is to obtain the item at an instant thus receiving the item and freeing up time you are trading money for item and saved opportunity cost to put it in a different light you are paying ccp to buy the free time back you would have spent on the grind2 no it wont ccp isnt stupid whatever nonvanity items they may provide will not be available ingame by playermade means so if they are selling you a faction ship there will be no way for you to get the same faction ship ingame and conceivably it would be a notrade item that cant be transferred to a different character will that kill the current faction ship market hardly because plenty of people will not want to spend rl cash but rather pay isk for faction ships which are available ingamewill selling sp kill the player driven market nope it will merely adjust character valuesnonvanity items is really a different discussion from sp though theres no global downside to start selling sp
you can already do this by buying plex and selling it for enough isk to buy a character
this is a bad idea give it not everyone is on the forums but it is a good sampling of the populationask the thousand in jita and they will tell you unanimously it is a dumb idea
6 implant  250 mil7 implant  1 bil8 implant  25 bil9 implant  5 bil10 implant  10 billooks go to me plus they can be destroyed
obviously this is meant to be the equivalent aurum amount rather than isk not sure if that value has fluctuated yet
simply put no never training times means players are tought patience can you deal with patience 
so your argument is that when a person pays for entertainment time then instead of receiving entertainment value they should be taught patiencemy first character was created on october 28th 2003 i know how eve works i also know that in a day and age where lots of entertainment offers are competing for ones limited time a game which requires you to be patient for two years is doomed
patience is fine it just doesnt exist in this game you can already purchase sp for real money via plex in the character bazaar all this would do is make characters more customizable instead playing a toon somebody else created you can play your own with your own skills name etc can you deal with reality
as still a relatively young player i have to say from my perspective atleast this is something i feel strongly aboutselling sp will break one of the major things that brings people back people take breaks to train long queues sometimes and its stupidity to offer a speedier alternative as it will result in loss of immersion loss of cash as people will get bored quicker by ataining goals fast thus resulting in subs being ended quicker and a detrimental effect on the long term veterans who influence the game overall any scrub just jumping into any ship simply deprives the pilot of experience and means a lack of balance between playersto ask for such a thing is rather idiotic to be honest you break the time investment many people have placed into their characters as well as god knows how many other negative effects think before posting such suggestions
firstly im interested to know how people taking breaks to train long skill queues improves immersion for you it seems like the opposite is truesecond characters are already sold for isk on the character bazaar a brand new player can use plex to purchase a titan pilot and titan on their first day i realize it would cost many thousands of dollars this is theoretical if a 6 implant which would shorten skill queues by a very small amount over a 5 and can be easily lost would break the game then how is the game not already broken its not broken because nothing can replace the experience of playing vs the skill point of a player the rookies in titans will lose the titans regardless of spthird it is clear you are new think about your points before making them
i wasnt debating implants so dont be cute i was talking about direct sp sales implants viable but outright sp sales are idiotic you can feel free to debate this with me but even you will have to admit unless your clueless its a slap in the face of long time players think before talking this topic was not about implants it was about selling sp outright
true i guess when people refer to selling sp i figure there has to be more to it than that straight up sp selling would be out of character even beyond ccps recent pr nightmare it would be like eve just straight up selling isk not plex but hard isk eve wouldnt sell straight sp it would use some other medium i dont think you have a valid fear sorry not being cute just overestimated you
i do agree that this would be bad though thanks for your contribution
preliminary drafti have had much positive feedback including outside this thread and so began a preliminary draft you can find it above there is no massive change merely explanations and expansions to the key notes

this wont gain any traction but i agree with the fundamentals the ceo is the centerpiece for a given company and represents the measure of its ability and the scope of its vision it really doesnt matter how noble the exchange of ideas can potentially be if the leadership has an iron lid on customer respect and service the buck stops at the ceo and so does the responsibility for what ccp is doing to the customers it needs to keepeve online is a dying mmorpg but i dont mean that in the sense that most people are going to take it to mean eve is dying because it is becoming more and more obsolete as time moves forward it is only a matter of time before a serious scifi mmorpg contender displaces eve as the sandbox space game so i can understand ccps progressive moves in a direction that will diversify the ip and compliment the current playerbase with an even broader market with a distinctly stable history of loyaltybut as with anything how you handle change is the marker by which the viability of your future is handled you cannot disrespect your current player base for the sake of future proofing because that will have the effect soe already tested and failed at with swg eve and swg are two completely different games but the base concepts of the coming changes are the same appeal the product to a broader market than originally scoped the problem is that you have to consider the current integration of the product with the market you already haveyes it is true that a company will never grow without new transactions and that accounts on the books are earned income but keeping that earned income is paramount to maintaining a black bottom line perhaps ccp is taking a calculated risk with the loss of accounts vs the gains of the nex but it is a risk that is completely unnecessary and is only going to hurt the most important facets of the community the credibility of ccp and the viability of eve as a marketable product all things stem from those two factors you cant have a solid and loyal customer base without both of those things being maintained entirelysome of us love this game so much we invent new reasons to play or generate ideas to improve it some of mine you have used in the past but not even the most loyal customer can truly overcome losing one of the two aforementioned critical elements of the business foundationdo i know the magic fix for this possibly but without all the relevant data on it neither i nor anyone else is truly qualified to make the hard decisionyou can mr pUFFFDtursson you can save this relationship with one paragraph many of us are waiting to see what happens but you can be certain that you will lose more subscriptions if things are not resolvedsome fires smolder long after the firefighter has drowned the ignition source

hi csmlucky for you you have a month to read the last 5 days of posts not sure how youll keep up but the above is a good start pippas post was also excellenti doubt this really needs to be said you play the game like we do but expansions and patches that contribute rather than reduce bugs were fed up didnt we get a promise about this recently iirc csm told them wed rather wait than rush on incursion and they listened short memories alzheimers clean up current content before we get new stuff balancing and fixing the multitude of problems that exist atm would be just as good as new content vanity only in the nex store and lets get serious here whats the use of going through all the trouble and resources of creating it to have it show up dead on arrival   if  we have to live with it then at least get it to work properly combat wear industrial miner uniforms enough of the tea with the queen uniforms and ask them how much for their shares im still convinced the player base would be better shareholders than the dummies they have now
a good summary of my thoughtsedit oops forgot the thumbs up
you have my 1
i agree whole heartedly1
you have worded my sentiments perfectly support
this is pretty much how i feel about this mess you have my 1the only thing id consider adding is that ccp adds a little more people working on the space flying part we have balancing or team bff for example so it doesnt feel like its been left on minimum attention in favour of the new shiny stuff
1 well summarisedalthough my priority is the need to be able to see what ship your in with cq off and quickly change it drag and drop and load unload cargoes drones when i want to be in and out if station cq will find if want to dock and do admin m
i have one thing to add to this excellent list of issuesmt not prioritizedi want to make sure that no matter how successful or not the mt store becomes that the focus of the development and coding teams will remain on gameplay if every new update has tons of new bling for our ships and bodies but very little fixingrebalancing of broken game mechanics thats not acceptableeve has to be the top priority fix the bugs restore the balance to ships weapons and pos warfare if the art teams can get a few new shirts ready for the store then greateve is a spaceship game with a store to buy virtual goods eve is not a virtual goods management game that allows you to fly spaceships

for me this issue is about non vanity items and the ridiculous cost in the vanity storethey really need to clarify vanity items as well are we going to see bars and shops that have been so loudly trumpeted by ccp being only available through aur will hiring a corp room reflect the price of hiring an office in a stationpersonally i have no problem with vanity items but anything that effects a players tactical or strategic play is a game breakerwhat has really concerned me is the pr disaster of the last four days this is the blame of the ceo hilmars failure to address this situation personally to the player base is appalling leadership of an organisation he needs to get a reality check from thishis trip to gateshead should be cancelled and he should publicly apologise to the player community for being so dismissive scornfull and arrogant towards their feelings the fact he has the arrogance to stand in front of a trade audience that have been laughing at him all weekend is stunning he should be preparing for this meeting with the csm and trying to save his companyccp is clearly in trouble with its clients it clearly has internal problems and dissent they have drifted from disaster to disaster recently and their delivery of content has been appalling words mean nothing it is actions and visible actions by ccp that stop this becoming a bigger diaster than swg
the csm must ask what happened to the old ccpwhat did the old ccp do they listened to what the players wanted examples the players banded together to form sort of alliances what happened ccp introduced alliances into the gameor players lived out of industrials in deep space what did ccp do they introduced posall of these gameplay elements were optional no one was forced to participatewhat is ccp doing nowthey force people to participate on their new content look at how they introduced the new forums look at how they introduced cq  only after massive technical problems for many players they made it optional to turn it offso my questions 1 why is ccp since a few development cycles now enforcing stuff on players that they dont want2 will cq stay optional3 is ccp planing on giving us back the old hangar functionality
while going through all the usual stuff get them to increase the number of saved fittings back to a reasonable number or revert to the old locally saved system its obvious now that it was a shameless attempt to charge us for functionality they removed
i updated all the question with the information given in this thread and only trough mail
ive posted this else where but i think its time that we should have a written constitution copy of my original post followsgiven the recent events i think its time that we had a written constitution a binding social contract between the developers and the players eve is a virtual world and ccp like it or not is the defacto government as citizens of eve we need a constitution so that we can hold ccp to account and ensure that our virtual world develops and progresses in manner that meets everyones needs including the needs of the developer read government to earn more money or raise a little extra cash provided that it doesnt come at the expense of game balance what we need is security and safe knowledge that the game that we all know and love is worth investing in both finacially and morally that we can make bets on the future and know in advance what significant changes are planned and approved by the majority of the player base as a wholeive mentioned before there are some things yet to be developed that i would happily splash out a little cash for every now and again so im not adverse to spending more money but i am adverse to pay to win or pay to change the balance of power or pay to unlock features that we used to get for free etcsome of the items i would like included would be1 online votes for new features with all implications fully explained by the devs2 a release of ccp from including 2 expansions per year quality not quantity3 a five year development plan written in detail available for all players to read and check etc4 all agreed points of policy to be binding and once passed irreversible5 an agreement that the constitution once set up can not be revoked or changed6 no new costly artwork for arts sake unless its part of the written development plan no point to the new augeror etc this will reduce costs etc7 no change foistered upon the community without prior consentim sure you will all think of more please feel free to add if you think a written constitution is a good thing that can benefit both the developers and the player base
what measures will ccp put in place to ensure that the dust514 will not become the first peice of gold ammo for aurumplex when it becomes fully interactive with the eve online universeseeing as us pod pilots are supposed to be able to hire dust players and effect sovpi and as dust514 will be a mt funded game it is most likely that plex or aurum is going to be the currencey of hire
this this is what i want
for my 2isk worth here are my issues in order1 a guarantee that no gameplay affecting items will ever be for sale in nex2 return the ship hanger and make the cq something you click through the hanger to get to
actualy guys no mts at all in eve wie nedd to stand a ground this time if wie will alow now mts in eve that means after some ccp can  on us again and bring soemting more pay  in game witout asking us if wie realy wont it
1 i like the idea of the cerebral accelerator for limited durationhowever i feel itd best be for new players only so that they can catch up to their friends ingame my mate has only just started playing and ive given him implants and a skill plan etc but its taking sooooo lonnngg for him to be able to fit ships and be able to do anything when i take him with me on roams2 in regards to the prices of the current vanity itemsno one is forcing you to buy them  all that needs to happen is for ccp to have more vanity items available and have new items added that are cheap and affordable  this way everyone can showexpress some personality when they play dollhouse and dressups with their avatars the people whore prepared to pay the price for the expensive ones can be even more uniqueexpressive than others or are you the kind of person who gets so jealous youre going to riot in front of your town hall because your neighbor can afford a porsche and you cantalso this3 items from nex storing being destructable i guess ccp wont complain if it means more reoccurring transactions personally however id like the option hypothetically speaking  to take off my best clothes if i knew i was heading into battle4 paint jobs bpcs having to repaint  makes perfect sense5 no convenience charges eg having to pay for 50 fittings  as paying monthly subscriptions we should expect this6 this1edit i know i didnt exactly contribute of any new ideas sorry about that rather i modified some of the ideas already mentioned and justified them i also justified some of other peoples ideas as theyd been picked on by other playerscheersps i know the cerebral accelerator is a character enhancer and i know in many of my other posts that im totally against this kind of thing but if you read the rules ive put forward to govern the use of this i feel youll all agree that it will be quite harmless and wont impact anyone  no more than plex for isk already does at leastpps again no noblegold ammo or 9 implants etc please
ccp have breached the trust of the playerbase we were promised no mt 12 months ago they went ahead we were told mt was vanity only they then tried to introduce a scorpion for salethey have said fearless was an internal discussion document only why discuss what you arent going to introduceto restore trust there is only 1 option the closure and removal of the noble exchange and the complete removal of aurum from our walletsactions speak louder than words
ccp really think they can preload csm via assembly hallsp for  nice onethin end of the wedge
all of it sounds good except cerebral acceleratoronly way that should be accepted is if it can only be used up to a certain point say 1015mil sp for example and just a small boost
just to clarify ccp didnt actually promise they merely said that it wasnt their planalso your post is offtopic this is a thread for ideas  a proactive thread not for pathetic trolling like yourstake it somewhere else hmmkay thx
havent you taken your daily dosis of medicine
permanent or temporary gain is no big difference it would upset the gamebalance whatever balance we might have and further enrage a playerbase that is at the edge especially sp which is the most permanent advantage imaginable in eve is in my opinion an absolute nogo for the store
no no skill points for money no skill point acceleration for money nothing should add gameplay affecting items in exchange for cash the nex should never create something out of thin air that affects game play in the slightest the golden rule should be if you want something figure out how to offset the gameplay effect with a gameplay cost kind of like the conservation of energy it cant be created or destroyed only transformed if i remember right ive suggested elsewhere that one could purchase additional character slots for cash as well as paying for training for 1 extra character on that account you cant train two character simultaneously on one account currently this would allow us to customize our subscription somewhat and is basically the same thing as multiple accounts except that you would only be able to play one character at a time i think this would be an appealing option for people who cant or wont multiclientboxaccountive also suggested skill transfer as an option my reasoning behind this is that it does not add anythign into the game it just moves it the skill had to be trained first the skill bought etc i propose that it work by purchasing an item blank onto which the skill or memory of that skill is transfered the donor loses that skill that item can then be sold on the eve market for isk a prospective buyer must first buy the skill book then use the skill blank to transfer the skill memory to that character 1 blank per skill 1 blank type for each skill level and multiplier combination these are the sorts of items that should cost upwards of 80 dollars and naturally in game would be accordingly pricedthis strikes me as fitting within the lore perfectly everything is up for sale even your memories
this one i wont back down on the rest seem ok but not this onethe ability to deck out your cq better in a single station as your home base would be nice doesnt have to be too ambitious first up just a couple of hotspots for the odd potted plant or sculpture not all of them have to be mt either you might collect a chunk of wreckage from a ship and display that as a trophy possibly with a minor aur charge for mounting or everyones favourite corpse tubes buy the tube for aur it comes with a plaque that alters to show the name of the corpse the corpse however you have to supply yourself
give an inch and they take a mileallowing just a small hole in a boat will cause it to sink eve already has enough holes letting water in
but itd be only for characters who have less than say 16mil sp like the 100 bonus new character used to get before the scrapping of learning skillsall thats going to happen is a character will be able to go from 50k or watever the starting sp amount is to something like 16mil in about 5 weeks instead of 2 months or something these are by no means good estimates you should just understand the point im trying to makewhich is enough to fly a rifter rather well then you cant use the cerebral items anymore wouldnt it be good for whenif you invited a friend to start playing the game that he was able to actually do something in the 21day trialim experiencing this right now with a friend hes almost at the end of his trial and he cant fit much on his rifter yet furthermore if i change my fit on my rifter to the same as his and have loads of free cpu  powergrid im still doing wayyyy more dps and have a much bigger tank and im cap stable while hes lasting less than 2 minuteswould you seriously have an issue with a player whos 4 or so weeks old being able to do a little bit more dps and have a little bit better tank youll still beat him but rather than owning him itll last a bit longer and be more fun for both sides i thinkat the end of the day though im not too worried if this does or doesnt go through as i managed to convince my mate to subscribe anyway i just thought it wouldve been nice you know and completely harmless
which is precisely why i dont want well ok just a little in game advantage ok id love to see some new ships in our spacelanes but they have to be either the same as existing ships and require one of that ship to buildbuy or available to everyone for iskas to the boost new players have the all learning skills at 5 boost which more than makes up for the old learning boost
yeah fair enough
mt of any form is the small crack that will let the flood waters indont forget dust is going to impact sov mechanics in some way and they are full blown mt what are the odds that ccp will use that as an excuse to turn the crack into a gapping hole
mt is here and is here to stay instead of resisting it which is futile its better to go with the flow and try to steer admittedly there are cool things that i wouldnt mind shelling out a bit of cash for the one stipulation no in game advantage at all this part of my philosophy on the thing is the only part which is completely inflexible
i see what you did therei agree that ccp isnt going to deviate from the mt path that isnt going to stop me from voicing my concerns and making others aware of the situation either well atleast until eve finishes its death spiral that is
i could see a cerebral accelerator item in game to allow multiple characters on the same account to be in training at the same time it would do nothing to increase training time on a single character
supported
i support with the following thoughtsits pretty clear that the noble store is geared towards the new user as well as the veteren so having items available for purchase individually at higher pricepoints than they would sell for isk after being manufactured is perfectly fine as long as we have a way to manufacture the items ourselves as wellinstead of purchasing bpo directly we can purchase the item we want to massproduce and there would be the chance to reverseengineer that item instead of purchasing bpo directly from the store we purchase an item and can reverseengineer it with a chance it will generate a limited run bpo based on your industry skills it would take several tries to get you a bpo that you can use this way you can keep the prices a tad higher still should be much lower than they currently are and would allow for people to make a small investment of time  currency and then the market wont be so artificial
so basically people can make isk from vanity items rather than just selling plex for isk
clothing should be buy direct persistent and not bpceverything not entirely vanity and that includes the alternate paint job ships should be sold as bpc with at most a couple runs but not alot
this has potential and is probably a core idea already in process by ccpthere is undoubtedly a new market about to be revealed to allow players to customise not only their appearance but their surroundings and of course the ability to produce and bring to market exotic goods of their own designlook to avatar featured developments such as second life and the player created market therein for purely vanity items based around virtual currency with a rl value and even an exchange ratethis brings on the need for outlets such as ingame stores owned and operated by players and when wis becomes a reality then the idea of browsing in such a store becomes feasibleexclusive dress designers furniture outlets low lighting rigs and jukeboxes for the casinodiscobarcrack housemy current idea is luxury toilet paper i feel there will be a demandi have been advised by a colleague that my business model is paper thin and ill likely get wipedthough i tend take his advice with a pinch of salt as hes a bit of turd  keil
i would support bpcs not bposwe already have plenty of out there fibers for hyper modern clothing polyaramids polytextiles supertensile plastics sylramic fibers industrial fibers microfiber shielding  genetically enhanced livestock for wool and leatherand you could argue that a monocle was manufactured from an occular implant combined with minature electronics and silicate glass or morphite crystalslots of bpc ideas are possible and you can give them very large ve mes to keep construction costs high ie lots of waste trying to select only the purest materials for these high end vanity itemsid support it but request that all vanity items both useful in game and purely pretty pixels so that they can be created and destroyed allowing for continuous demand i mean if you cant wreck them sooner or later every one in the game will have one and they wont be unique anymore
id like to see a clothing bpc using pi goods
offering bpcs for ships with customised hulls would create unfair competition on the market place between those manufacturers want to make the original ship and those making the customised one you also split the market supplydemand for a product in two now you have items people have bought off the noble exchange effecting the income of other players customised hulls should work like a body shop for cars you take your car in they customise it for you and you get a shiny new car back while these new prettier ships could still be put on the market it doesnt take anything away from the original manufacturerthe other problem with offering bpcs rather than complete items is that it further limits your market only to people willing to engage in the manufacturing process using the body shop analogy would keep it open to everyone without compromising the in game economy
thats how t2 bpcs work already you supply the t1 item plus other materials and receive back a shiny t2 itemso bpcs bought in the vanity market should be the same for clothing straight build but for uber ships and ammo you still need to buybuild the t1 item and acquire other specialized materials and then have someone with supreme skills build it if anything it adds to the t1 market as anyone wanting a vanity item will need the t1 item first
bpc means production cycle this is evedont spawn things from thin air this is not eve
i have similar idea ccp could let us make this items but make us pay for using production lines in aur for example or in form of some sort of taxbut i like the bpcbpo idea even better
make the storebpc onlythis is how it should worki have a list of items in the store all of them are bpcs each bpc has 5 runs on itlets say this time i pick monocole so i drop 60 bones and get the bpci then have a list of ruff materials that i need to make the awesome monoclesso i jump in my hauler go over the the planet and start making the base materials i needonce i have the materials i then go back to the station and open industry and start a run cycle to construct the monoclesi can then sell this item on contract or market or my storewhen i get one for iskdo mt this way and i dont think people will have a problem with itmake the arum store bpc onlypersonally i would want my store to be a west cost choppers where i install awesome engine trails and paint jobs
yes good ideabpcs ofc bpos would not make alot of sense for ccpand inlcude all items so clothing as wellalso make all items destroyable so this includes the clothing when you get podded
agreed

this is the first issue csm should tackle with utmost priority eliciting a clear and definitive response from ccp
mt is here to stay may as well get real about itthis seems reasonable better this than aurum for sp ideal no but a fair compromiseadd sp remaps to the list alot of people would pay for those hopefully if we can support enough reasonable ideas ccp will be too overworked to come up with stupid ones
id resist skill remaps makes skill points too fluid id prefer to maintain skills as a hard asset the skill transfer is fairly rigid and maintains that a skill point trained is a permanent skill point invested there is no way to convert it into something youd prefer without somewhere along the line someone investing the time to train the skill youd preferyou could buy the transfer blank drop your unwanted skill into it and sell it on the market the isk could then in turn be used to buy a transfer blank with the skill you want and youd have to buy the skill book itself of course id wager most people are only going to use this when they want a change of pace or trained the wrong skill so while the demand may be huge for those who simply want to acquire new skills as quickly as possible the supply will be i expect considerably less subsequently driving up the price considerably so imagine that youve bought a transfer blank used it and put it on the market your going to roll the isk price of the plex that bought your blank into the price you charge as will others demand will drive the price up further those that whish to use plex to sell for isk will in turn have to convert even more plex into isk this is win for ccp while further lightening the rmts wallets and spreading it more thinly without adding any new skill points to the game i would think this would dilute the impact of rmts trying to buy power on the world now given that they spend all their money on ships and items and what not how much money will they spend on skills instead of ships just some thoughts
i dont have a lot of problems with what youve listed as such but what worries me about moving beyond vanity items to things that provide functionality even if its only a convenience thing and not an ingame advantage thing is that it opens the floodgatesccp comes up with a new cool feature and has to decide whether to give it to us for free for our 15bux or if enough people will pay extra for it to make it worthwhile to release via nex instead
i completely agree im just hoping to influence what is behind those flood gates once the market was up even with just vanity items it became inevitable that game affecting items will find their way into it promises to the community are easily forgotten when there is money to be made id like their to be a queue of palatable ideas ahead of all the crap we dont want to push the release of such things back as far as we canif they start charging people for gameplay featuresskill typesship typesareasetc while simultaneously requiring a subscription to play then eve is well and truly dead its one thing to offer a few variants of existing in game items or non gameplay features and another thing entirely to create nex only features if we get to this point then weve been poddedthe only reason any of those things are even moderately acceptable in other games is because they are f2p
i can see your point in topic 1 and 2the rest is just wtf why not give people free content as it should be normal ffs you pay your ing fee for a reason1st server support 2nd contentwhy should every non combat item cost reallife money  i dont get the point incarna was announced a long time ago they always talk about how awesome it will be and now have to pay rlmoney to use this new features properly even more worse are guys wanting even more stuff to buy in the nexstore stuff the should get for free dont get me wrong  i really see the point and advantage in payed services like spresets but the other things you are mentioning like having a wardrobe or the possibility to add custom stuff in your cq should really be normal content added sometimes it is just wiered they talk about an awesome and big addon and you have to choose from 9pants which are actually just 3 because there are 3repaints for each
guys come on you can currently still buy vanity items for isk spend 350mil buy a plex then by cloths its not that hard the main issue is why anyone would spend 12bil isk on a monocle the big issues are game changing items should be built by players not spawned ccp have spent years changing the markets pi and so onalso as i said above they are just ideas you dont have to like them but my guess is that aur is here to stay because they would have spent alot of money on the coding to get all of it to work so now we need to find things that they can fill the store with that will add extra things to eve for the people that like shiny stuff for those that dont and wont use cq why do you care about cloths that you will never buy anyway
actually i want to use cq and all the features incarna has to offer when i first heard of ambulation the name this umbrella feature itself it was going by when first proposed as you know ambulation simply means walking i was a massive supporter of the ideai simply do not believe additional expense is justified for use of any of its content the monthly fee is progressive and the amount paid is cumulative content creation should be no different otherwise charge me once like a normal nonmmo title then  off 
do you have access to a titan if not then you are not getting access to all the content in this game and by your logic they should give you one for freeyou still have access to buy everything with isk like every other module in the gameaur is simply a method of keeping the plex prices up so that when they stamp out botting it doesnt effect the price too muchexplain to me what part of the game content you wont have access too
you assume i support plex either since it and people like you by proxy are using it to justify mts in eve from the angle you are doing now i no longer support that eitherbut it was a good point you made before i regained my sanityp
a hoolah girl i have been making it a custom to whereever i went to keep a stack of exotic dancers in my cargohold since the ships were massive and a hoolah girl on the dashboard wasnt visible it grew outto be a corp motto never go without the dancers but ever since incarna we are back to the human level again so time for a hoolah girl
take out all the virtual itemslets buy real eve t shirts real eve mugs real mouse mats etc for plex or paypalturn it into an online shop
ship paint would be pretty awesome but personally i would only think about buying it if it was either reusable or super cheappersonally i would be ok with paying one dollar for ship paint if it were a one use deal if its reusable maybe five dollarsclothes are meaningless at the moment other than to look at by myself in the cq so i wouldnt spend more than a dollar or two as it doesnt show off anything other than to me increase the stuff that is being sold in the cq and allow players to interact and it might be a bit more fun but for the moment im not interested in clothes at alli like the idea of being able to dump skill points maybe a set number of skill points for a certain price point i have a bunch of industrial skills that i wish i could reassign to something more combat oriented maybe do it in chunks of 100k skill points per package
no can do this makes too much sense 1edit this is why it makes too much sense  its clear that the nex store is targeted for stinking rich players with too much isk on their hands virtual monocle real quafe tshirt whats the difference these stinking rich players help offload plex from the market in either case this act drives up plex prices and helps even more guys purchase isk with plex ccp makes more revenuealso rational and irrational people may actually purchase plex with real  and buy a real tshirt whereas only the real nut jobs will purchase a plex with real  to buy a monocle
i had this idea few weeks ago when i was trying to plan what characters i was going to have on what account i have three accounts as of this momentnow my proposal is to allow subscribers to expand theyre accounts instead of having fixed number of characters it would depend on youre subscription feethis would also include introduction of multiple concurrent signins for the same accountexamplesingle month subscription for single accountsubscription fee  character slots  concurrent loginsactive training queue1495 eur  3  12990 eur  6  24485 eur  9  3this would not cost more then having multiple accounts could even introduce a small discount for players with multiple accounts thus favoring vets and really dedicated players and this would not give any advantages over having multiple accounts except you can more easily choose what characters you can log in toexample player with two accounts and six charactersnowaccount  characters  concurrent loginsactive training queue1  a b c  12  d e f  1problem character a and b can never be online at the same timeproposalaccount  characters  concurrent loginsactive training queue1  a b c d e f  2now you can have any combination of two characters logged in at the same timeps hope my tables above are understandable i dont know how to make proper tables on these forums didnt try html do these forums support html tags  please advice if you know editforgot training

as much as or more than anyone i would love to see the hype as a drone juggernaut especially since hybridsor at least the gally lineups ability to use themis subpar compared to the other gun systemsdoes this mean i think the hype should become this drone boat i want to say yes but i dont know i do know that the eve community will very likely not support it simply because its different thats fine change isnt supposed to be easyhowever if youre really trying to make a proposal that people will get behind do so in a way that doesnt make them feel uncomfortable with different ideas eg changing the gunnery or repair bonus to something else somewhat related in that way it will be better able to fulfill the role its designed for and why people bought it and hell might as well throw in a role bonus for drone speed or webberdrone strength to compliment its supposed role as a blaster ship but then people will say no way just fix hybridsthe problem then comes back to hybrids which arent going to get fixed any time soonand around and around we go
well it doesnt have to be a drone juggernaut it just needs to have a specific role and unique flavor right now its just a very expensive ship that doesnt get used much because its semimediocre i just want the ship to become something interesting my drone idea is just one of many that have passed through the forums i think we need to at least throw some numbers around to get a feel for the ideas available and feasible my drone control unit idea has a fair share of complications however i think it just needs a bit more to make it worth the extra 4550 mil in comparison to a megathron
1 supporti agree its a bit of a damp squib in the what the heck is so special about it stakespersonally i think it should have bonuses towards pvpdomi is widely used for pve and very good at it as well mega is competant for pve  pvp but not outstandi
i think the poor ability is partially to the slot layouts of the shipsthe hyper for being a armor rep ship has pathetically low number of low slots bump it up to 7 and keep the same number of mid slotsit does seem odd that the domino best tier 1 bs has the most utility slots of all of them most lows and mediums i would bump up the numbers for the other ships so they are at least equal or surpassing the low tier shipbut drone boat hyper what would be the reason of the dominix then too redundant maybe make the mega a ship with a mwd bonus or a missile boat
how about keep the hype the same but give it another lowslot
i like the idea of adding another low slotin reply to the comment on why since we have the dominix i think the dominix is a lowtier ship anyway it costs a third of what the hyperion costs i would like to say that that enormous extra cost is enough to warrant a better drone boat i understand it would directly conflict with it but if you made the hyperions drone count sensitive to battleship skill it means the dominix would be used by those who dont want to train battleship v then the hyperion would be made more useful the more levels you have if you get the numbers right on the ship and whatnot i bet you could easily make it better and still fair
i honestly think it needs a higher maximum speed or an ab bonus if we consider the megathron a toneddown vindicator the hyperion should be the poor mans machariel it could be a wonderful neutron blaster boat if it could ever get in range
honest question i asked myself why is hyperion so cool and rokh so bad
edit for emphasis rtfp
no more lies
im with khamelean im not an alt of a dev i dont work for cpp i just play the game this is an alt i rarely use just training skillsall i know for a fact is with incarna this new noble store shows up and i can buy clothes for my space barbie at an outrageous price then this leaked newsletter shows up and everyone treats it like its the eve game plan the presentation on eve news was extremely propaganda worthy only taking a few pieces of the newsletter and the general tone of the piece is for you to be against what is at this point purely speculationeveryone take it down a notch until there is real proof that this is the direction that cpp is going down then we can all quit enmasse if this is true
everybody liesmt is the way forward to attract new players to an otherwise stale and dated game before the game kicks the bucket its called boost in trade speak its a money grab before the end the end being potentially a couple of years out once the mt sales die down thats the reality of the situation
i dont care what eve is planning i dont care if it will be ed up i have all faith in ccp that they will make the right descisions on how to make eve better all those protesters are banned becouse they repeated an offense a ban or a gag of 4 hours should be considered a warningif eve will be ed up alot of people leave if it wont many more people will jointhe council should make sure that the voice of the people will be heard by ccpall those people are afraid that their favourite game will be gone if 2000 people are demonstrating they are not showing hate against aurum they are showing love for the game as it is now
i found this
1 i m support this 
dam rong button pls delite
you can just turn of the station environmentno lag just a pretty picture
yeah my blindness was epic proposal was out there alreadysorry the door  was a temp fix for the multiboxers would love tosee a permanent fix and it seems to requere a very little efford from programming side rp value  emersion would stay intact  the only change what is made thatyou volenteerly leave your pod instead of getting automatic kicked out of it
yes this makes sense to me from both a performance perspective and an rpimmersion perspective toothe npe could still start in the cq then move on to either the hangar viewin space undocking directly from the cq should be an option as should switching back and forth between the cq and hangar view eg via a leave podenter pod button you could even make the pod on the cq balcony interactive so its possible to enter it from thereo7mag
i can live with this i could even live with a variant of the old do not load station environment mode where a pic of the current ship was shown as the noncq setting maybe something akin to the incarna splash screeni typically run 34 clients running cq on all of them is imo not an option
1  i dont like to be forced to use something i cant use they already forced me to make a face for my main characters it took me 2 hours to finish then my geforce 6200 just cant handle ityes i want the o
ship spinning back or a image of your ship so you can easily see what you are flying if you are flipping between clients
signed as in the other threads about this same thing
agreed againbtw guys how hard is it to spell hangar properly
i support thispro tip to ccp this would reduce the heat on cq performance problem by great deal while you work on it i for one think cqs performance is quite impressive for first version i know and understand that this is only a small portion of walkinginstation and it will take time to release and tweak it
good idea spacing  lets hope the dumbasses up there in iceland learn to get a clue
1 please make cq and walking in stations optional
i personally dont like the idea of docking leaving ship leaving capsule and dressing just to drop loot into my hangar and then undress enter capsule and reconnect to the ship
qft
if so can you find out if they plan on making the mac client windows equivalent anytime soonwhat about at least squashing bugs or answering bug reports i have plenty in for them to respond tohave fun iceland should be beautiful this time of year

hi there csmi wont state the obvious about the recent termoil eve has seen but simply wish to bring a thread to your attention for the up comming sumitthere are now some 15 pages of support for the issues ive compiled into a consice list as raised by the community to be put to ccp for them to addressas you are all going to the extraordinary meeting i thought it may be a useful resource for you given the thread has been extremely constructive with little to no rageemotrolling
helloi believe the csm is fully aware of all the issues involving gameplay mt 99 dev fee etc and will come to a compromise with ccp that morethanhalf satisfies all around but while this is going on dont forget the people who fought to keeping eve what it should be and were banned for it one of these people has a reputation as being helpful on the forums and there is another possibly too these should be unbanned and even given a free monthi cannot speak objectively about hellicity so i will beg you to evaluate the facts and come to your own conclusion but to please consider themhellicity organized hulkageddon which caused noobs to leave eve and they were often the sort of casual people with a sense of humor i liked to play with as well as im sure impacting ccps bottom line i am the organizer of greifergeddon the point of which was to show these noobs that eve had a place for them after all now all the people i talk to in my corp the people i created greiefegeddon for say its good that hellicity is banned they can do just fine without hellicity and me making drama all over the server but on an entirely selfish leveli miss hellicity and i want himher back hulkageddon forced me to confront it and grow as a result and i even discovered to my great amazement that i was capable of enjoying pvp  provided i was still in a hulk mining veldspar when the gankers all blow up around me in all hulkageddon added to my gameplay i now think hulkageddon was a poor example of sandbox play but a potent symbol that players control the game not ccp and now i have an answer to why doesnt ccp do something about this because the alternative chases out bigger and better sandbox playersnow if you look at the facts smacktalk like in this video has been part of eve for a long time and often directed by carebears toward pirates it at times gets out of hand and actually i have to say smack talk is the main reason i avoid pvpif ccp wants to take an issue  and a consistent issue  with threats to someone outofgame i think i would honestly welcome it many of these situations can benefit from a gm reminding people that its just an internet space shiphowever it is very unfair for someone who probably did the only good deed toward the community of his life to be punished for some smack talk that is only a fraction as harsh as what goes on in that sphere of the eve universe on a constant basisin conclusion in addition to lobbying for all the known issues we all know about i think the csm should after a consensus has been reached that benefits eve as a whole revalaute the role of the people who have been banned in their efforts to prevent ccp from sneaking gold amo in without us noticing hellicity maybe a separate case but i admit i am more motivated to post this by hellicity than the others who are probably more deserving of being unbanned but whom i dont know because i generally avoid the forums ps  can u make the mining lazers a bit thicker i cant see them on a corp mining op so nothing to screen shotagain this is my personal opinion about hellicity and at odds with that of the people i care about edit 4 spelling n grammer
this proposal comes in two parts with the second highly dependent on the firstproposal part 1  vanity items should be destructible if you are in your pod and your pod is vaporized then so are your sexy new jeans you lose implants you lose the monocle the jeans the boots  all of it if they release a gold plated abbadon i am sure that it will be destructible so the same should go to other vanity itemsreasoning vanity items are meant to serve two purposes isk sink for players with billions of isk and nothing better to do and a cash income for ccp if vanity items are persistent then the available market will soon dry up make the item destructible and you open up the chance for people to buy an item lose it and have to buy it again if not you are plugging the sinkjust to bring up the pixelsrl paradigm that ccp loves i bought my wife an lv diary a small luxury item but still far more expensive that my wage bracket within 12 months she lost it also think about the guys that buy porches ferraris and lambos and wrap them around a tree luxury items can be destroyed and need to be replaced in real life so why not treat pretty pixels the sameproposal part 2  put vanity items on kill mails pods only vanity items should be rare so if i pod someone wearing a monocle there will be a big fat bonus in the kill mail sure the flimsy little thing is destroyed and i cant use it vanity items never drop only pop but the kill mail looks pretty at the same time  add implants as well its been requested for a long time so now is the time to make it happenreasoning eve is a sand box and adding vanity items to kill mails will be part of the fun  i can see a future game similar to hulkageddon having a 1 billion isk prize to first kill that includes a vanity item these are rare items and if you are silly enough to lose one then people will be sharing the link to your fail kill mail for years to come it will be part of the gametecho bitissue ccp has stated that since pod death means that a toon is instantly teleported to a new clone and that kill mails are generated a few processing cylces later they cant tell what implants were lost as the clone that died no longer exists when the kill mail is generated i am certain that the same resoning will stand for vanity itemssolution similar to an orca having an ore bay give pods a vanity bay the vanity bay is not accessible nor seen by players only by internal code routines as soon as a pod is created a copy of all implants and vanity items are loaded into the vanity bay if the pod is destroyed all items in the vanity bay drop just like any other cargo i am ok with 100 destruction of these rather than 5050 dropdestroy  the stuff is unique and fragile if the player enters a new vessel exits pod then those items are either removed from the pod or junked along with the pods 64 bit item id
you know i just might accept nonvanity mt items if we get to destroy them along with their owners however i still think nonvanity items out of thin air are too destabilizing to the economy and player achievement to work at all
matches my own views so ccp please look into this
so they would give no tactical advantage they would cost real money and they could be destroyed at any time might as well just throw your money in a fire who would use them you might get a couple of people who are super keen to show off how wealthy they are but how long would they really keep that up
i agree i would not use the vanity stuff you would not use the vanity stuff but you can be sure that someone will so why not have it listed on a kill mail if its in the game make it a part of the game
everything in eve is expensive and takes time to get the ammount of isk needed even if you can buy it via plex its either lots of rl money or time everything in eve gets destroyed and will get destroyed in a mater of moments why make it different im sure that way the apparatus items can get cheaper but then people would buy more it will make you think more to make your pod survive also it will make you think even more if you want to suicide clone to another place it has to be risk vs reward that was why i started to play eve that will keep many other playing and investing time alot of time and patience
rule 1  anything that can be bought with real money must also be able to be purchased with isk there should be no part of the game that cannot be accessed by players who arent willing to pay more than their monthly subscription fee as long as rmt goes through the noble exchange store this should continue to be the caserule 2  items added the noble exchange must not compete with items on the regular market player sellers should not have to compete with ccp for the isk of player buyersas far as i can tell anything that falls within these limit will not break the game if anyone can think of a scenario that this would not cover feedback is welcome 
please post in relevant threads rather than starting a new threadeg here
cos seriously the load time is getting horrendousthis is mainly an issue for those living inside wormholes where you bring in some modules to switch out with your ship etc over time you end up with more and more items until you get to the point where hangers take a noticeable time to load and no im discounting bookmarkspoint 1 is its annoying and theres no reason why not to do it gameplay wisepoint 2 is it might be worth checking the server load that it generates to have 120 items instead of a stack of 1 im not an expert in any way but it might be a saving
real money  plex  isk  shiny stuff  okreal money  plex  aur  shiny stuff  not okthe distinction may be small but here it is in the current version all the shiny stuff is producedbuilt in eve plex is only used as a way to get isk to get that stuff we do not want a system where plexaur can be traded directly to ccp for exclusive game altering content even if those things could then later be sold on the market
the above is entirely correctalso some of the things that were proposed for aurum are not purchasable with isk  like hangar slots or faction standings
i completely see what you guys are saying and belive me dont disagree but whats the difference yes faction standings skill rempas hangars etc could alter and unbalance the game but would it really be any worse than the current impact of plexif theres a faction or corp war and one player pumps unlimited funds into buying fleets of superships whose side is going to win i heard an ingame discussion the other night about someone that spent 15k to win a war extreme example but it can happen im not taking the side of ccp nor the side of everyone who is so against these changes i personally dont really care either way because as far as the balance and fairness issues go i dont see how this is going to make things any worse than than plex already could
the problem is that you magically conjure ships out of nothing with aur if you need to use isk there has to be someone supplying those ships so you cannot just get infinite amounts of them anywhere you wantat the moment you buy a plex go to jita sell plex buy ships someone had to mine the minerals and take the time to haul produce and research the blueprints while the supply is large its not unlimited sooner or later the plex prces will drop and the ship prices riseif you could exchange the plex to aur to ships no industrials could get their share devaluating the industrial gameplay you could also go to null deep behind enemy lines with no logistics in place and be able to wage war effectively with magical ships popping out of nowhere
as long as items on the nex dont compete with items in the regular market i would be happy for example i have no problem with trading in a ship already built by players plus aurum to get a visually customised hull back this wont effect other players in any way except getting them more exciting when they get to blow me up
i hate to sound like a negative jerk but i personally would not trust just the csm and ccp devs to work this situation out therefore i propose the idea that we the community demand that three well respected non csm non ccp experienced and active members of our community go to participate in these talks with transportation and lodging provided by ccpthese individuals are pillars of our community and in my humble opinion have helped shape eve in the game and on the forumsthese upstanding individuals beingchribbaliang nurenakita ti believe these members would keep the csm and the fine ccp reps honest by an wealth of respect from the community pull in game and the knowledgeability to put to voice the concerns i would argue the entire community shares barring an incredibly slim fewi know i am rather unknown on the forums but i have been jerked out of lurking to post this out of sheer concern concern for the game i love that we all loveregardsmigrator soul
since hilmar is still probably flush from his 52 firstday monocle sales i dont see why they cant afford bringing in 3 additional moderators to this very important discussion right now the exta transparency during the talks guaranteed by gaining three more available perspectives on the event and what is achieved if anything is probably worth more to ccps continued bottomline than any single suggestion or decision they could feasibly make and followthrough with1
indeed the monocle sales can easily foot the costs also i believe that it would ease quite a few community members mindsmy question is would those members be willing to gochribba liang akita would you all be willingif yes then i think that would be one of the best routes to go
chribba
sounds good to me  just use the monocle sales to pay for them to go im sure theyll more than cover expenses right hilmar
o that demon is the big elephant you been talking of in the room
from the time of anomalys nerf to toadyhow has ccp utilized the csmhave you been involved at any leveli ask because its seems like ccp tossed you into the closet and locked the door and now pulls you out to use like some sort of damage control t1 at bestas for how i see it
when eve was young development focused on helping players to do what they wanted to when players began forming adhoc alliances ccp introduced formal alliances when players began using secure containers and logged off industrial pilots as supply depots in deep space ccp introduced modular starbases somewhere along the line this changed and ccp began cultivating an adversarial relationship with the eve playerbase on a strategic level eve players have shown little enthusiasm for incarna eve gate and other recent projects and ccps response has been to try to force players to use themi pulled this from massivelycom its very straight forward short and delivers a strong message please keep this in mind when your in negotiations in iceland
hey sizzims when your there can you ask them about the fear of the pos coding and if we are going to see a userfriendly pos system in the future there is a player in the suggestions thread with a really funky looking idea of replacement poss that seems to have gathered a lot of good reaction over the 5 years the posts been alive  thats just one of many options ground up or reworking of code we dont care anything thats not so anally micromanaged is always good too cheers tex
make it possible for ccp to fix this messthank you
replace the csm please in the title with ccp please and the ccp in the actual message with yourselvesim only half joking
your half rightor full right wouldnt that be leftoh god
i know friend i knowputs arm round ops shoulderwere screwed
cries
ok all the constructive commentsreplies im getting from people including other threads have convinced me words arent enough it would seemi suppose then that the rioting and threats of unsubbing are the only course of action we can take however the really nasty and disrespectful wordscomments are not and the cheeky manipulative voting schemes and biased information etc which seem to have stopped or lessened arent cool eithergo forth and riot  do what you musti just hope its all over soon
factplease visit your user settings to reenable imagessound familiarno plans for mt welp we got it
yep thanks for thatdo not judge me on this but i dont think we do not have plans equals breaking a promise though it just means they havent followed their original plans im not saying i agree with thisi agree this is disappointing and its against what a fair amount of players wanted however you must also understand that there are many players who dont mind it as it hasnt affected them and there are also players whove purchased these vanity items and are enjoying their little fashion accessoriesalso plex for isk is a form of microtransaction so if thats what youre upset with they committed this crime a long time ago  and it works and the majority are happy with it as it allows players to run multiple accounts without paying real money and it heavily reduces all the illegal isk farmers who sell on their websites and also stops their annoying ingame advertising cheers
here is a link to a thread i made a few weeks agoread meit contains quotes and links from ccp discussing dust and its mt based system it also mentions how dust will tie into eve and how that tie will impact our eve by proxy mt for advantage is already scheduledthe difference between plex for isk and full blown mt is that plex is designed for 1 thing and that is to extend game time plex could only do that until incarna came out plex does not allow you to bypass the player run economy player run industry or the player run market for items mt  even vanity only bypasses it all in effect mt paves over part of the sandboxnot judging you i agree that ccps statement does not provide for a promise of no mt ever companies dont just flip a switch one day and decide to change operating models companies dont wait till the last minute to add a feature that requires modification on a massive scale new menus remodel existing menusnew items new categories new currency new exchange system etc at the last minute this is something that ccp has planned for a long time i would be willing to wager it was on the drawing board when ccp shadow made those statement i would also be willing to say that this change with mt was being coded 6 months or more prior to incarnas release copmanies dont change their operating models that quicky when they reach the size that ccp has
vandrion in the thread youve linked above you make some fair points in your op and provide some supporting quotesi replied to this op and try to be both objective and realistic and we agree to disagree which is fineand youre right to have fears of what may come but we must all understand that its all just speculation and if ccp have any sanity and sense they wont let it happen as your fears predictfor those of you who arent sure what im talking about  what im referring to is regarding dust 514 and unrelated to game altering items bought directly in eve
the csm was not told about any of this which is why theyre able to be vocal about it if they had signed ndas about these features they wouldnt even be able to say they werent told
exactly and they wouldnt of informed the csm beforehand if the topic wasnt up for discussion with the playerbase ironic then that zulu states that the csm is being drafted on short notice at this extremely latestage probably to simply be told what is going to happen from now on it simply gives credence to the belief that the planned 2day csm trip is merely ccps latest move to publicly legitimize mt as an eveacceptable concept altogether
i believe the trip is just designed to cool the population down a bit give ccp the ability to say they did something i know funny right and for them to cave a bit on pricing for tribble token items all of this to try and lower the volumn from us rabble rousers it has even sunk to a new low tons of threads are appearing praising mt and the fail that is incarna look in the threads these folks go silent as soon as they are challenged i can only think of a few things that would cause this1trolls sorry all the usual suspects are screaming about mt and incarna2dev alts it has been done before3paid forum flunkies happens all the time companies hire pr firms to trash competitors or hype their own products4 koolaid drinkers even these guys no better then to jump into this crapstorm
firstly they need to allow dust players who dont play eve a way to get items and fund their characters development so theyre not owned by all the eve players  furthermore the eve players dont have to spend large amounts of isk if they dont want towe dont know how ccp plans on doing this and controlling it so that eve isnt affected in a negative way or no more than the current plex for isk systemdue to above statements and many replies ive read in this post i dont feel mt in dust will be an issue  and im sure ccp wont allow it to have any significant impactand yes the vanity store allows items to be magically created rather than player generated via our player driven economysandbox but theyre just cosmetics and they dont affect us remaps and standings on the otherhand are debatable yet still i dont think theyll be too much of an impactto the op you comment that is bold and underlined that is speculation and i doubt ccp will allow this to happen ie purchasing items in dust will likely just be as mentioned before just to help with pimping out characters so theyre not left with the equivalent of a noobship every time they die and this wont affect eve as you so fearthanks
we will have to agree to disagree on the matter tbhgear will be purchased in dust with rl dust will have a yet to be determined at least publicly effect on sov mechanicsdust and eve one universeone wardust mt will have an effect on eve and that impact no matter how minor is the crack that i feel ccp will exploit regardless of the half truths and promises that come out of the csm meetingbetween himars email and the fearless newsletter my opinion is we will have mt sooner rather then lateri fully encourage anyone reading this post to go to the threadtitan here and read the unedited news letter and email it is very enlightening to say the least
the missile launcher hardpoints on ships are hard to see also it seems odd that the ships that can have missiles and turrets just have empty space when using missilesput a silo or physical launcher make it like turrets but a pod of missiles dam the old models just say or visualize the junks of metal that are sticking out that barely look like missile pods are something else fix the models latter but fix the hardpoints now
everyone well the forum majority by far it would seem is working together mattio you just find yourself on the outside of that on the outside the majority would seem rather chaotic right now but this everchanging majority is really in the largest amount of agreement on a single topic than ever before in the history of the game
however it would seem that all thats happened is a massive storm of hatred has happened over the fear that other stuff might happen further down the trackweve made our point weve been heardnow we must accept the little fashion accessories which many player have already purchased and are using oh and not to mention that the people whore on the forums are in fact a minority compared to the amount of people whore playing the game right now  as i was saying weve created a fussfud and weve been heardall we can do now is demand that they keep their word on having the store be for vanitycosmetic items only and perhaps discuss alternativessolutions enough with the counterproductive unpleasant behavior
no
ive been thinking about why i find mt acceptable for nonfunctional items but not otherwisei dont think eve can let players buy nonvanity items because it is both a game and a world it has rules and structure like a game but is also a sandbox where everything is part of a single connected wholecompare this with say a bioware game or a storydriven mmo those are games but not worlds in those setting being able to buy your way forward in a story line or being able to buy more story makes sense for multiplayer portions of those games i suspect that mt will be tolerated exactly to the extent that it doesnt offer a significant pvp advantage eve on the other hand is all pvp  even the pve and industrial parts are inextricably tied up with the largescale pvp warfareon the other hand compare eve with something like second life which is a single world but not a game there is no pretence that it is anything other than forum for social expression  there is no game balance to wreck i think eve would benefit from tools for social expression but not at the cost of breaking the game
id like this but it wouldnt endanger csm csm gets in on the upcoming expansions earlya survey in game now would be  do you use cqa csm question would be when we integrate dust how many minerals do u think this this and this should cost to build also should we add skills to make dust equipment
1 scrap the current system of aurum and allow aurum to be purchased directly in packs  1000 2000 4000 etc2 drastically lower prices for clothing and all current items3 introduce limitedrun blueprints that we can manufacture with pi goods using pi manufacturing nodes which can be purchased with aurum4 allow plex to be purchased via aurum not the other way around5 allow aurum packs to be purchased via isk  500 1000 1500 2000 2500essentially im stealing the microsoft model with their credits system by purchasing in packs you are often buying more than you need and unless you want to you arent purchasing way more credits than you really needright now if i purchased aur with plex ive blown 35 and lets be honest most of us will gladly spend 5 or 10 on a whim but 35 for some reason just doesnt justify ingame items right now for gods sake  theres a recession going onlowering the entrypoint will allow more people to get used to the idea of purchasing vanity items also the market of eve doesnt suffer because there will be items hitting the market that have been created using the blueprints while the blueprints themselves are purchased for a bulk amount that bulk amount ends up far cheaper than purchasing the singular item directly and allows the capsuleer to profit in game currency for instance if you purchased a blueprint for pants for 35 that blueprint has a limited run of 150 this allows the capsuleer to get back their initial investment plus make a hefty profit play the game that ccp has created contribute to the overall industry of eve and the pants they have created have a natural production cost and selling costccp wins because people are using their mt strategy and more people are playing eve as a result no buywin either
troll 1regular poster 0
post proof or it didnt happen
shrugperhaps its been known to happennope i dont make a habit of rewarding lazinesstroll confirmed now applying the jackass principle
csm alt troll confirmed which underlines the fact there is no evidence the csm have made no official response here or elsewheretheyve undertaken precious little engagement with players they were elected by they made more posts here in the one week before the election than they did in the three months since
well it would help the immersion factor like 2 if they would not sell boots that cost more than several battleships and refrain from any releasing any other immersion breaking content as this is the expansion mostly roleplayers have been looking forward too as far as i can tellso far the immersion breaking factors pretty much diminish the whole immersion that incarna does offer to practicly zero and then im not even counting the more frequent client crashes when im having ic conversations
so all people want to do is complain about mt nobody has any real suggestions on how to improve the content thats already here
all of these things are pretty much given but since ccp is so smug about incarna being the most awesome thing ever created by mankind i really doubt any of these concerns will be addressed ever since it would break their precious bubble i hope itll happen though granted that ccp take a firm stance against rmt in all forms or im out of here
1 nerf angel ships etc anything not gallente and faction mods so people cant buy plex then exchange for isk and buy overpowered shipsmodules to gain an advantage over us peasants who have to grind for isk as well as flip burgers to pay our sub
just sqeeze a clear and precise answer from them to the nonvanity mt items question dont let them get away with dodging the issue or answering with vague metaphores if they try to dodge it demand to know why cant they answer it keep pressing them until they give a clear answer to you or your trip will have been a waste of time on that front whatever their position and intentions are try to pin it down to something concrete to the best of your abilities
the most important issue is what they have been doing to eve they cant possibly be proud of how eve evolved not lately most resources seems to go to dust and wod eve get minor fixesi actually gave ccp some slack about that as i guess many others did but now when they start to milk eves subscribers i simply cant tolerate it the truth is that they overextended and now they are trying to squeeze every penny out of eve and make us pay the checks their hubris signedccp dont fly what you cant afford to loose it is time to let dust andor wod suffer instead of eve and eves playersi really dont care about mt prices trolls have monocles to buy thats about it however since incarna pretty much is a mt shop i think it is a bit disgusting that a whole expansion is targeting a select few players instead most of eves playerbase seriously what is that about its like releasing ships that only swedes can buynow when we have had a look behind the scene i am in fact against the mt shop it is a flawed concept in eve i will never use incarna because it is all about mt and not about the players in incarna i get to use mt in eve i get to use the players market also it is temptation lets face it ccp is really really tempted to start mting everything that latest blog make me give them some slack but it is pretty obvious that they will try to introduce everything they can get away with and the goal over time is to make us accept more and more and in the end greed will break the worldship spinning seriously dont mess with my ship spinning before this fiasco i assumed that i would use incarna from time to time but not all the time now when i am forced into that mt closet and get a glimpse behind the ccp scene no thank you for me incarna is the symbol for mt greed it is all about mt no thank you let me keep giving you my money to play spaceships insteadccp you need to fix your own house take some time to think through what the eve players have been given for their money these last few years take a look where the resources are ending up i would not mind if you released that info for us to see and ponder where eve will go in the future in know you have this vision about a fantastic virtual world where you have peoples cities and whatever but that is however far in the future a map to how to get those things is important this includes fixing communication and cooperation inside ccp as well
i know the summit is concentrating on mt but the issues revolving around incarna as i see them1 confirm no plans now or in the future for mt that bring advantage to the player  be it sp remap or golden ammo2 confirm that such items as the golden scorpion will be released either as a bpc preferable or in a part exchange deal3 return of the hanger view with the option to exit into the captains quarters with an option to start in captains quarters4 considerable amount of performance optimization is needed in cq  both generally and for multi clients inclusion of seperate graphics set ups for in station and in space5 nex store prices are excessive and should either be reduced or more budget ranges introduced soon surely better to sell from a financial point of veiw 100 items at 1 than 1 item at 606 functionality of cq needs to be expanded on rapidlly if its going to be of any interest at all introduction of the other station interiors for variety is needed
pre incarna  storm that are still brokenmissions jamming in missions has become intolerable it can take over an hour to do a gurista mission simply because your jammed all day reduce all chances of npc jams be 50 at least as well as reducing number of jamming ships in all missions1 captains quarters  simply put we want old hanger view with an option go to cq we dont care how or why but cq is laggy on most machines overheats others and just isnt as functional as old hanger2 mt future  the only thing in the eve world u should be able to buy is ship skins no weapons modules or really anything that would change how the game is played vanity items are the only thing that can be sold in the wis world u can sell objects for rooms clothes other avatar accessoriesthese two are the most important to us regarding the first one it looks like some of the csm think that a simple option not to load station environment will do the trick they couldnt be more wrong old ship spinning hanger is nonnegotiable
realistically that battle is lost  better to draw up secondary battle lines to limit its impact
bring back the hangerwe know you have spent a lot of time making cq but forcing people to use it isnt the way forward
i know ccp has been pushing for new ways to use micro transactions as other companies have success with them and im fine with that as everyone needs to try new things and adapt to the market rather than yelling at ccp about it though i would like to give suggestions cuz i know it will happen and better to embrace and shape it than cry about itnow i am only going off of rumors but one that sparked a huge conversation in my vent server was selling skill points we all talked about it and felt it was a bad idea but we also recognize you already sell skill points through the character bazaar and thus if it had to happen through the new system we agreed maybe it would be ok for a training multiplier so you could train at like 15x faster or something for x amount everyone would hate it i bet but you know everyone would do it which we laughed atanother personal topic i have been pushing for is character name changing for 1 character per account after the characters name was changed all people who have that character on their contact list would receive a email stating what the name was change to if you pose the argument that characters hold your reputation i disagree to the fact that you can trade characters and your reputation is not your own anymore and that name means nothing anymore i have traded 3 characters and its so easy to shed a identity that i cant see the problem with renaming 1 character per account the link to the topic i have been posting in was made by another but it has support name changing topic
yeah right im sure ccp would like the csm to inform them on the players opinions on these issuesi cant wait for ccp to tell us what a productive meeting it was and how the csm is really an invaluable tool for them to understand the players position surely due to the hard efforts of the csm ccp will commit x which they were going to commit to anyway given the outrage on the forums but whatever have the volunteer pr squad csm come out to claim credit that way ccp can talk about how they really listen to their playerbase via the csm and its not just a sham pr stunt
this omfg thisindestructible mt clothing items set a very bad precedent where do you draw the line would mt vanity ships be reimbursed upon destruction would mt uber guns in dust be refunded upon death can we not see how this destroys the sandboxalsofree helicity liang and the others who were banned to bring all of this to fruition assuming the csm meeting gets ccp back on track these heroes will have actually done ccp a favor ccp just wont realize it until after the first 50000 2 miniskirt sales
there are a lot of micro transaction games that just spam advertisements over their deals that theyre having frankly it gives me a headache playing them and is a turn off and one of the reasons i avoid mt games frankly i would hope that eve online doesnt just put advertisements everywhere i pay a subscription to ccp to avoid commercials like i pay netflix to watch movies and shows without commercials
i know what you mean im the kind of girl that will walk out of your store if you pester me with whatevers on sale i go in to get what i want then get out dont bother me with crap
tbh i dont care if the billboards in game were sold off as adevertising space for revenue ccp are clearly in desperate need of cash and if selling billboard space to coke or sony or whoever doesnt bother me i can filter that out of my in game experience like i do when i watch tvyes im over 35 so i do actually still watch ithowever what i want to know from ccp isdo you plan any non vanity items for aur
good suggestion
what a  folks this person represents the p2w individuals that hilmar wants
mine
thats a problemyoure not even all using the same way of doing thingsfrom what i saw mittens is posting his stuff on some public goons placethe only csm i saw posting often on oforum is whitetree and we didnt saw him these last daysadd your twitter also as it seems lots of you are using it a lotbut decide on one way to get each of you and make it clearjust ask yourself this question  how can the community know what we are doing youll see the answer is currently hard
thanks although i had your three mention to your cohorts that theirs would be appreciated also
i didnt include the others because i seriously dont know if they have onetrebor and i also have been posting a lot mostly in devblog comments threads and in thread in the general section but in other places as well you can also find me answering questions ingameif you follow tweetfleet youll find seleenes and mittens i dont tweet hell before this i didnt even blog p
i know meissa its just to make you see we are losti have even opened a twitter account and registered to ponies forum only to follow these things cause some csms use thesecurrently we are all raging at how ccp is bad at communication but heres youre also bad pyou said a few times csm6 were all agreeing on tons of things add the way you communicate please how can the crowd trust you when they cant follow what youre doing the crowd is saying that you communicate more recently but it is because you do or that you always did it but currently have more people relaying the places to check  i dont even know cause its hard to check
well all that i wanted to point out  this is not just microtransactions rage this is a cumulative effect all this changes is a threat to the current players virtual goods and skills value something players are investing their time and money its a threat to their safetyso what players are basically ask for is guaranties for their safety
ittthe mob the csm should quit rabblerabblerabblethe csm we wont quitthe mob the csm shouldnt quit rabblerabblerabble
they should not quit what an insane ideathis is the moment they can make ccp understand that they need csm as well as showing us that they can make a difference i had pretty much ignored csm as a pr stunt up until now however now there is an opportunity to make csm into what it should begood luck csm 
if the csm quite nothing would change one iotanot saying the csm going will change any thing though
csm obviously shouldnt quit before their trip to ccpland but if it becomes apparent that ccp is going to push through regardless of csm input then the entire csm resigning simultaneously could have an impactmaybe not the desired impact but it would have one likely it would spawn another round of articles  possibly expanding to news organizations outside of the gaming arenaif i were on the csm id probably resign the argument about possibly being able to change things from within more than from without doesnt actually mean anything if you cant change whats truly important ie all the talk about theoretically being able to change game mechanics pales next to being impotent about the creation of a new currency in the game

it would appear you are all on drugspay2win was introduced with plex i am astonished that such a fuss is being kicked up when we all already allowed credit card pvp into the game a long time agormt better ccp get the money yada yada yada yawni do indeed support the fact that in a store something should not be magically spawned i do indeed understand that when you sell a plex you get isk someone somewhere has earnedall of these arguments make sense truly they dowhat does not make sense is that everyone is raging about paying real life money in order to get an ingame advantage i feel like i am taking crazy pillsi didnt actually invent the piano key necktie though i wish i hadninja edit csm should not quit over an issue that is confusing enough for me to seek out zoolander clips
add any vanity item you want to nexadd pets as well if you wantdo not readd features that we used to have take them from us and then charge us aurum for them eg ship fittings
i dont think any gun ship or anything should buffed nerfed or any outside effect introduced as balancing races are not equal lately there is huge effort to bring symmetry to this game creating static balance with obvious strategies will destroy eve most uniq characteristicleave races alone leave ships  alone create dynamic balance with new items and features we dont live in balanced world lets nerf us airforce planes and balance with italian airforce so they be in balance please leave eve realisticplease stop these stupid ideas and leave this game alone minmatar was warrior race and it has to be stay like that it was worst mistake in this game to delete racial diffrences
you sir know nothing about fitting ecm ships or using torpsmax skills 1089dps permajam on any subcap without eccm and cap stable unless you run the mwd andor smartbomb it can be fit with different rigs and a zmt3000 implant to get 1255 dps its only vulnerability is to large drones so get yer jams on quickwidow solo bs hunterkillerlows3x cn bcs1x utility low i prefer a pds ii for more capshieldfitting but you could go dc ii 4th bcs speedagility mod or meta 4 sda for better jamsmids4x hypnos multispec ecm1x meta 4 tp1x t2 warp disruptor1x quad lif booster rockets1x sensor booster ii wscan res script can be replaced with a webber or warp scrambler iihighs5x t2 seige missile launchers winferno rage torps1x improved cloaking device ii1x large notos explosive chargerigslarge warhead flare catalystlarge particle dispersion augmentordrones5x hornet ec3005x hammerhead iino implants required but if you want some more dps you can invest in a zmt type implant to increase you raw dps couple fitting points obviously for solo work you need a warp disruptorscrambler of some kind that means close in work so the range bonus of racial ecms is useless also the cumulative jam chance with 4 multispecs is better against a single target than if you had a rainbow rack tp is great because it takes that 450m signature radius of a bs and pumps it to 650 which is just what your explosion radius is with rage torps your flare rig brings the explosion velocity to just about 100ms which is just about the top velocity of most bs the sebo is to compensate for the slower lock time due to the cloaking device and let you get your jams on before they can lock you and send out drones the smartbomb can kill a flight of medium t2 drones within the buffer of its shields if you want you can swap the sebo for a webber or warp scrambler but tbh its a pain to get in range of a webscram with a widow even with the cloak medium drones for extra dps and small ecm drones if the shiznit hits the fan and you need to gtfo
i love freckled redheads 3
i believe that quallity is way better than quantity
i think eve needs to spend an expansion cycle or 5 on fixing and polishing the exsiting content which would give them an even more shiny base to add their new content i remember a time before the devs complained about how many lines of code they had to change to make something work in their new dev blogs
a lot of what im going to say has already been said but im going to do a little speech on capitalscarriers have always been in my mind at least the best bridge between capitals and subcaps they are vulnerable to subcap fleets can kill them and are of course useful in capital fleets carriers are good where they are in general even if a couple of them need tweakingdreads currently are for hitting stationary or near stationary targets this actually makes sense to me especially since they must enter siege mode to even outdamage a bs or even some bc at 4k dps dreads make good heavy hitters theyre not brokentitans are now relatively balanced after the removal of remote dd and aoe dd titans have a very good place at the top of the capital field their dd is now balanced their other damage if people so choose to fit is respectable their ehp is understandably enormous and their support abilities are valued enough to be usedthe weak link is supercarriers first of all why cant they dock theyre not really that much bigger than carriers for the insane price inflation of supercarriers over carriers youd think theyd be bigger either make them physically larger or dockable this is just a minor concern however and is not the real issue supercarriers in numbers are almost invulnerable to everything but other supercarrier fleets this just begins a who has more supers race and whoever wins the race wins the battle this is stupid why should eves multilayerd almost infinitely complex combat system come down to who has more ships one of the inherent problems here is that the eve veterans have been getting fat off of countless sources of income including moon goo that most players will never see the top tier players can then afford to field many many supercaps there is way more isk being made than destroyed and that needs to change to fix 00 warfare a supercarriers abilities dont necessarially need a huge nerf there are a couple things that would fix this problemfirst of all their immunity to electronic warfare is much too powerful it made sense when there were very few on the field but theyve gotten out of hand as much as old players will whine about me saying this supercarriers need to die more the rarer the best ships are the more accessable 00 warfare will be to newer players as much as i would hate my supers dying more often eventually we must realize that eve will hit a critical mass so to speak too much old money and assets in the game will mean that it will become increasingly difficult for new players to make it players should be prepared to choose in the coming years between keeping playing a game they love and losing a few more superssomething else that would help solve this would be a new damage dealeranti capital  capital ship the dread is a good damage dealer already for pounding installations and stationary capitals even if at the moment supers can do it betterthere are two ways to go about this 1 make a dreadesque super cap imho a bad idea since there are already titans and dreads and would basically all but obsolete dreads2 make a sort of fleet defensive capital ship that provides an umbrella of safety against supercarriers how i think this would easily be done is essentially have the ship target and engage the supercarrier but instead of directly affecting the supercarrier it effects the supercarriers fighter bombers in some way mitigating their damage disrupting their uplink to the supercarrier itself etc being able to kill flights of fighter bombers might be a bit overpowered especially if you consider how expensive they are but i actually think that disrupting their uplink would be a very good way of doing it in fact it could be brought to subcapital warfare in general as well for specialized ship classesadditionally i think there should be a way to destroy outposts im out of characters though
foz what you are suggesting with the cyno mass requirement sounds very similar to the wormhole mass limitations it is one of the reasons why wspace is much more friendly towards small corps and alliances namely that there are limits to the amount of 
the idea of wh mass limits was kind of what i was after with the cynos as in a scifi universe it would make sence for th whs and jump drives to work the samein regards to the cyno idea itself the masses are just off the top of my head but you can see the direction im going in and im sure ccp could find a way to make it workdreads are broken if they arent then they would be used more i tried to give them a more heavy hitter vs supers mroethan structures idea in my post but i can see how maby its a little ottas for gallente the balance is in the hybrids increase the rails damage by around 1520 and your good and increase blasters range by the same but to compensate maby a 5 reduction in dpswith that gallente ships could still have nonlaughable longmid range dps while not having loler short blasters with a range that requires you to sit on theto be effective
i feel that capitals are fine gallente carriers and super carriers are good their sub caps need a boost super caps need a nerf and somehow need to become difficult to build there are too many out there
just my 2 cents1 gallente needs a serious rework shipsbonuseshybrids the whole bunch2 caldaris poor hybrid ships need some love too while at it3 minmatar need a bit of nerfing eg restriction of dmg types for starters3a dont forget to hammer the angels back in line dramiel im looking at u4 dreads need some love to counter the hordes of scs5 ew ships in general could use some rework6 bring that tengu back in lineps changes to the jumpdrive mechanic would be a sure way to balance all those cap hotdrops 90 arrive in the right system 10 in the surrounding ones50 of those at the beacon rest randomly all over the systempreferably with getting rid of those cynos as they are a joke in the 1st place
one imho huge problem with 00 is afk cloakers somebody can essentially go in a good moneymaking system cloak go afk and come back at intermittent points during the day to look for people to gank this severely inhibits some operations something that would fix this would be to make cloaked ships probable now i dont mean that they would be just as easy to probe as other ships but the cloak could make their signal strength almost zero require specialized probes etc it should take much longer to scan them down but still possible as it stands you can disrupt an entire system with one character who isnt even at their pc this is just as unfair as macrominers

noi have read the newsletter and agree with the characterization of mt as cosmetic convenience and power  that said my no vote is really for yes cosmetic and convenience no power you want to spend real money or plex for a nosering or purple hair  be my guest ditto for expanded hanger space or even the ability to sortretain wallet transactions a certain way but not for gamechangers one of the really great things about eve is that like real life you have to make the effort to improve yourself by doing something other than just blowing stuff up ie training sure some training takes a long time and i hate spending 20 days to get a level 5 skill as much as anyone  so what thats life but the ability to bypass that and for example allow a rich noob to buy the skills and a cap ship when theyve played the game for 2 days and complete equally with 34 year players will in my opinion absolutely ruin the game its not elitism or unfair advantage for a player that has put in a great deal of effort to achieve a level or experience to expect noobs to do the same  it is blatantly unfair to change those kinds of rules after the fact obtw its very disappointing that dust is going in this direction  i have no idea what the numbers are but do mmos that use this approach have the same level of play loyalty that eve does i doubt it obtw 2 a company makes a longterm profit by having a longterm satisfied customer base  not by maximizing profit when the outsource
nonever liked plex in the first place allowing plex and mt still fuels the illegal isk banks and spam while i understand people who dont have a lot of money for a monthly sub will feel the pain it will also clean up the profit from bots and hopefully remove the incentive for them to stay
no

no i considered to vote cosmetic only but that would just leave the back door open to force it down our throats at a later stage anywaytruth be told i believe mt for nonvanity stuff is a done deal and if anything may just be delayed to give em more time conditioning the community for it from ccps point of view the purpose of the meeting isnt to decide mt for nonvanity or not it is to get the csm to agree on a acceptable way to wrap it in for the community

1 great and probably cheap ideai feel bad thinking of all the showers that are wasted on stations games
this would be much nicer compared to the current cq however the ability to undock directly from the cq to save time should be kept
because cq interface is below any standardsalso i like ship spinning its what ive paid for these last 34 years at least it spins smoothly
i like the look of cq and i think incarna has potential however there are times when i need to do internet spaceships stuff and not be distracted by rp stuff the current approach make this a hassle when it doesnt have to be please see the sense in returning to us the features we love while still adding new ones we will hopefully come to love

sorry cant support this some feature may have been promised or proposed have to be left behind because of programing difficultiesi do not want to play a game that is going to to spend 20 million on allowing me to launch my frigate out of a mothership when that same 20 million can be put towards making wormholes t3 cruisersyou have to be able to apply your resources to where they have the larges effect when time changes and your gradual replacement of the code makes that feature practical to implimement then pick up that fallen feature on your way though
i should point out that i agree on return of static background only if they rework it in a far better quality a screenshot of a tengu in high res and high quality in old dock looks bad because background has poor quality

the csm has been invited to iceland in a few days time to address the outrage over the mt issueit vital that mts for game advancing items should never be brought in but the issue over cq being mandatory and not having the old hanger with the option to disembark should not be forgotten and swept under the carpet by ccp at the very least confirmation is needed that the option not to load station environments will not be removed
i would love to see the same option the dev had when he first showed it make it optional
when the devs showed us this they had the option as a button in the traditional hanger view i said well ill go along with it so long as that system comes with it whats the one thing they left out that ing button traditional hangerright nowoh and say no mt as well sorry had to say it sorry

i cant believe i havent voted here ealier  absolutely
here is why ccp shouldnt do thisthey could spend the time doing other better thingsincarna is already a cpu hog the more things flopping around and simulated the worse it getssince you all posted in here you clearly all have internet connections you can get much better footage of boobs flopping around than an internet spaceship game
everyone loves jiggle physics although this would mean needing to add a jump button
dead or alive has wobbly breasts itd be a great idea adding some real immersion and perhaps giving us something to do other than spinning ships on the otherhand as mentioned by previous posts there are more important things that need to be fixed first
and just how much of the aforementioned resources were spent on the arsty yet functionless captains quartersi say that cq sets a precedence for designing form over function and that ccp would be totally behind thisthe bottom line  well while you are modelling movements of fat depositions you could also look at the bottom line 1 for the lulz
the other poll is exaclty this whitehoundthe original post was made before there were any microtransactions other than plex
sorry i cant tie ccps hands to compete in the current marketthis micro transaction is an opt out option i dont have to pay for60 monical  dam right how else are you going to limit the popularity of an item any other suggestions in making an item rarethe only mistake ccp made was not to include some penny purchase items i am all for micro transaction to open up npc services like character moving between account or other npc services as long as plex is involved so no one is left out in the coldif you are worried about people being able to buy a win you are 4 years too late since 2007 a person has been able to exchange timecodes for titans
this thread is clearly shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted but 1 anyway
get rid of the nex store to show that you are listening to the players
yesi will not support any development that makes any part of eve in any way inaccessible to anyone with a subscription this includes vanityonly stufffurthermore the halfwere still doing the right thing because you can sell vanity items on the market is  in my opinion  much worse than not selling them on the market as this is a direct injection of value into the otherwise completely save for a few npc items playerdriven marketi oppose of any form of microtransactions in eve not in general making any part of the game available only to those that participate in mt either directly through   plex  aur  item or indirectly through isk  plex  aur  itemany ingame change requiring a microtransaction to be made at some point is not only against the spirit of what new eden has become but inherently limits the game for those not engaged in these transactionsfinally making any game content vanity or otherwise available solely through microtransactions gives the developers a very notable incentive to create suboptimal free contenti would be interested in flying a specifically branded ship  like the scorpion ishukone watch  but making these skinsvanity options not even minding the economy implications of providing bpcs bpos or even ships being injected into the market require microtransations means i may be forced to fly a suboptimally skinned subjective scorpion knowing full well that a more interestingly skinned scorpion exists in the game i pay for only it is not accessible unless i or someone else pays  for it i really am not able to put my concerns regarding any mt in eve into any concise form and as such some points are vaguely described and most points not even mentionedthis post will have to do for nowto reiterateyes i want microtransactions removed altogether
excluding plex because it is the lesser of two evils makes no sense it is either or plex made a huge difference to me as i can playenjoy the game and pay for it at the same time  but the fact remains that plex represent the ability of rl rich people essentially being able to buy isk and by extension advantageps note that the proposed mt is vanity only so technically that should be considered the lesser evil as it does not provide an unfair advantage to usersdirectly perhaps not but giving ccp a secondary revenue stream will allow them to do more for the game as a whole  kind of like banning pesticides no immediate benefit for the individual but mitigates pollution of fresh water supply to the benefit of allgiving the militias uniforms  u mad that would be the ultimate insult like handing out eating utensils to starvation victims  just sayin
introducing microtransactions circumvents the basic playerdriven sandbox economy that made eve the great and unique game it is definitely remove for me too
no to mt
no microtransactions ever
microtransactions goes against the concept of a player driven economy i had looked forward to both incarna and dust 514 as means to create new professions and new ways to expand on the excellent economy of eve however with this move i think ccp is moving away from the player driven economy which will hollow out a major part of eve

plex is the lesser evil of 1 redistributing isk to players spending  and 2 rmtbottingputting players in direct competition with rmtbotting is  in my opinion  the single best argument for having plex in the first place players with no scruples have always been able to buy isk from bottersrmtswith plex the majority of these sales now happen legitimately between players and ccp gets a share as well as opposed to the rmtsbottersthe ability for players to buy their subscription from other players who bought a subscription voucher from ccp using ingame currency  meaning you can play without personally paying   is a nice added effect of the antirmtbotting initiativethe redistribution of isk towards wealthier people is a very unfortunate consequence of plex but in my opinion this consequence is outweighed by the resultingreduction in rmtbottingthe ability to obtain a subscription voucher with ingame currency is an interesting bonus with an unfortunate yet necessary consequencewhat is vanity mt the lesser evil of exactlyvanity mt is not a necessity it is not unavoidable nor does it actually solve an issuequite the contrary instead of having vanity content available to every subscriber you must pay additional  or someone else must for content that could just as easily have been available through the gameplay already present without the need of microtransactionsif you consider nonvanity mt to be the greater evil i must ask why the option no mt is not even consideredthe only reason any mt content would be necessaryunavoidable only thereby giving relevance to the question of the lesser evil is if ccp are not currently financially capable of developing eve onlineif this truly is the case the evils to be considered include a number of options not limited to these few of courseccp slowing down or stopping developmentsupport of eve onlineplayerdestroyed significant plex quantities liberating ccp from subscription voucher liabilitiessubscription fee  increaseccp successfully accepting goodfaith donations already indirectly possible through destruction of plexproviding vanity microtransactionsproviding convenience microtransactionsproviding gameaffecting microtransactionspersonally and it cannot be stressed enough that this is my personal opinion evil 3 is the most appealing to me while still being probableevils 2 and 4 would be wonderful but are most like very unsustainable1 is extremely sad  and handsdown the greatest evil on the list5 is only very conditionally acceptable to me but still problematic  not to mention much less preferred than other optionsi could see 6 being likely but only ever acceptable to me insofar as conveniences are also equally available through ingame means  without depending on plex or other paid thingsfinally 7 would ruin the game for me and i would most likely see myself forced through principleideology to cease playingtldrif ccp are having financial trouble i would not mind an increased subscription fee  or even destroying an additional plex each time i consume onei would mind any form of microtransaction being added something that  sadly  has already happenedif ccp are not having financial trouble there is no necessity and no playercatering reason to introduce content as microtransaction and not regular goods i should probably start my own thread

harvested gas takes a fair bit cargo space i have heard of hurricanes ferox typhoons have been used to do this jobpoke this idea people of eve to see the introduction of a dedicated gas harvesting ship similar to a transporter in size resonable cargo space with the bonus for compressing gas to a liquid as per rl average measurements of the gases to liquid compression could be similar to rl comparisons eg nitrogen gas 696cfcubic feet 1cf liquid nitrogen so a basic formula could be aprox 71 like the volume of fulleritec32 is 50 so with 35 units harvested would give 1 unit of liquidhaving a module say mid slot or include within the ships design capable to compress the gas to liquidnot to forget cycle time bonus per level there is room to improve this bring it on ccp

lets just start by stating the fact that sp sales are already happening and they are immensely popular both on the sanctioned forums via isk which is rl cash via plex as well as on 3rd party sites for rl cash straight upso its really not clear what you are talking about when you say they would be idiotici am a long time player and i wouldnt feel slapped in the face i would welcome the opportunity to buy sp from ccp directly rather than by proxy when you buy someone elses character for rl cash via plex to isk you are stuck with their name their portrait for the time being till you get to change it for plex with their history that you as buyer are rarely 100 aware of and with whatever choices they have made skillpoint wisewhen you pay ccp straight up for skillpoints you have a much stronger bond with the character you create not because you paid for it but because you decide the name the appearance and the skillpoint allocation that is an argument thats based on logic rather than emotionall i have heard in opposition to straight sp sales are arguments which are all based on logical fallacies such as appeal to emotion fear pity tradition etc but not one argument thats actually based on logicif you have one to present i welcome it i am curious as to what logical reason there can be to not allow sp sales
your completely off the mark in regards to selling lp character purchases are not limitless and thus are trained by paying accounts if the ability to outright by lp was introduced the following would happenrookies would no doubt jump into something large and powerful and lose it quickly thus the eve market itself would suffer due to supply and demand issuesnullsec alliances with people who rmt lets not beat around the bush it happens will have the ability to train supercap pilots in weeks rather than months so instead of the current trend of them being used in countable numbers we would end up in a cluster of supercaps onlineyou would be spitting in the face of oh say anyone who has played the game more than six months and has invested time and determination to get where they are the sandbox would quite literally be turned into a kiddies swimming pool urine and chlorine and all your either an excellent troll or completely deluded implants are one thing selling sp outright is the road to f2p and iwin buttons it balances nothing and simply screws the sandbox epicly feel free to vainly try make points about the bazaar but understand the bazaar will always have limited toons at limited times regardless of how frequent sales occur sp sales would literally destroy everything that makes eve what it is it should take time to train for ships it should take time to get t2 weapon systems if you hand it out for cash you remove the entire point of the sp system
i wont argue with you because you are clearly set in your view and no reasonable and logical argument will even be considered by you however the point of the sp system is and always has been to have players pay a monthly subscription fee for eternity to come invested time and determination has nothing to do with it because all you needed to do was pay and wait it takes neither skill nor determination to do so sp have always been handed out for cash just at a much slower paceunlimited titan pilots so what there are only so many titans being built the pilots have never been the limiting factor when it comes to how many titans are operational its always been the availability of new ships if you had any insight in that level of alliance warfare youd know that
youre pretty naive if you think those with rl cash to spend dont already have an advantage over you
originally as in all of my posts im against nonvanity items that can give a player an advantagehowever humpink makes some valid points and the arguments you guys throw back at him are either quite poor or humpink has some pretty good rebuttle humpink seems to be winning this debate in terms of providing good reasoning my personal preferences asideif i may say however again id like to remind you that im originally against nonvanity items if yes if and only if ccp was going to introduce nonvanity items i would hope that they would also involve spending of isk and for anything sp related have very strict rules apply  ie only characters with less than 16mil be able to buy such items or somethingi mean seriously guys if you truly ignore your own prejudice for just a short moment and consider what this will mean for the game trying to think of the positives new player experience will be so much better you can invite your friends and they might actually enjoy the game rather than get bored so quickly and giveup im sure you can think of another oneand consider thisare you seriously going to be against the idea of being able to blowup an expensive ship thats been fitted and flown by a noobmore easy kills guys better kills tooand more players in generalyes there are a few consnegatives everything has cons but people are creating or already have created cynoalts they are always going to be a factor this minor change which weve had before with the 100 training bonus to new characters and before that characters started with 900k sp will hardly make a difference yes i know we all had the learning skills removed but this as i sad before is only a short little boost for newer players to give them a little helping start or are you threatened by a 16mil sp character in a frigate which is probably poorly fitare you jealous of later generations having it a little easier than it was for you in your first monthagain are you against having more people to shoot at more people to buy from you sorry for long post but i think people really need to just give it a little thought without prejudicereminder i prefer there to be no nonvanity items at all but if ccp is going to do it regardless this one i could live with cheers

no
thisalso i suspected that after a year if ccp ever implemented that p2w sp for  many noobs would say to the real veterans lolol why you no buy sp you are a noob youre in a drake and i have a nyx with all sp maxed outsp for  take away the fun factors in eve
i can imagine the neverending stream of mails on the killboards with supercapitals and faction battleships sporting comedy fittingsplease no the idea is stupid in every possible way
maybe 1 per 50 sp maybe but 1000000 for 15 youre mentally ill
this is circular the idea is stupid or not in the context of the game on its own merits youre asserting that ccp isnt stupid why because they dont do stupid things and why is this not a stupid thing because ccp isnt stupid logic failsmoke and mirrors about faction ships deleted because behind that we haveya dont say heres a thing to ponderduring that time of skill training and game playing what ships did you fly what modules did you fitnow a large chunk of people pay for skillpoints we must assume its large or ccp isnt doing it seeing as theyre not dumb and all and this is going to work out well for them right so all those players skip the frigates and crap modules hell lets make a pyramid a small percentage of them go totally nuts and spend ridiculous amounts of reallife cash to get right at capital ships well ignore those because theyre outliersa larger percentage stop at battleships instantly theyve bypassed frigates cruisers and very likely all of t1most of them at the bottom of the pyramid skip crap frigates or maybe frigs altogether and go for cruisers we must assume they at least skip the lowest rung or two of ships and modules or else theres no point in doing thisso having removed a huge portion of the demand for all those items how exactly does this not affect the economy again
honestly  this is not a downside yes inexperienced pilots with no clue whatsoever will be flying around with very expensive things not knowing how to use them or what 00 means or any other damn thing if you think about that for a minute you will realize theres no downside to thisim just not sure it will overcome the weirdness it will do to the economy and the economy is kinda 999 of the original vision of this game
originally players started with between 890000 and 912000 sp based on what they chose for raceetc rather than creating a giant screwball with buying skillpoints provide a bank of discretionary skillpoints that can be applied to get them going to the tune of around 400000 essentially giving them the chance to pick up those all important first skills without having to wait while they train to continue the tutorials and enough to spare for a few options
no extra sp for cash  i have over 100 mil sp taken me 6 yrs to get to this stage why should i be penalized for my time and investment in the game only for someone with very little intrest in the game logging on and buying 20 mil sp at the drop of a hat  what is the point  besides each ship is unique learning to fly a frig ie scouting will improve you as a pvp pilot later  buying skills  jumping ship classes too fast  obtain skill learn how to use ship and mods be a better pilot all round i think the skill system is a a part of makes eve good  tbh
first off let me say that im not an old grizzled vet of this game i started back in 09 when i first found out about this game i got my char up to about 8mil sp then i quit playing because no matter how much i played or how much i put into the game i only gained sp so fast you know great on you for players out there that have been on this game since beta without you this game wouldnt be here now with that said why not do something like this if anything it will lower the price of plex slightly because more people want isk to buy the implants that means you get to play more for less if you want to keep the player driven community going then make these items player creatable ccp wins because they sell more plex community wins because you will have more items in the community and you will keep more people playing for longer yes there will be some cons like guys with 80mil sp running around with a head full of 10s but if there destroyable why the hell not it will give the opportunity for players who would like to be more involed with the game a chance to get into more aspects of the game i mean seriously people why the hell should it take almost a year of subs to finally get into the game right now it takes about a year for 12mil sp maybe with these implants you could get 2030mil sp a year it would take years for a player like me to catch up to a player that doesnt have a head full of 10s and has been playing for long time
just because you conveniently twisted it into a circular argument doesnt make it soreality has already proven that ccp isnt stupid eve is still here after all these years and after so many other mmos even big studio titles folded not only is eve here but it created enough cash flow to pretty much fund the development of dust so yes ccp isnt stupid they will not introduce mt which will slaughter the cash cow that is eve i am surprised that this even needs to be saidit doesnt have to be large at all the code to issue skillpoints is already there thats how we got unallocated skillpoints for that one downtimerollback and for the learning skills creating code to swap plex for sp isnt resource intensive and its there for eternity to come i obviously dont have hard numbers but i would imagine that 100 people pouring in 1000 into converting plex to sp would easily pay for the code everything else is gravywould you drop a grand into a new toon if it is exactly as you want it i know i would but i also know that many of the players i know wouldnt because they cant even afford their current sub begging for someone to spot them a plex so they can keep going to fleetsplex for sp isnt for the masses it would never be its the ferrari vs that ford taurus the majority of the population is driving still ferrari is profitable even though it isnt common same with plex to spits interesting that you feel that someone else obtaining skillpoints quicker than you did would penalize you do you mind explaining what penalty is applied to you every time someone obtains a character they didnt wait 6 years for do you cringe every time a character is sold on the current character bazaarfrankly your feelings on this arent relevant when it comes to the discussion what a company should do for profit and growth you asked about the point the point is growth growth that hasnt existed in the game for quite some time if you cant see why growth is relative and important then thats a discussion for another topic or perhaps some basic business coursesi highly doubt you would have the same view if you were just starting the game today you dont want people to buy sp because you dont want someone to be up there with you thats an ok attitude but lets be honest in saying that it is about you and not the game itself
oops missed replying to thisi think its fair to say that if there was a plex to sp conversion many new players would skip frigates altogether builders would need to adapt to the increased demand for cruisers and bc and the decreased demand in frigatesplex to sp would affect the economy though i dont see how it would negatively affect the economy plex to sp would bring in additional players players that are not just the nth alt of an existing player there would be increased demand for products that demand may not be on the low end of t1 but so whatmy guess would be that few players would go all out and get the sp needed to get into a fleet fit bs but i would also guess that many players would drop a couple plexes into augmenting their fitting skills or get to t2 guns faster or whateverthere will be a shift in demand but new players create additional demand and existing players will demand other goods the economy wont be doomed
the minute i see this in the game id leave it defeats the entire purpose and feeling of eve patience and working towards goalsnot instant gratification
where do these sandbox breaking ideas come from do put some thought into these ideas removal of the time needed to train will impact the sandbox in a number of waysprogression in eve difficulty sps money required to do things are not linear and for good reason diminishing returns is in some areas and increasing returns in others are an important aspect of the sandbox economy much of its balance depends on this buy purchasing sp that balance becomes distorted some parts of the sandbox will be skipped over and additional unexpected demands will be placed in other areasselling sps is short sighted and will have a number of unfortunate expected consequences and possibly even greater number of unexpected consequences
because clearly clicking on a skill and waiting for it to complete involves work news flash eve is about entertainment and to most waiting years for something to happen simply isnt entertainingyour reply contained 122 words and 738 characters including spaces yet you failed to mention even a single unfortunate consequence since you didnt actually contribute anything to the discussion ill take the liberty to make a more personal suggestion and say that you should go into politics
i am for micro transactions but this idea is bada removes the biggest isk sink from the gameb prevents play for free isk grinders to have access to the game there for destroying the plex market
ok want one noob enters game buys his sps up to doing lvl 4 missions noob now never needs to buy frigs cruisers bcs all the ammo the fittings the risks to progress his way up through the game he does not need to purchase any of the products created by players that produce those lower level items he does not have to deal with the risks that allow his goals to have meaning by passing all the risks that has removed all the game play opportunities for other players to present those risks to that playerhappy this isnt rocket science wake up
new players used toi think they still do havent made any since tyrannis get a doubleskill point training period such that it basically does the same thing you stated here the first 14 million is doublespeed giving new players 400k points outright when they dont likely have the isk to buy skills worth investing those points in is rather messed up essentially they get 600k free points just spaced out across their first month45 days or whateveri would object to skill points purchasable directly through plex or aurum but i am not completely against being able to buy skill points an idea a buddy of mine and i bounced around before was perhaps having a skill points injection kinda like a booster make a sort of skill point booster bpc that can be a purchased with lp from the various factions something like 10k sp bpc for 100k lp and 20 mil isk not cheap at all or b drop rarely from regular npc rats i guess with having some freely available sources a plexaurum form wouldnt be that detrimental just as long as thats not the only waythe idea in a nutshell being 10k skill points approximately 5 hours of training is not a significant amount of sp such that it would throw out the game especially if like clone jumping you limit it to one injection a day something about the pain of flashmemory learning to keep it in line with lore and that it would be so overly expensive for skill points that it would not cause people to make supercap pilots by buying sp after all theres the character bazaar pilots can be bought that wayby doing this it will get the high sec people that want to move out to 00 the sp that most alliances demand just a little bit faster the 00 people can get their little sp bonus and the old disgruntled veterans 5th year for me dont get angry at all the young whippersnappers who didnt have to wait for their battleship v trainingjust whatever it is keep it small so that the bonus gained is not so much that it throws things out of balance

you know what this will help vets more than noobs consider vet player out in 00 he can crank out tons of isk chasing down rats and faction loot and lots of meta 4 items he can sell all of this for a nice profit in high sec not to mention all the isk bounties he then turns around and creates a new character he buys a bunch of plex and then goes off and buys skill points for the new character and magic himself in a carrier pilot he knows exactly what skills he needs he knows exactly how much it will cost him to create he then takes that carrier pilot and ganks the stupid noob that bought his way into a dred before he knew what the consequences could beolder vets can out isk the new kids older vets can buy skill points faster than the new kids think about it for a moment as for your buying character argument this is false this characters already existed someone took the time in the past to create them took the risks to earn the isk to purchase their skill books went out and played the game and interacted with others to generate that isk to produce that charactercharacter swaps are sandbox neutral buying skill points is not
its not rocket science yet you still fail to think it through and only consider the path of reasoning that fits your preconceived notionslets look at your example in a little more detailfirst lets talk about risk where exactly is there risk in empire mission running i really do have an open mind about this but empire mission running in a frigate cruiser or bc doesnt hold any risk if anything its more risky to get into a level 4 without knowing what you are doing because you just bought your toonit is true that he doesnt need to purchase lower level items but instead he is purchasing battleships appropriate modules and ammo two years earlier than he would have he is still consuming resources just different ones that will affect individual producers but not the economy as a wholeif you insist on talking risk then other players now present that risk to the battleship pilot for a much more significant loss than suiciding a mission runner caracal in hisecwhat about goals having meaning there are two ways to look at itone way is that nothing anyone does in an mmo has any meaning at all waiting for a skill to complete over time isnt an accomplishment because all it takes is money and timethe other way to look at it is that the person who does not have a problem with dropping lots of disposable income into nontangible goods has already accomplished his goals in real life goals that allow him to not worry about rl cash he wants to spend on virtual stuff now which player is more accomplished the one who spend 6 years of his life and 1000 on eve or the player who walks in and drops 1000 out of disposable income ill let the readers make up their own mind on this onethe third way i know its a long way to look at it is that its really none of your business what someone else gets out of the game just because you feel that waiting for something to happen gives you some sense of accomplishment doesnt mean that everyone else thinks about it the same way what is true is that ccps goal is to provide entertainment value in exchange for money thats all that really matters if ccp wants more money then they need to adjust the way they deliver the entertainment value one viable way to do so is to provide instant action for players willing to pay for itno one is disputing that there will be effects should sp ever be sold straight up however a well reasoned argument demonstrating negative effects has yet to be made and no omg they wont buy 60k isk kestrels anymore teh sky is falling is not a compelling argument
the loss of the mission ship for one ninja looters hauling your loot to market and not getting suicide ganked deciding to sell or reprocess much less learning the difference sell to highest buyer or sell order these are all risks and each represents interaction with another playerwhat about the noob industrialist the noob miner that is operating on a small scale learning the ropes of eve industry and market he looses potential customers cause they just skip right over his productsyeah that sense of accomplishment for overcoming those risks will mean so much more when everyone is running around with 150 million sp and gold plaited pantslisten to your self youre going to try and equivocate this left and right arent youyou can try to equivocate this point with me if you want to but it is not going to do you any good take your straw man and put it in your bag of politician trickswell he can go buy some plex and get a character from the character bazaar a solution already exists that doesnt disrupt the balance in the sandbox thats why it is there and acceptable to most players well if its none of my business then its none of yours either who are you to tell me anything then or make any sugegstions on these forums at alljust because you do not like the result doesnt mean sound arguments havent been made your head is in the sand
for reasons unknown you want to maintain the status quo and use deflection to in an attempt to avoid answers which are inconvenient to your goalsill leave it up to the readership to decide who made arguments that they are able to logically followthe flaw in your line of argumentation is that you presume that all new players will buy their way out of whatever ship class this is an unreasonable assumption likewise it is an unreasonable assumption that an entire industry exist to gank level 13 mission runners out of the loot they are hauling off does it happen it probably does but the impact of some players skipping that content is no different than any other change to the game mechanics eve has seen over the past 8 yearsat the end of the day neither of us has the hard numbers to see how many t1 ships are being produced at what profit they are being sold whether they are being blown up in empire or 00 etc etcwhat we can hopefully agree on is that ccp has those numbers and hopefully the ability to look at them and estimate what impact sp purchases will have on the economydo note that the suggestion to sell sp for straight up rl cash also doesnt have to be an all or nothing type of deal it could easily be adjusted in any number of ways such as providing a limited number of sp that can be purchased per character say 12 or 24 mil to skip one or two years or there could be a limit of how many sp one character can purchase per year lets say 12 mil per year just to make up a number or any other conceivable way to allow players to enter the more meaningful parts of the game without having to spend a couple of years to wait for ityes yes any trained monkey can be in a decently fit tackler in a couple of weeks but its 2011 people who dont already play eve dont have the desire to wait before they receive the entertainment value they are paying forthe skillpoint mechanic is the 2 reason why eve doesnt have more players than it does the 1 reason being the complexity of the game the complexity cant easily be adjusted but the skillpoint issue can be overcome in a sensible way while at the same time still taking in the profit that would have come from that player if he had been subscribed all that time
be my guest this debate has been around for yearsif they want to bump up brand new players thats fine bump them up all the same ccp has gone back and forth on this over the years if they want to allow a way for everyone to get a bump in sp then do it with an in game isk based means that all players can access with out having to go to aurum based microtransactions pay to win keep it in the sandbox this is what implants do and no one has much of an issue with them everyone can access them with out having to go to rl moneyi am not wholly opposed to sp accelerators via some device what i am opposed to is allowing someone to purchase it outright with real world money inside the sandbox whatever go for it everyone can get at it the costs will likely scale exponentially like pretty much everything else in eve plex may be involved in the process to acquire the isk but plex is sandbox neutral in that regardbut do be aware no matter what device is used veteran players will always out class noobs if they have access to the same thing weather its aurum based or isk based it is not the advantage you may think it isthere are many other ways to encourage newer players and maintain retention especially around that critical six to seven month mark besides tinkering with one of the bed rocks of this sandbox
makes so much sensethanks for putting together such a great listid love to do more courier work but contracts are really cumbersome to work with right now and rarely worth the time to even find a suitable one let alone fly ithm im flying from rens to x i could take some cargo along for the way thatd be fun nah itll take half an hour even finding a contract thats relevant and doesnt look too scammy

in here
even tho i have already stated my account this one btw will be allowed to expire on july 18th my reason is for the technical part of running the game period i also am maintaining a neutral stance until such time that results will come out for the better of the community at largei also support the vote of no confidence
1 this about sums it up
im pretty sure no one cares what we think at ccp
what will this document accomplish are we going to vote him out of officei cant play eve anymore knowing that the guys who put this show on dont thyink of us as fans or even customers but as subscribing and they hope mting piggy banks which must be smashed open asapthis little piggy went to perpetuum
yeah im sure the board of directors is gonna get right on that dork
lol you are so bannedthis is completely disrespectfulare you a shareholder do you own a significant part of the companywe are playerscustomers we dont run the company and its completely up to the company with how they deal with the game they own the game you pay for the privilege of being able to play in their world that they created you dont own jack and your word dont mean jackto suggest such a thing is ridiculousand im not saying i agree with everything ccp does im merely saying what an idiot you are 
its a mutual agreement i pay so they can provide they disrepect me any way and i walk away ccp was a company who caught me as a customer because they provided clientservice as in they provided an alternative to buying game changing itemsthey are doing something wrong if their player base is constant as i got at least 5 friends to play eve because of me if they mess my eve experience as it was and should remain im sure i will have support from them when leaving now consider how many others did the same as me what will happen if ccp will upset groups of friends because of thiswe as players asked for improvements and bug killing they would have won more subcribers if they did that as i was an avid lobbyist for eve i am certain many more were lobbyists aswel
by all means

doesnt change the fact that this thread is going to upset some people at ccp and possible result in bans

yeah i thought it was very strange that the ship itself is completely noninteractive in the hangar looks like an oversight in the programming i think
theres a keyboard shortcut altc but yeh it really should be as easy as it was with the mouse
seempulz
if you merge the ship hanger to the station overview the hanger is the first thing open by default when you dock you can then double click on a ships nametype to open its cargo holdi guess that really makes it a double click but its what i used to do anyways  it took me a bit to get used to the fact that i had to double click on the ship hanger and not the back of my avatars head edit on second thought i want to be able to open my active ships cargo hold by double clicking on my dudes head
supercarriers need to be much larger but they should still be called supercarriers it makes sense why theyre called thatreal life progression escortlight carrier  fleet carrier  supercarriereve progression battleship drone boat ie domi  carrier  supercarriermakes sense to me the name is fine

yes and from what incarna put out they arent paying attention to what were are doing is not 90 of what players do in space
agree with the above also very much want my hangar view back so i can elect to bypass all things cq with a more functional screen than the door
we pretty much agree with this i believe theres some wiggle room on the csm about services  i dont give a crap about neural remaps for plex but im comically hostile to gold ammo or the eve equivalent of lowes

eve is a unique sandbox product the result of years of efforts and love from ccpthe nature of the sandbox environment requires a close relationship of trust and understanding between ccp and the communitythe eve sandbox requires constant improvements developments bug fixes and gameplay additionsrecent internal reports have shown that the ccp mindset towards eve has shifted from its courserecent expansions have shown ccp development focus is more concerned with other projects like wod and dusteve expansions should not be camouflaged parts of other games incarnawodeve expansions should not be hooks to other games tyrannisdusteve should not be used as a goosecow to finance vampires or console fpseve requires dedicated teams of developers that not only fix bugs but are also 100 focused on making eve better and growing the sandboxexpansions should be meaningful with content and gameplay additions that further enrich the gaming environmentproposalccp commits to 80 reinvestment policy of all revenues from eve subscriptions to be put back into developing evethis policy will be audited by the csm  community by reviewing annual company reportsccp is free to develop other gaming projectswhatever and can use its track record and reputation from eve to secure external financing according to investor interest and required commercial viability assessments
i like this post and agree completely
i think 80 is a bit high id be alright with 60 devoted to actually improving the mechanics and such for the game incarna was the eyecandy expansion adding no mechanics which benefited the gameplay itself and thus would be part of the 40 invested in extraneous projectsccp has spent an enormous chunk of their available funds in side projects such as wod dust and wis i have no problems with these projects as i want ccp to grow but everything in moderation im wondering if once these side projects are done were going to see more and our beloved game is gonna be left in the dustsupported in concept
signed
i would be happy with 50
sorry cant agree with this topica company has to have its freedom to make its own physical policiesit has to think outside the box to compete in a real worldif it wishes to share 10 million in development in world of darkness which will in turn provide a 5 million in shared development back into eve every year for the next 5 years then that is their decision and i will support ccp on that
80 is probably too high given ccp have already got themselves in over their heads with wod and dust but the idea is sound  the majority of eve profit above and beyond operating costs and salaries should go towards further development of eve and not development of ways to sell mt items as with cq and wis but improvements and additions to spaceship contentfix the bugs first then improve existing content like boring missions exploration fleet warfare sov outdated ui etc finally add new spaceship related content
i would be happy with just 5 which probably is more than the one art team team bff and team gridlock who are currently working on eve
we agree that ccp should have freedom to pursue different projects and think outside the box in order to compete in the real worldhowever how much they can do this on top of developing eve is what this means to address you are seeing the glass half full where all these projects are sucessful and lead to improvements in eve without impacting its development but there is also the glass half empty where these projects lead to so much resources being skimmed away from eve that in practice ccp is gambling with present assets for risky future venturesother mmos which much larger revenue streams can do this but their games have reached a critical mass where the  skimmed is irrelevant in absolute terms thus not affecting development i not only fear that eve has not reached this critial mass yet but also that this level of critical mass for a sandbox mmo is much higher than for traditional storylined pve gamesthere is also a risk mitigation effect from having a portfolio of separate projects rather than all your eggs in one basket under the shared development umbrella the fact is shared development hurts the less risky projects eve and benefits the much riskier projects dust and wod if things go wrong you lose it all because you gambled with everything you hadlets assume that 80 is a good enough figure in practice this means ccp has 20 of eve revenue to develop other projects and once initial conceptearly stages are settled it can then go find investors and vc to fund them if they are sucesfull eve will also benefit from the 5 million shared development you referwhat wont happen with this is that ccp starts taking larger steps than they can afford chasing after larger projects than its real size permits if eve grows so do the 20 for other projects ccp already has an advantageous position with the track record and credibility from eve if these projects are good they will obtain funding ccp is better placed than 1000 other companies developing stuff from scratch  no need to skim off eve please note that several sucessful games have been launched by companies with much less resources than ccp under this scheme  it is still a better setup to make new games than the one they had when they made eve and we all agree eve is pretty awesome why risk it for other things and eve needs constant individualized and focused development lots of it
personally i would like to see this meeting that will take place broadcasted and recorded just as ccp did with ac9 what a joke that wasoopsoff topic set up a special forum so that we the players can ask additional questions or add our input in real timetime to step up ccp and answer to the true investors of eve the playerseve foreverpower to the playerscc
im a fan of this summary have been since i saw it the first time most of the csm is as well it gets linked around a lot
my question would bewhat is the road map for incarna what features are you planning on implementing and when all this drama has ruined would should have been a wonderful achievement for eve and its players give us something to look forward to again
t3 battlecruisers and battleships promised with the apocrypha release where are they and why am i getting led in an infinite circle trying to find out if theyre going to be released we need time spent on correcting problems and finishing the unfinished projects of the past if some of these cannot be finished we need a closure of some sort something telling us what promises made will and wont be worked on now or ever1 on bring back the old hangar as an option if my new vid card hadnt arrived last weekend id be unsubscribed alreadya monthly or quarterly development report detailing the basics of whats bieng worked upon or requiring everyone to post a monthly devblog for their team requiring the same will go a long way towards accomplishing transparency and will keep confusion and additional questions as to what is actually bieng done from clogging up the forums and petition systemspassionwhat more needs to be said here unban em all they wouldnt have acted out if it wasnt something they didnt care aboutpreventionto stop issues like this from exploding across the game and disrupting forumstradehubsliveswork kick around ideas not just at the office but get us involved eve players as a whole are the smartest out there we ruthlessly kill off the dumb ones every day ideas that might cause mass controversy are the first things that should be brought to us rather than find out through subterfuge and information leaks want to know if something might cause another riot ask theres more than enough of us to give a full spectrum of answers from as many standpoints as necesaryand yes id pay 5 to paint my hookbill black like it used to be
theres not a whole lot i could add that hasnt already been covered here and im a fan of streamlining the graphics of captains quarters and the growing ambulation aspect of eve to bring the hardware requirements more in line with the rest of the gamethis issue has also made clear that more and better communication between ccp and the userbase is necessary freeing political prisoners would also be a sign of good faith as a good many are just that greifers not includedhowever id like the ship repaints and customizations to be alot cheaper than 5 myself id also like to see them sell for isk it would be more realistic anyway paying a work crew in isk to repaint your ship like youd pay to repair it the bigger the ship the bigger the cost because theres more to painti have one more issue it doesnt have to do with mt but it does involve incarna with the incarna expansion drones were made to take aoe damage from missions while i understand the reasoning behind this drones have been the whipping boy for nerfs as long as ive been playing i think its about time they see some love perhaps in the form of a complete overhaul expansion in the form of specialized damage drones like that we now have fighters and fighterbombers for carriers but for all three size classes a new ui and perhaps some new gameplay dynamics or even technical changes to make them less laggy so that devoted subcapital droneboat ships in highsec with number bonuses and skills that would lead into carriers rather than the current nonsensical training gunboats to use a droneboat skill training model would not be such an evil conceptim probably the first to really notice that in the patch notes but as a droneboater it directly effects me and does limit the missions i can run without paying more to replace my expensive tech 2 drones than im getting from the mission rewards
updated mainpost again use colors to make it more apealling to readand did a spelling check
im sure like almost everyone else on here i dont care about vanity items if they want to price monocles at 70 usd then more power to them and good luck with that however i think theres a grey area about what is game affecting and what is not overall im not against being able to pay for something that you can grind to get i draw the line at being forced to pay for something in other words you cant get it through normal game play my 02 for the csm are as followsthings that dont cross the linenew ship skins that consume the basic ship to getclothes etc for space barbies and kensplexstandings corp specific nonempire ie cal navy not caldari empire increases i dont think this directly affects competition between players enough to qualify as p2wextra fittings slots on the serverpets for barbie and kenthings that do cross the line p2w stuffgold ammo w better stats gold ships w better statsaur for spaur for access to regionsaur for specific skillsetc
i would like to see ccp rent out invulnerable 00 systems for aur on a monthly rental basisi would also like to see the ability to upgrade such rented systems for some monthly aur charge example upgrades could include a system decloaker that prevents cloaking in that system or access control lists for gates so that the gate will only let you through if you have sufficient standingsif the csm doesnt bring these ideas forward at the summit it will only confirm that the csm is just a pr tool
i would like to see 1 million skill point packs avialable in the nex for close to the price of a plex either as a one time or once per year opportunity aside from various compaints i have about the quality of the interface the biggest eve turn off so far is the long wait time to get the really fun stuff selling smallish lots of sp would not negatively affect the in game player economy would generate income for ccp and help keep more newbs in game by shortening the wait time to get the stealth bombercloaky haulerhulk
well yes so allow the items to be destructable clothing should be destroyed when podded  probably not perfect lore wise but function  lore in this case imho so then they would be like implants btw implants can be pretty damn expensive and people still wear them so 
supported from pi materials it would make sense even for clothingoh and for the dude saying but player made stuff has to be destroyableincorrect stuff sellable on market has to be destroyable and yes clothes are on the market guess whatthere destroyable want proof go get podded poof monocle gonelol i find it epic you all dont realize the clothes are bound to the clone have you not clone jumped yet
it would be more fun to implement shooting in stations and add a right to loot the body and if you shoot somebody in the chest his shirt and jacket are ruined but all of this is just dreams oh sweet implant hunting
lol  youre out of date on your info ccp changed this podding does not cost you mt items theyre invulnerable
edit  i misinterpreted your post youre speaking only to clothing so fair enough i think you will find ccp does not want to sell bpos they may do very limited run bpcs bpos have no long term depreciation in fact they generally appreciate in value as many people research them if players can get a bpo then why ever buy another from ccp when someone out there has a better one plus the bpo holder can crank out researched bpcsi suspect the blueprints sold in dust will be more like bpcs than bpos
good idea  it opens up a new source mineral market as well ie requirement me to buy components from dust 514 to make my designer clothingthe price in aurrum could be low but the process in building it could be a challenge making it a rare item to purchase and there for heavily covetedi like your thinking
crap now i have to buy some cloth get me podded and see what happens just to get the facts straight 
so if i have the clothes on i dont loose thembut what if a transport them in my cargo surely they must drop like plex does rightoh and i 100 support this topic death to magic give us bpc
hmm good question so now i have to buy 2 cloth items argh 
in the crowd source microtransactions vote thread i voted for cosmetic items mt only with some requirements but the reply i ended up writing was so long it turned into a thread of its own i was trying to explain my views on the market and my worries about mt systems in eve ive read a lot of arguments lately for and against mt in a competitive non f2p mmo but i feel that the core issue is not being stressed enough the ability to turn cash into ingame wealth or power isk not just power items so in this thread ill explain my understanding of the eve market and the effects of cash flowing into the game ill also explain why i feel that ccp cant control the cash to isk market the way they seem to intend and ill propose an alternative mt system that includes a control by the player base and market i havent played this game as long as some of you may have so i know i sure as hell dont know everything if you feel that im wrong then please enlighten everyone and lets at least have a discussion about the market for cash to isk trading in eve and vanity items mtand to anyone who takes the effort thanks for reading give me a minute posting the rest asap
i believe plex only worked read didnt break the game while allowing ppl to trade cash for iskpower because it was a contained market with a builtin control because plex was only good for game time the real demand for plex was relative to the percentage of the eve population willing to trade isk for game time except for some market manipulation by players another good argument for plex was that cash for ingame money trading is going to happen in any mmo so you may as well have some oversight and control over it the amount of cash flowing into the game through plex hasnt broken the game for me and that amount would only have increased relative to the eve populations growth and the popularity of game time for isk im against cash for power or ingame money in any comptetitive nonf2p mmo but even i thought the plex system was pretty ingeniousnow ccp wants to introduce some more cash to isk markets in the game i know thats not what theyre meant to be but they facilitate it im not against that as long as its equally limited and theres a strong control in place i think theres enough room in eve for a little bit more cash to isk features because i believe eve players will be able to adapt and overcome a slight isk advantage that a cashisk trader might have also the fun these features might add to the game could be worth it like being able to buy game time for isk is pretty awesomevanity items work great for players as theres no competitive advantage and they work great for ccp because of their relatively low development cost and theres no subscriptions lost like with plex im worried though that enlarging the market for cash to isk items plex and aur items could imbalance the game its undeniable that the percentage of the eve population that would buy vanity items for isk if they were available at reasonable prices is much larger than the percentage willing to buy game time for iskso without the selfregulation through demand mechanism that plex had the only control left for the flow of cash to isk through the aur items market is through controlling aur items supply if that really is the plan i very much wonder how much supply theyre planning on because in order to keep the game balanced that way they may have to eithera make plex prices very low to saturate the market quickly thats a no go id thinkb keep plexaur items very expensive doesnt really fix the problem and will probably just cause discontentc keep plexaur item supply far below demand would put a domper on mt sales and annoy the players who now really want their vanity itemsso in my opinion they cant control the market through aur item supply alone i believe the only way to control the flow of cash to isk is to tie it directly to either an activity or the growth of the eve population with a ratio that the eve universe can cope with with microtransactions i believe that control should be required items for each microtransaction that have to be earned through an ingame activity or traded on the player market if you couple microtransaction items to ingame earned items you make the eve universe adapt in order to accommodate the coming inflow of cash any item that is added through microtransactions has already been worked for ingame and the price of a mtrequired item on the player market would be relative to the price of its finished mtd product minimizing cash to isk profit ofcourse that would break one of the important ideas behind microtransactions saving yourself the trouble of earning things
so this is where i ask ccp to be bold as they claim they are try and think outside the popular mt box for eve there are two big differences from the standard f2p mt model anyway youve got lots of paying subscribers and the eve crowd is not your average mmo crowd if anything eve is about earning stuff ingame through dedication of time and effort more than any mmo ive played so far i think eve players are happy to put in a little bit of work and will still be just as excited about the exclusive vanity items that mt offers themthis approach would provide several controls with which the player market can be allowed to incorporate mtitems and eventually find the right prices mt required item spawn rates can be managed and a price can be set for the required items reprocessed materials or an npc handin reward in the case of disruptive market manipulation by players like artificial scarcity over a longer period the spawn rates can be adjusted upwards to compensate in case of market saturation reprocessing the required item or handing the item in to an npc for a reward should be more profitable than selling the required item on the player market with varying supply and shortages due to required item spawn rates and market activity you can add a whole layer of trading collecting and combining gameplay to mt a gameplay mechanic of its own that doesnt affect the balance of powerthat would solve the issues with anything appearing out of thin air supply and demand of the aur items market would be controlled through the eve population and the exchange rate profitability for cash to isk could be managed through plex and aur store prices ccp could manually change the cost of plexaur items or link aur item prices to the required items market to throttle the amount of cash to isk flowing into the game such a link could mean for instance that ccp would lower the aur price of an mtitem if its required item is abundant on the market and raise the price when it becomes scarce again if ccp could find the right price for required items reprocessed minerals or npc rewards the right spawn rate for required items and the right priceexchange rate for aur store items i think the eve universe would very well balance itself out around vanity items microtransactionsfunny part of it is ccp would have paying subscribers working for them making them even more money while theyre having funfinal note ive not discussed dust in this post because i dont really know yet how exactly it will tie into the ingame economy i think another thread would be more appropriate for that discussion thoughand if anyone got this far thanks for reading
this
there are already posts on this topic but i support the cause
while i support this topic in that im not a fan of such convenience items being added this is not related to the microtransaction issue as long as aurum can be acquired with isk features such as this are available to players willing to spend real money and also to player who arent they can simply save up and grab the extra features with isk that being said this issue needs to be judged on its merits apart from any microtransaction issues and even then i dont think it holds up
an excellent point  ive played plenty of games that had builtin inconvenience purely to drive sales of convenience items myselfno the first thing the csm should raise is getting an absolute concrete no there will never be any ingame advantages including but not limited to better ships modules weapons ammunition boosters and implants sold via microtransactions no there are no plans no at this times no weasel words no laywerisms an outright clear concise statement
emptyquotin
we need a flat out no from ccp on this idea as wellno inconvenience by design therefore no convenience mtsif the inconvenience is something players will want to get rid of fix the game design with the 50myear in sub fees  dont charge more to not fix itsupported
1now you are giving them way too many dangerous ideasbut you are right i can see them capping fittings somewhere but a reasonable limit based on actual technical constraints would probably be closer to 1000 or higherit is hardly about the storage space
oh yeah conveniencebased mt will keep me unsubbed 1
got my vote though id still rather see mt removed completely
very good points supported
agreed i find this sort of behavior from software companies very distasteful even more so for a product for which i have already paid its as if i purchased a full version of photoshop only to have to see constant popups for illustrator and other nag ads ive paid my cover charge to the party and bought nearly six years worth of drinks tipping the man in the bathroom for a towel is optional if it is not optional then dont be surprised when i relieve my self on the dance floor
well in the case of blobs logistics would be necessary to essentially keep the gate open say a group of 25 ships have 5 logistics ships under my model those 58 logistics ships could help to move the 25 man gang relatively unhindered say there is a giant gang on gate and you have a small invading force it makes the roles of scouts much more important finding alternate routes as an attacking force that sort of thing and when you start pwning face the campers cant just jump throughshooting down an idea on a basis that it will create bugs means theres something wrong with the game not the idea
essentially shooting down an idea based on putting arbitrary mechanics in game because you can not figure out how to over come the issues when others can is a great reason
gatecamps will now have people on both sides constantly jumping through to deplete the capacitor unless you can tell if a gate is capped out from across system goodbye buzzard and viatoradditionally you encourage more static pvp since people would rather have other people jump into their fleet rather than jump their fleet into others in ones and twosit would also be a good idea to have a mechanism is place so that people can tell what the cap level on gate is
1horrible idea if you can afford to spend extra real life money on the game you should just get another account that gives you 3 extra char slots and an extra training queueskill transfer and especially the combination of these is even worse since it
excluding the transfer idea your basically arguing against extra accounts period if you dont like that people can train two characters at once then you must really not like people being able to train two characters and play those two characters at once so your argument is at heart contradictory with itself ill give you the transfer though i dont like the possibility that people might eventually be able to pay money to get skills however if it must happen if ccp is going to do it i want it done in such a way that someone somewhere invested the time in training the skills that are going to be sold this limits the supplymeaning no matter how much money you have there will be an in game bottle neck that can not be overcome with money which in turn will increase the perceived value and above all preserves the status quot you might say that if they can pay for extra accounts they can easily overcome the bottle neck you forget that the skills have prerequisites i cant use two characters to get minmatar cruisers level 1 in half the time for either character to get to minmatar cruiser level 1 both would need minmatar frigate at the appropriate level now you could have one work on gunnery and the other work on minmatar cruiser but the moment any skill is transferred off the character youve got to cover that ground again on that character to get to the next skill up so using two characters to get skills in half the time only works up to the point you start transferring it can be done but at enormous cost you have to pay for a transfer blank for every skill you want to transfer and you have to pay for an alternate account or additional training queue for the duration of that training in the end you have one character that can do one role at a time which might have otherwise been two or three or four characters that together would be capable of completely owning that one character i also think most people willing to p2w will not have the patience to wait on cashing out their training mule to get to the really high end stuff i think this transfer idea will carrot our dear rmters right over a cliff and leave a large chunk of money in ccps wallet meanwhile the rest of us have a way to correct minor training mistakes while making a little isk if we need to or to sell off skills we simply dont want anymore this part i think plays into the lore of the gameagain however the fact remains that we are confronted with the possibility that ccp might simply put skill points on the market in exchange for money period no training queue no waiting period at all you may not want my idea but surely you dont want that idea even more as ive pointed out im trying to turn nightmarish outcomes into more tolerable alternatives can i at least get a lesser of two evils vote while denouncing both possibilities
after this last weeks emotional rollercoaster and digesting all the available info ive finally bent in to the desire to write this thread op despite my better judgementtable of contents10  disclaimer11  purpose20  introduction21  bulletpoints30  arguments31  granularity32  exclusives33  the character creator40  end points41  conclusion42  shoutouts10 disclaimerno doubt if youve even bothered to crack open this thread youre either for or against incarnage or monoclegeddon and will without a hint of further reading likely attempt to derail this thread so that it may join the ocean of other derailed threadsplease refrain from doing so at least until youve read me out unless youre scared a 3 year old newbie like myself might change your mind its been said elsewhere but honestly  if youve ever had any love for eve you would realise that at this point youre only hurting it more than it is hurting youhowever if you are genuinely a lover of eve online i welcome you to read on and eventually make a constructive comment even if this thread only ever gets its one page and is swiftly forgotten in the depths of the assembly hall or is trolled into oblivion11this threads main purpose is to outline some ideas for how the aur store cancould be turned into something remotely acceptableobviously we are almost all in agreement that aur store merchandise should never go beyond vanity items allcaps exclamation mark so with that out of the way here are my points of view on a few points the csm might want to consider bringing up to ccp on the topic of the aur microtransaction store20 introductioncurrently the aur store only accepts one kind of payment by design and that is aur the purpose of aur is to granulate plex as to create a plex sink out of desireability for the offered items this is currently not the case as nigh on all of the store items cost more than their real life counterparts indeed any item in the aur store which costs more than 1 plex is a redundant item as the store might as well just charge plex instead of aur because of this my proposal revolves around redesigning the aur store to accomodate for multiple requirements for the sale of a vanity item such as faction lp and standings to name a few21 bulletpointsso to satisfy the bulletpoint quota here are some bulletpoints redesign the aur store so that  all items cost less than 1 plex worth of aur optional increase aur value of plex for added granularity  exclusive items should require additional conditions section 32 see below for specifics  basic vanity items should require basic easy to complete conditions  all items aur prices should not directly devide or multiply into 3500 do not reimburse currently purchased items people made a preemtive investment  market damage control has never worked irl itterate on the character creator so that we are no longer dependant on it for anything but our passport photos  make vanity items destroyable in some way either through poddingship lossstation or sov flipping  make our character photos be more passport photos less real time representation
30argumentssome of the above may need some explaining31 granularityas stated above in part 20 the purpose of aur is to granulate plex and anything costing more than 1 plex worth of aur is redundant however due to the nature of the cur
the solution make any non ordinary and basic items in the nex require additional conditions it really is almost that simple as it turns the rich sucker navy jackets into status and acheivment symbols and we all know everyone is secretly an acheivmentist for examplecaldari navy captain ceremonial jacket aur199 caldari captain rank in faction warfare required 2000 caldari navy lpwith the above pricetag the jacket in question could even be given as a faction warfare reward uppon rank aquisitionall of a sudden you stand out from the crowd what you wear shows your status in new edenand say you get demoted or even fired well you can still wear the jacket but it wont let you into that caldari militia exclusive bar anymore even less its captain area also notice how now it isnt a vanity item but because it is reasonably priced  affordable and somewhat exclusive and can be awarded through other means than the aur store it is much more acceptable than if it was aur only this idea could and should be implemented for all non basic vanity items how much would you pay for an awesome guristas monocle too bad you dont have the standings evil laughter just as ship modules have faction variants the basic nex store items need faction variants even if it is just another colour or slight model change when was there ever a notion of the incarna environment purposely being any different from the rest of evethe bottom line of this point is wis feels like something that isnt eve one major contributor is that there is no requirement for incarna features as of this moment to rely on the rest of the features and vice versa change that the two environments should be playable independantly but should also reward those willing to use both if ccp is scared that people will not use a feature make it worth our while33 the character creatori have a bone or two to pick with it dev pun intendedyes the character creator ccp has developed with their carbon tech resources is amazing but it also has its imperfectionscurrently the nex vanity items are indestructible if you are podded with your monocle it doesnt dissapear this is a problem as these vanity items are also on the market the market for anything indestructible is doomed to eventually fail as supply increases and demand decreases less people will want one as everyone already has one suddenly the ones without monocles stand outmake vanity items destructible but also less of an incentive to gank current monocle wearers beware they are out to get youthe character recustomisation should only be used for our photos not our real time avatars changeing clothes outside of the recustomisation session should be as easy as refitting a ship simply stand infront of your mirror and drag a piece of clothing onto your avatar rescustomisation should be kept as a passport photo opportunityupdater im sure no one in their right mind always wears what they had on 5 years ago when they took their last passport photo here is the catch though make the passport photo update automatically every time you add time to your account this is for both lore and practicality reasons for starters it means that someone who loaned a monocle for their photo and then resold it only has it until his next liscence renewal theres the lore refrence when you update your liscence you need to submit a new photo nifty no on a practicality level since you already save the expressions lighting and pose automating the entire process for each character once a month shouldnt be a big problem for the briliant ai programmers at ccp
additionally with direct implications to this add an option on the cq mirror to access the garderobe you know the clothes dresser which would basically be a real time catalogue of all your accessible accessories like a station item hangar but for clothesissues that this solves jumping clones getting podded with vanity clothes changeing clothes without changeing your general appearancedamn this is turning into a long post just a bit more to go though40end points41 conclusionright now being ccp has got to be incredibly stressing its a hard job to develop and push out these expansions unfortunately the perfect fuel was added to the perfect storm which lead to an apocalypse of before never seen outrage in the community trade hubs were locked down with protesters rendering the game often unbearable to play in the long run for a lot of us a now over 400 page threadpocalypsethreadtitan of rage was created in the process the fact that leaked info was made public by en24 at the same time made the situation so volatile it literally exploded ccp took a while to realise just how much anger they were dealing with it rivaled and probably even surpassed the t20 incident which as we should know prompted the creation of the csm just dont let that get to your head ever as players and customers yes we are powerful  but with great power comes great poniesresponsability so if you want to ride the white pony realise it might evolve into a horse and throw you off its back42 shoutoutsto the csmi trust your competancy completely and i know that as much as mittens doesnt care about some or all of these things he is the chairman and will do the right things in the end likewise to the rest of the csm show ccp the light at the end of the tunnel  just dont let it be a fenrir freighter on colision course with their sturdy shipto ccpi dont know how your current methods of communication with the playerbase work on an internal level but i would heavily suggest that you rethink them as was mentioned elsewhere starting a monthly qa newsletter in the shape of a devblog would be a huge step in the right direction preferably create an eve gate feature to let players send their questions reliably and easily it also makes eve gate more useful the lack thereof being the primary reason so few use it to begin with this last week has been nothing less than public relationsageddon dont ever let it repeat itself again at least keep that mindsetdont get me wrong im angry at you for releasing incarna as unfinished as it is despite whatever release shedule you had in mind this is borderline incomplete feature that should only be on sisiduality right now but im also more than willing to forgive you for all the mess if you let us help you clean it upto the communitychill out ccp screwed up admittedly big time but its time to put down the pitchforks and torches and to show everyone that you are capable of something other than rageing like spoilt brats in a toy store show ccp what makes the eve community great show them why we love eve and keep it dearly in our heart we are all scared of what eve might devolve into if handled incorrectly see easony but now that ccp has decided on what its next steps are flying the csm to iceland for the 2nd ever emergency meeting in the history of eve it is time to take a step back take a deep breath and take a fresh look at the situationi started blameing ccp initially but now its the community which is starting to look immature and irresponsibly hell bent on destruction are youthank you for reading all of the above assuming you did you may now tell me how much of a ccp altsupporternaive person i appear to be or maybe youll actually support this and prove how wrong i am in assuming the forum community only rages
i dont know if 4 posts can be considered an op but uhh flame onedit oh i almost forgot do feel free to add your support to this thread if you so desire the option is right by your replyedit text box thanks
the thing id like to ask you isis the game better because these involve aur instead of isklpdoes ccp really need this extra cashflow to develop eveis this cashflow going to go to eve at all
imo no yes and no in that order
the game does not nescessarily become better because the nex involves aur instead of isk or lp or any other payment for that matter however i strongly feel that for anything that is off the general market and is hence somewhat exclusive no one currency should dominate the existing lp stores charge tags misc items as well as lp and isk isk by its very definition is the base currency of eve online no general transaction should not involve it  aur or otherwise isk should be the majority cost of an item with aurlpanything else as a token side fee if were talking about creating items out of thin air upgrades like the iw scorp should either come as paintbuckets for maybe a dozen aur some isk a faction standing with ishukone requirement or as the ship itself with the prior requirements plus a base scorpionccp does need this extra cashflow to develop its three currently in development titles dust 514 wod and ofcourse eve online eve is still in development durr there has been multiple threads on this in the general discussions part of the forum right now however id rather point people to buy things from the real eve store than the noble exchange because you can get a real eve tshirt for 20 as an extention of that the cashflow will probably not go to eve alone it is logical to assume that it would go to whereever ccp needs it most
i still say get rid of mt altogether lp stores are the appropriate place for clothing and trinkets if players want to earn them sooner they can buy plex to get better ships and mods in order to complete more missionsfw in their available playtimehowever if the mt store is here to stay  ugg  then the op has some decent ideas
thank you its nice to know im not a fundamentally flawed individuali severely doubt that the so called mt store will be removed ccp wantedneeded a plex sink a way that isnt adding game time to your account but still removes plex from the game  see the recent change to plex that let you put them in your cargo hold and move them so that the ammount of plex created ie ammount of 15 sent to ccp for a plex increases indeed right now ccp probably makes a large percentage of its money from plex i say this because there is a much larger potential for multiple subscriptions values to be consumed with plex by a single player than without plex someone might fund their account with their credit card and supply their character with isk with plex all of a sudden this person has doubled or even trippled his contribution to ccpedit some random guesstimates right now there are over 2500 plex on the open market thats 37500 worth of plex most of these are in the quantity range of 12 units the daily movement is about 260 last i checked so that means that every day 4000 of plex are put up for sale thats 117000 a month
hooray for xg 3 you forgot to tick the support this topic box mate
i really want a top hat and a caneand before someone think im a troll im actually dead serious people dont seem to understand that i want my character to be stylish
the so called stinking rich players do supply plex to the market but adding more supply of an item with a roughly fixed demand does not increase prices it lowers them the more people who buy plex with cash the lower the value of plex in iskto bring things back on topic i would like to see the option to activate the skill queue on a second character on the same account for the price of a plex you d still be paying the equivalent of a second account but would simplify the book keeping as such
race and gender changeseeing as for some time raceschoolbloodline has meant nothing in relation to attributes and how incarna changed the aesthetic of every race it seems only right to give people a doover albeit a purchasable one for a reasonable price 12k aurum and yes in the sandbox mt should be kept to vanity items only the instant anything slightly game changing becomes attainable even indirectly through real money it ceases to be a sandbox and player driven economy
ship decals would be nice nothing says youre screwed quite like a giant flaming 666 on the side of an armageddon with a cruiser sized skull plastered on the front
well  why not a poker minigame sort of with very moderate and limited aurumbets or an enhanced jump clone upgrade with a 1684h jump timer  just raw thinking 
corp paint jobscorp pays a great deal to have a crop paint job talking 100x monical costcorp pays a lot for corp logos players can put on ships logo placed in 2 slots costs 10x monical costcosts a lot but once purchased each corp member only pays a bit of isk or some other resource to use it
a button that makes leaving your pod and enter cq optionala monocle that lets you see all characters in station without clothes think about the performance boost the client will get if it doesnt have to render all those clothesor maybe services like a killboard or a skillplanner i think there will be a big demand for those when the free tools are no longer being developed because people have to pay to do that
clothing that doesnt look like it came from an overpriced thrift storeback in the day when we made characters we had a whole slew of different gadgets that could be put on them a lot of head gizmos more of that maybe add other things along those same lines there are multiple layers of clothing for the torso i could imagine backpacktype things gloves with gadgets and flashing lights i was expecting futuristic but i see grungevarious customizable uniforms uniforms that have corpalliance logos on them maybe throw a bone to the militias by making uniforms that show their rank
i do not support selling game changing services such as faction and sp resets bad idea all round 
the option to remove every single trace of rmt in eve removing aurum from the wallet removing the stupid button in station services and removing the showcase incarna everything else is just pure stupid and only stupid people will buy stuff from the vanity store
would it be possible to add the same payment options to the plex system that eve has for account renewalhello csmi am not sure if this point has been proposed before i did not find it anywhere ive run into this issue on several moments really when i feel like buying a plex the only way to currently buy these through eve is by creditcard or some odd system which seems to work for russians would it be possible to add the same payment options open for account renewal to the plex systemi am sure it would make buying plexes much more accessible to many people like me not owning a creditcard but fine to pay with the other options like directly through ones bank it would seem like a minor change in my view but i do expect ccp has it under different branches because of the different workings i feel if ccp looks at how many people pay for their monthly renewal in otherways than creditcards they should be able to imagine the possible increase in plex salesthank you for your timezav
nice would work for me as poor student bump
yeah i see no problem making plex easier to buy with a variety of payment methods
yup benefit for both parties ccp gets more isk less need for odd changes for the sake of money though i want to avoid relating this proposal to any recent change cough and we the players can buy plexs with not 2 methods but 7
when cq is disabled we should be shown the old station view rather than the current picture of a doorapologies if this has been said before i did look but couldnt immediately see anything
yeah it has been brought up extensively but other topics have since bumped it down however its by no means a dead topic  myself and a great deal of other players want cq and wis to be 100 optional with the old hanger being the option not the door
here is some suggestions of what i would like you do in iceland in very broad termsstart by demanding the complete removal of aur and all forms of playercpp transaction for any ingame things other then subscription time the subscription we pay should include everything that is in eve periodthis will of course fail but in negations you dont start with the compromise you are hoping to get out of itonce it is clear ccp will not remove aur and you cant get any more attention for those demands i would like you to demand the following1 ccp should clearly promise that eve will continue to use subscriptions as its primary funding mechanism2 ccp should provide product content labelling that is easy to find and that shows exactly what in game features and items are included in the subscription and what you will have to pay extra for3 ccp must state that they are still committed to the eve sandbox model and still have the long term goal they pushed when launching planetary interaction that everything in eve should be built by players from player harvested resources4 ccp must promise to not sell pay2win spaceships items vanity items new player time limited boosters and similar as long as it is compatible with demands above is as far as we will tolerate mt to go5 and ofc put the ship spinning backthere should be 3 options you can choose from on what happens when you dock a  spinning shipb  static intractable ship background like do not load station environment option worked before incarnac  automatic unpodding into incarna enviroment option a and b you need to click a button to unpod and enter cq it doesnt matter which option is set as default as long as we get themi would like to know what everyone thinks of this if you only support some of the points i have made please indicate with number and opinion like 1y 2n
works for me
sorry if ccp sort out this mess we will be comming back
o bye
take you well deserved breakplease quit the game immediatelyonce ccp has change the game for the betterreturn refreshed when the game has been allowed to evolve eve grows with the tools handed to us not the story content that is created for us to read like world of war craft they need the ability to brain storm and this document shows it ccp is willing to take into consideration of the opinions of several conflicting opinions to open doors to do stuff is the sign of a company who has potentiali am personally looking forward when the work completed on dust 514 and realm of darkness feeds back onto eve because of carbonccp has already taken assets from the realms of darkness and feed them into the epic arc of evemicro transactions can only benefit eve as those  carrying rich boys and girls carry the cost of the game because they wanted to stand out with a new monical
no
edit  fixed for readability ok i know there are tons of threads like this but here is my view of this subject and what i think should be carefully discussed by csm with ccp this week and what i dont care about and can be left alone 1 nex pricesdont careif you dont like that you cant afford a vanity item then its your problem this ought to be for the few that need their epen enlarged2 nex products like ishikune scorpionnow this is more problematicim all ok with idea that we get a normal ship just with different visual facewhat i want to stress though is how we can get them  it have to be exchange  something  aur  sparkling something  it should be bpc not item that we trade therefore it will not only be about getting already made scorpion and trade for ishikune version but maybe trading bpc for a bpc of ishikune version this allow more flexible prices for new ships  i dont care how many plexes it will cost3 nex potential items like gold ammothere are some arguments that if this would produce bpc just like the faction store it would be like faction store so some would sell it and market will be full of those so anyone can use itwrongfacton store is limited to the ammount of players holding standing and enough lp to buy now unless the price would be extreemly high to high to use it actually the market would be flooded with thiose ammomoduleswhatever probably making t2faction version not only innefective but also to expensive everyone would use the cheep all avaible uber version4 nex potential services like faction standing remaps etcout of questionanything that gives one player advantage of any sort no matter how small not only in terms of pvp but also in terms of character progress or pve mission access should not be even considered 5 nex potential game upgrades like additional clones command screen in cqnew game features avaible only to aur clients or expanding already avaible features by rising existing limitsas long as this will not touch fis part of game im willing to listen to proposals it can affect gameplay in incarna to some level but without some sort of proposals i can not say but i say no to any gameplay aditions that will benefit aur players over others even if only by easing interface usage this opens road to dangerous path of removing content and selling it via aurif i miss something i will add laterdiscuss
this mt is ok if it stays vanity only the price ranges are not my concer since im not gona buy anything of that store
supporting my own proposal
i agree with this mt is ok i will never buy from the mt store but if not doing so means i cant ever win because someone else has bought an item from the store then im out and before anyone brings up plex plex is not an ingame advantage considering it means they can play for free but doesnt make them better at pvp and since the plex still costs ingame money it is still costing them just out of a different walletin short mt vanity good anything else pure evil
thanks for the support
i hope this topic isnt burried by the anger topics above its a nice idea which can be looked at as an addition to buying characters plus will make more people come back or get their alts playing again
this ui suport ito hope that nto brat on top on ader topic
interesting concept altho i think there are more pressing matters at hand
there are always more pressing matters at handsupported
thanks for the replysi ofcourse forgot about training queueslike it is today you can only have one concurrent active training queue per account thus only one concurrent character with active trainingin proposal it would be like thisconcurrent logins  concurrent active training queueshope this is clear enoughplease ask if something is not clear and feel welcome to add or disagree with my idearegards
can the csm please bring up that a lot of players would like the cq to be optionalcq is great but i dont need it every time i dock i stop by for a quick ammo or shield recharge and i get out of my pod why would i do thator my alt docks up to drop of slavage and cq loads up just to drop off stuff why woudl my character get out of the shipcq is great and will be better still but i dont need it everytime i dock also cqship spinning
as a caldari at heart and actualy feeling gallente as close relatives read this as fan for caldari and gallente races inside eve as a game hybrids are either best guns read here blasters or worse guns read as rails all other guns have better overal dps ragarding medium long range then their hybrid counter partseve is a large universe and im amazed how well is actually ballanced considering there isnt much testing grounds on other servers like all other mmos run nor there is much experience with this kind of sandbox before eve went live
1ive always loved the look of the hyperion i think it should be given a role like the fleet typhoon give it a nice drone bay some missile bonus as well as gun bonus make it a unique ship and skill intensive to pilotthen we can move on and add lots 
i like the idea to think over the hyperioni love drones so i think the idea is great to give it the opportunity to use like 78 sentrieson the other hand why not leave away the armor repping and give it next to the guns the counter bonuses to a scorpion make it an anti ecm ship that has a certain resistance to ecm measuresthat would be interesting for pvp but as well for pve agains guristas  bit tweaking on the energy and cpu might me necessary
terrible idea there are already many l4 mission farmers that are way too rich and crash mineral and module prices anyways t2 salvage would unbalance the market and crash the price of t2 rigs
nomushrooms
a major part of my isk comes from highsec mission running but even i disagree with the proposal lowsec is risk vs isk it should stay that way
nomissions are predictable and if youre losing your ship you are either overconfident or doing it wrong with a couple of fairly skilled toons plus an optional salvage toon level 4s are easy to tank and hard to fail ccp was right to restrict t2 salvage to t2 ship wrecks and lownullsec sites
obviously you havent noticed faction rats still spawn in hisec both in belts rare and in anomalies and exploration sites not to mention mag sites still yield t2 salvage in hisec the odds are about what youre asking for herethats right back away from the raven and your textbook mission running and get into something with some competition
 possibly one of the most intelligent posts in all of the forumsthey didnt actually lie and incase you didnt read the other replies in this thread  they certainly didnt break any promises either as they never actually made a promise in the first place they merely said it wasnt their plan plans changei have a habit of correcting people i know lol 
plans have changedthreadreally how many times can we get back to this shadows quote come on
players thats not part of our dealccp i am altering the deal pray i dont alter it any further
perhaps we have no plans to translates roughly towe hadnt thought of that yet but now that you mentioned we can charge for it well add it to the queue 1 for community involvement
i concur
one of the most tedious part of war is the act of adding all known war targets to the watch list and removing them when the war is overit both consumes player time in unfun and unproductive activity and server resources both when updating lists and when sending notificationsmy proposal is to add a corporation andor alliance level watch list updatable only by directors or some new role that would be automatically be part of all members watch listthe tedious part is thus centralized and divided by the size of the corporation and server optimizations could certainly be foundstandings already work like that since both standings and watchlist are used as a common intel tool adding the same functionality for watchlists would be coherent
im a day behind on reading zulus blog my bad but after i cancelled my account ive only been checking on things to see how things turn out not so much to play all the timeto my pointfearless and the its just a rag to discuss ideas its not facts yeti actually believe this but look deeperwho is arguing the plus and who is arguing the negativesyou have a guy in the con department who shreads data and makes spreadsheets all day saying mt for greed is badvsyou have one of the lead game designers still actually working on eve the spaceship parts theyre still separate in my book arguing on the plus sidelets pretend that he was given this side but doesnt believe it who picked him for that argument and why the massive disparity job classifications oh yes all equal im surespreadsheet monkey vs lead game designerlackey or leadi hope the csm drills in on this point when theyre in iceland this week
conspiracy theory
this is the first time i have posted or even visited this section of the forums but i had thought of something in regards to the nex store i posted it in the comments thread for zulus latest blog and will post it here for conveniencewe the players through the csm need to be very specific about the future of the nex and make sure that ccp is the same i dont mean getting rid of it that wont happen since they put a lot of resources into development however i do see ccp stating for now that they will not introduce items that will produce an in game advantage but i dont think that will cover all of the possibilities here is what i can see happeningccp and the csm will come to the agreement like i said above and most of the players will be satisfied but about a year down the road when dust is due to release or right after pirate faction tower bpcs will show up in the nex and i would hate to see the rl  cost on those after all how much is a rl skyscr there will be a lot of minor gripes and forum rage but most people will be happy that they can now get them againccps response will be something along the lines of we did not introduce anything that provides an in game advantage the towers are already in the game most people will be satisfied with this answer because well its true then other items will be reintroduced and accepted for the same reason and soon after that will be the p2w itemsyes this may be a conspiracy theory but i can see ccp doing this please get them to agree to if something has in game stats it will not be sold in the nex we cant allow them wiggle room or loopholes that they can say we didnt go back on our word see thank you for taking the time to read this if you did im not really saying this will happen but i can see them doing it
the csm is irrelevant ccp will do whatever it is they want to do the csm is just a pr expenseother than that i am for one are for being able to buy pretty much anything via nex and i dont see any type of problem with it neither do the thousands of other players who arent going all emo on the forumsimprovise adapt overcome  or walk away which you and all the other forum warriors wont do simple as that
i say nooooo
no different to any other politician i often wonder why people even bother voting for these csms tbh noone can actually point to anything any of the past 5 csms have achieved that ccp werent going to do anyway
i have zero confidence in the csm they are paper tigers at best ccp yes women at worstall of the csm should resign but dang it those free holidays to iceland sure are nice huh
oh yeah getting 4 days notice to fly to iceland for a couple of days is sweet i dont really understand the you should all resign thing what do you think that would accomplish right now one of the biggest problems is that ccp just plain doesnt understand why you are upset the only way that will change is by people talking to them that is why we are going
the  i dont even eat seafood
i agreed need to take out some of the penalty maybe divide the sec loss by 10 and then it evened up and make eve a bit more favorable
um yeah notes anyone
good question altough there are more pressing matters right now
must be on ccp hands now and given the timing and situation i think well have them after the minutes of the exceptionnal summit
can the csm please bring up that a lot of players would like the cq to be optionalcq is great but i dont need it every time i dock i stop by for a quick ammo or shield recharge and i get out of my pod why would i do thator my alt docks up to drop of slavage and cq loads up just to drop off stuff why woudl my character get out of the shipcq is great and will be better still but i dont need it everytime i dock also cqship spinning
i think it was confirmed that if you pod someone with a monocle they lose it not sure thougheithe way i still stand on my pointscq optionalno cash for eve itemsvanity only forever and always in eve and incarnathe other things are basically icing n the cake and would show that ccp is listening also the mission thing is annoying i cant do even a lvl 3 in a drake now cause being jammed for 2 hours isnt fun
heres my wish list from the csm in iceland details in the original thread summary in brief  what id like to see the csm seek from ccp in iceland1 commitment to restore the preincarna hanger view as an absolute development priority2 serious consideration given to vanityitems nex being produced as blueprints with player input required for manufacturing finished product3 commitment to a healthy ratio of traditionallydelivered content items over nexdelivered content items4 get the truth about dust 514 and come back with a provisional estimation of cost to play we need to know how this is going to impact our ability to afford and enjoy the game of eve online
what i would like to know1 mt for gameplay affecting stuff  clear yes or no preferrably written in blood or something not the smooth stuff like there will be no golden ammo bcouse our art team made them green already2 put the old dock back disembark button to go to cq3 percentage of manpower and funds that goes to eve development at the moment4 some longterm plans for eve would be nice to know it seems there is no clear vision at the moment
hey csm if you want to speak for me this is it theres plenty of content and game mechanics like missions pos  industry that is full of potential yet in dire need of a major rework not just random removal of complexity prevent them from releasing even more halfbaked features cq is a nice tech demo but useless and annoying no mt a la nex no vanity items that have not been earned through some kind of honest grind plex for isk is perfect the concept can and should be refined  eg split plex into 10 units and offer different types of pilot licenses for cruisers bs and caps see my proposal in jita speaker corner that way new players could play for less effort than old megabillionaires and multititansupercap owners
i have given this mt business a little more thought i think i actually could accept all kinds of items if they were at reasonable prices and if they were blueprints bpo andor bpc if that is done then i wouldnt care if they further down the line placed every npc bpo in the nex as long as the price is about the same as now nex would become the market for blueprints the problem for ccp is of course that bpo for clothes would be very cheap they cant sell a tshirt for millions and millions of iskthe drawback is that new players rarely would buy any bpo anyway it is imo worth for csm and ccp to ponder if this could lead to anything acceptable
i meant for micro transaction theyll be everywhere there is something to read hey look everybody 30 off xxx for a limited time only itll be in the character select screen the billboards there will be pop ups itll be a nightmare that you cannot escape or turn off you think theyd let you turn off an advertisement to a source of revenue itll kill the game quick
the moment they do that i can probably guess about 50 of player base will leave for perpetuum aka i dont really think theyll do this anytime soon since everyone know where that would lead
to try to define where the boundary is for people on vanity vs nonvanity mt i have started a bunch of polls on failheapchallenge it would really help us the csm if people would be willing to go over there and vote and discuss a few possible mt ideasthe forum is
i do not like to register on third party forums i wish this would have been done here polls are also a narrow option of choices predetermined by the thread maker you may have better luck asking and tallying the information in a thread here thanks for the effort good luck whats the deal on the notes from last summit i am hoping csm realizes there is room for improvement on how long it is taking this should have been finished long before this other matter came up imo
csm if you are the least bit honest you will admit that whatever concessions ccp gives you at this meeting have nothing to do with you it was due to the players who posted their outrage on these forums if you joined in those posts then you should be given creditif you did not join in the outrage then you were just as much part of the problem you are simply going to be the messenger for any concessions ccp decided to make to the players due to their outrage ccp isnt calling this conference because of anything you did on your internal forums its calling it because of what the players did they will eventually give you concessions but those concessions will be given because of the players outrage as expressed on the forums not because of your arguments at this upcoming meeting
there are no concessions the leak was never a concrete plan to begin with stop patting yourself on the back for nothing a good percentage of the outrage was people trolling to begin with imo the csm is supposed to represent us if they were not going you would complain about that too i imagine they are doing what they can and dropping their plans and going show respect at least for that
i wish it could be done here as well but there is no poll functionality on these forums i do understand that i will get fewer responses but some information is always better than none
wow it is a wonder you breathe in the thin atmosphere up there on that high horseif you think there will be any concessions made you are in for a rude awakening ccp has most likely called them to iceland to explain their side of things after they tried doing so twice directly through blogs to no availat most theyll cut some 50 off the aur costs on the indestructible luxury items and issue statement with what they have said time and again only vanity in a language that fevered emorager brains can understandthe only thing that was achieved this weekend besides all you lolrioters looking like fools on drugs was to let ccp know that masshysteria can not be avoided so theyll have to phrase their blogs in very very simple languageps remember to activate your bling two step gotta have the csm bar or the officialness will be questioned
he doesnt get bling because hes an alt its a shame because hes one of our best reps and deserves a full slot next year if he runs
no bling what kind of existence is that  poor guybut now the thread at least got it so it is all good
i would vote but cant register i dont get a confirmation email tried twice 
apreciated but not good enough this forum should be the primary means of csm informing and consulting the playerbase now i have to search the heavens and earth to get to know how the csm feels about stuff some tweets here a blog there a collumn over there a vague mentioning of forums where you have posted without links to the actual posts im looking at you mittens blogs tweets and other forums are fine as secondary means but plz try to keep things centralized on the forums that where created for you
i couldnt agree moreas the official representative of the player base csm should be communicating with that player base in a central location and advertising where that is its no good all posting in different places and hoping that people will stumble upon what youve writtenyou claim to have got internal communication going well but getting that out to people outside csm is a shambles
another request for written minutes of this and im starting to feel that the people who represent me to ccp are starting to let me downlet me repeat i am deaf i cannot listen to this recording you mentioned that a transcript might follow but dont appear to have followed up on i feel like i am being left out
whilst i agree with the main topics on this thread the thing that really gets me is the eternal beta things change in everything and i agree that some are good eg pi others not so cq as a glaring example slow buggy and not properly thought through as a grumpy old cynic i never trusted ccp to have my best interests at heart so the changes that affected me i took in my stride what really bothers me is the lemming like rush for the cliffs edge of new change for changes sake or to be uncharitable to screw a few more pennies out of us peons please ccp slow down listen to what people are telling you works and what does not and do something about it sadly i can see no viable way of getting the message across csm seems to me to be a busted flush all that talk about ndas says to me that they are being used as a screen to deflect genuine concern and opinion whilst allowing ccp to carry on business as usual after 5 years of playing eve ive had times when i could not take playing for a while like i suspect have many others but just now mt cq and the continual tinkering with new stuff and ignoring the faults is beginning to make me consider permanent retirement
but then the troll came back using a disguise and ganked the barman and stole his treasures
hmam i blind and dont see a list of csm anywhere in assambly hall or jitas cornerplz redirect me thx ressoruces as where they are active would also be nice
there is a csm tab on the left side of this site and most csm blogs and comments are posted on twitter tweetfleet
im relatively new to this game i was playing a different mmo a while back and switched to this and loved it much more complex big fleet fights blah blah balhit all seemed great then about six months ago i moved to null sec and started fighting and learned that the game has great promise but falls short there are several ship classes that could use some love but the biggest issue these days is capital ships and how they basically end sub cap fights carriers and dreds arent that bad but it seems that every major null sec fight ends withok guys they have 5 titans and 20 nyxs get safe the system is theirs i dont think super caps should decide every fight and right now they doi have two ideas for super caps the first being my least favourite of the two but give them a sov cost so that having 200 super caps sitting around would have a ridiculous cost making the fleets really hard to maintain without bankrupting your alliance that combinded with slow build times would make supercaps rare again which is greatidea two would be balance them by changing their roles motherships and titans should do almost zero dps to sub caps while be effective against normal caps and the ultimate structure bashers normal caps should do great dps to both supers and sub capitols but should be vulnerable to die from both and be decent structure bashers but not as good as supers and sub caps should basically be able to fight with supers in system without even noticing them except for the occasional doomsday but stay just as vulnerable to carriers and be even more vulnerable to dreds this game would be better if you could have fights that involved all ship classes without supers being the only important onespicture a fight where two forces with all three ship types land on field the super caps engage each other and the capitals assist in the mean time one side wins the sub cap fight and chases the others caps and supers away seems more balanced to me sub caps in force should be able to chase or kill titans if the titan doesnt have either lots of regular caps or sub caps as back up i realize that supers need some back up even now but its not like they have to worry if they lose some of thier support also consider allowing moms to jump with a certain amount of piloted ships in their bays i think moms should be like mobile stations with a weight limit maybe even titans too

nodefinitely no greed is not good well maybe as long as it means wanting more isk by selling stolen goods from helpless freighters haha i understand that the serverpark and development has its inherent costs i am willing to pay for that but killing off eve by introducing microtransactions to support sideprojects and fill shareholders greedy chubby hands is just plain wrong on a more personal note the new character creation thingy is awesome grants us nice portraits and stuff but the whole cq thing just takes the focus off the core gameplay of flying ships in space the effort that went into developing the cq could have been put to way better use
vanity onlyno need to complicate things and let the rage continue with aurum items going farther it accomplishes its goal with vanity items and going farther isnt worth it imho
vanity only but done so through player craftingsome of us desire more robust crafting in eve so much so that we are willing to pay for it  thats sad really

cosmetic only the only in game effect would be the ability to sell arum items on the market for isk wich isthe same as the curremt sale of plexes doesa big resolute no to items that gives an edge above players who only pay standard subscribtion the pay to win formula exist in other games indeed but they are free to playpay to win games not ones where you already pay a fee to play the game itself

i want to spin my ship thats the only reason i even played eve
i love cq and incarna features but as the author says for inmersion a lot of times i only dock to full my shield and cap so my char doesnt need to leave the ship1 i support yhis
10
yep get that insulting door out of my sight and bring back the old hangar i will use cq but at my own free choice
10
i dont know if it has been already listed here but we want the station hangar back for being able  to click our ship and open our cargohold to click our ship and open our bays  drones etc  to see our active ship at a glance to spin ships to drag and drop ships from hangar to run several clients on mid range computers for immersion it is not logical we have to go thru to pains and sickness of getting out of our pods every time we want to change ammo or whatever for not getting forced into the item shop or tv adds not cutting any slack to ccp for not being able to provide content good enough so that players actually want to get inside incarna everything i forgot
this would make me very happy to seewhen running 5 clients having each of them show captains quarters and trying to quickly swap ships between them is a slower processdoes ccp want me to cancel my 8 accts and just use 1  based on the latest release my guess is yes
i forgot a nice suggestion i read somewherein addition to a neocron disembark button in the station hangar there could be following right click options in space enter station and disembark shipenter station
signed
yes but i dont want a restriction on character transfers biggest value of this feature would be to improve character liquidity  a lot of the characters of the bazaar have stupid names
im still sceptical but i think this could be implemented in such a way as to be reasonably effective at maintaing identityassuming the previously suggested limitations i would also add that once you set a standing to a character or add them to your contact list you will always see them as the name that you saw when you set the standing if they have changed their name then the new name would appear under the aka section until you decide to open your settings and chose to view them by their new namethis should cover that once you tell your buddies to look out for that vader cat they can add to contactsset standing and they will always see them as vader no matter how many times they change their name unless they choose to see them by the new nameso rather than sending a bulk eve mail simply add a token to the characters old name to let anyone who sees their old name that there is a new name for this character or show outdated names in a different colorirl analogy i have a different nickname now that i did when i was at university and different again than when i was in high school but people i run in to from those days still call me by my older nicknamesthis my be a inconvenience for some players doing background checks but i think it is a greater quality of life improvement for far more people who knows a features such as this may even encourage a new third party tool to keep track of dastardly people and make recruitment easier
supported id even go further and allow racegender changes there is even game lore to support it
i support this product
benefits must come with increased riskmonocles bring no benefits therefore should have no additional risknot supported
anything inside the pod should get destroyed if the pod is wreckedand if not then it should drop as loot
i like this
yes
so are you using physical logic arguements for a game where you have fluid physics in spaceby your own silly arguement then all your clothes should be gone as wellnot supported
implants clothes  in fact anything on your person should be destroyed or at least chance dropped when you get podded
thissooo is this the real deal or a troll implants are popped so should monocles and any shirts boots ect you should come into your new clone with some plain clone center hospital robe or something
no monocles should get destroyed by podding and show on the killmail
this is the far better option you should spawn in the medical facility on your clones station bucknaked and have to buy new clothes in fact i like the drop idea even more collecting corpses is so 2005 im wearing that suckas boots
big thing you dont wear clothes in a pod though the monocle is cybernetic so short of freakin rippin out your eye before entering your pod i dont see how you can logically say a monocle survives being podded to be transferred to the new clone
here here i second this motionthis makes far more sense from a loreimmersion point of view than unpodding and taking a shower every single time you dock up when usually all you want to do is drop some cargo transfer your pod to another ship refit repair collect your purchased goods drop off a delivery yada yada yada
fully support the notion of making disembarking optionallike many people who support this i like cq and eagerly anticipate where it is going but frankly making it optional fits better with the lore fits better for performance and lastly and potentially most importantly fits better with what all the people in this thread and likelymany many more want
signedbring the old hangar functionality back showing us the door is simply insultingps i think its time to buy me a supercap and never be subjected to cq again
i just found this thread today ccp you make me very very angry people told you time and time again to leave it alone ive even read threads that say they saw it running via a dev before it was released to the public the way it should bespacehangarwis you intentionally did not change it to sell monocles and it backfired on you the eve community is not like wow or whatever other mmo the majority of your player base is intelligent so now the choice is up to you are you going to sell enough monocles and trinckets to cover the unsubs or not we will see dont look too good ive already unsubbed all my accounts if i cant opt out of incarna im done in aug when my subscriptions run out will resub once i can opt out of the dollhouse
supportedjust because something is optional doesnt mean we wont use it specially if you make something worth doing with intresting and productive game play but however also it should be my choice if i wish to quickly dock up and deal with my ship or if i want to dock up and exit my pod to venture into the stationand as a developer you cant tell me that that code is already gone you never completely delete code it could be a simple preference setting as to which docking environment i want to default to and a button to switch between the environments in station i think its pretty sorry that we have lost direct ship interaction with incarna and now have to work through buttons windows and menus for stuff we used to be able to handle direclty by clicking or right clicking on our shipthe goal of any software ui enhancement is to provide a better user experiance not to take away efficient and regularly used features which makes client interaction easier dont complicate things that dont need to be complicatedccp please use kiss im sure someone at ccp knows what that means even if they dont use it
i agree we should have options variety makes the game better
after the explanation of the intregration of the incarna into the eves make up it is like saying no you cant go the the left hand of the map as the way as it sits you can just stand at your belconyso i guess that can be optionalbut in the flavor of this thread i disagree
i have to fully support this as a multiboxer ccp you want me to run my 5 accounts on my 3 computers right thats a lot fo money for you guys i have spent 3200 on 4 accounts over 5 years well my super duper main computer can run 2 clients at full tilt but fps falls to about 20 20fps looks bad my second computer can only run one client docked in medium graphicsmy laptop can only run cq in the lowest possible settings i turn it off to make it easier and its a dell xps m1730 laptop i cant adjust the graphics everytime i dock i need to run multiple clients per computer i can disable cq right now but for how long i hear it is only time before you disable that and i always have to disembark from the pod as an rper i wanted incarna but you guys did the wrong thing and didnt even keep to the rp of it you dock your ship and then disembark from the podit makes rp sense it makes game mechanic sense it makes pr and marketing sense so why in bloody hell are you not reinstating the station view
supporteda quick dock collect and undock orjust the idea of a pod pilot should well be in a pod
supported its only logical that leaving your ship andor pod while in a station should be optional darius mordecai
i love incarna and cq but to undergo that unpleasant process of leaving the capsule just to dump cargo in station is somewhat immersion breaking it is not something most people would do because of the extra discomfort for no gainalso being the empyrean being that i am i feel insecure without the insurance of the brainscannerif you read the burning life youd understand
looked for this option and was sad to find it not theretick to remove aurum from the wallet approvedalso thisU02C7U02C7i also love how you think by putting it in turquoise to pop off the screen will make me think i need to get some aurum because the balance is zero nice tryU02C7U02C7

are you kidding you have the perfect name what fc would want to call you as primary
well it seems that you are pretty set on your false justifications paulize if you are willing to consider that knowing darth vader as somebody put it who has a personal vendetta against you is the same as putting darth vader in the lot with all the other reds then there really is nothing more i can say to convince you all i can say that i believe that ccp will do the right thing and never allow this not without some serious fee like 50 usd or more at the very least the same as a character transfer charge

i would like them gonethis is a subscription game ccp already have a mtish mechanism via plex they dont need another

yesclothing items and such should be player made not created out of thin air for rl cash
looking at the exsisting mining ships i agree with a noctis based variant leave the 8 highs allow it to equip 5 gas miners with a 25 reduction in cycle time but the hold definately needs to be around 5k m3 with enough midslows to fit at least minimal defensive grid 3 mid 3 low would be sufficient and room for 10m3 drones for defense instead of adding turret slots to the ship just give it a special attribute to allow gas miners to be equipped i can even see this as bieng a serpentis modified ship since theyre the most likely to have developed a ship specifically for gas mining make the requirements to fly it based on a combination of gallente industrial 3 ore industrial 3 and exhumers 3based on the technical info gas miners were originally developed as high efficiency ore miners but deemed too slow to be useful with newer technology available for reapplication i can see the idea of gas stripminers as valid but even the t2 gas strips should have approximately 50 of the m3 yield of ore miners of the same type i base my figures on this a miner 1 wich is the next iteration from development of the gas miner 1 the gas miner yields 10m330sec or 20m3minute versus the miner 1 wich yields 40m3minute the second proof iteration comes in the form of gas miner 2 vs miner 2 gas miner 2 yields 20m340sec or 30m3minute vs the miner 2 wich yields 60m3 minute taking these figures into account as a baseline a strip miner 1 produces 180m3minute so a gas strip miner 1 should produce 90m3minute or 270m33m cycle the gas strip miner 2 is a bit more complicated and producing crystals for every possible gas type would be wasteful since there are many more types of gas than ore take a baseline of 6012 for the strip miner 2 with t1 crystals or base of strip 2  t2 crystals of 630m3 skills and ship bonuses do alot for em they break down to an m3minute rate of 2004m3 and 210m3 per minute and a baseline for the strip 2 should be somewhere around 100110m3minute or 300330m3 per 3 minute cycle

best i can tell the ccp excuse for not sharing their roadmap is to do with managing player expectations if they for example were to say theyd add the missing fifth t3 subsystem in dec 11 and it didnt happen the community would go nuts otoh if they dont tell us anything we cant go apei guess the concept of updating us when things change is beyond their comprehension
supported
i completely agree i dont know why this feature was removed but its making corporate life hell for a lot of people if it doesnt come back and come back soon many people will start leaving its not easy to pay people for their loot anymore this is unacceptable
casting vote to reenable this disabled functionalitydeveloper time estimate 1 minuteqa time estimate 5 minutes because theyll have to retest the export on all supported clients
supported as long as it is all faction shipssome of the regular faction frigates are at least as powerful if not superior to many of the t2 counterpartsthis actually makes most sense
time to make fw again for newer players
proposal changed to reflect differences in hull power and thus my support as promised which one in particular because i sure as hell dont see itfiretail  both afs  clawhookbill  both afs  crowcomet  ishkur  taranisslicer stands out though but only because amarr frigs are generally poo difficult to compare it either way as there is no equivalent in t2 really its a mix of punishercoercerwont matter much as it will degenerate into a thrasher spam contest for the most part when hope pirate frigs are kicked out
perfectly reasonablefw being their favorite feature ccp surely is running to get this implemented
i like raping noobs in my factionpirate shipsbut in all honestly this is probably a good idea but it would need to be all faction ships not just pirate in the case of the cynabal people will just downgrade to a sfi dd i would switch to a cometbetter yes but still unbalanced
destroyers are easily accessible to noobs so what is your problem exactly 
to start i am a 2006 character however for this topic anyone having played a year can appreciate this issue those having played less than a year are more likely to appreciate the benefits without being as concerned with the negatives not intended as more than a generalization if you fit outside of that then ok i have to admit i am a bit mixed on this one as previously stated there is already mechanics that allow legal means of obtaining the sp you want but there is an inherent design in that affording a rather limited scope i cant imagine there were many people out of 10s of thousands that bought characters 2 years ago with ill sell this in the future in mind much more likely they sold it due to real life changes so it isnt a daily occurrence as such i actually had a friend do that very thing college became priority in short it took time to train up and even though the new owner will have an edge he is still an unskilled player as for the time it was real time that someone spent so it isnt instahigh sp it still takes the time and investment of someone to get the character to that degree of sp so if someone wants to spend that time and sell the fruits of their labor then it works not everyone finds a random named random skilled character appealing so it has built in limitationsthe positive to highspn00b characters is there will be many easy pickins for a while until they as a person become more proficient at their character however equally a down side to that is a higher loss of ships devaluing the ships these highspn00bs arent well versed in that would drive the somewhat delicate market down trend good for me buying said ship  bad for me selling said ship that said however there is something that is an unknown as yet quantity  how is ccp intending on selling sp if they do and for how much if the monocle is any indication then we can safely say there wont be many folks paying that much for sp the post suggests 1m sp per plex 15usd but itd likely be more like 100k sp per plex if thats any indicatornow the fine art of balancing how do we ccp get more players selling sp is yet another avenue to appeal to something that even as a 2006 character i can look back on and appreciate the struggle of geez it will take me a year just to pilot something fun to fly with my buddies factor looking at it from that angle lets say i talk a buddy into playing finally and hes just starting out i am cruising around in my t3 having a blast figuratively and literally and it will take quite some time before he even comes close to my level so i dumb down get a frigate and run some level 1 missions with him ok that sorta worksbut how does that scale how do i get my buddy interested when he still has to struggle with such low yield results for a stretch of realtime its not fruitful for him to follow into l4 mission running in a t1 frigate if i go in and get agro hes gonna sit on the edge of the playing field and watch me play the game ever watch someone else play something for hours but if were doing his l1 missions i am getting near0 for my game time no incentivei think thats sort of the angle ccp would be considering by taking the tactic of selling sp how do we get the gamer buddies that didnt start way back when the folks that have been playing for so long into the gamethat isnt to say it isnt workable but its awfully discouraging to the new guy when i have so much cooler toys than he does and it will be 2 years before he is able to even play on that level i will still be training and now 2 years ahead as well he is permanently behind i think its going to be expensive to avoid flood of highspn00bs but available to avoid losing players to man i dont want to spend 4 years training just to keep pace with my buddies mentality
by this very logic you may present quite microscopic minority
im with him so hello no if you want instant grats go play something else
i used to be against selling skill points but as ive read and participated in various discussions ive noticed something interesting  the pro side seems to better articulate their position than the con ive come around to being in favor of a moderated skillpoint purchasing approach where you can buy enough sp to go do some fun stuff but not enough to instalevel your new character to a perfect titan pilot
im against the outright sale of sp i am sure i am perfectly clear on that point but i want to address this particular question of pricing so salt as neededin eve skill points based on attributes and the skills themselves increase at a particular rate im sure someone can dig up the formulas if they careif we look at the current method of sp redistribution that has been used it is a straight up refund of a number which you may paste on anything with no benefits or penalties related to the characters attributes and the attributes required for the skillso whats going to happen is there is going to be this skew on pricing a competition of cash costplex time neural remap costs lp value implant costs etc this will ripple its way through the economy and could have some manifestations in lp values isk values and time time is important here because isk is a commodity currency that are going to be difficult to measure and could lead to unexpected distortionsalso we must remember that each level of the skill gives the benefit not the number of sp level is a quantum on stats in space sp is the time needed to reach the next quantum so its going to be difficult to also price in depreciation of effort in a way that isnt going to skew some additional things such as what people train and how they make their choices itll be much less expensive to train a skill to level three than four so we may start seeing all sorts of odd choices part of being good in eve is to have made that choice to take the extra few days and get something to level 5 but if it is yawn boring cause it can just be bought for cash to train something else then it begins to rob people of meaningful choicesits a lot bigger can of worms than most people think it is
and for everyone of you that does leave instead of veiled threat ccp will have 3 more players who dont want to wait 2 months to fit into a decent battleship a whole new generation of players would love to play eve if they could really enjoy it and play it the amount of people that ccp lose to this whole skill point tree limitation is huge i bet 100s every week join and go wtf and leave if not daily cause of the glass ceiling not everyone has 500 to dump on a character or would but people would dump 2030 here and there to increase their own gaming experiencealso i now own 170 million sp across 2 pilots and i tell you that the knowledge i still dont have cause im 3 months in and new is that if i engage anyone in pvp im dead as the knowledge needed for pvp is so immense that vets would own noobs even with the same skill points eve takes years of play to learn tactics fittings what ships do what and how to counter and most people will not buy sp most will let it train as is normal only a few will buy sp and ccp should limit buying of sp to credit card transactions so these vets and rich players cant buy up all they want ccp should cash in and make some real money for a change i dont pay ccp a cent now to play their game cause i just buy plex with in game current i ran a 1010 maze please yesterday and got 18 billion in loot enough to plex my 2 characters for 2 months from 15 hours work its stupid ccp need to make people pay to play
technically your already cash to sp you sold plexs for isk than bought toons off the forums only difference it someone had to spend time doing it which is a core part of this game change the core you change the game also what stops someone from just changing the credit card number really that amount of red tape to stop people form cheating the system would cause the programmer to stop working on the game and just fill in loop holes plus you are still paying ccp just indirectly
whats stopping you or anyone new from enjoying their experience now because they are not the best thats life get used to it your statement reminds me of the southpark episode where theyre playing wow and have to skill up to beat some teabagger ass hat once they gank the guy one of them asks so what now and another responds now we can play the game there will always be someone in eve that is better than you or a bigger blobthe loss of players around the seventh month has more to do with a perceived lack of meaningful things to do more so than waiting on skill points eve is not the sort of game that gives you things to do you have to find your own goals within your limited set of abilities but these are not just based on your skill points much is based on your imagination and other abilities like finding a good corp making some friends or go out and get in trouble so how is allowing someone to buy sp going to help this situation had you come in and stuck with your original character you might be having more fun you skipped over all the learning that you speak about now when you die in pvp it costs you a lot if youd been out dying as a true noob learning the ropes youd have spent a lot less money and probably know a whole lot more and be having a lot more fun youd not have this nagging thought in your head about how much you had paid for the characters you have its like sitting down at a poker table and being scared to fold cause youre afraid of how much youve put into the pot already you robbed your self of being a noob whos fault is thatdid that plex just drop out of they sky as for forcing cc payments youll end up encouraging black market rmt which is what plex was originally all about
op should go play wow or some other dumbed down mmo perhaps farmville leave eve for those who enjoying earning their status in the game
i cannot believe this is even being discussed by players any playersim perfectly in favour of noobs getting a few free sp to get them started yknow enough to get in a decent frigate with all the mods they need i know from experience that that was one of the most frustrating parts of being a noob having to wait a few days doing practically nothing in order to be able to use all the modules you need to get a good start doing whatever pve pvp meaningful manufacture mining all these things only need 100200k free sp in order to spec your character for them but new players dont have those so they cant get started for several days talk about a learning curve if you have to wait a few days to be able to do something anything at allnoobs worry about not being on the same level as the other players they simply either leave in a huff or learn to accept it as i did sure my 1 year old 10m sp character will never be as good as a 100m 6 year old character but hey im coo with that its just that others have to learn to be ok with it too being denied something makes it all the more meaningful when you get it but by the same token you need to be able to do something meaningful in the meantime as wellfinal stancefree sp for noobs about 200k possibly with one or 2 doovers for that single patch of sp because noobs make mistakes and train unimportant skills sometimes no buying sp directly with isk or cash basically give them a chance to get started with basic modules and see its not all bad
if this ever happened eve would be dead
sign me up my char was created in 2008 played for a little bit approx 11m sp then idled recently restarted to play with some friends who are all in the 1530m sp range and i can do very little with them i cant even powerlevel to catch up since its realtimei dont want to buy a character with someone elses reputation etc but id really like to be in the 1215m sp range oh welljbl

why dollars for skillz is bad mkay  skill points dictate what your player can and cant do when you first join the game your basically set to fly poorly  a frig you invest time in either trying to fly frigs better or you go destroyers  or you try cruisers or say fk it and go industry either way you set a path on which way your going to play the game this path is how you interact within eve using the game mechanics and the player driven market if skill points for dollars is introduced a method to skip these first few steps is introduced allowing players who pay the cash to leap frog to advanced content battle ships carriers tech ii  advanced industry etc  this would hurt the player based economy making the cruisers and other entry level ships and tech increase in price or become scarce due to a decrease in demand that fundamental change right there is enough to ixnay the skill point for cash idea the reason there has not been many good counter points to this argument is because this is a very fundamental change in the eve game mechanics it would alter the way every one plays and would be difficult to to foresee how these changes effect the game  change it will though and it will not be pretty  instant uber alts another game changing effect that would effect mission running  industry and null sec in ways that are hard to imagine but most if not all these changes would be bad leap frogging would allow players to forgo entire sections of game content again changing how eve is played and causing content to be ignored or not used ie the tech 1 market drying up because the majority leaped frogged to tech ii this would also encourage pay to win because more and more players would be pressed to pay for these skills to be competitive in game thus creating a skill race to the top  where in the end everyone has max skills just so they could remain competitive in the game and when that happens eve would be fundamentally broken and a shell of its former self the counter argument that purchasing in game chars already allow for this is flawed because these chars are in limited supply and even fewer are maxed  essentially the purchased char had to abide by the same mechanics as everyone else and is not an advanced character created out of the ether at some point it had to participate and add to the mechanics that make eve functionskills for cash is bad  it is just plain simple  to bad the ramifications of it are not as simple to foresee but if they were eve would not be the awesome game that it is 
awesome could not be better demonstrated
lets be honest about this how many people would really pay rl money to gain sp 1 maybe 2 and dont quote me on the numbers but im taking an educated guess that there are roughly 20000 to 30000 real people playing not accounts but real people thats playing now so thats 200300 people spending money to gain sp faster in the current game is that ammmount really going to make a huge diffrencenow look at the amount of people this could draw to eve oh wow you mean i can be somewhat competive with the players that have been around forever and all i have to do is spend some cashthat alone will draw tons of new players to eve not just the ones who will pay extra to play will some quit yes how many is anybodys guess but i think more people will talk about quitting that actually quitting and more new players will fill that hole three fold ccp is a business plain and simple if the draw more players to a game they make more in subsplexselling sp the more money they make the better they want to make the game to draw even more people in all of this can benefit the players to a market that has 30000 people buying stuff or a market that has 60000 people buying stuff the people it will hurt the most are the ones selling there toons for isk im just guessing the people who are the most vocal about this have a toon for sale i have played a ton of other mmos and yes eve is by far the best one so why is it so far below some of the others 1 its the learning curve of this game time fixes that 2 its the ing skill system that you cant ever overcome people are absolutely right about a vet vs noob the vet will will most of the time so whats the big deal but like its been said before this game is about entertainment and making money so we will see if greed is good and i hope they dont start mts but they obviously are going to do something otherwise there wouldnt be aur why fight everything change is going to happen why not steer it to something that would draw in a larger player base
wrong the overwhelming majority of players do not post on the forums that is the only thing you can say with confidence
god no there is no shortage of highsp characters on the market buy one of those if you want to skip years of training  otherwise plug in 5s and deal with it obviously itd be nice to be able to buy a plex off the market and skip an entire month of skill training but this would cause highsp focused characters to lose a lot of valuei absolutely do not support this idea
this idea is bonkers rl cash should only be used for vanity items or stupid paintjobs
i want to commend the op for wading in with a thought he knew would be controversial and largely sticking to arguing the topicgetting more players into the game is the 800 lb gorilla in the room the pcu record has stayed pretty flat for a couple of years now anecdotally i see players not in game cite the steep learning curve as a reason not to try eve current players can be a great asset in ccps business need to recruit new blood that ccp did an inelegant at best job of asking us to help is a wasted opportunity to say the least but if we really care about maintaining a healthy community we need to be willing to reengage despite ccps artlessness i want eve to be here 10 years from now it wont be if its just supported by the subs of the current community it also wont be if it es on the current community which i understand is behind the current state of community unrest ccp needs to make things right in that regard its a tough balance is my pointback to the sp sale idea i like the aurum super implant ideathey can be destroyed etc i wonder if theres another middle ground that honors the work of vets and rewards their longevity namely a playerrun sp market whether its selling back of skills on a noble market or ccp awarding sps to selluse based on subscription length lack of a vet loyalty program is another important topicthis could be one aspect of that a playerdriven sp market would ensure that sps are a finite commodity dependent on player length of service and that some player is being rewarded as another player is paying and ccp is earning revenue obviously this and any sp sales idea would require regulationcertain skills not eligible for applying bought skills the trial account list is a good place to start limits on how many skill points a player could sell back etc etc etc the bottom line is there needs to be a way to accelerate players past the frankly boring content into actually having fun in the game or they will leaveanother way of doing that imo would be streamlining the process where new players get matched with good corps fixing the corp management functions so corps can recruit new players leverage incarna to immerse players etcanother topic for another thread too
this very well said the op and others like him lack the fundamental reality of development when you start a new job you dont slip your perspective boss a 20 and say teach me right now how to be a manager then make me manager youd get laughed at youre a vet and you still dont get it experience must be gained in time not dollars as navarone stated players will lose interest faster if they are allowed to instantly achieve an end goal ccp would really canabalize their players and the hard working vet player will quit and move on if others can gain instantly what they had to achieve in years admit that you just want to cheat youve cheated in every game youve owned and are ed you have to wait like everyone else i pity you and everyone else like youtldr  not supported
i understand how you feel but you seem to think that ccp doesnt know this when they may in fact be banking on it even if a pile of new players cycle in drop cash get bored and cycle out how many years of a subber would they be worth what about the vets you mention who arent paying a sub at allnot condemning nor condoning and this depends on their being a steady supply of new blood cycling in but i can see the reasoning we dont have new subbers because noob life sucks really it just sucks the high barrier to entry which is not the learning curve btw gets removed maybe we get new people also while theyre here why not get more money out of em to offset the lifers
i understand what youre saying about buying sp outright with cash is cheating because well it is there does how ever need to be some way of a player who started a game later to at least cover some not all but some of the ground between them and some of the older players buy implants that go further than 5 with aurisk or cash something i fully support them being destroyable thats one of the reasons why i love eve so much if youre stupid to go to nullsec with a head full of them well its your own dumbass faulti do want to say something though about the whole pay to be better yes the skills would be there to operate the new ship but they still wouldnt know how to fly it and just because you have been playing longer dosent always mean you know more so how is that any different from buying plex selling it for isk to buy a toon in game the only difference is yes them money goes to ccp instead of the player and youre not stuck with somebody elses mistakes if youre under 15milsp youre pretty much stuck in care bear land for a year and a half while you train most new people quit once they find that outi still dont think it would be right to pay 1k and be caught up with everybody but there really should be some way to close some of the gap on a side not why not give 2x or 3x sp as a part of the buddy system on paid accounts not trial but that should be in another thread
i wouldnt want to gloss over this honestly seeing both sides of this argument and myself having mixed feelings on it this is why the old timers get antsy about the idea myself included why on earth should i change horses mid stream the mechanics worked against me and now offer to give it away frustrating from that perspective but again my larger point in my last post i have rl folk that just dont want to invest the time because it would take me years to get where you are so ill play this other game thanks though yes there are some negatives to the game with a large influx of highspn00bs howeverif it were regulated in such a way that only 1x skills example could have purchased points applied to such as what you are saying 1
if one whines one should be able to give alternative solutions so my ideas arei have no alternative solution for mt ccp please do not go that routewe are not your golden goose we are your clients and your playerbase we rent time on your server and you are getting plenty rich off of that isnt it enough the economy is player based you have said so quite proudly yourself from mining the ores to selling the ships and mods player based no magically produced itemsi have turned off the cq it is less than useless in its current form it is extremely laggy gives us some but not all of the functionality we had before but in a far less friendly and vastly more time consuming format it does not replace ship spinning w something as or more interesting to do than ship spinning was1 options other than dockingspeeding up actual gameplay and possibly helping to reduce laggive us the option to contact our agents and conduct business w them outside of the stations within docking range via comms like we do now for agents in ships getting missions completing missions and getting paid all do not require one to dock docking is required only if cargo needs to be loadedunloaded for missions or to change or refit ships2 make cq more interesting until wis is ready this is my pet requesta strike a deal w netflix so we can rent moves tv shows and watch them on the cq big screen i personally would love to watch firefly star trek bsg or clear skys in the cqb possibly add a change of view from 3rd person behind your toon to 1st person on the couch watching holov3 new ship spinninga give us the ability to click on the ship hologram and see our current ship either full screen and rendered similar to the old ship spinning in dock view orb click on the ship hologram and change view to 1st person with a fully rendered model we can manipulate and spin4 and for the sheer hell and fun of it put in a bathroom allow the toon to enter and a few minutes later exit w flushing sounds make it last long enough on average so the player can go too we all might be surprised at how many might use this feature just one pilots opinion fly safe and see you in the sky please see my blog for my full thoughts
here is my incarna suggestion stop putting dev resources into a fancy space version of 2nd life and get back to the core of the game internet space ships
fistme whataname i dot disagree w you but we dont run the servers or own ccp and incarna is here and i think we all know it aint going away several thousand people maybe 10s of thousands have yelled no to incrana out of 300k this leaves a couple hundred thousand who havent either spoken up or who like or at least dont mind it the yea votes even the silent ones have the majorityok so we have to deal with it period well life is like that isnt it and the sandbox ideal is to be lifelike and sometimes lifelike seems unfair well life is unfair whats that you say eve is not life as it is a program written by people yup it is and on where in they are tying to do 2 interdependent things create a online game thousands want to play and profit from that creation again the majority win just cause we the minority who dont want incarna are somewhat more vocal with our dislike per second doesnt mean we will get what we wantleading us back to we have to deal with it period so let us get verbal with some positive changes ask for things that will make it better for you and if there are none either unsub or deal with iti personally look forward to the day when i can dock walk through the station to a sky cable lift or a shuttle bay and fly down to the surface to join in with the dusters and do some up close and personal dps swapping
here is my question to you do you buy gas what about bread electricity internet access why dont you go and crusade for those providers to reinvest 80 into their companiesplease dont hold back do telldemanding from a private company that it should run its business a certain way is nothing short of crazy you dont like the way ccp is run stop giving them your money simple solution but arguably there is far less grand standing involved
it seems as though that there are people who play games so much that theyve lost their grip on reality hence the phrase get real this isnt going to happen
never thought maybe you werent carrying that little helicity boson quote too far did you lets get something straight here ccp developed eve and got you interested in their product you have spent months to years investing in eve as entertainment at the expense of a monthly subscription or additional time investment to earn the isk to pay for plexyou are not feeding ccp signing their paychecks or any of the rest of that fluff get a grip step back into reality and get over it the only time anyone has any claim to providing for a business is when they put hours and years of effort into keeping it afloat from the inside taking  poor wages and giving it their all despite that while the owner sits on his duff es away money and generally doesnt give a rats ass whether it sails or fails youre paying for entertainment whatever you like to think and ccp is providing the environment for you to attain it that is all nothing more seriously get over yourself
firstly i was trying to help and support ccp into getting back on track aiming to be constructive and making suggestionsproposals that can help sort this mess that is my tone and hope people read it that waysecondly and drawing on the commentary above if my favorite baker that makes awesome bread that i like suddenly starts selling me stale bread with chocolate toppings extra charge while showing me posters about this ferrari factory he plans to build on his backyard i might just ignore him and go buy bread elsewhere but i can also and would probably tell him its not such a good idea not because i consider myself a ferrari or bread expert just because i care about him and like his breadthirdly i can understand the frustration with the blood sweat and tears of effort that people put into developing a game dont know if its good or badly paid since this is a hobby for me that said perhaps the frustration should be directed towards whoever pointed all this effort into a possibly wrong direction people are not forced to like everything one does even if you put a lot of effort into itthats why paying attention to customers is importantfourthly recent eve development is reduced to bug fixes while the rest of the company is focused on other projects eve has been hurt by this and in my opinion this is part of what is making people frustratedi waited for tyrannis learned the pi skills and after 3 weeks was tired of that horrible clickfest and turned away never to come back  i thought why are they doing this crapthen i realized its about dust not evei waited for incarna then it got released and it does indeed look lovely but its totally useless on top of unplayable buggy  even if you try and have a rig that runs it i can after a few days you just feel stupid since there is nothing to do i think why are they doing this crapthen i realize its about wod or some other carbon thing they are testingnot to mention eve gate fiasco all of this is the consequence of low development investment and people being focused elsewhere the agenda is elsewhereif ccp had told us we are going to do something else you guys stick in there and well be back in two years it would have been honest and i dont really think sandbox games can live without constant and focused developmentthat said i was trying to help sort this out the suggestion was meant to address this problem neither saying that the diagnosis is correct nor that the prescription is the best its just my thoughts trying to help out and calling it how i see it
or maybe if they dont bring it up it will prove their competence since anything making 00 even more stagnant and expensive to live in is total bs

buying standings for aurum certainly does cross the line  standings services are a popular playerdriven industry your actions have consequences and you have to work your way out of those consequencesextra fittings slots for saved fittings are being artificially limited to 50 why should we pay for more no doubt the folks at ccp would say babble babble database load rabble blah  but then that would open the door to paying aurum any time you jump into a system that has more than 200 in localout of the three groups defined in fearless only vanity are acceptable no concierge items no power items id extend a little concession to allow bpcs to be sold along with seed resources for some pi schematics that result in eg crate of monocles being produced
standings are only permissible if it is for the purpose of fixing broken standings ie 5 with empire factions anything else is for the players to provide such servicesmake it so that there is an option for saving fittings on the computer instead of on the server there is no reason to to
why would you agree to any market where items can be bought only with aur but sold for isk isk is power too and if players cant earn aur or aur items ingame without cash in the equation somewhere that means the vanity items isk market would be completely dominated by real cash investors in other words its a market for laundering cash to isk and in case you think thats just like it used to be with plex i think youre very much mistakenthe cashisk market and vanity items mt  player market in controldamn posted with the wrong character shouldve been lilandraa
who cares until i can spend my isk to buy aurum
line for me is drawn where an item bypasses ingame requirements of skilltimeno standings no missions no nothing that is not 100 fluff
micro transaction in the noble exchange store are a means to charge extras for expansions an expansion pack expansion set or supplement is an addition to an existing roleplaying game tabletop game or video game these addons usually add new game areas weapons objects andor an extended storyline to a complete and already released game  wikipediaccp does not charge extra for game expansions  eve online faqccp markets that it does not charge extra for expansion when in fact micro transactions sell addons that should have been included by the subscription fees based upon the customer expectations ccp has set since 2003that should include anything a player uses in game
sure you can go to jita and pay isk to buy a plex qed
sure you can go to jita drop the 360mil isk to buy a plex qedin fact this is going to be the bigger supply of aur from people using isk to buy plex to get aur i dont think that anyone is silly enough to buy aur with real cash and its better this wayat the end of the day aur and nex items is a way for the isk trillionaires to go around and show you how much better they are than you as flying their titans around in highsec is not allowed how else can you show your wealth in highsec with a monocle or a sexy uniform its their way of saying hey losers im better than you and dont even think about aggroing me else i will have my alliance kick you and yours back to the lowsec hole you crawled out of
well im not sure i understand exactly what you mean but my point is that plex has to be bought with cash first by a player before it can be turned into aur or sold on the market for isk so any ingame purchase of plex or aur items for isk is ultimately a trade of cash for isk theres no way around it the aur items market increases the size of the cashisk items market ingame formerly that was only plex enormously
with standings i think that buying say 90 standings with the caldari navy would be acceptable buying increased standings with the caldari empire would not be also i could see being able to buy things like loyalty points you can grind to get there if you want but if you dont have the time and do have the cash i think it would provide an additional avenue anything that basically comes down to cash to isk i think would be ok because they already have it with plex
sorry to be spamming your thread pthats a big misconception i think the market for plex was controlled by the limited demand for game time for isk this made sure that the cashisk flow would always be marginal compared to the size of the player base and thus the player market plex was by its nature a very limited cashisk market the aur store is not it opens the floodgates
the line cant be drawn lowfar enough every single inch they can get theyll take to push in mt introducing more and more of it over time slowly eroding player resistance their own philosophy and ethics
no worries about spamming i welcome the discussion if i understand your argument youre saying that the plex market is limited because of the limited demand for iskplaytime while the nex store will not be because there will be high demand for the items contained therein i would say perhaps but definitely not at the price points they currently have in there the only thing that might change would be the efficiency since aur has a fixed exchange rate to plex and isk does not right now anyone who wants to can purchase a plex and sell it to a buy order for isk at a price reasonably close to the sell orders this suggests that there is a high demand for plex since the price is close to equilibrium buy orders are close to sell orders and there are a large number of both types of orders the only thing i would see the nex store doing would be to fix the plexisk exchange rate assuming they dont sell items that directly affect gameplay that cant be obtained through any other means
i meant that the plex market was limited because of the limited demand for iskplaytime not anymore but i agree the current situation is not really a problem but i believe the intention is to have a bigger selection with a greater price range the way it is now is kinda halfbaked  i guess just to limit the amount of plex flowing in suddenly since a lot of people have been stockpiling hmhm and i dont think ccp has a good control on that efficiency the only control they have on the aur store is limiting the supply of aur items and setting aur item prices i believe the only way to control the flow of cash to isk is to tie it directly to either an activity or the growth of the eve population with a ratio that the eve universe can cope with well since plex can be traded for aur now we cant use current supply and demand as an example for what i mentioned would have to check some old stats but regardless the market can be deceptive unless plexes were consumed by the populace or if the populace grew or if popularity of isk for plex grew real demand for plex would not have risen market manipulation by players traders trying to buy low and sell high or traders holding on to plex for instance can cause fluctuations bubbles and scarcity though theres lots of isk contained in the isk market in the form of unspent plex but the isk contained in the plex market was exactly that contained in order to gain isk from the plex market to spend in other markets you had to either buy a plex with isk and sell it for profit or buy one with cash and sell it but if a player buys plex with isk to resell it for profit the real plex supply was not lowered while demand was the trader is holding the plex for sale if too much plex was supplied there was natural market saturation and price drops reducing profitabilityso even though the plex market may still have been profitable it was competitive because demand was relative to the eve population at a stable and acceptable ratio also the consumption rate for plex was much lower than what i expect for mt vanity items im worried that the proposed aur items market cant be controlled by means of prices and supply alone because of the greatly increased and renewed demand i dont think we can count on the control of demand by the populace like we could with plex
i agree which is also why i dont think nonvanity items would be a problem as long as there is an alternatate means of obtaining them through player activity what i would guess is that because the plexaur exchange is fixed but iskplex is not that as new items go into the nex the isk prices for plex would rise astronomically the mt goods that are based on aur would inflate in isk in step with the plex costs at some point the advantage to buying the items for plexaur instead of isk would go away as it became alot cheaper to buy it in isk instead of aur once again assuming that they are items or services that you can get via alternate means anything that is game changing and completely nex specific outside of things like standings changes would break that and thus break the economy pretty badly there may be some overall inflation on the isk based goods that make it into the nex store but as long as they can be player made competition should keep that inflation managable which should minimize the impact on the overall eve economy
tldr  give new characters more skills that allow the operation of basic stuff such as racial frigate iii other frigates ii hull upgrades i afterburner i etcwhen the apocrypha expansion was introduced the starting sp for new players has changed from 800000 sp to 56489 sp while new players were offered a skill boost effectively turning them into blank slates that train the needed skills faster after the removal of learning skills in incursion new players got an even faster training rate by getting a 12 point increase in all base stats without the need to rely on skill boosters or suffer the grinding halt of training learning skills it was a bold move that removed one of the initial barriers for getting into eve so i applaud that decision once againhowever the starting 56489 sp seems a bit too lacking for new players as it is barely enough to allow basic game play options and even the most basic modules are more than 10 minutes away from being able to use sometimes the lack of skills can force the learning process to a dead stop especially during the industrial tutorial where the player is asked to produce an item but does not has the appropriate skill to do that you have to train industry to level 1 this halt in the introduction of new features may negatively influence the first impression of eve as many players first playing eve are often much less tolerant to waiting for access to new features than established players as often described by the first hour rule or dump the game if it does not interest or entertain you within the first hour therefore removing the impression that the users have to wait just to gain access to the most basic functionality will improve eves first impression and new player retention rate which in the long run will help both the growth of eve and increase the number of pew pew targets or skers that dive into your market manipulation attempts and ccps financial health more subscribers that will also buy the nex stuffthen how do you do thisquite simple really give new characters more basic skills that unlock most of the basic features a new player will ever need in the first day this can be done by adding the following skills to every new players starting skill set racial frigate iii nonracial frigate ii  nonracial turret ii missile launcher operation i rocket i standard missiles i hull upgrades i repair systems i afterburner i propulsion jamming i industry i astrometrics ia new gallente character for example will start with the following skill sets spaceship command spaceship command iii gallente frigate iii amarrminmatarcaldari frigate ii group total 32490 sp hybrid turret iii energyprojectile turret ii 13360 sp missile launcher operation i rockets i standard missiles i 1000 sp navigation iii afterburner i 8750 sp engineering iii shield operation ii 9415 sp electronics iii propulsion jamming i 8750 sp mining ii industry i 1665 sp science iii astrometrics i 8750 sptotal sp 86145 spwhile the amount of sp given in this proposal is only about 16 hours worth of training it will be sufficient for any new player that wants to follow through the basic tutorial and career tutorials and to consider as many options in future progression as possible in terms of race and profession to prevent whines from this changefree skillz its unfair1one it will be better to give 29656 sp to all characters that are created before this change the exact amount new characters will gain from the revamppros jump start that involves less waiting to actually do stuff wider options of game play for new players increased retention rate of new players benefits both the users and ccpcons none
no the number is entirely arbitrary and completely circumvents the training queue which is the reason a lot of us are here in the first place newbs cant simply spend a few days or weeks maxing out and claiming they are l33tif newbs are going to leave the game before getting to stealth bombercloak haulerhulk due to impatience then they will also leave after waiting to get to the next thing so your simply delaying the problem a short while the only solution then is to make the skill pack something you can buy repeatedly so that they dont have to wait at any pointno might as well put concorde battle ships up for sale while were at itno bloody thank you10more important still that many skill points in the hands of a newb is a waste i paid twenty extra bucks for a million skills points and still got killed getting too much too early and risking too much isk can only drive off a newb
i would tend to agree with this the idea of handing out sp is kind of silly thats why i suggested an item like the cerebral accelerator it has precedence and doesnt just lump the sp on skill training is still required it just goes a little fasteralso at whoever mentioned the newbs with learning skills so does everyone else and they dont help much even the cerebral accelerator doesnt help much i used that on this character for the first month and it basically got me cybernetics v and a few other things before the month was out had to train learning skills too of course as i started this account before the change kinda lost out on that but gained with the 1 remap so its not bad
why would you agree to any market where items can be bought only with aur but sold for isk isk is power too and if players cant earn aur or aur items ingame without cash in the equation somewhere that means the vanity items isk market would be completely dominated by real cash investors in other words its a market for laundering cash to isk and in case you think thats just like it used to be with plex i think youre very much mistakenthe cashisk market and vanity items mt  player market in control
a number of players have noticed that recent eve expansions are somewhat lacking in substantive gameplay content perhaps this is due to lack of funds available for eve content development at ccp especially with so much effort concentrated on other new productswhile we eve players would love for ccp to devote more of its development isk to eve that is probably not a realistic objective the kind of expansions we want appeal to veteran players but are unlikely to attract enough new players to produce a satisfactory return on investmentinstead i propose that ccp allow community volunteers to assist in developing future substantive gameplay content for future eve expansions perhaps the editing and approval of communitydeveloped content could be coordinated through the csm the goal is to continue evolving the eve universe and keeping it alive for the enjoyment of us players in spite of financial realities
it is much cheaper to develop products for an existing customer base than it is to develop and market new products to lure a new customer base you also would see a much quicker roi from your existing customer base
from my own experience in software development adding major features to an existing product is not really easier in fact it gets more difficult with time the main problem is trying to integrate new code with mountains of old code that may or may not be understood any more by people still employed at the company also everyone wants to work on the new exciting product so there may be a morale problem in forcing the best developers to stay on tired old evethey have no way to recover their investment with todays model where content patches are free end game content like new t3 or capital ship mechanics has little appeal to new players since it takes months to years of skill training to access that content so they cant justify it on the grounds of increasing subscriptions one could argue that such features help retain old customers buy its hard to prove that the veteran players wouldnt resubscribe anyway even without the new content
there is a huge difference of point of view between the guy that receives a paycheck and the guy that pays that employeethis from my own experienceof course
well i was always on the receivingapaycheck side i wouldnt know as much about the management side of it from a management point of view what would be the negatives of letting community volunteers develop eve content
i was speaking from the ownership side management usually has less of an idea of wtf is going than the guy grunting out the heavy liftingi do not see any real negatives for community involvement as a matter of fact my customers are some my best inspiration for creating new products what i was speaking of essentially is the cost of creating productsservicesmarketing for new customers that is not a proven when you have an established customer base that is telling you what they want the current customer base is already in place and you can actually track and forecast what you will get in revenue in the near and long term that also means that your current customer base will for the most part will be your marketing arm by write ups in social media etc bringing in new customers

supported buy only for bpc items
the thing that most people arent thinking about is that letting any type even bpc of game altering mt will just give ccp the excuse to add more game altering items for 
good point the threshold for adding more invasive microtransactions will be loweredhowever for the sandbox it would be better to let players produce the vanity items than let them magically appearwell i am losing hope for eve ccp screwed it over hard i dont know if the damage done will be repaireble i can only hope that ccp has a tiny bit of integrity left
i was thinking of using pi materials for clothes and monocle supportedaddendum clothes as separate items do get destroyed in space clothes in portraits do notccp didnt think through carefully enough to realize that portrait  character we dont take a new passport photo every time we get into a new set of clothes so if the avatars and portraits are separate this would make more sensealthough it may be a problem when a corp decides to share a single monocle  status symbol putting it on a character only when taking portraits and passing on to one another to get monocles on every single characters portrait but hey taking photos with a tux does not mean the groom will be wearing a tux for the rest of his honeymoon right
its actually quite simpleaur is introduced to control the plex prices as ccp has no way to control plex prices directly when i say price i mean price in isk as we will assume that changing the usd cost of plex is a no go as that is pinned by the monthy subscription priceso how do you control the price of something that you cant control directly by controlling the supply or demand of it its exactly how the fed controls the value of usd by tweaking interest ratesso how can you control the price of plex by providing a plex sink ie aur and the stuff it can buythey dont want to introduce anything that will affect the game mechanics really they dont why because that will just cause people to get angry and it would make usdplexaur more likely than just if the items were vanity for vanity the aur supply will come mostly from isk wallets of trillionaires which is exactly what ccp wants and what trillionaires want too maybe things like custom corp logos can be bought with aur and other things that show wealth besides you cant exactly fly your titans around jita to show your superiority but you can sure as heck wear a monocle
thanks for the reply agreed though ive read that ccp has limited the supply of plex in the past in order to control the marketso if i understand correctly you do agree that vanity items sales through mt would facilitate cashisk trading to some extenthow exactly does the aur supply come mostly from isk wallets of trillionaires when aur can only be made from plex which can only be created with cash even if those plex wouldve already been in the game before vanity items mt why youd want a plex sink a lot of plex may not have been exchanged for isk yet in other words their real value atm is only their cash investement untill they are sold on the isk market by the person who bought them for cash the turnover rateprofitability for plex on the market was linked to the actual amount of plex consumed by the population for game time whereas now it would be linked to the demand for vanity items insteadalso it may not be possible to fly your titans around jita but those extra iskies may well fund a war in nullseccouple of edits in the last paragraph
never mind wrong button again time to fix the layout i think
i would like my representatives to ask ccp to define ccp does not charge extra for game expansionsthe common definition of a game expansion includes addonsan expansion pack expansion set or supplement is an addition to an existing roleplaying game tabletop game or video game these addons usually add new game areas weapons objects andor an extended storyline to a complete and already released game  wikipediasection 10e of the eve online terms of use utilizes the words new releases of software and expansion packsnow here it the expectations set forth by ccp since 2003 your subscription fee gives you unlimited access to the eve online servers website and customer support unlike console games where you are purchasing the game asis the development of eve as a persistent world is ongoing with frequent updates to add new features and improve your gameplay experience subscriptions allow us to continue making eve bigger and better as well as paying our staff their monthly wages ccp does not charge extra for game expansionsincarna introduced new items as part of an expansion so then why are items being sold within in the noble exchange are excluded from a well documented and marketed customer service expectation flawed thinking but its just a damn monocle vanity items they have no direct effect on game play  whats the big deal  just ignore it  adapt or gtfo  i can buy plex convert them to isk use the isk to buy in game items these are assumption a limited perception of the inevitable future of the game and a resignation of ones right to customer servicegtc and plex are not expansion items each represents a direct exchange of cash for services from ccp they are alternative means of paying for subscription plex almost qualifies as content by doubling as currency and as an item that can be traded in game both are anomaly of trust between community and developer they are currency not goodsthey do not improve game play they facilitate convenience items that purchased with isk that were converted from the sale of plex on the player market are not not direct transactions with ccp almost every items in game is manufactured by a player or sold by a player with prices being set by a player even though playera purchased plex from ccp another playerb bought the plex with isk the isk playerb might have generated by tech ii production and sales playerc purchased a tech ii ship or item from playerb playerb purchased minerals and materials from playerd and playere whom harvested the raw materials all of which is gameplayit may not obvious to a pvp focused player but he does play link in a long the chaincurrently items being sold in the noble exchange breach the integrity of the market and customer expectations players do not harvest materials for the items players not create the items player do not set the initial prices for the items aurum and the nex insures that no matter where in the cycle the item is purchased ccp profits from the exchange it a clever way to insert hidden charges for expansionsthe timing of introducing micro transactions for expansion items is cleverwhat is more clever is that it is being presented as a option for you not to be includedim not making an argument for eve online avatar dress up to be free although it should be because it and all items introduced within is an expansion im pointing out the eve players right to customer service from ccp who should deliver on expectations when the developer says  ccp does not charge extra for game expansions
with incarna the universe has expanded for now there is the room couch and door this is incomplete presentation of things to come because the station environments are restricted to quarters it is unclear at the moment how incarna improves game play is it presently underestimated as an alternate shard that can be remedied by disabling station environments when stations environments expand to include multiplayer interactivity thru avatars rather than spaceships we will see improvements that will remove distinction between internet spaceships and avatarsit will not be called incarna it will be called eve avatars will become a vehicle like spaceships to continue exploring multilayer multiplayer interactions as we have been doing since the universe beganit may not make sense right this second but open reason to include what has been said about the future of station environments then maybe yea  one would like to exercise customer service to clarify this abrupt breach of trust bait and switch in which ccp starts to charge extra for expansions when they been saying for eight years now  ccp does not charge extra for game expansionsthe issue about micro transactions in eve online is not about players resistance to change it very much about ccps abandonment of expectations marketed by the company and not clearly communicating the shift with the customer base it was ccp whom set the tone eve online is pure subscription based model mmorpg and also stated that eve online will not have micro transactions if ccp are to charge extras for expansions thru micro transactions they should be upfront about it and clearly communicate the expectation shift with their customers and completely define the new expectations the company should not be marketing that they do not charge extras when in fact they will charge extra in micro transactions in addition to subscription fees there is a term for this it is called false advertisement
signed for good arguments
good points well presented you have my support
im sorry i have to disagree i dont care about rmt i want my ship in the hangar yes that does sound selfish and ridiculous that exactly how i felt when i read this i understand your upset and i am willing to support you but lets not push the issue off the hangar view under the rug it is very important to me
1 inconvenience by design is unacceptable
i doubt anyone here in this thread disagrees with that issue tooand heres a thread in this forum for just that thing
alright so i believe there needs to be a means for legitimately taking over a corporation in many reallife corps there is a board of directors but our corps only have directors no board if there is a corp whos members have no confidence in its top tier management there should be a means for removing that person or people in my case a toon of mine founded a corp passed on leadership yet remained a member when i had to step away and now everyone that remains no longer plays while not necessary i would like to have my corp back but i have no means of ever doing soso i would suggest the following  that a corp have one of two options available for affecting corporate takeover the first option if membership is lacking is the ability for membership to vote inout top tier management a percentage 75 maybe of active play within the last 3 mos membership voting yes would be necessary for any action to occur only one vote of dismissal could take place in any 6 mos period to reduce the possibility of vindictive actions or retribution and to reduce needless turnover the second option is for creating a board of directors to handle the hiring and firing of top tier management the board of directors could be comprised of 7 or 9 members and would require only a simple majority to enable an action the board of directors would serve without term limits themselves but would lose their position if not active in play within 45 days the board of directors could also assign any top tier management positions on a contractual basis with specific goals that need to be fulfilled before the end of the contract termanyhow i kinda threw this together so i dont expect it to be perfect but i do believe in itthe first option is what current corps would default to with the ability of switching to the second option should this be adopted
u can elect a board in game in reality if you have 51 of shares you own the corp and can take it over anyways
we csm2 changed sovereignty for example
looks like zelda is full of s then
you should its pretty goodanyway ignore these idiots anyone with an ounce of sense can see that being on the csm is no joyride
simple as the saying goes  if you cant do the time dont do the crimeafter all it was your choice to take to the dark side
why not just giving the opportunity to buy back sec status from the shop with aur 
and while your at it let me buy sp and faction standings with aurto be honest this kind of microtransaction would be the end of my subscription if you choose to yarr which we all do at some point you have to be able to accept the consequences of your actionsive got an idea though that would be pretty cool concord paying bounties and big sec status increases on arresting popping player piratesthat would make those low sec gate camps even busier
one word performance cq looks reasonable as far as i can see but seems to be a real resource hog im not in a position to give a definitive opinion on this as i run eve under linux and this may probably degrades the framerate but i have seen other comments saying that cq is slow and that some people have problems with laptops overheating pretty is fine but if it detracts from the gaming experience then this should be addressed reintroduction of ship spinning seems to be a popular request i must say that the static screen used when you disable cq is brown dull and depressing i do miss having an instant reminder of what ship im in as i have a tendency to undock with the wrong type of ship and that is a pain
the biggest problem with the cq right now is that it serves absolutely no purpose aside from a bit of eyecandybut this eyecandy is affecting performance of the client which in my humble opinion makes it incredibly stupid to have even released it at this point i think the typical eve player doesnt care much about how the game looks otherwise we wouldnt be playing an old game like this its performance and function that countsthe update incarna falls in my opinion into the same category as the upgrade from xp to vistalooks better alot slower and less stable
so what should be done to make incarna betterscrap it
wont happen get over it do something productive like think of something they could do to make you like iti play on a macbook pro running windows 7 and havent had any issues with performance i dont multibox though my friend does and didnt have any trouble with two characters in cq at once but his desktop is pretty new and shinythat doesnt mean that people arent having performance problems though i figure that was kind of the point of cq to figure out the performance issues isnt this the engine theyre going to use for wod anyway so of course theyre going to want to iron out the bugs thereas for functionality since im an rpnerd i like the immersion i always thought wis would be cool and that getting out of my spaceship would make me feel more like i lived in this universe furthermore i think eve is pretty darn pretty for an mmog especially when you look at wow which came out a year laterbut features what features should be added
i agree with everything the op has laid out get it done
to those of you here on the forums that time and again criticize me because i seem to be hiding or because i am too short or even because i cant find a box to step on well heres the reasonuntil ccp adds the handlebar mustache option to the recustomization feature i will not show my whole facei have a wonderfully bushy and carefully treated handlebar mustache in real life and i dedicate almost half hour everyday using pinauds clubman mustache wax to make it the way it is and for some godly unknown reason ccp does not gives me the option to have one ingamei therefore refuse to show a naked face or even worse unawesome mustaches until my demands are metfor the mustacheplease visit your user settings to reenable images

failheap is that better than scrapheap where the socially retarded people used to hang outi really dislike community forums where a group of residents terrorize any input thats given
i think captain picard might have something to say on the issue
hi i see a massive problem with the graphics though in overall it is a massive step forward i dont know if any has realized but the closer you get to your ship in your capitan quarters the smaller your ship looks why is this can something be done about it thank you the ship size doesnt actually get any bigger when u approach it its like static and in reality if something massive is very far and you approach it you shouldnt see it get bigger even though it is but in this case not only that the ship does not get bigger but the terrain behind it is which gives the effect that the ship is shrinking
you cant sticky these in this forum

noccp does not charge extra for game expansionsi do not support being charged extras thru micro transactions for expansionsthe description vanity items is a mislabel for expansion addons those items will gain more relevance to gameplay when the development of stations environments expand to include multiplayer interactivity thru avatars rather than spaceships it will not be called incarna then it will be called eve avatars will become a vehicle like spaceships to continue exploring multilayer multiplayer interactions as we have been doing since the universe began
one thing that bothers me is the mothershipsupercarrier issue personally i dislike mothership as a designation more than i dislike supercarrier theyre all basically overgrown carriers even before they overhauled them into supercarriers so some name pertaining to being a carrier seems obvious their bonuses were always a complete copy of the carriers of their race for instance and they of course also use the carrier skill they might as well be called tier 2 carriers but they are so much more impressive than a carrier they do need to be considered their own class so supercarrier apparently seemed appropriate to ccp and it is a better moniker than mothership motherships as theyve said way back when will hopefully eventually be reintroduced as a brandnew class ive heard among my groups suggestions about making the mothership concept into mobile manufacturing ships though that would suggest an industrial to be honest though i dont think thats too terrible an idea either
im one of the dreaded newer playersid like if plex was completely removed from the game  it seems to encourage isk farming and character trading which is a huge way of circumventing training time so far it looks like players and alliances have actively spent real world money on plex and then turned them into it into a fiscal and military advantage over other players i find it blatantly hypocritical if the same people are bashing microtransactions oi like the microtransactions but would like them to be cheaper i hope that nothing that is manufactured in game ends up in the exchange im in favour of convenience items if theyre not too pricey and arent game breakinghoping they get more fashions in the store and that well be able to switch out clothes before doing dangerous stuffits a pity i think that jump freighters cant do those big jumps makes nullsec look less attactive if its true that nullsec is less valuable than it once was thats taking some incentive to go there away too at least in my noob opinioncurious if the game is going free to play with microtransactionsalso wondering if the company is hurting during the global recessionregardless hopefully there are discount days on the horizon in the exchangevixx
as i understood it plex offers a legitimate method where otherwise rmt sites and such from china or wherever would probably still find a way to farm isk and request through questionable channels real money for said isk screwing ccp out of the extra funding and likely even the player getting fleecedi do agree it would be nice to remove it altogether but i think the game actually could easily suffer more without it i dont know for sure but i assume there was a time when plex did not exist and rmt was rampant regardless
this has actually been complained about by old bittervets for a while now agility and tactics took a backseat to raw firepower and thats how larger richer alliances hold the field doomdays need tracking modifiers so theyre pointed at what they are supposed to be pointed at and supercarriers have gone full retrdmy main issues stem from faction balancing i love flying minni now but the projectile buff was overdone between having all the speed agility and optimal to falloff there is no reason to fly anything else excluding certain circumstances you have the one race thats best at putting itself in specific ranges but it shoots from its nose to the horizon relative to everything else that doesnt make any sense from a balencing standpointit also doesnt help my immersion knowing railguns isnt the volley weapon of choice we all know what a railgun is dont we it throws slugs down a magnetic rail at multiples of the speed of sound seriously what are blasters something that throws  so fast the ammo burns up before it goes farther then 10km the way i picture itgalliente  extreme volley  extreme shortlong range  very high agilitymoderate speedhigh armorlow shieldamarr  extreme dps  medium range only  low agilityhigh speedvery high armorlow shieldminmatar  dpsvolley short to medium range  high agilityvery high speedmoderate armormoderate shieldcaldari  dpsvolley medium to long range  high agilitylow speedlow armorvery high shield
and when i talk about range differences they need to overlap more there is way to much certainty in this game on what kills what some more overlap would introduce a lot more pilot skill to the game
thumbs up for less dependence on jita
no
no
no no way
noanything that would be considered for a cosmeticonly store should instead be offered to the manufacturers in game as blueprints the efforts to add new items should be to support the current economy of eve  it hasnt had enough love in the past few yearsmaybe if they finished some of the features added in the past few upgrades they would find the new subscriptions thus obtained enough to satisfy their investors
no no
absosmegginglutely no
no
no
no
 nothey should never have included a 2nd currency in the first place kill aur and you effectively fix 70 of the problems in one go the introduction of aur was a terrible idea from the get go the game has absolutely no use or need for a completely new currency just make everything have an reasonable isk value and that is all is needed end of story
no subscription based games should never implement p2w mt the entry of such things will slowly collapse the structure of eve
nono no no no no absolutely not never ever f noneed i be more clearvoted no microtransactions in eve the devs need to bubble scram web pop and pod the nobles exchange  and then drag its frozen corpse in circles through the trade hubs on a tractor beam so that we players can teabag its remains a fitting end
hell no

cosmetic only and only of existing content new content should be free via the expansions
no
vote cosmetic  you think that the only microtransactions ingame should be those that allow you to buy items that effect nothing of consequence such as plex for boobies or hats nice clothes nipples etc which do not effect anything although they may restrict the sandbox and lessen the chances of more miniproffesions but what something looks like and how many layers of clothes you wear when you play the game in the privacy of your own home
nomts meh dont know what to say i just plain and simple hate em plenty of sparkleponys in other games eve should not be one of them
cosmetic onlygive me funny hats or give me death
no
no i support being able to purchase cosmetic items but one shouldnt have to spend real money to do so i understand that ccp is having financial difficulties however so i wouldnt be completely upset about cosmetic only mts but i still think its a bad idea and not the direction that eve should go

1it might make cq underutilized if implemented now but this is definately something i would like to see when multiplayer wis comes out
only reason why not is because ccp wants to grief us showing us the door
forcing us to deal with cq is definitely immersionbreaking of course it has other problems as wellit may be easier to sell nex goods when we have to look at our avatars every time we dock but compromising the gaming experience to tell us stuff is a goodwilleroding maneuver on ccps part incarna 10 is basically a fluffonly expansion i love fluff but immersionbreaking fluff is selfdefeating and ultimately pointless in my view

thanks for the interesting idea i do think that it cuts into the appeal of name change significantly though how about applying that only to negative standing contacts the latter would most likely play out naturally anyway amongst positive contacts i can agree to disagree but what can you say to those that think character transfers are a bad enough thing already
supporting obviously as a person unhappy with my character name i would even pay for it or let someone else already pay for it via plex for name change back in my day there was no randomize name option back when i created my character i was in my teens and didnt think too hard ive since wisened up a bitincarna is a great time to add something like thisand people who keep mouthing off about your name is your reputation  one of the things ive learned in eve is that if youre going to do something horrible you do it with an alt ive met very few people who have the balls to pull off largescale corp thefts and destruction of kitten orphanaries with their mains not that i would mind a name history tab but still that concept is just so broken its not even funny because there are plenty of ways in eve to avoid bad karma alreadye and obviously i wouldnt mind reasonably harsh restrictions on it either like once per year limits or the like
i woud like to propose to ccp that the twelveteen million or so deaddormant trial accounts that have never been activated since trial end from the last 7 years be deleted and the names contained therin released for new playerscharactersccp can simply send an email giving them notice like the emails we all get inviting us back after 6 months of not playing and then terminating the accounts after the given time my proposal is for dormant trial accounts only if a player has activated then in all fairness they should be able to keep name and character for any future usethoughts
trial accounts only why not
yes but for trial accounts only
i totally agree with this if it regards trial accounts only and a 30 day notification is sent beforehandsigned
yes for cleaning up the character namespace it even makes the db guys happy
i kinda agree with this one imho it should be accounts that are more than six months expired and with two million or less skill points that will clean up a lot of the namespace and clean up the servers as wellsupported
for nonactivated trial accounts absolutely
10
i support this in principle but it is probably going to be more trouble to implement than it is worth
more name options and cleans up the db
makes sense
if it was only a trial and never activated after a year it makes sense to toss them in the meat grinder
i support this
signed
i will agree this only applied to trial accounts as already suggested is probably a good idea even though this character was one that laid dormant as an unactivated trial for a year or two before friends dragged me in fullspeed
agreedhowever any char that has ever been made nontrial should be left untouched
ya any trial account over 6 months old should be given notice and then removed
supported
sounds good expired trials only of course after several months
my monocle says i must approve this wonderful idea
sensible idea 1
i like the way this guy thinks
the reason monocles are so expensive is because you buy a eternal supply of them
splortch here hold this for me while i go ninja mine in 00
so everyone will have stuff like highgrade snakes n slavesi dont think so
please share what youre smoking cuz last i checked you only wear a monocle not replace an eyeball with it

i have no need for aur display or noble store eitheri should be able to remove them from my screen
right pls give an option to remove aur from the view
i totally agree with thisalso make it an option to choose to have the balance on the left instead of the right because this is how annoying it is
this
true and trueand why the color is blue is this some kind of vague allusion and what is it for
bah you and your harsh empty words you still havent answered how this is worse than darth vader buying another character selling the current one to offset costs of transferring to a new one and totally blindsiding you well it seems that you are pretty set on your false justifications kaelie been keeping up with current events greed is good oh no i see that youre carrying the universal banner of righteousness into this discussion have mercy been mentioned already funny how that never in that last quote turned into this
true also for all those rpers and for some realism gangs in my town actually force ranking members to legally change their name you could change your name to reflect a position in a corp like if im a corp ceo of a fairly successful corp and someone really wants to join then they have to change their name to captain mcbunnyears iii and it would be stuck like that for a year would definetly make ceo demands and corp requirements a lot more lulzy
if anything these vanity items should be produced and sold by players not created out of thin airsupported
supported completely
support oh yeah be sure to include all the minutes to 
yes would be nice to see where ccp is taking eve
yes it would be nice to know what is coming next in incarnait would be nice to have something to look forward to again
supported a roadmap would be nice to see definatelyand would also actually probably atleast quiet down the community quite alotgreetsjessy
yes i to wish to see that
yes because ccp will totally do this
please reinstate this feature ccp or at the very least give us another way to perform a bulk export of this data
this feature needs to be brought back sleeper sites are hell to break down without this logging so it would be wonderful if it was brought back 1 from me

ok lets put this in perspective so i have to work at my job making widget x for 4 years in order to be better at making widget t last i checked practice made perfect not linear timewait irrespective of effort not meaning to cause insult here but think about it in the context of just what you state here the more you do something at your job the better you get at it yes timeeffort an example comes to mind i can imagine very few folks played swg here anyway i played a year or so at first release and they had a multi tiered if player fires the pistol and the code looked and saw if you have 0 points in it then you have a 1 chance to increase a point at 20 points a 10 chance etc on until you got full pistol then you could go work on rifle and gain in that proficiency etc that is closer to real life if we are to use real life examples to compare against if i played more then i got more proficient at something quicker than someone else no that does not equal purchasing sp that wasnt the point just pointing out that waiting x time for a sp pool to fill is not really anything but a game mechanic to give a player a means of having something to look forward to that put everyone on the same playing field of everyone has to wait the same time to get x skill problem isnt on a 11 basis the problem more relates to how ccp gets more players interested in the game like it or lump it me included ccp has to do things that we arent going to always agree with my vote was apparently not accepted on the monocle in order to attract more business there is always fall out and negative response but those margins dont hopefully compare to the positives that is gamble that ccp has to take and makeas an aside fwiw swg finally closes its doors this dec for making a catastrophic game mechanics change they lost all the major guildsplayer base of the oldtimers over the last 2 years and didnt manage to attract new players they tried to compete with wowor perhaps vets have given this some serious thoughts and are trying to look at both sides of the argument and find too many pros and not enough cons we talk it out and if some good rationale shows up to support how the negatives would be permanent in nature rather than temporary influx of balance changes then sure id be persuaded more to the negative viewharsh and emotional response some of us like the concept of sp sales but not outright here buy bazillions of sp for 1 kinda thing i am talking about severely regulated limited in scope means of jumpstarting n00bs into a drake at most sort of thing then charge them an arm and a leg to do it give them something that closes the gap a little so my buds arent so annoyed as to walk away but give them more than just enough to hobble in a cheap t1 frig give them a chance to spend serious major bucks years worth of sp costs a years worth of dollars limit on cant spend purchased sp on this skill type of regulationsi can imagine in some folks eyes your statement then applies to everyone who buys plex for isk infusions or the bazaar high sp char purchases they cheated the system by having a high sp toon instagrat for play
a friend starting 2 years behind you isnt their problem and its an advantage to your friend that youre there to help him hell excell that much faster assuming you know what you are doing as far as your incentive you now have a rl friend playing along side you is that not enough since this is a mmo besides it will only take him around a month if you help him focus train to become an effective combat pilot pve or pvp as there are plenty of different roles he could fill along the way plus the great learning curve that does exist you cant exactly cram down his throat in short time there should be a balance i would even wager his toon will have the sp before hed know how to properly apply itthe real issue for player retention is immersion into the game as mentioned players are pretty much required to think on their own as to what to do saddly this is a problem for most people ccp is trying to figure out how to get new players to want to get immersed without overwhelming them and freaking people outit is tough being a noob and could use some sp love i agree there but most people will tell you its better to earn your experience vs having it handed to you people dont respect free or quickly obtained stuff we just dont appreciate it as much so what to do in past assembly hall topics immersion in this case having a more in depth career path explained seemed to be popular my example was for the military pilot an in game video of the military pilot fighting for his race in a 1 month term of service noob vs noob style fw with free ships clones fighting in a separate set of systems where he would be more guided and be taught combat could earn isk lp ships sec status and perhaps bonus sp this mode of introduction to eve gets a player more actively invovled develop friends in the service and give him goals there was much more details in the posts but all were good reads eve is a different kind of game its not for everyone the bar of thinking is higher the risks are higher goals are longer term but thats what makes it so great and loved barring future poor decisions on ccps partop stop trying to make this a mindless shooter style game its not quick gratification of sp with rl cash is like cumming before you can even get your pants off stop playing devils advocate for your own lawyerish arguement and agenda the survey of readers by percentage have argued against you its for a reason the small validity you think you have is based upon noob status it is an issue for noobs but throwing money at it is not the solution as ive shown immersion is more the issue and quick sp in large amounts counters immersion speak for the real problem dont create new ones peace
and cheeseburgers and lots of it
this is where you and most other opponents are confusedyou didnt earn anything because it took exactly zero effort on your part you simply paid and waited for your status which is exactly what the op is proposing pay and wait except his proposed wait period would be significantly shorter to make up for that one could conceivably be asked to pay more
id like to get my spouse into the game and would appreciate if we could just buy a couple years worth of sp buying a used character isnt an option for her nor is starting from scratchoutright sale of hundreds of millions of sp may not be the way to go but i really do hope that ccp comes up with a way to let people buy some sp to skip the low end gameperhaps an older player could sponsor a new player once where a new player will be eligible to purchase 15  as an example  of the sp the sponsor has and it can only be done once per account so if i have 100 mil sp and i sponsor my wife then she can buy up to 20 mil sp once i sponsored her i am locked in and cant sponsor another character regardless of whether the sponsored character used up all sponsored sp the sponsored character could be allowed to only make the purchase once so they have to decide right there whether they want all the allowed sp or notthere are a bazillion ways to make sp purchases work without to shaft the game
actually what really is evident is that there is a very minor minority 502 of the vocal playerbase who vote yes for microtransactions on the forumscrowd source microtransactions 1st vote result countedinsertdataherebesides which if thats the case that the overwhelming majority of players are either not opposed or dont care one way or another then it goes without saying that the vocal minority who do care enough to participate in the forums should have their say heard respected and heededsince as every person has theoretically the same weight of voice in eve online by means of the csm and by means of the forums that majority who apparently dont care are essentially opting out of making their voice heard so therefore their unheard vote doesnt have meaning as their vote is synonymous with the concept of nulltherefore in the absence of the data to support your theory we can only go by the vocal minority who do care enough to provide enough data to produce a theorycrowd source microtransactions 1st vote result countedwe can also go by the views of the csm whose role it is to represent the playerbase and the truth is that the csm cohesively agree that mt should be at best vanity only and preferably no mt at allcorrection money buys advantage almost everywhere some notable exceptions are games and ideally also sportsby saying everywhere then you are saying that when i play monopoly against my family members which say includes an 8 year old child who has only a few dollars of pocket money in her possession that all my opponents should naturally agree that if i buy more boxes of the game effectively pay hasbro more money then i should be able to accumulate the monopoly money from all the additional boxes i have in my possession and use those additional funds to have higher buying power which will inevitably allow me to win without challengeplex to buy isk from other players which by the way wasnt produced from thin air like with the nex store items since a player actually played the game to earn that isk is an allowable exception because it provides ccp with money that would otherwise go entirely toward a black market allowing mt purchase of sp or items on the other hand is ccps attempt to cut into the playerdriven economy that eve is famous for and was designed to encouragethis is not real life this is a computer game therefore reallife comparisons have little weight however i feel that my comparison to monopoly holds at least some water because rather than comparing apples to oranges i am comparing one game to another game
if youre trying to measure your success in eve by your total number of skillpoints youre doing it wrong your worth comes from what those skillpoints allow you to do not the size of your number and if youre unable or unwilling to accept that then yes eve is not the game for you even then past a certain number skillpoints just gain you breadth not depth and you can buy breadth already by subscribing multiple accountsthe idea that new players need to be able to catch up in raw skillpoints to veterans is stupid and possibly even harmful to the game sure you might get a few more people subscribing if they could throw a credit card around and fly a battleship in their first week but they wont be the kind of person who will stick around once there are no more goals for them to aim for that kind of player might make todays numbers look good but it isnt good for the long term health of a game and what about the beginners who arent willing to throw real money around in the first couple of months of game time how do they deal with an eve where nobody produces basic equipment any moreand on the subject of the existing character market that differs from buying skillpoints in a number of important ways the fact that its no longer your character you might not like the portrait or the name is an important barrier to entry its clear even from this thread that people are unwilling to give up their identity for a boost in skillpoints and that naturally limits the number of people buying characters which is a good thing secondly the character market is a product of the current condition of the game if a patch or even just a change in community knowledge comes in and radically boosts a certain playstyle everyone is starting on an even footing including most of those who buy a character because nobody was forewarned sure there might be some people who coincidentally trained the new correct thing or even people who had the foresight to do so but with skillpoints for cash anyone would be able to instantly jump on board with the flavour of the month massively reducing the diversity that makes eve special
there were 364875 active paying subscriptions in march 2011note that these are paid for accounts not actual players there are of course many multiple accounts altho i believe last number said was 14 of the players have more than 1 accounts  since then it may have increased tho i receive these numbers directly from ccp even when they are going down  which has happened several times but never for long and not by that much up until now i am really curious what the next numbers will be p you can get some more info on subs on my site mmodatanetyou can also verify some of the numbers by checking the eve quarterly economic newsletter
dear csm and ccp and coplayersnow you train about 2m sp in a month that would be aquivalent to 1 plex aka 30 days game time why not sell those 2m sp instantly for 1 plex  whats the diffenrence about getting those sp instantly or in 1 month of waiting time  the advantages are clear  you avoid empty skill time and can start instantly with pvp and other things of course this will bring kind of nonequal between those who can afford to buy them and those who cannot but let us be honest  in real life we have everywhere first and second class if you fly by plane or take a train you can choose to pay about 50 more for comfort a second class and first class will both achieve the destination point so there is no difference a company council knows that 8090  are second class and 1020  first now we have no first class in eve so ccp cannot take profit of those who are willing to pay for this comfort economically it is not good for a company to waste possible profit and im speaking of 20  of playerbase who would eagerly pay for this feature i agree completely with the prohibition of special things like golden ammo and such because then the destination point of first and second class is not the same but getting a month amount of sp for the price of 30 days of game time doesnt disbalance the game it only brings comfortim supporting your idea 1
i think the biggest issue with this from my perspective is the idea that established vets with massive isk reserves andor the means to acquire even more isk would just use this mechanic to further reinforce their skillpoint advantagesotherwise i think its just vets who dont want new players to be able to pay to skip aheadthe only argument against letting new players get more skillpoints through plex from my perspective is the idea that waiting for skillpoints can let one play the game at each ship class size instead of just pay for the ability to fly a battleship and subsequently buy the battleship skipping ships that really are usefulbesides if someone who does that plans to just do missions anyway they end up being forced into tiny ships anyway since they have to work up through the factions which definitely shouldnt be changed as this to me is part of the richness of the sandboxeven those who would do this and jump into pvp theyre inexperienced and would probably lose battleship after battleship before they learn to use something smaller or more specialized battlecruisers tend to be one of the most popular pvp ships for instance anyway ultimately forcing a player to progress slowly up through the ship classes gives a chance for a player to respect each ship class not that they will but i did say chance theres plenty of people who can fight very effectively in a rifter for instance tackling battlecruisers with experience
i hate to argue this side of the debate but just for accuracys sakei believe the vets advantage issue with this is irrelevant tbh yes vets will be able to increase their skill points at will but it will only give them the ability to do more things not do them better theres only so many sps than pertain to flying a hulk or a hurricane on purely skillpoint terms a newer guy in an omen who bought several million sps and applied them correctly will as good as the vet who did the same the real issue here is something else player retention goals get met too easily and quickly and them players get bored and  off

obviously you would like to argue that those who dont care are opposed because that fits your desires and your view of things theres just this minor issue that any kind of votes are just like online petitions completely meaningless because they hold no real power what is happening right now is exactly what ccp predicted a hurricane in a waterglass a few hundred players out of thousands are going emo the rest of the player base is cool with the change because if they werent they would speak up business as usualin reality silence means acceptance those who oppose mt are on the defensive thus they have to be vocal those who support mt dont have to do anything because they are with ccps view they dont have to emorage for mt because mt is already happening simple reallyi think the argument in support of mt has been presented in a clear and logical fashion the opposition on the other hand went all emotional what gives me solace is that your 15month will pay to support mt implementation whether you agree with it or not regardless of all the forum warrioring you and others are doing on here you will not biomass your toon and walk awayno matter how you and others will try to spin that ccp and those in support of mt will ultimately win whether ccp will sell sp or not ill be smiling thinking about that every time i see the login screen
i had a hard time reading this my brain was trying to revolt the whole way in fact i think it succeeded because i still have no idea what you were saying here if you are not a native english speaker fine but you seemed to use decent english earlieralso stop clipping the first part of the quote forum tags it breaks the forum formatting
not true the majority of people will protest as soon as they are facing the problem even when warned about it several times before the main reason why most protesters were silent until ccp implemented the shopthis means you will get a whole new group of protesters when ccp starts implementing gamechanging items like ships modules or spof topicabout the new player sp problem i think its a great idea to make a couple of epic arc missions in high and lowsec with which you can earn x amounts of sp if you complete themperhaps a new storyline but the old one would be great as well fun for new players fun for old playersgr mardock
thing with selling character instead of just skill points is that when character changes hands total amount of skill points in game doesnt go upif you could use inflated isk to get plexes and then lolaurum and more skillpoints youd suddenly lot of titans whateva instead of nicely spread sp among noobs no not boobs noobs
you going to pretend youre behaving differently in reality silence means silence in your imaginations it means youre rightthis foolish canard if people are passionate enough to rage they are not going to throw away their character to satisfy the banalities of you and your ilkso because ccp will do vanity items and aurum is here to stay as they have stated publicly you conclude they will indeed sell sp lol and you claim to have logical arguments laughable
i had a hard time reading this my brain was trying to revolt the whole way in fact i think it succeeded because i still have no idea what you were saying here if you are not a native english speaker fine but you seemed to use decent english earlieralso stop clipping the first part of the quote forum tags it breaks the forum formattingwith incarna and mt ccp simply take part of the moneycake that belonged to rmt sellers lets take an example you can spent 20 for ingame needs 1 you can buy a machariel via plex for pvp loose it and forget the money2 you can buy a golden emblem for your ships which is not destructable and can be used all over againif you choose 2 will you spend additional 20  for a machariel we all driven by the wish to express ourselfes before incarna we could only buy ships and characters to be special now we can also buy those items this items are only sold by ccp so rmt ebay guys loose a part of their profit which now goes to ccp  so in fact this mt is good it drives out part of rmt sellersto completely stop rmt ccp is in fact doing the right thing those mt item can only be bought via plex thus means the need for plex will rise thus means the cost for plex will rise rmt with isk will stop when a official price will be 1b isk for 1 plex proof now 1 plex cost 15  0375b isk official price  plex cost 20  1b isk rmt ebay priceif ccp succeed with their ingame shop and implement also plex for sp we will have1 plex  15  1b isk official plex  20  1b isk rmt ebayergo ccp is on the right way  to rise the plex cost with all strenght at this point players who bought black isk before will stop that because the official price in real money will be lower than a rmt ebay price
while sp for real money is a bad thing there is however a reality few are willing to accept eve wont last forever the eve skillpoints system simply doesnt scale well over time which is to say over time the chance of there being enough time left to try and do the same as other have done so far will decrease until eves projected lifetimeleft will be only a few years or lessfor instance im looking at a full minmatar crosstraining plan for my alt duration almost 2 years will eve still have 2 years left and how about when i ask this again 2 years from now see my pointso while i do not support this proposal it might be a good idea for ccp to start looking into modest ways to allow training to speed up a bit for everyone like maybe 2x neural remaps a year or so
agreed 100 gallente has been by effect repeatedly nerfed over the years and its fallen drastically behind hybrid weapons need some love gallente needs some love
doesnt matter which hybrids need a bit of love as a caldarigallente at heart i decided not to train any hybrids because it is just unfair against lasersprojectile
pulling the shortest and longest range guns from the same weapon type hybrids was a bad move to begin withthe synergie with the ship bonuses make any kind change bloody hard to balancethat being said blaster do need some serious buffing although i must say that most of the changes should hit the hulls they are supposed to be used onneither damage or range are that much of a problem but actually getting into range and applying that damge is
i propose that ccp allow shares to be bought and sold on the market instead of only given away this would allow for the creation of an actual ingame stock market along with the items market we have now if shares could be bought and sold with isk players could invest in corporations the players could also directly affect the price of a corporations shares by their own actions this would include corporate wars monopolies on resources etc to determine the value of a corporations shares there could be a rankings list points would determine where a corporation was ranked on this list points would be awarded to a corporation for their assets war achievements time in business and the number of members this would allow only longstanding well trusted corporations to make the list the higher their rank on the rankings list the more their stock would be worth however only 49 of the corporations shares would be sold on the market the other 51 would remain in the ceos possession overall i believe this will allow for a more dynamic and real stock market in the eve universe
i think that is a great idea it would bring a whole new angle to the game and would give players a chance to generate true corporations great idea much better than your last suggestion
but that is not how stock works irlyou would need to have a board of directors that would vote on the stock dividends paid outi agree stocks should be tradable on a stock market as well as having quarterly or monthly dividend paymentsit would also allow corps to do takeoversadding stock cannot dilute the value of current stock without increasing the value of the company to compensate
my biggest gripe with high sec war is station games where your target is more or less invulnerable my experience with war has been having war declared on me and the war targets afk in stations all day and dont undock wasting my time or when they do it is only to tease us before they dock up again they only undock and attack mission runners and miners who dont listen and they have no chance of taking losses this makes war stupidmy proposal is in a onesided war that is not mutual the aggressor cannot use stations in high sec they can use stations in low sec or null sec if they want a safe place in high sec they will need to build a pos if they want market access they will need to use alts or go to low sec  null sec clone jumping into high sec stations would be disallowed if a character is docked in high sec when a war becomes active they remain but once they undock they cannot dock back up for mutual wars these restrictions would not applyi think this would enhance high sec war by wasting the defenders time less and if the enemy uses posees give the defender real objectives to attack
war huh yeahwhat is it good forabsolutely nothinguhuh uhuhwar huh yeahwhat it is good forabsolutely nothingsay it again yallwar huh look outwhat is it good forabsolutely nothinglisten to me  aah
you should be happy theyre bothering to undock to attack your mission runners and miners they are thinning the herd
very unsupported although something should be done about station games not just in high sec low sec as well and npc 00 however banning from high sec stations is a bad idea as this just stops people war decking which is a bad ideamaking all stations spitters would work though as you need to have speed or tank if you want to survive otherwise the enemy can kill u as u turn around to dock

hi i have a suggestion for possible featureaddon to the noctisperhaps we could have an auto loot option that is only available via he noctis so when i activate a salvager on the noctis it will automatically place loot from the wreck in the noctis cargo holdthis can even be done via a skill or perhaps via a auto loot module fitted to the noctis regardslowkey
its hidden feature you can buy with aurum
do you also want to legalize botting or you just want to drive salvage value down
how does loot modules alloys ammo drive down salvage value exactlythat said im against this if only because it decreases the risks minimal as they may be especially in highsec associated with this activity without a matching decrease in the rewardsnot supported
a system by which the community can bankroll desired featuresalong the lines ofthe csm and developers produce a list of featuresenhancements desired by the community and assign a aur cost to themevery feature has a expiry dateplayers can then pledge aur toward developing that featureifwhen a feature reaches its required funding prior to its expiry date ccp commits to implementing that feature details on implementation time scales should be part of the features informationtokens would be used to rereimburse players aur if a specific feature expired prior to it reaching full fundingas a item of polish its possible that you could implement pledge tokens as a way of tracking players  these could be in the form of vanity items  tshirt all i wanted was ship paint jobs  all i got was this stupid tshirtas the feature list is compiled by the csm and developers in concert it can be community driven while still allowing ccp to maintain control over it the developers can always say noas ccp follows the scrum development methodology its possible that features would require several rounds of funding or to be broken down into distinct chunks for multilayered featuresit gives players the chance to push for things they want in possibly the most persuasive manner  with money and to ensure that that money is going into your game in a manner of your choicefinally as a side benefit ccp can run its occasional charity drives through the system
lol its only a game people are getting way too upset over these mt and nex issuesif the game upsets youfind a new game if you dont like any other gamesstart playing golf or take up fishngif you dont like golf or fishing go back to playing eve its not the end o the world we started off paying a subscriptiom fee but if we are happy enough to start using ingame currency to pay for game time we cant be hypocrites and shout about evil mts ruining the essence of the game

i would sign it if the csm special meeting wasnt being held yes i know you mentioned theyre under nda so they cant report back about the outcome i still say that makes this motion premature though basically youre asking for a vote of nonconfidence whilst negotiations are already planned for this week i too do not have all that much hope for a good ending but formally i think we need to wait at least until we hear back from the csmnot supported for now
so i take it you mean ship spinning other than spinning the model in the ship fitting window or just watching as either of the holograms spin or as the actual ship itself spins as all three do spin albeit at a relatively slow rate dependent on the sizeagilitypersonally i actually avoided ship spinning as i have odd ocd tendencies that developed in relation to the ship orientation but i do agree those who did enjoy it or at least use it as a distraction should be allowed to do it again in a better form than the ship fitting window if it is inadequate
alejan basically yes i mean either a click to go back to the old docked view of your ship or a new view say 1st person as though you were sitting on the couch and the hologram becomes fully rendered so you could manipulate it rotate on all axis and zoom in and out as fully as beforestrangely for an awful lot of us it was a rather addictive way to burn time when waiting on a fleet up for a mission or a war fleet or waiting on a corpmate who was fitting a ship or getting a mission or you just wanted to be ingame w your mates but didnt actually feel like doing anything in particular for some unfathomable reason it simply never got boringwhats even far worse now is the static view you get if you esc  and disable load station environment you get just a really crappy pic of the locked door that is supposed to lead out to the fantastically rich interactive environment of read thatonedaywillbe walking in stations bah humbug its actually a huge let downi have even accidentally undocked in the wrong ship cause in order to even know what ship you are in you have to open the fitting window what crapseriously ccp can do better
first idea is very good and has a practical use second one not sure how practical it would be maybe if it could run videos from your own hard drive although that could have compatibility problems with different video formats but its been done with the jukebox so maybe  new ship spinning would look cool depending how much development time it would take bathroom i dare not ask what you where thinking at the time of posting that bit 
actually you dont need to open the fitting window to know what ship you are in i always have the ship hangar normally titled just ships window open virtually permanently when im docked in a station and in that window the active ship is surrounded in a hollow greyish box if i wasnt at work id take a screenshot and post itits not much but thats what ive relied on to tell me what ship i am currently in even before incarna i sometimes referenced that window sometimes my views instation can get that clutteredas for your suggested approach to bringing it back i actually wonder about all the tidbits weve been hearing suggesting good news relating to ship spinning if perhaps that might be one of the things ccp mentioned to them edit that is the method you suggested being one that ccp may well have mentioned to csm but well probably not know for months
this is worth consideration
some good stuff to this seems like a 1000 cuts thing so probably should be added to that but i do agree it makes sense
dear csmhere is a list of concerns i have with the current state of eve that i would like brought up at the csm meeting 1 money pit i see warning signs that the game will in the future require me to pay more than my subscription fee i loyally pay every month this is concerning i dont have a problem with vanity items its the concern that those items could grow into things you need over time people want assurance on not having to pay more than a subscription just to play2 csm involvementthe csm should be directly involved with anything passing into the game they are entrusted to the player community as a system to ensure eve does not degrade in quality or experience i would like assurance that things will always pass through the hands of the csm before being implemented 3 speculation over buying standingsif standings are going to be for sale players are completely bypassing the pve portion of the grind that for everyone else was rite of passage its time consuming to grind standings and its a rewarding process but to offer a shortcut there is just wrong the player also gets robbed of the experience4 noble exchange breaks the systema major concern and complaint about the noble exchange is that it breaks the system in several waysproblem first items are offered instead of blueprints this cuts industrialists out of the process and because the noble exchange is in every station it would mean you could abuse that to bypass logistics with any nonvanity nonbpc item solution have the nex offer bpcs then indies have to make the item from textiles or some existing in game resource to tie it in to the economy5 golden ammogolden scorpiona lot of mixed meanings and speculations surround this topic this has the potential to upset game balance if things are offered in their final form situation a major alliance needs ships but they are pinned down in a corner of null they buy the completed ships or ammunition from the noble exchange thereby cutting out the miners needed to get the resources and more importantly in this casethe logistics of getting materials out to their corner of the galaxy it also introduces more materials into the game without removing them from elsewheresolution again bpcs in the nex would solve these issues and include industrialists and haulers in the process6 clothing pricesthe clothing prices dont seem to have any anchor to reality the one that shows up in your avatar picture is of course 45 times the cost of all the rest people dont want designer clothes but they would certainly pay for cheap characterdefining clothing or items that enhanced role play even if the monocle had simply been an eye patch it would have been more acceptedsolution forget highend clothes go for clothing that could promote a role play environment cheaplyexample i am role playing a sansha am i going to spend 15 bil on something that makes me look more like a zombie or 100 mil for a fitted phantasm 7 highend designer clothing versus cheap customizationwhy not offer customization for cheap than designer fluff for a lot people would paint their ships and add articles to their avatars if they seemed more like normal items or roleplay enhancements customization  awesome designer jeans  laughableexamples eye patches pax amarria cigarettes ship paintdesignssuperficial customizationthe players have been crying to paint their ships for some time some people really prefer the old khanid clothing there is a huge market for it but its broken in the current statesolution offer cheap clothing and more of it focusing on things that will promote roleplay and community within eve you can probably move enough cheap articles to make up for the difference in the designer clothing
8 the uproar over aurumaurum was supposed to be granular plex almost everything costs more than a plex so when does the granular part come in the way it is geared just looks bad as if people are supposed to cough up 70 for a vanity item in this instance a vanity item for your avatar that costs more than a tangible item from the gift shop that is what scares people it looks terribly ominous from a player perspectivesolution have aurum be some type of credit for the eve online gift shop people would throw down isk to buy plex for aurum if they got something tangible from it like a raven statuemouse pad is worn out but i have enough isk for a new one9 losses in functionality with incarnaproblem losing the old hangar view makes it impossible toview your active ship easilyclick the hangar to open cargodrag a ship into the hangar to board itit also takes longer to load and makes it so the players cannot spin their ships which had become a mutual yet laughable pastime that many of us miss solution offer the classic hangar view as an option10 more expansions  more broken stuffa large gripe among players is that with each expansion the game seems to work worse than it did previously it gets better over time but there are still longstanding bugs and broken mechanics in the game that simply havent been addressedhow is it they are making clothes before refining systems that need attentionexample 1 ship maintenance arrays make it very difficult to secure ships the security options are scant and they are hard to manipulate they are pretty easy to steal fromexample 2 highsec wars are a joke it all comes down to who can abuse the aggression station and gate mechanics the bestexample 3 to drive the last point home highsec war mechanics make it far too easy for neutral alt fleets to remote repair your war targets with little or no repercussionexample 4 someone just jumped a titan into rens nuff saidsolution revise the current mechanics to promote more fairness and less outandout exploitation of poorly working mechanics neither war target can dock for 3 minutes etc if possible dedicate less people to new development and more people towards debugging and tuning the current environment to perfection starting with core systemsin conclusion the players need confidence that the checks and balances that set the environment and economy of eve stay intact and that the quality of the game does not decline its a gorgeous game but the immersion is broken when bugs and flaws make it look more like a toy than a virtual realityfly safe liaro
this is something that needed to be said something others have tried to say but were unable to through their caps lock and utter hatedoomed speechesreally i believe ccp is trying to cater towards younger kids who can abuse their parents wallet for shiny thingsface it ccp the newer players your trying to keep around are transient they always will be your income comes from a solid core of devoted and opinionated players who keep the games economy running internally these players are the ones who will choose which players end up staying and which end up going no amount of content or shiny new things are going to make players stay that the older players want gone so you may as well keep the older players happy and in turn they will teach the newer players the way the world works and many will leave and be replaced while others join your ranks of devoted players tldr older players are whos opinions on the direction of the agme should matter quit trying to the noobies if they truly which to stick around instead of being transient they will saty no need to try and attract all these kids older players drive the economy and make it possible for the enwer players to even get out of highsec without being slaughtered by ratswork on the broken stuff to make the older players happy and they in turn will stick aorund and teach more noobies to not be newbsin the end everyone would be happy and your profit would increase no nonvanity mt or shiny halfthoughtout projects neededreally my fear is taht it becomes like a certain other space mmo taht everytime they talk about an expansion or fixing a bug it keeps getting moved back because devs got too into the mt and clothesvanity items and mtonly pvp gear taht only coiners got to pvp and everything besides their version of carebears left then the carebears left the road ccp is heading down has been traveled many times before and always ends in heartbreak andor bankruptcy for the company or at least their gaming division
i think you need to slow down with your typing and be more accurate with key press order but grammar national socialist interrogation aside you help solidify the point we veterans are the ones that keep them afloat the dedicated members of the community are the most valuable resource this game has and they cant just sweep us aside without feeling the impact just reinforce the strengths of the game and ignore the rest for the time being
one of my problems with aurum is that it seems to be a currency that just came out of nowhere and quite frankly it seems like something that a capsuleer from an inuniverse perspective would look at and think this stuff is virtually worthless the stuff it buys is exorbitantly expensive for what they are again its never been mentioned in the lore so where the hell does it come from i suppose in a way it should turn into something like lp in some respects just something thats accepted only it buys purely vanity items but it does seem a bit odd all the samethis is a dealbreaker for many not me so much since ive adapted to using the hotkeys to open my cargo bay and referencing the fitting window which technically has shipspinning functionalty and if one really wants to they can put a preview of their current ship behind all their windows but this would be a pain in the arse when the functionality was already there before incarna or the ship holograms in the cq for the various elements mentioned edit oh and i always have my ship hangar window open and if i dont have any of the other things visible i can always glance at that and see which of my ships has a whiteoffwhite box around it but still i get what you mean there is however no reason not to let us drag the ship item icons into the cq environ to assign that ship as the active as was the way of things however being able to quickly dockundock while still having the cq available if i so wished would be greatly appreciated

so because im new im a kid i wish it was true if only playing a game could knock a few decades off d id love it best thing since nip n tuck pps i do appreciate the veterans by the way they play so well it looks like magic to me sapph
once an account has been permanently banned their assets are frozen in place forever faction ships bpos t2 modules and plenty more are wasted time and materialsproposalwhy not auction them off using npc players this would accomplish 2 things first it would put these hard earned items back on the market secondly and most importantly it could be a fairly large isk sink imagine an auction for a nightmare going for 550 mil and all that isk disappears from the market
i would like to be able to type 10m into a market order then hit the space key and it will automatically type 10000000 for me it would save some timeditto with knot ditto with b thats a bad typo waiting to happen
heres some feeback after having spent some time playing with incarnaturret icons dont have enough contrast or differentiation its really hard to tell what means what with the new icons the turrets themselves look good thoughwalking around should use the industry standard wasd keys right now its setup more for a console controller which is fine for dust but difficult for evethere should be a shortcuts menu accessible from whereever your avatar is in the closet that has the basic ship options such as ship cargothe lighting and shadows in cq should be changed to provide better contrast for the things in cq or the lighting should be dynamic and allow the player to choose the lighting levelyou should have the ability to zoom in to a first person view point on your avatar vs only being able to choose over which shoulder youre looking over for your pov
once you give your money to ccp its not your money any more its their money you paid it in exchange for a service as long as ccp supplies the service you paid for they can do what ever the hell they want with their money after thatwhile it is also in ccps best interest to invest money directly back in to eve to improve the product and attract new subscriptions that is not the only good choice on how to move forward development of wod and dusk will give back 10 fold to eve on the investment in time and technology not to mention diversify the skill set at ccp the whole purpose of the new carbon engine is to allow advances made in one game to improve others built on the same technology if you honestly cant see the benefits of this long term then you are very short sighted indeed
that is why its a proposal you know suggestion
i do recall seeing someone making the strong case that unreleased projects should rely on investments and such intended for it just like any new venture and certainly even from white wolf profitsalso i agree heavily with the point that eve is a unique sandbox the perceived directionmindset that the internal reports generally imply would undoubtedly deconstruct that sandbox which makes the game unique and lets face it its the only selling point for this game the gameplay is arguably dull and lethargic the community and the sandbox nature are what make this game worth playing if the sandbox is destroyed by said perceived directionmindset theres no reason for anyone to play eve it would be the death of eve and subsequently ccp since they have no other project ready to support them they would be committing seppukuthis is what needs to be impressed upon ccp by the csm that theyd be killing themselves if this is indeed the direction they plan to take the game is just too handsoff in gameplay and theres no way to fix that fast enough to pull in a different community to keep this game going
geez last time i checked ccp was a company with the goal to make money for shareholders not a community service you dont like it leave i suggest ccp sells itself the mess the company made out of incarna shows that they are over their heads with the product design and implementation ccp dont seem to have capacity to do both develop new content and fix bugs sell the corp to sony now who owns the access to dust anyway sony can handle the boring stuff microtransactions barbie  ken environments and it frees ccp staff to come up with awesome content
and you think these people havent already canceled their subscriptions they have time on their accounts though because cancelling subscriptions doesnt mean your account ends that very moment time was paid for and theres no automatic refund system nor would anyone expect there to be they will continue to try and clarify to ccp that they are on the way to destruction up until their current subscription time expiresccp selling to someone would probably not be too bad so long as they arent going to muck around with them poorly like activision with infinity wardccp has often said they hold their community in such high esteem players are just insisting they actually back that claim up
i can understand where youre coming from and appreciate your efforts to do something positive however i cant help thinking that ccp wont even finish reading your post before moving onto the next thread if they do even read threads in herethey have their goals their priorities and then a budget which would be under review now given unpredictability of current circumstances that takes these factors into account their decisions are made by a body of professionals and i doubt theyd even contemplate even considering such ideas from just a player
like all plans if everything goes well its fine however the concern is that it may go wrong wod  dust and that it is draining too much resources from eve the proposal was aimed at making sure new stuff being developed has a scale proportional to what ccp can realistically do without hampering eve and by introducing a quantitative measure they can control it with a metric based on investment  which is what mattersi want ccp to make a gazillion euros every day but feel like revenues from investments in eve are more solid and generate steady growth and profit while investments in other venues may not lead to commercial success and are risky especially if you take on 2 other projects at the same time no problem with risk but how much you gamble is a decision that involves a tradeoff between investing on your present assets that give you solid growth and investing on future assets that may be worth little by putting everything on the same bag eve has to pay for everything and also shares all the risk i know game companies do this left and right but not with sandboxes  for them its scripted gameplay where players repeat routines endlessly while being milked so it kinda makes sense after a while to go build new scripts on some new game eve is not like thatone of the problems this could also address is lateral development ccp seems a bit like companies that are very good at engineeringscience but are terrible at making consumer oriented products even when eve gets awesome new additions that have potential ccp seems to go like potential is there we implemented it we proved we can do this cba to fine tunepolish it lets move to some other awesome idea supercaps sov changes fw incursion cosmos epic story arcs all of these have tons of room for improvement ccp does the first part putting it there engineering it but then they dont fine tune further to make it really awesome all of these things could have a bunch of developers iterating and advancing each feature further thats what focused development in a sandbox should be as opposed to lateral development always targeting new things new additions new great ideas that are great but leaving a trail of unfinished things behindand i am not talking papercuts perhaps sandbox development favors this approach since development can do the first mile and leave the bricks for the players to build stuff with but there is a difference between giving players tools and leaving them with unfinished stuff ccp listens to player proposalsthey also seem very stubborn thoughi dont think well ever realistically get 80 but when you start something its better to ask for too much than to settle for less and perhaps if we build some traction we can get all those professional people to think about it a bit
although i would like ccp to focus more on eve for obvious reasons this idea is completely fail and would not workccp commits to 80 reinvestment policy of all revenues from eve subscriptions to be put back into developing eveso what happens if the operating costs of eve such as the servers internet connection etc amount to greater than 20 of revenues how would you allocate shared development expenses between multiple games this policy will be audited by the csm  community by reviewing annual company reportsyeah because the csm and players are all financial experts and this is a publicly traded company oh wait ccp is free to develop other gaming projectswhatever and can use its track record and reputation from eve to secure external financing according to investor interest and required commercial viability assessmentslol

tldr faction and t2 moved from a static cook this t1 item to get a t2 item to assemble your t1 item add this and get a faction deadspace or t2 itemtech 2 we all love it but what if we could streamline its development with the advent of rig  and now t3 subsystems why couldnt we just have a more modular system loadout upgrades  deployment packagethese are superrigs very much like what you would see on t3 it modifies the ship to the appropriate corporation or faction and meta level they are a secure container with all the modifications and resources inside think station egg but a rig for ships and possibly modulesunlinking tech  meta and parent faction from traditional hulls has some interesting side effects for instance faction loadouts such as a navy raven could be any meta level people have asking for tech 2 faction for a while this could be one way to do iti imagine 3 groups of modifiershouse tentative namerolemeta  tech levelthis can go 2 waysinstalling a house loadout attaches an affiliation to the item such as a faction or npc corp this also changes stats to fit the meta level adding a caldari navy house loadout to a raven basically makes it a cnr the role modifier gives the ship a role such as hac or logistics ship adding a logi role to a sythe without a t2 meta modifier would result in a meta 1 logistics ship they all show up in the fitting window on ships and have a naming convention similar to hardwirings one could combine meta and house though to make it easier side note along with these one could probably have a inexpensive set of slots on ships that changes the flair of the ship such as logo and paint jobplan b because plan b is usually the better plan anyway is put all this into one one package and have the player right click and apply loadout this does the same but with less flexibility and more ease of useeither way both are destroyed if it is repackaged the bps require the same materials as upgrading it now with out the original item and because of balance i would imagine there would be restrictions on what can be applied wherei dont particularly know what to do with bpo owners i would assume they would keep their bpos and continue making the same itemsthis adds a bit of depth to the game for pvp ships all retain their t1 name and would have to be scanned or visually identified to know what loadout is applied
hopefully this thread helped with the csm in there talk with ccp
hey everyonewith one of the last patchesupdates there came a change that made me really happy after the stacking operation all items are automatically sorted by the last used sorting method its little things like these that make eve a better experiencebut from my point of view there is one important step missingi always find myself repackaging the items fist before they are stacked and sortedunpackaged items serve no use imho they take up more space and cannot be stacked how little sense there really is in having unpackaged items can be seen in the fact that modules cannot manually be assembled the only way to do that is by fitting them into a ship in fact i dont even get why i have to confirm the repackaging as if it is something badso i propose the following automatic repackaging of all items that do not have the assemble option in the rightclick menu when the stack all items command is executeddamaged items are not being repackaged but instead the normal message is displayed that not all items were repackaged repaired items are repackaged with the next stack command after repairit would improve the clickorgy that eve still isand as i accidentally trashed 5m in t2 drones a couple of days ago it would prevent players from having to click so dangerously close to the trash it optionmaybe im missing something here im not omniscient in this case please educate methank you for your attention
so theres super awesome meeting gonna happen thats suppose to juice up my sphincterits the dog that stopped the war hurrahno sticky here not seein hey guys live it to gonna eat shrimphug it out work on thisthatthe lil changes ppl ing love them so far always liked ccp until nowbut csm cant make ing sticky about upcoming trip or apprise us of issues they as players are gonna bringtake opportunity to bring upnda nda nda nda nda nda s the pointjust a sticky gonna represent or gonna get ed up while spouted youall i want to know is if i should set long skills until stuff done or cancel while new games that i know  about get their jolliesshould i scale back to 1 account if yrs of training still dont matter all the complaints from 03 and post t2i dont care about mts now i give a  that only 1 csm has ever taken hard stand and he was an alternatei give a  that all the responses ive read for yrs is mainly oh ya we hear you get right on it im only getting ing olderi give a  that resources for things that require testing development are going to another game a game that for  all has nothing to do w my subscription to eveif csmccp had read ppl pleaded long ago that if they were paid isk to go on sq theyd gowhy the  would i spend the time to find out about some super ass awesome fit that i cant find or afford on test server or even testing a fit i get the  on tq and try and then get back to rl and work just call it the fit server or the omg they gimme skills to so own you w this super but never gonna fly dream serveri wouldnt even be playing this game despite its awesomeness if were not for the ppl who developed extra stuff to make eve easier to understandor even something from the csm that said the old saying fly only what you can afford to losewere fighting for you to fly what you can carry  load of fun in
id never agree to nonvanity items mt even when they can be earned ingame too because the ppl who can buy them for cash would probably still be at an advantage easierquicker access to goods 100 availability no need to earn isk first but i agree that any kind of competition on the market between players working for goods and players paying cash for goods would help to control prices i would still be slightly worried though about the amount of cash ppl are willing to pay for a little bit of isk vs the amount of work ingame ppl are willing to do for a certain item if the cash ppl would accept lower exchange rates sell for lower isk prices than the ingame ppl are willing to work for cash traders would still dominate the market so yeah there would be natural market saturation like there was with plex but because of the much bigger market and the greatly increased and renewed demand it would still facilitate a lot more cashisk trading than we were used toit also wouldnt solve the problem with things appearing out of thin air thats why i thought up the plan in the the cashisk market and vanity items mt  player market in control thread its the only thing i can think of atm that would solve most of those issues
agreed in full

hm cant say as im likely to do that it all balances on the value of a plex anyway right so you circumvent the plex market with purchase and direct translation to aurum and the plex market doesnt get fed this results in plex demand remaining high so the value stays up and aurum purchases mean less as they translate to less isk returned than plex market value would give youyou dont really think people are going to burn cash on aurum do you or that players are going to burn isk on clothing when they could just buy a plex for isk and translate itedit 1 for making me think i havent had to do that for a couple days
my views on the nex store and related issues1 no implants modules ammo etc anything that will directly impact pvp the market or pve should not appear one exception i will mention last2 no convenience charges things like more fitting space as others have mentioned3 any ship skinsmodels regardless of how implemented should always require as materials or payment the same ship that is given out as a skin such skinnedremodeled ships should differ from the original ship only in appearancepaint job and contain the exact same stats as the original ship4 clothes are a vanity item if something is expensive then its expensive these are nothing more than vanity items if ccp wants to make it so only the richeither  or isk rich can buy them so be it not having a vanity eye implant monocle is not going to affect gameplay for you5 plex prices have changed over the years 30 days used to be 150m now they are 300m if they increase in the future due to the nex store that is simply something players need to adapt to as they have done already in the past please remember before you complain that you are playing for free with the only cost of your account being that you have to play the game it should also be noted that it has become easier to earn isk as the years go by6 this is the one exception to my first point that i would be accepting towards many will disagree with this and thats fine with me its always good to see differing opinions however i do not plan to argue about it simply giving my thoughts as i hope we can all do without an argument if you comment on this point and want a reply from me say so so getting to the point allowing something such as the cerebral accelerator or similar type item that only speeds up training time5 faster 20 etc for a limited time and has a restricted reuse time just as we current have with attribute remaps would be something i wouldnt mind seeing such an item would allow new players to get into some game play sooner without instantly granting them access to the higher sp game play such as stealth bombers as mentioned earlier in this thread it would also give current players a chance to catch up a little bit to the older veterans since as we know sp is the one thing an older player subscription time wise will always have an advantage in regardless of how much effort a newer player puts into the game with a limited reuse timefew months full year etc and a duration time1 month etc this item would not be able to be abused like pure aur for batch sp would be which i am completely against by the way also something to note both plex spenders and isk users have the capability of using the nex store so this would not help only those willing to spend cash tldr i like the idea of a limited reuse time sp accelerator but am completely against a straight upinstant sp batch
i will biomass my toons if the nex persists like it is todayhell i wont pay ccp to design outoftheair itemsshops where they can trick dumbasses to pay rl money for random bits and bytes completely outofsync with game mechanics and game lore not while theres so much inconsistencies in the existing contentits a game ffs the main thing about games is the play aspect ccp sells game time cards thats their business they should be doing game design and game developmentbtw im fine if they restrict the access to specific parts of the game via mt but thats a different thing
hehe thanks but yeah i think that when the aur store selection gets larger and when isk prices for vanity items become reasonable a whole lotta ppl will buy vanity items for isk itll be a whole new market with a lot more renewed demand and a lot more opportunities to make a profit compared to the old the plex market which wouldve become saturated much quicker ive been discussing this a bit more with rc denton in the wheres the line for mt thread last few posts on the first pagea quick summary
ok first of all gallente are all weird minmatar like to look scary caldari are just eh and amarr im sure you could find a reason for them toonow if we can be in new eden where they have the ability to clone a capsuleer near unlimited times without severe genetic degredation why cant we manipulate the dnalike plastic surgery but genetic some people want bloodlinerace change for iskaurplex whatever but what about adding genetic variations like the minmatar who like to look all fierce give them some wolf fangs or something i mean poeple in real life go out of their way to add prosthetics into their look to make themselves more scary in a world like eve with such great science why not do the same thing but realtldr if they allow bloodlinerace changes i want to be able to give my minmatar alt wolf fangs and my gallente alt something to look whatever could be considered a weird hybrid look for gallentefeel free to scream no and theres more important things personally i agree and think taht before current content is fixed everything else should be on the backburner but long term i think this could be funand no one go calling me a f since im not talking taht extreme just some fangs or whatnot make the facial features a little wolfy like wolvering or something just for aesthetic appeal and not mandatory either just optional
yeah i was a little ignorant of the details and i thank you for that but that is going to be another one of ccps mistakesor did microsoft want complete control if so then i can understand ccps reaction
oh and correct me if im wrong but wouldnt sony try anything to help its sales right now and is ccp aware of just how insecure psn is if they dont try to resolve that problem then this is just going to blow up in their faces im mostly unaware of the specifics but if you can clarify this i would greatly appreciate it
yes ms wouldve hosted the game on xbl would not have allowed integration to eve and i believe wanted payforupgrades limited to something in the 60 or 100 mb range over the life of the productall things that would have been badtm for dust the way ccp envisions it
what i noticed is that they seem to have clammed up after the emergency call for the csm meeting im a bit worried about that to be honest
obviously youre not reading their blogs reading fhc or watching twitter they have done the exact opposite of clamming up
i do follow themseleene hasnt updated his blog since the call and has only had 4 tweets since then compared to a much higher volume in the days before the callpretty much the same for all of them
i agree with the op myself on the first point especially we do need a ui and ive been having the idea of actually just dumping the current 1999 style uifor a more modernish aproach and one we seem to be seeing in ccps false advertising clipsbut ofcourse with difference so called mode buttons one button for each mode showing relevant info and nothing else not related to that specific modefor instance a button saying combat mode it would change out the whole ui info and move it off to the bottoms and sides so you can actually see the targets and all while on the sides we get our normal locking list we currently have on one side and maybe something else related to drones on the other sidewhile on the lower side of the screen a few bars or just something similar would show up with shields armor hull and capand then in industry mode it would show more to the middle and atached to the ship on the sides of it the whole market and on the leftright side atached to the ship info related to the item selected in the marketofcourse this idea of mine is just up for improvement aswellgreets jessyps excuse my bad spelling and punctuation have been awake a long while while writing this post
1 to opccp lets see a separation of docking and cq let the cq be something the pilots choose to enterbring back the spinning 
it serves as a tech demo but with absolutely no content right now im very supportive of things that move us away from spreadsheets online and incarna is a much better new player experience than what existed before but its hard to get excited until you can actually do fun things with it
someone form csm said mondayso were are the csm may meetings more than 1 month as gone by
i want to make the request that the minutes from the meeting are indeed provided off course i can only speak for myself but for me a statement and clarifications are not enough i would like to see this as a transparent processthanks for considering my statement
why in the world would this even be a questiontrust is in short supply right now in eve the players want to know what is happening and why and i am at a complete loss in attempting to understand why the csm would not push for as many answers and as much transparency as possiblethe csm cannot force ccp to do anything it doesnt want to do but the csm can and should aggressively represent player interests and then provide detailed minutes so that players can make up their own minds about whats going on and the future direction of eve online keeping the meetings secret will only serve to further agitate an already upset playerbase
they are and they will be released as soon as we agree that they correctly portray the stance each participant had
the reason why tweeter sucks as a form of information distribution
in the assmbly hall there was made a topic about ships and what was broken to that there also was a voting topic about what was needed fixed the most i remember some issues came up pretty high until now nothing happend to it has it become a dead horse evently if u keep pushing this forward it is not going anywere
dont get ed off at ccp or better yet do if you feel like it just dont react foolishly if you dont like what ccp is doing just boycott the new market system and the new currency
have you even glanced at the 400 page threadnarok that ccp started i think that there is something like 4 ccp posts total in that that was supposed to be the resolve it with common sense thread which turned into deafening silence from ccpthe protest in jita was initially to get more people who normally ignore this part of the game informed about the entire mess and then well someone found out that you can shoot the statue without getting concordokken this protest has in my estimation done more than the mass unsubs and the request for parley from ccp pann that  well wasnt rl emergency or some such for pann the protest has been featured by nearly every gaming news site out there  bad pr for ccp  oh  guys what do we do now from ccpsoon as the csm summit is over and the people who have been protesting get the information we all want to hear then itll go back to normal in the time being sell hyperinflated ammo
one did but you didnt miss muchwas tweeting between lubing his backside

some nice ideas here 
very funny however the fool here is you not sure youve noticed that our bodies arent original
no were clones but you have to realize taht dna is dna and screwing with that realistically gives the chance of leaving you a pile of goo or a girl with bunny ears depending on the mood of the facility technitianbut seriously a clone is a clone if you change a clone its not a clone its a brand spanking new person and im not sure how eve lorefluff deals with the whole can a capsuleers brain copy thing be implanted into a different bodynow that i mention it if they allow this why not add the ability to bribe nullsec cloning facility technitians to let you modify the clone they have their sp saved in would be lulzy and make just as much since as altering a clone to be a different bloodline imoedit were assuming 1 capsuleers are filthy stinking rich comapred to the average new eden citizen correct and 2 cloning technology and genetic manipulation has advanced to the point where capsuleer cybernetics and nearperfect cloning is actually considered convenient and ordinary right why not have some extreme genetic manipulation for some of the wealthier more eccentric capsuleers i mean to go along with being able to change bloodline if taht can be supported by lore then why not something weirdin other words i would accept this so long as 2 things occur they allow weirder things when your remaking your character perhaps animal characteristics especially wolf characteristics for something like the minmatar just to look like a badass frakkin hunter and 2 they found a way to do this without alot of people changing bloodlines in a corp taht the corp leader does not have the skill for alowing other bloodlines in corp
