supporting for an old friend plus i agree with iteves just like that  im subbed just because the game has got progressively worse over the last 6yrs ive been playing imoand my friend agrees he stopped playing 2 years ago but still has his account active to train just because hes got faith that eve online  a bad game will one day be rectified
supported new features are nice sometimes but bug free old polished features are what causes me to stick around for yearsfun fact ive paid more for eve than any other video game ive ever bought multiple accounts for several years totalling over 1000 thats quite a bit of money for one single video game
the more they overthink the plumbing the easier it is to stop up the drain james doohan  star trek the search for spockfix the damn plumbing
me tooeveryone seems to agree this issue is structural and serious  well everyone except ccp
just making it possible to drop not just multiple outposts per system but even multiple outposts per planet as long as theyre at least 100km apart edge from edge would be more than enough no need to buff the number of industrial lines available per player outpostthe material adjustment would not really be needed since you always have hauler drops and if thats not enough lowend prices will eventually just go up to compensate in fact this will create an imbalance in mineral pricing between 00 and highsec highsec with expensive highends and cheap lowends while the reverse would be true in 00having personal arrays gives a much to small entry barrier which means just about any outpost will do fine and you want a certain degree of concerted effort to be made for a healthy market to emerge not just about any outpost out therean initial investment the magnitude of an extra outpost or several extra outposts will make the owning alliance want to promote the area as their own regional hub and also make it a more attractive capture objective by competitorsobviously the system capture mechanics would need to be altered to not include outposts or only include any one outpost as opposed to all of them because otherwise you could just outpostspam however expensive for some alliances it could actually be practical
you do realize that in the two years that ive been playing i have found more people who do highsec industry that agree that it is barely profitable even with the refining at stations ive also experimented with it personally and found that unless you have a lot of people doing something for nothing for a corp aquiring the minerals and building anything is time consuming and very nearly a waste of time actually it is a waste of time and it amazes me that people still do ityou can put a buy order out for anykind of mineral and spreadsheet everything to cost calculation vs potential sale value of product and work in a profit margin between the two first problem is that someone actually has to fill your order which given the competition is not as easy as you might think competing for those minerals only drives the profit down lower and you end up with a barely profitable venture that takes two to threee times longer to complete than it should have second problem is actually getting it to market and profiting from it as it could take months to sell and you have to compete with sell orders to get the product sold and still make a profitif you factor in the time to do all this with micromanaging transport and manufacturing times you come to the conclusion that it is entirely pointless and a complete waste of time yes im factoring in high mepe bpos herenerf it anymore and you wont have anything to buy not from me anyway though i suppose i cant account for people who apparently have their whole lives to waste and think its fun even when they lose isk that and increasing demand may actually drive the prices up which may help a bit until everyone runs out of iskwhy dont we just focus on nullsec and boosting production capabilites for pos and by other meansthat may even help highsec production though it may also drive it into the ground when all you madhappypvpers stop buying ship in jita and demand drops through the floor then well just have a whole lot of worthless ships in jita that cost a whole bundle of time and effort to create along with modules and whatnot of the tech ii varietyshocking isnt iti do believe nullsec industry should see a big boost though along with wormholes the first step to that is production capability refining in a pos is stupid manufacturing and research in a pos are awkward to manage with pgcpu and defense concerns a large pos is the only way to go if youve half a mind to do it and it costs you rediculous sums of isktime to maintain it how can that work out to a profit or even be worthwhile unless you make more use of it than thati remember once spending two weeks mining on a nearly daily basis for hours at a time just to build a maelstrom that was with the help of some corp mates using a couple hulks a retriever or two and an orca with fleet bonuses two weeks maybe thats realistic in the grand scheme of things or maybe its not either way ill never do it again in a game no matter which that is a complete waste of time as i believe was agreed to by everyone in corp after this is why people use macros because it reduces personal effort and makes the venture somewhat more easily rationalized possibly much more easily rationalizedill never for this reason believe anyone who goes on about how they went on this awesome mining op with their corp and how they mined continuously for hours and repeated this process everyday it was so fun and they talked about all sorts of things from posts in the assembly hall to what their dogs ate for lunch it was greatyeah right maybe once for a few hours or even a few times here and there but not when you look at the result and not after days or months

wow ive looked at this thread fifteen times and couldnt care less about some note on my character sheet regarding birth date or some suchim going to support it anywaywhyactually despite my seeming lack of concern some small voice deep inside of me says its neccessary along with changing the year to something fictional as is good and proper
this has bugged me for a while since my third birthday is coming up
thanks for your support so far  lets try and bring this to the csms attention
supportedmost of all armor rep bonus must be changed
nice to see everybody and their alt supported thisfleet ops im thinking no maybe not dont really like the ideaisnt draketrain a corp that flies all drakes in a massive blob formation totally off topic but i had to get that in therecsm was nice enough to put up a thread regarding ship fixes and improvements mostly theyd like to know what everybody thinks sucks about ships in eve so they can tell the devs and hopefully encourage a rebalance across the board you should check it outblack ops have been kicked to death already in a number of threads and everybody has a different idea how to fix them mostly that results from some notion that theyve come up with a cool tactic that would only work if you had a ship with all the features requested great wonderful ideanow lets move on ccp is not going to be able to apply a fix that suits everybody and is even less capable of doing so following the advice given herewhybecause nobody agrees on anything here everyone wants there own thing whether it be power hungry solo war machines or fleets required for even the simplest operation no matter what ship youre flying neither is a good ideasolo is good fleets are good and leadership skills are slightly overpowered in any case but only when up against the solo guy who is most certainly dead anywaywhatever happened to being able to run away you just cant do that anymorelive to fight another day nope not here this is eve
why not make it so that the pilot flying the black ops doesnt show up on local until he speaks in the channel have black ops deal a perfect wrecking hit the first time it decloaks and attacks on an unsuspecting enemy
i am not sure when exactly this changed but recently drone damage is now listed in the overview notifications just the same as everything else this certainly can be useful i am sure carrier and other dronefocused pilots must appreciate it but it should certainly be separable from turret damage and other notifications the turret notifications are very important as they give the indication as to how well you are hitting the other guy if the other guy is moving too quickly and i am barely hitting them it would help if i knew that in a somewhat timely manner now though if you have drones out and they are also attacking they drown out the more important turret notifications and you are flying in the dark i personally would rather know if my turrets are doing what they should not what my 5 light drones are up tothis can very easily be fixed by making the drone notifications a separate option in the menu gunners can then focus on what they want and drone boats can still have the option of keeping track of their little minionsany comments are welcome
ok ladies and gents here is my 2 isk worthill make this easy to understand as possibleill take a day out of my playing lifei dont bot scam or have heaps of skill points i do have a pvppve character in 00before the anomily nerflog in choose character check mail see if any ops are on that my limited skills comply with attenddont attend that op if no op go pvp pverat or mineconvo and talk to my like minded corp members and alliesgenerally have a good time if i make enough isk over a week or so maybe able to buy a ship to pvp in or replace a lost pvp ship have fun is my main aim and do as the game says risk  reward tis why im in 00 rightafter the anomily nerflog in choose character check mail she it 5 more corp members moved back to empire space because the nerf killed their income to the point where they could not staysee if any ops are on that my limited skills comply withoh thats right there is no one else to come along now that they have moved back to empire so there are no ops not that i could attend because i lost my pvp ships and cant afford to replace them limited skills  not much income anyway well lets do some pi check local damn you mean the 4 afkactive campers are still here 5 days later the nerf allowed them to concentrate where as before they were spread outnot that it mattered the corp has taken down all its poss so no fuel is needed another income down the spout ehso i rat then i jump 5 jumps through a wasteland that used to be full of other allied members to the next system worth ratting in again bow bow its camped by 5 afkactive cloakers what do i do today no one to talk to or convo bar the enemy and i dont speak their language stumped therewhat are my options 1get a bot to fund my pvp idk about you but i wont do it 2move back to high sec like the others is becoming an option to fund my pvp so less pvp fights more missions not really excited about that bah so i log off and go play another game becauseeve is loosing its fun factor for me i love to pvp but if i cant fund the shipsmy opinion is to unnerf the anomilies thus allowing less skilled players like myself to stay in 00 now im not knocking the afkactive cloakers id do it to now if i had the ships but in 00 you have to start somewhere and what the nerf has done is make it so much harder for the small corpguys like myself to make the ends meet how can they get their own piece of 00 if they cant fund their pvp losses its that simple
oh i can think of a few considerably worse  problem with setting the bar too low to cater to lowsp individuals such as yourself is that it benefits botting and heavy alt use while acting as molasses on conflict in general  grass has to be greener somewhere for the sheep to dare venture the great unknowndo not fly what you cannot afford to lose ring a bellall the nerf did was force people to run the numbers again and either downgrade ships or skip an op or two while gatheringfly afs interceptors and other cheap stuff until your skillsincome can support bigger if your corpalliance has a craptastic reimbursement system that doesnt help you help them then why the hell stay in the first place
especially when they actually work which is why u feel the desperate need to troll it but plz let it all out wed all like to hear it

apparently not very many people today remember that ccp created a game where griefers like themselves could play together in the sandbox this proposal actually undermines some of the very principles that run through eves bloodhaving weekend suicidegriefer alts is a timehonored tradition for many an industrialist as a way to blow off steamyou might also consider that there are five empires that compose concord and i really dont see the jovians giving the other four any say over their internal financial affairs even if the state were to permit the federation or the empire would give the republic any oversight of the private transactions of their citizensin practical mechanics as many have commented on in lore and in theory this proposal fails the sniff test
make it so people stop self destructing for sole purpose of robbing us of our kill mails a simple solution would be to make it so that self destruction results in not getting an insurance payout
sure im good with that bloody cowards should fight to the death anywayokay that was fun thanks
fine but then also make sd almost instantanious if you shoot someone usually the goal is to destroy his ship his ship is destroyed what exactly is the issue
ah the natural and inalienable right to kms
theyre also robbing you of any modules or cargo that happen to be on board their ship
this will allow you to  a few extra kms but itll have so many unintended side effects the irony is it wont even fix the problem
clearly the real solution is to remove killmails from the game
actually not paying insurance to ships that selfdestruct sounds normal to me theres not one insurance company that would pay me if id wreck my car by intentionally hitting a tree
not paying insurance to ships that self destruct is fine as long as it is put ingame at the same time as not getting insurance for suicide ganks where concord pops you the two go handinhand
buy order for useless item 1never buy useless items or things you dont have a clear idea of what they are or use unless you can build something fly or shoot with it dont buy it the stupid is overwhelmingpeople can also scam by manipulating market so that the value of a item appears higher and they have a buy order that has a minimum of 100000 for a really rare item no limits to the possibilitys exist on how to get scammedfor someone making a lucid story about how successful they are seems odd how you got anywhere in trading without margin trading the skill you want gone did you get the isk to trade by plex selling you will get scammed if dumb by any number of means as i said dont trade in useless items you will not use
can we please get t3 frigs everyone wants new stuff everyone asks for things like submarine warfare or dreadnought killing battleships instead of asking for one mega overpowered ship can we just have a line of ships that we can customize
i think that was the idea of t3s though unfortunately we all got aboard the failboat for that onewhy what happenedturns out only one configuration of each t3 is worth half a damn and the rest are crap go figure
lol on that one there are many different setups for each t3 ship just for tengu i have 3 working just fine for their purpose an they only cover buffer tanking for fleet fight there are quite a few setups for active tanking cant say much about other t3 as i dont fly themas for the idea itself of t3 frigs i think that t3 destroyers would be more interesting they could have setups for pure dps some for scouting covert maybe but we have that in both frigs and t3 and maybe even some for interdicting maybe bubbles that can hold even interdiction nullified t3anyway  more t3 stuff would be interesting
no if they scaled in comparison like t3 cruisers then theyll be grossly op as youll have something that hits hard hard to hit and probably come to the cost of a t2 fit tier 3 bs so it will essentially become the only ship to ever pvp anymore if anything i think they should have t3 rigs or modules that work something like implant sets that will give the ship overall boost in stats and boost them by percent with matching ones that or t3 bs an expensive bs that specializes in killing super carriers obviously not one t3 bs could take out a sc but have certain focused stats that would work great in large fleets but then again probably would be better off getting fleet of scs to counter the scs
not necessarily depends what the subsystems do if its a copypaste of the cruisers then yes but there are other options that might actually augment the frigate class rather than obsoleting itjumpers delight cyno frigate with 2x recon bonus and ability to jump itselffcs crutch ewar immune long lock range frigate with small sigfcs wheelchair deploy pos like shield bubble on battlefield depletion of which means death of frigateetctankspank is more than covered by afs and pirate frigs so a t3 should tap some of the unused potential
at least two thirds of the existing frigate range is terrible worthless junk they all need fixing before any more additions are made to the frigate range let alone massively customisable additions using the t3 template that inevitably result in hilariously overpowered death machines
so mining piratingor pvp salvaging and industry are good sources of steady income if you just want to grind away at it what is missing is for haulers to have the same kind of steady streamyes there are courier contracts now and that has made it a lot better than before but the problem is that anything worth contracting is valuable and with it comes collateral that are just too expensive for beginner players to afford or the cargo space too large for beginner shipswhat that results in is that there is no real pure way for a beginner hauler to make money they are forced to do either some trading or some mining on the side in order to generate the goods to haul splitting their skill pointsproposed solution interbus contracts  ferrying of passengersboth npcs and pcs can be ferried from ab npc ferrymen who fly interbus ferries operate anywhere in empire space with fees charged to customers depending on jumps players can book an ticket with interbus and catch a ride on the next ferry which operate once a daydowntime anywhere in empire npcs will fly interbus ships with no weaponsplayers can also be ferrymen with the right module upgrades to their ships to make it passenger ready take npc or player contracts their ships can be from a list of ships that can be retrofitted to be a ferry no freighters allowednpc contracts will pay depending on jumps and passenger load via formula so long as passengers are delivered ontime can take the form of interbus agent missions in stationsplayers can create their contracts private booking and post in contracts page passengers are anonymous but the rewards are defined by how much the player wants to pay these contracts can be from anywhere to anywhereattacking ferriesattacking a ferry load in emp space will cause severe standing hit concord will protect immediately even in lowsec emp space there are noncapsuleer civilians on these afterall rememeber interbus operates only in empire exception to this is if the ferry load was a private contract players ferrying contracts that are not interbus contracts are not registered with concord so they dont have the same immediate protection these haulers need to find their own escorts normal concord protection rules apply in emp space with the response time depending on system sec statusif ship destroyed then passengers are killed via same percent as loot some may remain alive in the can if pilot is forced to eject abandoning the passengers then pirates can claim all passengers alive big standing hit with interbus if pilot abandons ship without dying themselvescaptured passengers can be ransomed interbus will pay standard ransom amounts for npc passengers perhaps have a level of passengers akin to the ranks of dogtags to make vip passengers demand more ransom maybe use markets mechanism for allowing pirates to sell back passengers at certain stations just like npc station buy orderscaptured capsuleers this is the fun part can be ransomed directly with the player once a person places himself in a contract a new game mechanic would prevent them from leaving the station that they registered themselves as a passenger in they can still do market do anything that you can in the station but just not leave the station if they do they cancel the courier contract that they placed themselves intowhile in transit the player will need to be restricted as well as if in station but not at any particular station for purposes of market access a new in transit locale will need to be used with incarnia maybe some transit screen player can check mail and access neocom but thats itif captured then pirates will negotiate release through neocom pirates can choose to return passengers or kill them killing them is the same as podding returned players return to station of departure
continuedso why would you want to be a passenger either interbus or player contract depending on destinationwell anonymity as a passenger your name will not show up in the grid you are just one of the trillions of citizens in new eden going to and frogetting yourself to low00 easily when you are not a pvp character who can afford to fly a battleship to get to your destination maybe you are just a rich industrialistso that takes care of the demand for the service as a passengerwhy would you want to be a ferrymaneasy decent steady income stream for beginner haulers in interbus contractsharder but lucrative income streams for advanced haulers in private contractsand income stream for pirates tooadditional miscellanialocator works in locating somebody who is in transit the name of the pilot ferrying and the system is reported for pirates tracking down specific people to kidnap passengers standing matter for interbus contracts  no outlaws 5 allowed to take contracts or be a passenger on interbus npc contracts as a ferryman the contracts that are available to you to take depend on both your interbus standings and your concord sec status we wouldnt want a shady character ferrying some planetary governori think that this new market will open up the hauler profession and have it stand as its own instead of being just the necessary evil of a trader or a miner profession it fills the hole left missing by the parcel courier contracts which were inaccessible to new haulers due to costs and it also opens up a new revenue stream for pirates and kidnappersoh and it also makes the situation of john rourke in clear skies a reality win
i quite like the idea of ferrying players around theres quite a lot here and i think itd be better to focus on just one thing  so supported in that instance also you should support your own proposal lol
no and yesnono concord should act as usual and not in low sec spaceno players itself should not be able to use this thing for transportyesyes for only one thing i see as usage other than npc missiomning which i dont care for  that is transporting of players jump clone from point a to point band that should not be linked to special modules or special ships or limited so that freighters can use it it should work like normal courier contractsso no support for this proposal but i can see something can be worked out from it
thanks for the feedbackits very much a proposal intheworks and actually looking forward to any arguements that may illustrate any potential flawsthanks bumble and maxwondering though why you think that we shouldnt transport players themselves max besides the only reason i can think of which is more dev work for ccp i do like your idea of jump clone transport which will achieve essentially the same thing although ferrying would have to check the standings of the toon at the destination so that people cant use it to work around the standings requirement for jump clone installationnegative of this is that it restricts people from going to places where they have not sufficient standing if we only did the jump clone moving option that isi really envisioned this as a way to get from ab for players who neither care to spend the time to jump themselves nor the capability to do so safely in the case of going into null sec and are willing to pay instead and take the risk of kidnapping i can believe there are a lot of station traders or alt toons that could use this service just to be moved without the tedium of doing it themselves and in the case of npc ferries which move once a day and perhaps will not even manifest in real game mechanics as a ship just instateleport you they provide the service for anyone who ever logged off and thought wouldnt it be nice if i could just wake up tomorrow at point bfor the jumpclone addon to which i give the credit to max for thinking of it i think that freighters or any ship will be able to courier them the ship upgradesrestrictions was more for live passengers npc or otherwise the reason i thought to add this is because that as npc contracts should be primarily a source of isk for new haulers i didnt want freighter captains to come in and buy out all the passenger loads leaving none for the little guys i suppose an alternative is to make the npc contracts payout low yield so that freighter pilots wont be interested also the thought of booking passage in the gaping maw of a cold dank freighter cargo bay seems a little off so let me refine it a bit morea npc ferries run by interbus move you or your clone during server downtime and cannot be intercepted works only in empire no outlaws allowed to book passage like major airlines works as an instateleport booked through station services in neocomb privatepublic commissioned loads are carried whenever the player wishes it reward paid on delivery of you or your clone at or before the designated time can be hijacked by pirates for direct ransom like chartering a flight and taking a charter  aka han solo in tatooine works like a courier contractc some passenger loads are issued by interbus these have no players or clones in it just passengersmortals these provide low end cash flow for new haulers no outlaws allowed to take contracts can be hijacked passengers can be sold back to interbus for pirate cashflow so this makes low end money for both new haulers and new pirates works like a mission from interbus agentd concord acts as normal in all cases agree with max my original thinking was because i wanted more risk for the pirates involved if the npc bus drivers were present in the game if we do not represent the npc ferrymen at all and instead make it an instamove during down time then no need to change concord mechanicshow does that sound
interesting but it needs tweakinginterbus operates under very strict rules regarding neutrality and secrecy any new game mechanic to be introduced should ideally be consistent with the loresources
proposal is kind of interesting though tbh ive seen it beforebut there is one flaw in your logic anyone sane will need to insure his journey with the same high collateral or he will be dropped in the most inconvenient location make no mistake
but surely  unless im issing something of course  if the passengers are transported by npcs ie interbus during dt they will be plopped down at the station of their choosing
plexing isnt appealing anywaysits wrist slitting boredomthese changes turn plexing into a life or death commitment to a fight in order to secure vp towards making a system vulnerableanybody not wanting a fight will find nothing of value in plexing any moregoodbye wcs frigshello combat fit ships designed to sit on a button and hold it whilst taking fire from enemy playersaka hello fun greatuse an alt to activate a plex timer alt is locked in plex waiting for enemy wing to show upenemy faction arrives with 5 combat ships to defend said plex using up their activation limit at the gate alt in plex is only allowed 4 combat ship reinforcements into same plex before entry gate closes meaning that the morons that used an alt are actually at a disadvantage as they only have4 players  alt vs 5 playershow is this a good ideawhat benefit is there to using an altanswer none
yeah umno not true
well okay ive never tried it personally but i know a 2003 player that seems to think it works maybe it used to and doesnt anymore i dont know
i thinkbefore any overview enhancements are made the entire overview settings window and layout need a revamp its really hard to get to grips with when i first started playing i struggled to get it to not show friendlies not show people with certian standings as red all the time and collumnstabs rows it needs an esc menu for itself as in eve the overview is them main interaction itemwindow you play withhaving choices for colour of certian projected effects such as mentioned here locking agression helpingso you can then manually set different things to your chosen colour shape of certian projected effects iconsan array of different shapes and sizes for each class ship and suchbut the way it is now the settings window is just a little too fiddly to add more into itbut supported non the lessand red agression colour of choice should always override the friendly colour as this could lead to many n00b ganking exploits just saying p
account sharing is banned in the eula i believe  thats more than enough reason to ban an accounton a side note hearing that ccps looking into 2357 usage accounts and banning them makes me a little happier about the bot war
considering how unlikely your story sounds not to mention the lack of capitals full api key of all accounts or gtfo oh and can i have your stuff since you are quitting anyway after ban is over of course
using a macro violates the terms of use sharing your account info so multiple people can use 1 account also violates the terms of use so you committed a bannable offense either way also this be the wrong place petition ccp petitioning the csm and other players wont get you anywhere
i find this thread to be pointless you want to petition your  back but you then state you are deleting the clients that seems a bit unhealthy to rotate playing time with accounts go outside and spend time with your kids take them to an amusement park or a museum or something hell you live in australia do what all aussies do and go ride a kangaroo and throw boomerangs at wild dingos and cook snakes
supporting this for great justicealso watch out for cyberstingrays
i too use my dying relatives to justify why its ok for me to cheateditalso lolling at the racism guys you shouldnt ban me im not one of those horrible yellow skinned isk farming commie s im australian
to be perfectly fair did you ever check what kind of animals live in australia it was supposed to be a prison for a reason just about everything is there to kill you i dont even trust the koalas anymore i would rather have my kids playing eve 2357 then go outside in australia
i like this its way too short of a trip to invade other regions i moved my carrier pretty much half way across the galaxy in 3 or 4 jumps as for the stagnating thing thats not true from experience when lazy alliances like se and coven dont like to move far they will reset other people nearby think it was about 2 years or something when goons left quariousdelve stovensecoven got bored and then fired on it this then caused conflict with sysk and stoven reset sysk too and then was pretty much forced into period basis so from this we can see something like this will have a likely chance of causing smaller coalitions does it guarantee it no but its more likely to happen then fighting over true sec systems because people want to pvp and not have to take all day to get there not rat all day
looks like it is more you dont get it everything that promotes conflict results in larger coalitionsrelated to that this is a sandbox the issue isnt large coalitions existing the issue is that you need large coalitions to have sov in a nonsucky sov system if one alliance is twice as strong as the other one they can hold on to twice as much space but since in dominion defending your first system isnt noticable easier than defending your 100th system the alliance that is twice as strong will take all space
so you admit this change wouldnt do much because there would be so much yellow that people would disregard it and that its easy enough to spot legit ordersthen whats the point other than suggesting devs waste their time on something that adds no value to the gamenew players will figure out scams like everyone else does fall for it once spot it or even maybe bothering to read the forums
the server also doesnt like thousands of people jumping into one system but we still do that regularly 
i like this it is annoying to bounce back and forth
dont we have this alreadythis would actually be less of a punishment they dont do that anyway thats what alts  corp logistics are for
you dont know what your talking about do youhow can you kill something thats cloaked duh thats the issuepeople can just camp systems with afk cloakies and stop the whole system thats the issue fully supported that there is some way to find them whilst cloaked
theres an easier way than having to scan people down make new modules etcjust make the cloak use cap  that way the cloaker would either have to gimp his setup to make it cap stable meaning that the solo cloaker would actually have to pick his targets instead of just being able to pound anything that isnt a domi or not be able to cloakafk for 237 without the cloak eating its way through his cap and turning off  then making him scannable through normal means simples
i just received word that white tree is leaving test to join goons quite rightly the test players feel they have had their votes stolen by their so called friends in goons so that they have full control over the direction of the csm and ultimately the game we all playconsidering he is leaving the alliance that backed him he should step down and if he will not be removed so an alternate can take his place how can we let a group of known scammers and griefers destroy the game
we control your game nowsmug
calm down he isnt leaving test even if he did leave why would he step down
please dont tell me youre in test please please
ccp please take these issues seriously akita is on to something hereendorsed

this is mainly for gallente ships but some also cover gameplay as a whole also ill not include all my explanations for each of these but ill link the original thread so you can read my justifications thereoriginal thread
okay ive thought about it and im ready to replyfirst off id like to say that eve needs a first person mode of starship control and command this should be an optional perspective and be available with incarna as a choice made when first entering the game available from the new starting area in command quarters this doesnt mean it has to be available when incarna is released just that it can be a feature added laterheres how it worksthe cameras which float around your ship are the key obviously moving the perspective to a full first person mode is not a viable choice as we are still pod pilots the first person perspective of command will center all the cameras facing out from your ship slightly above center and clear of the models structure you still rely on them to show you the world around your ship from this pov the player will see his ship beneath him and be able to rotate his view to look around and up a hotkey to invert your view may be used to have the same perspective from the bottom of the vessel this will bring players closer to their ship and make it the center of their universezoom options will become available in this perspective allowing players to look at more distant objects with the scrolling of a mouse wheelreintroduce the radar currently the blob of ships and objects around your vessel serves as a radar of sorts allowing you to see everything around you from a zoomed out perspective this will not function with a first person perspective and players will become more reliant on their overview and rediscover the need for an actual radarthe radar will be 2 dimensional and relate all positions as out from the ship whether they are above below or next to it based on distance and relative position dots on the radar will indicate through shape ship or object class and position those above will be one color below another and next to a neutral balance between those will be a shade between for example we could use blue yellow and grey respectivelyintroduce collision damage and alter collision avoidance systems damage from collisions with any object will result in damage affecting shields armor and structure on a vessel bleeding through from one to the other with the majority of damage hitting the outermost generally shields first damage will be dependent on mass and relative velocity and will be affected by the inertia of both collisions will no longer result in rubber ball effectsto avoid collision damage on warp ins to gates asteroid fields stations and the like we will introduce a 10 second delay for ships to rephase with the physical universe on completing warp ships will continue to travel in a straight line or will automatically redirect their trajectory with normal inertia effects potentially halved and without reducing velocity towards the nearest edge of any model they happen to be within upon leaving warpeffectively warp is extended until they are no longer within a physical structure being out of phase ships in warp will now have a cloaking effect from the point where they enter warp until that point at which they leave it free of obstructionsi do not play eve to have the impression i am playing pingpong the effect is undesireable and unrealistici would also like to see a captains cabin arrive with incarna or sometime after as an addition like the captains quarters aboard station it will feature the ability to move around and have a viewport to see outside your ship other players may visit you there when they are onboard their own ships and within a reasonable proximity this will be projection and not in fact actual forms and physical interaction the quarters will be entirely virtual and exist only in the pod pilots minds and be accessible through their interface with their ships i believe something similar was done in a chronicle once
specifically regarding ships i have the following to sayweapons aboard ships should see some change im not talking about the new animation effects graphics or similar things weapon placements aboard ships need to see changes in other areastake a battleship for instance typically it carries 58 turrets which are mirrored somewhere else on the ship only one of which ever fires at any given time basically this is fine but ship classes only really fit one kind of turret or a smaller version in equal numbers this should changeimagine a battleship in eve with only two large turrets yet also sporting four additional mediums and another six small ones while it may put out a significant amount of dps with such a configuration it can only do so within the range limitations of its smallest turretsmore to the point such a ship would more closely represent a space faring version of a real battleship frigates would no longer be able to single handedly take on a battleship nor would most cruisers battleships would have a purpose and be much more capable of defending themselves a reason for the class would exist and combat of all sorts in eve would evolveevolvethis same can apply to battlecruisers and cruisers dreadnoughts carriers and supercarriers currently only range is a factor in choosing to go for a bigger ship class which is quite often silly when missiles are brought into the equation and then there are drones which can be had in greater number aboard some larger vessels this is irrelevent when you consider an ishtar in the equation as it holds and fields more drones than pretty much any battleshipfrigates need a little love to they generally lack powergrid while having ample cpu and limited fitting hampers them or just plain makes them all but useless there are a few exceptions which serve well in some situations yet these are exceptions and not the norm most frigates are fragile and easily destroyed while being incapable of fielding any real offensive forcecruisers arent much better most of them are useless and not just for pvpships need to scale properly a big ship should be big and no drone should be more than half the size of a frigate large ships may even need an inertia dampening effect which slows other ships down around them though not much and relevent to mass kind of like coming close to a planetlarger ships need higher maximum velocity despite their mass there is no reason why they should not be able to achieve higher speeds it just might take longer for them to do so smaller vessels like cruisers should have higher maximum velocities as well as should nearly any other vesselto counter the effect of increasin velocities and time required to reach maximum velocity to warp on larger vessels velocity required to warp should be relevent to the size of the ship all vessels should take approximately the same time to reach warp when traveling within a straight line allowing for slightly increasing times to achieve warp in a straight line for even larger vessels this is space there is no reason we should need to move so slow beyond that required for tactical maneuvers in engagementsblobs will no longer existwith collision damage and increased velocities players will have to take greater control of their vessels and more care will be required in fleet formationsthis will also affect pve macros like ratting bots making them less reliable and potentially unusable
eafs in general they are simply too fragile all of them should have their sig radius dropped maybe even in half they have poor survivability in small gang situations because their ehp is so incredibly lowin additionsentinel a few hundred armor points would go a long long way here fitting is also very tight even with perfect skills could use another low slot and some extra gridcpu to stick something in there i also wouldnt be adverse to an extra 5level range on the neutsnos if not this then at least make the small faction neuts cheaper in the lp stores the cost of those things is insidiously highkitsune im actually fairly comfortable with this ship and yes i do fly it youre forced to choose between midrange high strength jamming or boosting its effective range what i never understood is why it lost the base hulls drone bay i want my guard dog backkeres whats the point of a damp ship with such pitiful targeting range give it 60km or so an extra 25 damp strength would help a lot toohyena the web range bonus is useless if you cant get into range that means you need a mwd the mwd blows your sig radius up to the size of a small moon the 3 bonus doesnt cut it the paper thin ehp just got worse if youre worried about it taking over the role of an interceptor too much then perhaps reduce the base speed so that it goes about 25kms with a mwd needs more cpu too it isnt possible to get a decent fit using all t2im generally happy with the build cost of these ships i wouldnt want them to be much cheaper but not more expensive either unless they dont get buffed then they need to be cheaper
print this out and have it sent to every employee at ccp sov nullsec is literally choking to death on these ships the experience of the sc pilots themselves is not fun ive been flying a nyx for over a year now and im not enjoying myself as for the rest of the troops who are out there in hellcats hacs carriers and anything else thats not an sc well i can only imagine they are miserable they exist entirely to bait other sc onto the battlefield so that the other sc pilots and i can kill them that is the sum total of all goals in 00 right now build more scs kill more of the enemy scsthis needs to end and the sooner it does the better im more than willing to see my nyx nerfed or outright removed from the game if that helps bring back meaningful subcap interaction in sov fleet warfare
and to parrotthe tier system is terrible too many ships are simply useless buff the terrible ships to be in line with the rest so that theyre worth flyingthe amarr t1 cruiser lineup is pretty sad the arbitrator is nice but the rest are sad bonuses to laser cap usage arent a good enough reason to fit lasers to a ship people end up using acs instead change those bonuses to a rof or damage bonus or range bonus or something worthwhile heat bonusham prophecy would be super cool please please please give me a reason to fly that ship the ship model is awesomeangel ship line is overpowered the dramiel in particularsuccubus phantasm cruor need lovethe sacrilege is a nice concept but it is lacking as a hac it needs to get very close to its target to really do anything unlike other hacs which are agile fast and can do good damage at range a cool buff to the sac would be a much larger cargo bay so that it can store more cap boosters for the dualrep fit speaking of that dualrep fit it would be nice if other fits were viable for this thingi want active tanking to be viable in general not just for a few niche shipsgypsios take on a wide ship nerf isnt a bad one i would rather buff than nerf but if all ships end up well balanced then i really dont careunprobeable offgrid boosting is terrible and needs fixed

simple if you nerf sc then no one will use them just like when they were moms and no one used them other then for pvea dread costs 110 the cost of a sc and it can dock plus you can insure a dread imo a ship that costs 10 times cant be insured cant dock should be able to pown the other ship and if you did nerf scs then you will get big fleets of dreads and abbadondrake fleets and that is just boringbut if you keep dreads the same and keep sc the same and add in a tech ii dread that can tank more do more dps plus use capital nuets as capital nuets will make rr really hard for cap ships this will add more flavour to capital fights which imo is allways a good thing
you know it is possible to make game balance changes in such a way that we dont get binary overpowereduseless results and note that if this isnt possible then your silly juggernauts proposal will by your own binarygamebalance argument result in one of juggernauts or supercarriers being uselessand you still havent explained why youre introducing an entire new class instead of changing one that already exist i suspect that youre just getting a hardon for the silly ship names that youve proposed

my suggestion is some asset accesible by acceleration gate that only lets in ten or so people per hour that makes it only accesible to small gangsas to what the asset should be ive no idea maybe the customs offices or something
forumena altair marconus orion guilliman r and arkady sadiki like this direction i think if we could combine these ideas to produce an interesting mechanic i like the idea of hacking upgrades to reduce their efficiency could we combine the hacking
not sure if you are referring to that most excellent eve forever video they played at fanfest it looks great  people see it and want it they get eve and find out that planetary combat is still coming soon tmguess that my point here is that scheduling the hype to correspond with the product releases may be beneficial in establishing a reputation as a game company as to what the magic formula for this is i have no idea but there is probably a way to ensure that you get the product out before disappointment sets ini like a tease as much as the next guy but eventually it better deliver or i get very discontent
personally eve needs a graphic noveldo that and you will get more people into the loor of eve and then more will want to playplus ccp should team up with some magna commics and create some made for dvd movies about the history of evethere are millions of nerds out there who should be playing eve but dont knowcare about it giving them nerd moviesgrahic novels will to this pretty well
following on from this it would be nice if research towers could use blueprints in your personal hangar unless you trust everyone in your corp who has roles researching high value bpos in a tower isnt really an option this is because anyone can cancel it and take the bpo from the corp hangar
why i have to move around stuff inside the poswe have for example one pos in our wh with 8 equipment assembly arrays in addition one component assembly array when i log into eve the first time of the day im first have to locate in which of the equipment aa all the materials and bpcs are located move them around start jobs and move them around one more if somethin is missing i have to take an industrial anf fly things from hangars or the component aa and store them in the equipment aathats a pain in the ass its only costs time and produce server load its a big space station it should be able to handle such things by itselfso what i would doarrays and labs have no more storage space you just can install jobs your minerals bpcs bpos moonmaterial etc is located in a corporate hangar array from here you can select the bpc bpo and install jobs into labs arrays whatever you have anchored after installing the mats the job are required disappear and after the job is done the endproduct appears in you hangar array it would be nice if this would go hand nd hand with the change that you can open containers inside the corporate hangar array to sort your things
the permissionsroles system in general is terribly broken and borderline unusable but particularly so when it comes to pos managementas a ceo i should be able to create an arbitrary number of roles those roles should be able to provide very granular permissions on a perpos basis it is mindboggling that anyone thought it was a good idea that any permission applies to all towerspos structures are too communal theres no personal storageim okay with the fuel being the way it is you know how much you need you buy it or pi it you transport it youre done changing to fuel pellets wont really change anything it might even make things worse instead of one player making fuels a and b and another making c and d now they need to get together an add yet another step in the process to make the pellets suddenly fuel is even more expensive  as if the neverending rise in robotics et al isnt bad enough no thank youwant fuel to be more convenient set up the tower to automatically draw fuel from the corp hangar array as needed then use the fuel inside of the tower itself when the hangar array is empty you can dump 6 months of fuel in there one time then not worry about itsome pos defenses are laughable blasters are near useless a stealth bomber can tank torp batteries theres no reason to use a tower other than minmatar unless you desperately need the cpu for labs or the extra silo space speaking of why are gallente towers so undertanked compared to the others im fine with manual anchoring and onlining systems being able to queue anchoring and onlining means that someone can enter a system and drop a dozen essentially selfassembling towers with minimal effort this makes space invasion too easy the timers also ensure that he structure is vulnerable until someone puts in the time to make it defensible you want a tower then put in the time necessary to set it upand whats the deal with containers being able to rent pos facilities to the public would be very cool not just research slots but production storage etc
that is what needs to be fixed this proposal would fix it
your proposal doesnt solve the problem we have guys running around low sec all day long looking for mission runners and plexers we know where they are we and they know how to counter npcsthe plexers and mission runners the ones who want a fight give us a fight great funthe other plexers and mission runners the ones interested in system occupancy or making isk run away and dont give a fight boringyou are then either forced to orbit a button for 20 minutes or hang out for 12 hours to grief err keep them from acheiving their objectives solution ignore the occupancy weenies who dont want to actually fight and instead go have some fun finding plexers that doi am beginning to believe that having a resolution to the conflict not based on absolute time is the key to more fun offensive plexing kill all the npcs and youre done offensive mission running complete mission youre done defensive plexing  defensive mission running some poison pill like cutting the net that effectively fails their mission if they dont fight you figure out a good mechanic for defensive plexing that doesnt involve orbiting a button for 20 minutes when the offensive plexer bails and you figure out the occupancy solution perhaps give the defender the right to close the plex but not gain any points towards occupancy after he pushes the offensive plexer out 
im not sure who the we is in your quote but your entire militia does not know where every plexer is i cant emphasize enough how this will change fw plexingi have sat in plexes for over an hour i dont even start the timer because i dont want the npc agro on me or the enemy mostly im in ships ranging from t1 frigates to t1 cruisers i find it very hard to believe that no one in the entire opposing militia wanted a pvp fight with those sorts of ships and yes i have spent some time on the gallente front sitting in a merlin in minor and medium plexes waiting for fights if you knew i was there why didnt you come fight seriously get a t1 hull and go sit in plexes i think you will find you only get about 1 decent fight per hour i had been doing that for months but an hour is too long to wait for a single 60 second fight so i am letting my accounts run out and will resub when ccp develops something where i can get about 48 decent small scale fights an hour lets face it you didnt know i was there even if you were logged on even some of the people in local likely didnt know where in local i was like you say currently you go chasing someone around which we both agree is bad gameplay but if we were alerted where the plexes were being taken then we would not need to chase people the best way to do plexes would be to split up your gang throughout the relevant low sec regions that way the person running would have nowhere to go since there would be someone else a few jumps over chasing him out of a plex in the meantime you would be doing plexes yourself waiting for others to come to fight you or going over a jump or two to fight or chase the enemy you would be on teamspeakvent deciding if you wanted to gang up on a larger target or how to best use each and every pilot throughout the fw regions instead of just telling the blob to hold on gate and call primaries thats right the best way to win the occupancy war would be to break up that blob pretty much everyone in eve who wants allot of easy to find quality small gang pvp would join fw in order to do plex fighting that is allot of people i and many others would actually start playing the game again the inside of a plex would not be a good place to go to avoid pvp these regions would fill up with lots of players stockpiling t1 insurable ships to go pvp in right close to the actionsuddenly capturing 111 plexes would actually be an accomplishment winning the occupancy war would actually be an accomplishment right up there will winning the alliance tournament suddenly being good at fw plexing is seen as meritorious and doing the plexes would be fun 237
people will have ignored the broadcasts after the nth time they run out to maintenault only to get blueballed by a plexing alt your reward for pushing them out is to sit on button for 20 minutes problem not solvednote if somebody wants fights in a plex they open them in oms heyd tama or some other system that had lots of wts and pirates in it lots of good fightsedit buy yeah maybe it would work as a good dating service if the names of the pilots involved were broadcast as well
yes a dating service might be a good analogy more like speed dating but you do more than talk and yes the pilot names should be broadcast as well but i will tell you hide and seek plexing would no longer be viable people will go into plexes with the expectation of getting fights and those expectations will be met there are too many players in eve crying out for small gang pvp for this to be anything other than a huge hit this would change eve from a game that only people with way too much time on their hands can play to a game that people would be logging in and getting good fights in a matter of 35 minutes it would be a constant rush i will admit i didnt spend much time at the gallente front but when i did i went to the places you mention no fights just allot of sitting around inside plexes i did the same in kourmonen and ammamake and auga and kamela and dal lots of sitting around wasting time very little fighting that is what the current eve is all about but it could offer allot more
could we get this stickied
1six months is plenty of time they just need to prioritize based on how much time they have cant cram an elephant into a thumbnail small iterations over time will lead to less bugs each iteration show constant improvements and allow for smaller gra
so true we also have major alliances flat out telling new players dont train gallente

an emphatic yes
i have the exact same issuecolor blindness issues come up regularly why not let us customize the interfaces colors as we see fit also more blackness in space as opposed to bright nebulae would help a lot a light yellow module activation timer is completely invisible to me in certain solar systemsi could not disagree more players who pay attention to the combat situation take the time to learn about various ships and their capabilities or put in the time to build their own tools for profit calculations should be provided with an edge over those who want everything done for themmodal dialog windows are terrible and should be removed it would be sweet to select an overview setting for my scanner from a dropdown instead of the use overview settings checkbox my scanner can use one setting my overview anotherthis is a fantastic idea even better to break it up into multiple contests that can be run concurrently one for inspace flight one for marketproductionscience windows i try not to bash eves ui too much because we need a lot of important data all at once to be visible its hard to make something that communicates that much information and not have a cluttered screen if that information is taken away for example velocity angular velocity radial velocity then eve loses the depth that it is known for
how about adding a reprocess button to the sell item screen so if you decide the prices arent to your liking you can quickly reprocess said item right now you have to exit out of the sell item window then right click the item again and reprocessthats just unnecessary extra clicking
yes
back to the top for a good idea due its place in the sun
if you make the ships with the shortest range the fastest how is that going to make kiting worse that would practically eliminate it also increasing sd strength without increasing range will make it no more or less op than ecm is now probably less tbh and notice i said you cant separate the rig changes from the gallente speed buff because killing the rig penalties without buffing gallente speed means we just have a different flavor of kiting and a new buff to amarrminmatar
i do like that you get the notifications of the damage drones dobut i would agree that they do spam the notifications and i would enjoy if there was an options to show drone notifications
open the combat log and see all the data but it wouldnt be a bad idea to be able to filter based on certain types of either incoming or outgoing damage probably a very low item on the lowhanging fruit scale though
really just need to stack drones and have a single damage event rather than one damage event for each drone they did that for guns it would make sense to do that for drones as welledit supporting a change
lets see the fact that there r only 3 slots per account and new chars cant magically summon free isk wouldnt that be nice for newbies and even if they did they would make great suicide gank fodder in their t1 industrial oh and every account u open will cost u 20 essentially spending roughly 400500 mil isk every time
lets see trial accounts to get around the 3 slots the new character doesnt need any isk since their only purpose is to accept a contract and make another t1 industrials never enter the picture as the existing highsec hauler alt is still doing what they do with one extra step added and trial accounts to get around that last part
why not put a 5 minute counter on a self distruct of a ship or a podmost battles are long over before thatif you really need to pop yourself cause you got yourself stuck in a wormhole  a 5 minute wait isnt that badon that note  if you are on your 5 minute counter  and you disconnect from the server  intentionally or unintentionally   you should not warp off  but stay put in the same spot till u blow up still leaving somone the option of doing you the favour
remove insurance from the game completely

thanks seamus i didnt know there was lore associated with interbus in that case we should make a new set of npc corps for this purpose caldari spacelanes and the spacing guild for instancebumblefck is right for moving ab with no hassle in empspace npc delivery shouldnt be a problemdi mulle good point we would need collateral for private contracts that players would take but the only reason you would use these is for travelling to low or null sec and these contracts will be expensive anyway and only meant for experienced haulerssmugglers so it doesnt hurt the low end empsec marketfor a deterrent in empsec and low end contracts that beginning haulers may take we should put a secstatus penalty for dropping the passengers off at a different location its definitely criminal as it amounts to accessory to kidnapping so what would prevent pirates from starting an alt and pick up some contracts and flying them into harms way meaning into an ambush with pirates who kidnap the passengers in space thereby avoiding the aforementioned penalty this one i may need some advice on but i thought maybe some sort of tally of passenger loads lost to pirates if you lose too many then you lose your license to carry passengers this license would be one of the things that you would need to buy in order to start carrying passengers along with the aforementioned modulesrigs to your ship this is to make a barrier to entry that would make creating new hauler alts for pirate mains for the purposes of feeding their main toons noneconomicaladditionally if the problem is still that every budding pirate would create a hauler alt to feed him prey and even though we have made it restrictive to build up a new hauler alt too often the problem is still how can we prevent it to feed pirates a steady stream of npc passenger heads to sell assuming the hauler only takes npc interbus contractsthen what we can do is the system will penalize pirates directly for attacking and ransoming npcs by way of putting bounties on them these amounts will depend on the vip value of the passenger load which depends on the standing of the ferryman who took the contract which also determines the reward for delivery this makes sense as kidnapping civilians is a serious crime and their are families of these npcs who will put out bounties on any perpetrators this should limit these types of piracy to only the very notorious pirateinterbus still used here just because its convenient as a name
i like this idea adds new depths and ways to assassinate people
so the updated proposala npc ferries run by interbus move you or your clone during server downtime and cannot be intercepted works only in empire space no outlaws allowed to book passage like major airlines works as an instateleport booked through station services in neocom if interbus used then use the existing lore ie they move only 13 jumps from interbus headquarters else come up with other npc corps for providing this service like omnibus or othersb player created privatepublic commissioned loads are carried whenever the player taking the charge wishes it reward paid on delivery of you or your clone at or before the designated time can be hijacked by pirates for direct ransom like chartering a flight and taking a charter  aka han solo in tatooine works like a courier contract standing loss and sec penalty for dropping off cargo at a destination other than the one specified contracts can be collateralized having your ship blown up by pirates and losing your passengers npc or pc passengers will incur no sec penalty but will incur standing loss with carrier restricting your choice of future npc contracts and the number of times you have lost your load will be displayed on your record as a percentage of total successful deliveries players can restrict their contracts to pilots who have certain success ratios onlyc npc passenger loads are issued by interbusor other npc corps these have no players or clones in it just passengersmortalscivilians these provide low end cash flow for new haulers no outlaws allowed to take contracts can be hijacked passengers can be sold back to interbusor corp for pirate cashflow so this makes low end money for both new haulers and new pirates works like a mission from interbus agent passengers use the ingame items that you can move into cargo holdsd concord acts as normal in all cases agree with max my original thinking was because i wanted more risk for the pirates involved if the npc bus drivers were present in the game if we do not represent the npc ferrymen at all and instead make it an instamove during down time then no need to change concord mechanicse everytime a pirate shoots at a passenger carrying ship one that is fittedrigged for carrying passengers and whos pilot is a licensed operator not just any ship that happens to be holding the passenger items in hold they will get a warning if they ignore and fire concord will respond as per normal rules if the ship is destroyed then a bounty will be added to the pirates name by the system this is in addition to any sec penalty and bounty added for aggroing innocents this represents the bounties put on the pirates head by the families of the npc killedkidnapped the bounties are more x5 x10 if any citizens were spaced killed when the ship popped this makes the ideal heist for a pirate is to force the hauler to abandon the ship intact having the hauler take the reputation hit in order to minimize bounty placed on themf locator agent will be able to find players who are en route if they are in a passenger manifest of a player ferry they will not be able to find them if a player is a passenger on an interbus dt ferry
a positive side effect of this new dynamic in the game is that more people may want to take up the hauler career presently as their are no ways of making money as a beginner hauler you end up being a traderhauler or a minerhauler but the hauling part is a secondary profession i envision a universe where their are expert haulers who know how to evade pirates and know the best alternate routes around space also large convoys of haulers moving as a fleet together the same way convoys in wwii did for protection in numbersif there were more haulers then it would help other related professions like trading and mining imagine if there were a lot more haulers then it would be feasible to contract out to haulers to move your low cost goods around within emp space presently as there are no low level haulers the only ones who take courier contracts would scoff at a 20k reward to move tritanium from jita to rens but its exactly that kind of cheap hauls which would make the life of a miner and a trader much easierbasically the economy needs more haulers good for the economy good for lazy players who cant be bothered to fly themselves around good for pirates as extra income
so few players would encourage orchestrated situations with expendable alts locking the plex out
yes pirates and militias can camp entry gates exactly the same way as they do alreadyif we fixed it so they were not able to do this then we might as well be playing stocan i just check to make sure your ship comes equipped with a dscannerif so can i suggest that you always scan a plex before warping to the gatein this case if u find more than five ships on scan u can assume that just maybe it could possibly be a tarp pnext objection please
describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your altseriously maybe im a bit thick  does someone want to run a thought experiement here and actually explain to me how they are going to use their alts to break this mechanicit feels to me that folks are failing to read heads too full from reading other threadsyou send a n alt into a plex and camp the gate is that the sum total of your objections or am i missing something because if thats the problem then it only applies to people without dscannersie n00bs
you are the one with impaired vision as you insist on believing that having 23rd of what makesbreaks a pvp engagement applied automatically and setting hard limits on engagement size will be good for gameplayyou may have been in the war since the beginning but it is evident that you have very limited experience with the whole plexing system  guessing your exposure to it has been chasing frigs around which is a pitylet me reiterate my previous as you apparently didnt understand it was your suggestions to be implemented speed frigs would be in all plexes and run to next plex at first sign of trouble ad nauseum  there would be no fights at all since no one likes having most of their options taken away ecmneut to break tackle no active tanks no movement away from timer etcto get the maximum oomph with number limits necessitates faction ships automatically excluding the pvp newcomers who have the most to the gain from fw  information of open plexes will be ignored in short order due to spam travel effort and above mentioned running frigs  it would truly become an alt war with whatever side has the most winningi was being nice before but no more the idea stinksps veshta yoshida is the name you want to look up if checking my credentials
im not replacing the existing losec mechanics im simply suggesting that there is an additional element when engaging in plexesone still has to navigate through losec and all its goblinry to actually get to a plexbelieve it or not i stopped chasing frigs a few months after fw was released now we use plexes simply as cover from blobs however most of our chosen engagements still happen at gates not in plexes how can they run when they are pointed by the buttonthey cant get off grid coz they are neuted and webbed if farther than 100km from the buttononce in plex and running the timer and only then the plex location is broadcast indicating that a pilotgang is committed to the plex until the timer is completethis is just speculationi could just as easily suggest that there will be fewer blobs and more roaming small gangsand in a situation where one has to hold a ship on the button whilst taking fire i can see quite a few gang setups that use both local tank and rr this implies that means that neuts and ecm will be invaluablefaction ships should not be considered to be t1not a problem with plexing but with ship clasification your alt wcs frig concern is addressed above with all due respect we know of your family well we need not check your credentials i dont think you get itthink it through in your headalt arrives in system alt scans plexalt enters plexalt is pointed by towerbuttonalt moves to button to start timerplex is broadcast as actively runningthen one of two thingsa a fight happens and the victors close the plex and take vpb no one gets to the plex in time to challenge the plexers the plex closes the button turns off the plexers earn vp and warp off
why what do you think will change you get a horde of fit frigates all over the place they are alts remember and you even want npcs removed to make it a slamdunkif you have a 100km neutweb barrier then this is what happens alt frig enters plex and starts timer hostiles appear on short range alt logs off alt disappears from space in 60s as normal logs in whenever to land on plex gate operator probably has multiple alts that can be cycled hostiles are now trapped inside the plex until timer expires and can do diddly except use same logoff mechanic to free themselvesthat is what it will be like you can change logoff mechanics to avoid it but then you are really trapping the pvpers the alt could care less because he is a 40k ship with minimal skillsno implants ie disposable alt aka plexing altspeculation not so much i dedicated my life to understanding human behaviour and i am rarely wrong when it comes to predicting it
and if the alt is pointed by the button upon logoff does that count as aggressedwill that not keep alt in place long enough for those short range ships to enter plex and destroy ithaving never tried logoffski i have no idea how it works forgive if im wrong hereedit from evelopediaspecial caseslogging in npc combatif a player logs out from space while in npc combat their ship will be removed from space after 2 minutes instead of the standard 1 minute this is to make it harder to use logging out in combat as a means to escape from your enemy note that if you are warpscrambled you will not warp away from the fight
updated op
the only thing i can really think of to stop macrosdamageanimate asteroid fields making each asteroid tumble and float on grid never staying stationary change collision avoidance mechanics and make it possible to receive damage as a result of collisions damage will bleed through shields to armor and structure roughly 50 30 and 20 respectivelythese same effects would apply to ice fields and fragmented ice and possibly new ore types would increase the number of smaller faster moving hazards this will also transfer over to ship collisions but will be the result of relevent mass inertia and velocity ie a frigate hitting a cruiser will receive more damage than the cruiser ramming tactics will become possible and perhaps even give a reason to fit reinforced bulkheads and armor plates with afterburners for the sake of this thread the focus will remain on mining howevergas clouds will become hazardous and cause damage to ships within a certain proximity not affecting shields but instead attacking first armor and bleeding through to structure this time with 85 and 15 respectively gas clouds will also drift and flow within a rough area making them hazardous to be within mining proximity tosome effects of gas clouds may actually reduce ship velocity or result in flashburns from ignition resulting from contact with ship ion trails effectively damaging the ship in normal fashion and reducing the quantity of harvestable gas availablethese effects do not generate isk and so cannot be exploited like increasing pirate activity canwith the resolution of mining macros we can make mining more profitable and increase the availability of various ores in all locationsadditional thoughts would be the addition of ore combustibility in mining operations such as with mercoxit only affecting many more types of ore with a rarer occurence even veldsparim not a miner myself but i know it to be an unprofitable venture when compared to missioning or any other venture in eve mining is just not worth the time investment increasing the profitability will only benefit macro users and make their activities more worthwhile unless we prevent the occurence of that behaviour mining will continue to be an unprofitable barely entertainable enterprisewe have 6 localized trade hubs in eve and a smattering of smaller ones that barely suceed in holding ground between these we see all the wealth of new eden displayed on the market orders every ship and module crafted sees its way to these markets and countless other potential markets are left untouched this is partly because there is not enough manufactured to reach all these markets coupled with limited demand and difficulty in actually producing all that is required to create a market in these locations macros are running industry and no one else can compete with not the time the willingness or the ability to manufacture and produce products and still be competative in industryif profitability is increased macro users will increase profits and inflate pricesif macros are removed as effective means of harvesting resources demand will increase and prices will soar as markets deplete of all available products with their disappearanceif both are done well see balanceaddition of encrypting client server communicationsbots rely on information sent to the client from the server to do what they do best so i have thought of this maybe not new ideaall server to client communications should now be encypted requiring a decryption key like a wep key to unencrypt the data client side this will be a primarily cpu load activity on the client pc and will have little or no effect on actual gameplay decryption keys will be random and transmitted after every downtime on client login and possibly infrequently during actual gameplay
wait wait what absolutely nothing you just said will do jack to stop mining macroseditso lets see what you want done you want every trade hub instantly closed because any griefer corp could rr a freighter on the undock and cause everyone undocking to blow up then you want to insure that all of new edens miners are floating in space with both armor and structure damagescary troll is scary
i too would like to see mining become even worse of an activity than it already is also i would like mining ships to already have damage so i can gank them more easily
it will never get fixed ccp relies too much on the income
i have tried for several weeks to get an answer out of ccp regarding what happened to faction towers and gun bpcs but to no avail we have not seen them drop in over a year and a half and we want to know why
need
theres your problem
avocados are found in australians true story
but you know no one else who was on the account was using a bot assuming the op isnt just lying about their own use of a bot seriously though im quite happy if ccp has started hitting the always running accounts
that is certainly the most ridiculous thing that ive read today so what if i have no social life andor an insomniac  you youre banned
can i have your familys stuff

its rediculous the bounty system is a waste of time why have a system that is worthless we need to have a bounty system that is tied to a players skill points of course their would be strict guidlines for fairnessyes i have placed this suggestion in the new ideas forum but i want some feedback from this forum
feedback on what expand your idea make it different from the dozen other bounty threads floating around and leave skillpoints alone if you start knocking skillpoints off of people you bring in all new ways to grief
never used the features and ideas section it might as well be called the recycle bin
i love this ideado we need a new ships for this or just a new modulemaybe jsut a capital mod that can be used on any capital ship
an easier solution would be making it harder for a super to kill hics as has been said why would someone fly a hic make them useful as antisupers and multiple problems are solved1 make a hic immune to neuts when the super point is active2 give the hic an hp buff when the super point is active3 make drone bays and fighter bays separatethese three things should change the balance for the better
i see a large commitment to excellence thread below mine perhaps we can get that stickied in order to keep that reminder to ccp visible

well good thing you voted for the person and not the alliance he happens to be inright
what a load of bs you dont vote for someone to the csm for your own selfish needs the csm is there in the interests of all players not just the interests of a single group of people what about all the people in npc corps are their votes just wasted because they voted for an individual who isnt directly involved in their corp i lol
oooh consequences you better hide and start doing the good ol station spinning 
eve is like am mlms unfortunately if you come in at any point in time the only way to get a better return than previous entrants is to work with remapsimplants to achieve a faster sph and perhaps in 5 years catch upas far as isk goes the same applies many niches are already filled to capacity and the road to manufacturing at a profit is long and arduoust2 bpos have long been the bane of any budding manufacturer and i gave up long ago with the manufacturing career because the cost of entry is too high in both isk and timeanyone looking at anything like a catch up is deluding themselves ccp took out the learning skills top stop players wasting time skilling the learning skills in the process they also removed the most significant of only 3 ways to increase sph ratesthe only way of leveling up the playing field is to create more situations where time in game is not as important as skills in the toon and the pilotfor example sites in lownullsec which prevent access to particular ship classes so people wanting to pvp in frigs can sit in a site knowing that only frigs will be warping inresign to the fact that the rich will always get richer and the poor will always get the picture
anyone complaining they cant compete against the few t2 bpos shouldnt go industry anyways mostly cause they have no clue at all to start with
there have been many and varied suggestions on how to make pve missions and mining for that matter more interesting ccp  csm should be spoiled for choiceex the mission requires you use your pod to enter the first gate once in the pocket which is perma scramd you can select a ship from a special support ship depending on which ship you select the next gate will send you to an appropriate rendezvous to complete your mission a dc in the mission ship in the mission area like pos force fields means you stay there and lose the faction fitted frig or whatever youve chosenjust a single example of many many ideas given by the players of eve which given a little time with a coder could be added to the gamethe main problem i see with missioning is that almost every mission is written up in the survival guides making missioning as easy as abc i try to do missions in pvp omni tank fits now just because it adds a little jeopardy to the mix if ccp had a more dynamic way of building and naming missions making the survival guides redundant that would go half way to making missions less simpleas for mining well thats always been a dull game maybe npc mining rats should be around to leach those rocks out from under your lasers so taking out an npc mining rat can reap you more ore than if youd mined it yourselfccp could go a long way to making the game more interesting it seems to me though that the ceos of ccp are of the mindset that eve is their game and if they want something done they will dictate that it happens learning skills and stuff anyone else noone else rides on my roller coaster sort of attitude i can imagine the ceo getting on one day and doing his usual thing and getting shot down nerf that ship that shot me down thatll sort those s outsigh maybe we will see something more dynamic and interesting when dust 514 comes out
learning skills were removedplease give us 7 implantsand i want more slots for drugs and more slot 3 drugsanyone else agree
erm why
because they took away our learning skills and the slots because theres no decent slot 3 booster
they took away the learning skills and gave you the same stats youd have if you had them all at five what does that have to do with 7 implants
1 this has to be possible they make it possible in stations can combine ship and mod holds into a single hold if you like avoid if you repackage things a lot
lets look a the original roll for the dreadnought there were introduced back in 2005 under the cold war expansion as soon as the first outpost was advertised the major military equipment manufacturers werent long to respond with the ultimate tool for them more correctly the ultimate tool against them say hello to my little friend now has a whole new meaning dreads were never meant to be anti capital ships they are supposed to be anti stationary objects which they fit rather well sc are supposed to be anti capital with the fb the reason i would like to see a tech ii dread is that there currently is no counter to the sc for price and ability titans are too expensive and dreads already have a roll so having tech ii dreads being a ewarcapital nuet upgraded dread gives a good balance to scs the trick is not to make juggernauts op so so each ship will have lowered sensor strength to that of their races bss
this this and yeah thisthe last thing this game needs is a new cap ship class
oh yeah ive almost forgotnerf supercarriersthanks for your attention
either give dreads a five min siege mode with extra high slots for this capital nuet or give us tech ii dreads i kinda like the idea of a yellowish moros
how would you nerf themreduce thier ehpremove fb reduce fr damage againmake them go in a siege like mode that allows them to launch fb but makes it so they cant be rrwhat is the balance you are looking for dread to schow does do you nerf sc without making them pve onlyships
heres a threadtldr you dont alter much the balance between supercarriers and dreads since supercarriers are supposed to be anticapital but you make supercarrier pilots have to decide on their role at the fitting screen rather than a single omnifit for every occasion and increase the supercarriers vulnerability to subcapitals particularly dictorshictors so that they need a proper support fleet to bail them out if they get into trouble
yes for example that idea is goodhowever any change that would limit their usability will be good currently scs are used for killing capitals killing subcapitals shooting poses attacking systems attacking stations hotdrops pve well before they removed sanctums anywayin one word theyve become the ultimate i win button in the game no matter what situation you use them in they are simply the best tool for the job plus they dont have anything that can fight them except more scs and that is only if you dont pack enough of them in the system to lag it out so the opposing force can not even get in the system thats wrong
i think you missed the point of the thread the csm is asking for player feedback not giving you an idea to examine

people have been dragging their tongues over swtor peeks since they started developing it its been awhile and they did the same with aoc nd a handful of other mmos prerelease personally all i see resulting from that is fanaticism that quickly turns into bitter disappointment and eventually those players despise the developers even before release the funny thing is they knew they would have to wait as long as 5 years from the first press release that development had begun moral anyone who wastes that much of their life teasing themselves with sneakpeaks of future content is bound to be disappointed its a givenso that is generally to be avoided on the development side unless it is strongly considered that player expectations will be exceeded in both the short and long run strangely swtor has had its share of fanbase drop after complaining bitterly about the wait yet the remaining community is strong and remains commited despite all this even stranger and almost unknown in pre and postrelease mmos swtor has a fanbase comprised of mostly rational and content individuals i was pleasantly surprised by thataoc at this stage had a pantheon of ex and current beta players frothing at the mouthes and calling the devs all manner of things they also did a fair job of belittling and derided every positive thinking or optimistic individual who still liked the game by the time they had finished with their efforts to roll aoc off the edge of a cliff one with a long drop to a wet rocky grave aoc had all of 1000 active members and fans remaining im not sure how its doing nowsomething else to be avoided a content playerbase goes a long way keeping current players happy and maintaining flawless or near flawless content with little or no bugs and glitches will ensure that they wont drive off potential new players i dont see why people feel the need to do this and i generally consider it counterproductive as an increasing playerbase only ensures that the money will be available to deliver on those promises made by the devs throwing a wrench into that only results in lost profits and fiscal responsibilities that mean less actual quality releases on timei should think that was obviousthat being said players can and will wait for the delivery of that content provided it arrives in a fashion that is neither early nor late and it is reeased relatively free of bugs certainly without gameshattering ones they will generally be happy any bugs should of course be irtoned out within months of release as this shows the devs wish to expedite the process of quickly cleaning up those deficienciesi think players harass the devs and try to destroy games because they think it will force the devs to do something about it thats kind of like beating your kids because you think theyll be better for it rediculousstupidlets move onclicky eve advertisements on the web are not really working they do not follow you either its just that ccp has paid to have them out there in a big way i dont have tracking cookies on my pc i kill them with fire i still get these ads its googlewhatevereve is an awesome idea and its a great game yet how many players are looking for a wasd alternative to clickclick when they start to playpeople like first person they can relate to it eve controls more resemble an rts with a single ship you can control surrounded by a few scores or hundreds even thousands of other ones people start asking how many ships they can control at the same time you tell them one unless they get two accounts and then they have to dual box this is whatr i here in rookie chat and generally how i respond ive made a lot of accounts and closed more than a few to date i think i have accumulated 910 accounts of which only two now are subscribed and two others are still active for a bit hmmm
eve online banner ads remind me of half a dozen other cheap browser game ads and thats sort of what you expect when you look at them ive played eve for over two years and i still expect this that has to changemake sure they know that it is an mmo not just a browser game but a fully featured game with content that is fully installable on your pcsure lots of people like browser games even i do but they drift between them and generally stick with one or two eventually they may get bored and look for something else but most will play them for years this is not good it means the vast majority of players have their game and theyre not about to move ono game for instance looks a lot like eve in the ads yet it is a 2d game with no real content sorta pen and paperish never played it but ive met a few fanaticseve has to look differentit has to stand outit has to be recognizedthere are a lot of space games out there particularly browser based oneseve needs a movie or more than a book or graphic novel i never heard of it until just before i started playing and i cant recall exactly how i figured out it was a real game browser games lack account security they also have somewhat different devs that do odd things and have questionable marketing and unknown motives they are not legitimate businesses and you have no idea who is running thema lot of people shy away from that they fear for their personal security and rightly so the administrators and others on the other side of that equation know where you live within a certain radius and gather your personal information personally i dont trust them myself though i have taken my chances in some limited fashion its especially a concern when yuou are aware that they know how to code and manipulate code and are capable of doing any number of things which will compromise your personal securitya legitimate company gets credibility and it is best to be recognized as suchtrustretail releases and advertising companies like ea games and others are well recognized and no longer need a retail presence or much in the way of advertising and what they do need they have on the internet or through console releases a lot of games stores no longer carry retail versions of pc games yet when you walk in you may see a release on console and ask if its available on pc word of mouthbittervets cough im a bit of one myself there are many things in eve that have disappointed me most of them however are related to the community and not the gamethe other bittervets are what they are for different reasons in many cases though im sure some were driven off by slander trolling flaming and all the rest this wonderful community does to itselfgreatest mmo community is not an opinion i share though i will say it is perhaps the largest as it exists within a single shard universewe are together always this means we have much in the way of competition and there is only so much of any one thing to go aroundat what point does the community outgrow the gameit already hasfortunately we have wormholes which allow some players to experience their own success where there was no room for it before this is rapidly becoming like any other part of eve howeverhow many systems in nullsec are not claimed by an alliancea handful or more at most and they are not particularly interesting or even available unless you happen to be interested in joining a coalition without being able to hold space in nullsec one of the most profitable ventures in eve depending where you reside the other is wormholes how can any alliance fund or gather a fleet to contest nullsec dominance by other alliancesunless they have friends willing to give them space and support their growth they cannotwhat is the most profitable venture in highsecmissions
passive incomeplayers who play browser games and enjoy rts generally like these games because progression isnt limited to time played income is continuously generated with limited effort such as with planetary interaction eve involves markets and player driven economies ships are destroyed and lost and pirating and griefing are the most common of activities for many players these losses cost isk and players are forced to continuously grind missions mine and pve to generate the income to replace these losses the alternative is plex which cost money and increases gameplay related costs which sometimes does not fit in the budgetparents not everyone who plays eve is 30 something like myself how many parents like to spend money on a game or watch their kids spend money on a game monthly and potentially for years to come possibly for multiple accounts not many i think plenty of people are living beyond there means already and many just dont have the ability to cover these game associated expenses for the sake of entertainmenteve allows players to cover this cost with isk earned in game through buying plex in a player driven economy earning this isk takes time a passive income is counterproductive when considered alongside development costs and a monthly fee based game how to resolve thisgiven that its a player driven economy the introduction of more passive income will up the cost of plexs and many other things so that may iron itself out regardless someone has to pay for them initially so passive income will also result in less plex being bought from ccp and introduced into the player driven economyplex cost more than the monthly fee though only by a few dollars and that decreases somewhat with the number purchased plex is cool it offers something most mmos do not the ability to turn real money into in game currency and wealth its also used for charitable donations by players to aid in relief efforts for disaster victims from timetotime as organized by ccpthis is cool im disappointed to say ive never participated in any of these efforts as they always seem to happen when im short on real life money and ingame currency not sure how that happens that the occurences coincide with my being broke but thats just the way it has worked out so fardespite all that passive income and plex and profit and development may not work out to be a practical thing at this time that is for the devs to decidei think eve and ccp for the most part is doing well every indication is that that is true but representation and appearances can be deceiving and i do not know if that is the casepassive income will encourage new and old players alikehighsec is the starting point for all players it is also the least profitable place to remain in the game unless you happen to be some guru of financing or run you own personal isk generating website or both regardless of that there can only be so many gurus and those following wont be so successfuleve is economyas an economy based game eve relies on player driven markets and competition in those markets is fierce supply and demand is the key and often the market is oversupplied in many areas yet these areas are localized and centered around three primary regions all these markets rely on local activities which draw players to locations of interest as well as accessibility from surrounding regions and nullsec jita is the primary of these locations with its market extending to the far reaches of the forge dodixie is a trade hub reliant on mission activities and rens thrives on pirates and missions alike as well as access to the great wildlands and beyond amarr exists on its own with close proximity to jita detracting from its potential worth as a trade hubnowhere else in new eden serves as well in these capacities and many systems and regions are empty
this is getting rather lengthy isnt it ill try to make the last part briefhighsec needs to see an increase in passive income to encourage players to join or stay beyond their 14 day trials who might otherwise never play or leave within the first few daysgriefers and others like them tend to ruin the game for many save themselves and discourage new players from joining or staying eve is accepting of griefers and even encourages them yet hom many parents wives or just generally people enjoy their spouses or children being subject to name calling profanity and similar activities or even taking part in these activitiesit prolificatesi was in an euni fleet once for a short time on a roam and was subject to a cursing swearing fc which anyone walking past my door could here if they half listened imagine someones mom listening to that and tell me how long they would be playing the game afterthats not the worst of it i see racial slurs sexual connotative derogatory references and multiple other things in chat in most any system in eve people read this it is not complimentary or flattering sometimes its quite plainly disgusting or flatly offensiveeve does not have moderators for local and its not possible to do so this will discourage many from playing or allowing others to play the gamewhile i do not personally get too offended or even get offended at all depndent on content and direction it does happen sometimes i fear that my landlords may be disturbed upon listening amazingly that has not happened or at least they have said nothing about itall my voice chat comes through speakers and i do not wear headphones they make my ears itch or sweat and are generally uncomfortable any more than 20 minutes of listening to anything on headphones damages your ears anyway no matter than volume or quality of the soundthink of two teenagers sitting at a pc while one of them plays eve the second is subject to all the first experiences in many ways and may not share the same casual disregard for the contentreputationim trying to break down all the possible barriers to effective marketing here and finding there are a lot of them weve established that flaming and trolling turns people off i think thats a big one this is not pvp its person vs person and it usually results in one side being disuaded from continuing to play thats what happens when you actively work to disrupt someones enjoyment of an activity its even against the eula despite that its not monitored watched or otherwise dealt with in any real fashionwhen a playerbase is comprised 80 of people who enjoy bullying and pushing around other people it is rather hard to remind them that it is not an acceptable activitythe same applies to botters generally the two groups are comprised of the same or like individuals hackers and the like are no differentwhat do they hackers in fps or other games enjoy mostderiding other players for their incompetence or lack of effectivenesssee the common trendanyway thats not really what were here about and is mostly a seperate issue though it does affect the outcome of any marketing schemeintegrityevery developer needs integrity to see the fruition of their ideas accepted by the common whole marketing is typically targeted and the choice in how it is targeted results in the type of customer it draws what is the largest customer baseeves playerbase is not growing or accelerating in growth it is stagnating as players make their way to other things and every step forward sees an increasing number of losses yet their are more active players at any given time than i remember there being two years ago whats the reason for this are they bots or real players or just multiple accounts or both the latter i think is truewhy do people quit
sorry to say mars but your post is very wrong on so many levels that i dont even know how to respond to each point youve mentioned without breaking the eula so ill just kindly ask you to stop posting because you are only embarrassing yourselfthanksabout the subject increasing the available monthly buddy invites was a great idea viral marketing  best marketing getting back to making trailers that are coming from inside the game world was a great move trailers should continue to be like that it wont hurt to have the little all scenes in this trailer were captured using ingame rendering engine title before the video it helps presenting how eve really looks like without having to download a massive client first to see it about bringing back old players that left the game you cant do it by doing something like anomaly nerf players that have left the game usually dont bother with ads about eve on other sites those who have left know where to find the information about whats going on inside the game  the devblogs and honestly speaking from grayscales devblog to new forum fiasco you must work hard to bring at least something that community really wants in order to attract old inactive players old players havent left because of the lack of the new content after all
thats your opinion and you are welcome to it consider this thoughplayers lose interest in eve and move on to other games whether they be new players on trials or subscribers that have been with the game for some timeto answer my earlier question why do players quitlack of successgriefinglack of budget available to pay for the gamenothing to dobitterness over areas of the game that have been changed and unwillingness to overlook or adapt to a new developmentfrustration as a result of any or all of the aboveif you cant get players to stay in the game then what is the point of marketing it costs money time and resources to market a productlook here and see the results of recent marketing pay particular attention to the period following mid 2009 to late 2010 and 2011 check subscriptions 150k  1m under mmodata charts v32 on the left
sorry if this is naive but cant we just pay militia for military conquests and fine the losers wont that incentivize them to attack and defend their complexes how much you lose depends on how many npcs on your side that were killed presumably they arent capsuleers so the navies are hiring these militia to bolster their forces same for rewards get paid depending on the number of hostile npcs that are killed that may take a little of the heat off pvp once npc civi navies show up in a fight as there is money to be wonlost
in the downtime frenzy when it still existed both sides would have near perfect intel for an entire constellation at a time and good fights were not happening more than oncetwice per dayeve players are risk averse by nature so if they can outnumber the target they will lets say you give out plex location and pilot name rabbits are soon identified and ignored while fighters are swarmed which in turn makes them rabbits  all the while the rabbits are closing plexes at willif the aim is to close plexes which it is for all standing grinding alts then the life of a rabbit is the only sensible route  in short you cannot polish the current system to any kind of shine it has to be deconstructed and rebuilt if it is to have any sort of meaning or valueyou would need to make it pretty damn high pay to make it worthwhile especially if timers are to stay  iskhr is all that matters to the people you would attractnote you already get pretty good isk for offensive plexing by way of tags and loot just not a widely known fact
that is not because eve players are genetically cowards its because the game mechanics never reward anyone to engage in anything except blob warfare the game mechanics proposed in this thread would make it so the strategy is no longer to blob up but to stay spread out and fight again its really easy to make the fighting spread out make a mechanic where people have to be at several places at the same time just because ccp has never added that to the game doesnt mean it cant be done  or even that it would be difficult to do rabbits wont be ignored but they will constantly be frustrated if they try to do what they do now if you want to gain occupancy it will no longer be a good idea to form up a big blob so you will no longer have blobs chasing a rabbit the side that has pilots spread out throughout the entire fw regions will win the occupancy war the best way to win would be to coordinate pilots throughout the entire war area having separate squads that can cover say 7 systems each call this a sector or zone these squads might be between 120 people you dont need to go chasing anyone if they move into a different squads territory the squad that is there already capping plexes in the area can just hop over a jump or two and kick him out you can stay put capping plexes in your sector or zone while the rabbit wastes time running around the side that spends more time running instead of running timers will not win if they run you let them run and continue to cap plexes lets say the rabbit runs 10 jumps from you and goes into another 20 minute plex you ignore him when the intel pops up you can talk on vent and let your militia know that this person is a rabbit that way your own militia will not need to send too many resources good pilots to kick him out the local militia covering that sector can let him waste 15 minutes then make a jump or 2 kick him out and cap his plex if he wants to go running several jumps and start another timer that would be fine let him he is just wasting his own time not the time of people who want to fight when he gets to new plex the intel will pop up again and someone in your militia can hop over a jump or 2 and kick him out again before he can cap a plex they can run but they cant hide no one needs to do any chasing and rabbits accomplish nothing
if people can not fight for themselves in plexes they will not be as useful to the militia this is because they will constantly need to pull pilots that could otherwise be running plexes to their defense if one militia is bad at pvp and needs 3 people to kick out 2 of the opposing militia same ship classes then they will need a larger active militia if your side is outnumbered this can of course be a problem i dont think eve should change that but there are things you can do you can set up coordinated attacks in different regions lets say the other side has a blob of 50 people but you only have 20 up in taff well you can try to focus your 20 in frigates and capture minors or you can use jump clones or shuttles and get your 20 in bses to cap majors in a distant system like tzvi yes of course the smaller force will always be at a disadvantage but because there are these different sized plexes with ship restrictions the smaller side  if it is well organized and equipped can still bring a fight to different regions allot of how this will play out is how fast can one militia be in the right sized already fit ships in a different region capping plexes the better organized militias although smaller militia will have plexes capped across the universe before the bigger blobbier militia can organize resistance also there can be other things that help smaller militias lets say caldari have all of their systems occupied and already occupy half of the gallente systems the mechanics could then start letting gallente have cruisers in minors that way even if one side is outnumbered there can still be good fights the storyline idea is that these last systems are true bastions of gallente loyalists so the gate engineers give secret intel to the gallente side to help themi just ask that you think about what i am describing and ask yourself if it wouldnt be great if you agree it would be great but think the op proposals wont bring that about then ask why and what would need to be changed
in all honesty you underestimate the fortitude of the alt rabbits and the will of people looking for fights to chase them downankhesentapemkah used the 5 standings loophole to run all those plexes and she was never interested in fights and damar griefed her constantly but he was one of the only guys who has ever had the will to grief the rabbits on a consistent basis nobody else wanted to waste their valuable game time chasing somebody around who didnt want to fight
x gallentiuswould you agree that rabbits would rather not have their whereabouts broadcast to the opposing militia if you agree then this change will not encourage being a rabbit it will discourage that behavior we may disagree about how much this will discourage the behavior the only way to really know is to try it but by creating mechanics that continually discourage that behavior we can get rid of it the current system so strongly favors carebearrabbit plexing that of course that is how its currently done but this can change and it is really not that hard please though we have to stop blaming the players for achieving their objectives in a rational way eve players will continue to rationally pursue their goals we need mechanics such that when the game is played rationally it brings about allot of small gang pvp currently hide and seek alt rabbit plexing is the rational way to win occupancy if the mechanics change so that is no longer the case people will stop doing it but let us back up before we talk about mechanics changes i really think we need to have a vision of what we want to happen when we log on in fw otherwise we are just making proposals that will just lead us in circles if we cant be clear about what we want a gaming session to be like we shouldnt just be shouting out proposals that sound good my vision is to log on and be immediately told where people are trying to hold plexes so i can go and fight for them lose a ship get in another and get back in the fight keep going at it with whatever you can afford to throw at them hopefully there will be some amount of reward to holding plexes to help defray the cost but for the rest i may need to use the credit card or do some carebearing whatever that is the pain that makes losses hurt i understand that the thing is once i have endured that pain and i have ships placed strategically through out the war zone i want mechanics that bring about the fun i want quality fightsi dont want to spend so much time grinding missions so that i can stock up on ships only to warp around for hours and eventually just lose them to blobs i want to log in and if we are severely outnumbered i want to be able to have chances that a certain coordinated attacks can be pulled off by having the right ships at the right places so i can do something for the war effort other than sit in a stationsif the other side has 50 in a blob and we have 20 lets say we get into frigates and go 15 jumps to a new system they follow in frigates thinking we will do minor plexes there surprise we have fully fit cruisers in that system so we can start running medium plexes they would then need to have cruisers nearby and hopefully we would be able to knock out some medium plexes before they can reorganize if they do we can jump in bses etc if they come then we all jump clone back up to some other system and start running plexes there again having coordination and logistical supplies would be a huge part of it it is better to be on hand at the decisive point with ten men than to be absent with ten thousand tamerlanesee i want the war to be more dynamic in this way i want it to involve logistics and strategies and tactics not only yeah we are waiting for our fc to finish a cigarette so we can get back in blob formation and see what we can fight we will accomplish nothing other than hopefully find a good fight again we can still have large fleets and i dont mean to put them down but i think fw can offer something different as well it can offer fast paced small gang pvp like eve has never seen this is the vision i want to strive for what do you say is it worth trying to get a game where that sort of game play happens if so then lets figure out why our current mechanics dont lead to it and how we can change them to bring that about i dont want the only option to be get in a large fleet i like large fleets too but small gang pvp is what ccp has never given any love too its time and fw plexxing is how to do it
while i can see a lot of flaws with this option i really wish some form of it was introduced i started playing this game at a young age and made the terrible mistake of adding iceblade to the end of my name because i thought it was cool its certainly not cool 7 years on still it has convinced me never to get a tattoo

i pretty much agree with everything said herethat is one of the big problems with pvp and ship combat in pve too much clutter not enough view and way to far zoomed out just to fight effectively generally you have little or no idea what your ship orientation is and less idea of what you are facing you cant see the opponents ships and you cant see yours everything is just little crosses bigger crosses distant lightshows colored tags and your overview readout the overview is useful in pvp as it is virtually your only usable tool for selecting targets but of less importance in pve large scale battles make it less useful and more cluttered clutter is definitely a problem i refuse to drive a crappy rusty car and would rather walkwe cant always choose where we live
there are already keybinds in the game for basic drone commands thank god as a further improvement how about you assign drones in your bay to a group then drag that group out of the drone window onto a blank module button and anchor it there presto one click drone group launchrecallcan we have a keybind for open container pretty pleasehow about a command for take all and a keybind to go with it or even better yet some way to combine these twosomebody mentioned moving the selected item functionality into a bar on the bottom of the screen good idea or better yet make it a toolbar that can be placed where you want it this toolbar could be player controlled as to how many buttons it has and how big the buttons are and also what commands are assigned to what button drag and drop would be the preferred method and you already have icon artwork for most of it from the current selected items window any function that can be assigned to the toolbar should also have an equivalent keyboard shortcut or can be assigned to one for the game controller jockeys out there the key point here is more customizable oneclick or keyboard functionality and less right click and scroll context sensitive carpel tunnel hellbetter yet kill two birds with one stone by building into the client a means of detecting andor preventing clientside exploits like multifunction macros and bots then make the ui opensource and let all of these folks out here build and share their own ui setups based on the underlying functionality everybody wins and ccp doesnt have to do the heavy lifting
let team bff go through the big thread of things to fix pull out 100 or 200 or 50 individual items that they can fix and are willing to fix then let the us prioritize them via voting items are fixed in the order of most popular to least with the understanding that there is no guarantee that items far down on the list will be fixed in the next few releases if ever

that last bit is actually against the eula anyone who has a subscription is not allowed to also have a trial at any time thereafter
methinks its also against the eula to have multiple accounts at all however theres no enforcement discouragement or even lack of encouragement and its even accommodated for in some ways and if really needed trial accounts can be upgraded essentially for free via referals probally also against the eula also no enforcementand not really reliably detectable even when taking no countermeasures against detectiona lot of eula terms tend to fall under the category of ifwhen we wantneed to and arent even nominally enforced in most circumstances let alone even making the attempt or having the ability to do so on any reasonable scale i kinda wonder why they even bother considering theres always a we can ban you anytime for no reason line in there but i suppose they gotta say what they may or may not ban you for somewhere
all true i guess but it would make it more of a pain and a chore to do there by making people do it less its exactly like money laundering in real life the laws make it diffucult for you to transfer money directly to alqaeda but some people or companies like haliburton get around it by buying and giving them goods etc or have offshore accounts with neutral parties like cayman islands these i expect to be in game as well you can find a neutral sec third party to move your money through thereby incurring a slight risk that they run away with your dirty cash the idea is just because it wont dissuade everyone it will make it time consuming enough that most people wont bother except for the hard criminals and for them they will get what needs to be done this may also open up the market for trusted money lendersescrow holders the gnomes of zurich
actually i dont think i ever meant it to unilaterally stop people from getting around the system just make it enough of a pain for them so that they dont do it as easily just like real laws in rlyes you can item exchange crime gear but then one of your players is going to have to fly from high sec to low sec for example its a pain and it takes time which has a real isk value thanks to plex
okay something contructive to add what about these amendments0 status counts as  as far as sec status penalties are concerned so you cant use new alt middlemen without committing some crime first but the sec status used for money transfer checking is that of the previous downtime so you need to wait a day to use a new alt who just committed a crime so that he will be able to receive  from 10 mainas he is now a  toon moving money to  toon will cause sec penalty dropping his sec status further soon it will be unusable to move money to  toon due to costs as described belowbesides the sec penalty for transferring isk from a  player to a  status player add a tax that will tax a percent of the transferred funds depending on your status differentialfor instance 10 transfers to a 01 character 99 criminal money moving taxso for every point differential you get taxed maximum of 15 for 10 sending money to a 5 status person along with sec penalty in this casethese taxes only apply to transfers between  status characters  characters sending to  chars pay no such tax but  to  do this represents how much more costly it is to move money around in the criminal word those swiss bank accounts dont come cheap and includes the elbow greasing fees to pay off the right people to cover the tracks of the money transferaforementioned moneylaundering skill help reduce the sec penalty for crossing money from  to  or vice versanew criminal banking skill helps reduce the tax on moving money in the underground 1 per level
how about thistake your stupid idea put it ina little box and bury it in the hart of a sun i suggest tama
why are people so scathing in these forums pmsanyway at the very least it identify whether or not this really is a problem in the next qen i would like to see some statistics on money transfers from good toons to bad toons or vice versa on the same account im sure our chief economist should be able to come up with those numbersfor instance if it is extrodinarily high that good  characters send money to  alts on the same account that means that piracy isnt a self sustainable profession and contrary to what some of you may think im not antipiracy i am procapitalist if the piracy profession is not supportable without funding from good low abiding alts then that just means that the profession needs to be fixed economically its not fair to pirates to have to play a good character just to fund his fun life in the criminal world basically it amounts to the same principle as contraband why bother making laws that prevent the sale of boosters and drugs with associated penalties or other laws that prevent the funding of crimes with clean money and by extension clean economic activities when we allow the biggest loophole of all in the prevention of the funding of crimes with clean money
i respect that point imigo it is clearly made and obviously reflects the true nature of people to which i agree but using the same example just because some people will always find ways around the rules it doesnt mean we should abandon all attempts at making rules if that were so we should just get rid of the irs and collect taxes on the honor system are there loopholes yep likely which is why this assembly hall is a place where we can all bounce ideas around like adults but dispite the loopholes that may be exploitable by the few doesnt mean it shouldnt apply for the majority in your example just because the pirates engineered an ingenious method of ganking your friend is that grounds for throwing away the sec status rules because they didnt work
its actually pretty clear and the we can ban you anytime is for those situations when they know and cant prove it multiple accounts is not against the eula it states as much in there i know because i read the damn thing 34 times just to make damn suresome of the eula isnt enforced or not enforced fully i know players start trials after subscription and do it quite often some even roll trial after trial out while having an active subscription or two it allows them to watch rookie chat and use it for recruiting or various other purposes its pretty obvious when someone continuously mails out corp invitations to multiple players who have just started playing on a new account or trial even more so when you know they dont mail out to new players that are alts on subd accounts ive started a couple accounts in the last few months and received the same mailouts on both of them though only once per characterstill its purely speculation on my part isnt it given they could actually just be opening new accounts like i am starting a trial with a sub is against the eula second and following accounts must be legitimately purchased as retail boxes with game time or bought off the eve online site with the account purchase registration fee for 1995 contracts are horrible to read and involve all sorts of ambiguous statements but that much is clear as are other things when carefully read
what kind of answer is is this are you really a csm delegate if you are i can see why the csm is worthless
a simple answer to an awful proposal that would require breaking every single aspect of eve
whenever somebody makes such an overarching general statement like this a kitten somewhere dies seriously it goes against the whole point of town hall forums every idea should be heard and of you dont support it then dont click on the support button if you have constructive criticism then please voice it as it is welcomed nothing is personal so please try to keep the discussions professional
and once again accepting that contract will incur the sec hit reading comprehension ftl mars pretty much covered the trial partapparently the only thing they can do is flail in desperation by blowing things out of proportion because of their selfserving notion that theyre somehow the center of the universe that theyre somehow above the laws and rules and that they should for some reason be automatically entitled to all reward and no riskconsequences they know it will work and they cant let that happen so while they in their ignorance and stupidity troll the thread they only bump it up for the rest of u to see their riskaversion and inability to deal with even the slightest of consequences and most likely theyll still do so even after this
why do you think this is the biggest problem
i think the point thats trying to be made is that in this game you have wide freedom of choice to do different things but actions have consequences having alts that do unsavory things which are supported by isk made from legitimate business is fundamentally no different from an rp standpoint of character a hiring character b to do things which character a is unwilling or unable to do himselfeven this can have consequences there are corporations and alliances who dont like to have members who are connected to behaviors they dont approve of and which do thorough background checks including checking player trade transactions in the walletin addition as has been pointed out the proposed mechanic is unenforceable without making tremendous changes to just about every way that players interact with each other in the entire gamei understand the sentiment behind this proposal i recently returned to empire space during a transition period from one nullsec home to another and i have to say highsec is distinctly more hostile than i remember it being a couple of years ago the number of people leveraging the game mechanics to make paydays off of the average lawabiding empire citizen appears to have increased tenfold based on the harassment i have personally experiencedwe know that ccp wants to move players from empire to nullsec they have stated that many times so whether its right or wrong i seriously doubt we are going to see any changes to any of the game mechanics currently being used by griefers and gankers to pad their wallets and killboards at the expense of carebears this is doubly true now that ccp had to nerf their latest nullsec carrot of fully upgradeable pve space the long term effects of such condoned hostility on the retention rates of new players could probably bear some consideration howeverimho the biggest news here is that the op didnt receive a reasoned reply of this nature from our honorable csm membership instead of a rudely curt response on the one hand and the epeen fueled flame on the other shame on them
so like i said not enforced cant be enforced on the internets that virtually means the rule doesnt exist and even a grain of thought and a halfhearted attempt at detection countermeasures like a basic proxy plenty of those running around and since you dont actually care about the security of the throwaway account would render detection virtually impossible short of bringing in reallife law enforcementseperate thoughtoverall its more then a little counter productive to create essentially pointless game mechanics that would only encourage people to run amuck with your eula policies you cant feasibly enforce when things degrade to the point of virtually punishing those willing to obey the law and rewarding those who arent the rules only serve as encouragement for themselves to be broken the rapid spiral of the base hypocrisy of the situation can only lead to tearsall for an arbitrary proposal to make criminal more like real life in a game not to mention the founding theme of the game is a basic lawlessness completly lawless in null and any attempt to create abitrary strict enforcement gamewide is simply counter intuitive to the entire rest of the game theres currently only 1 real strict enforcement in the game and thats concord and its not even game wide its set on a delay so you can kill people anyways theft incurs no wrath beyond what somone can actually do about it and scams are encouraged i think youre playing the wrong game if you want strict enforcement of anythingi did rather like some of mars concept of introducing some sort of rewards system to create a meaningful difference between high and low sec standing seeing as how creating meaningful differences actually adds depth to the game on the other hand an arbitrary and unrealistic determination that criminals should be banned from interacting with noncriminals in virtually every way via magical rules that fell from the sky and exist somehow while not fitting with any other game element or theme to date does not they can still interact would be a pretty failtastic argument seeing as how that interaction by the nature of the proposals themselves makes any interaction with a criminal involved an interaction only between criminalsnot to mention creating rules you admittedly know can be bypassed with only the hope of annoying people as they do so is immensely crappy game design at that point youve regressed to the point of creating rules simply for the purpose of annoying your players thats generally known as a terrible and pointless ideatldr no thats stupid
i think that this goes against the you have rights to what you kill principle i think it would make the life of a salvager too easy everyone would just end up being salvagers when you consider how much training you need to fly a noctis vs a fully loaded pve battleshipwhat salvagers should try to do instead is to engage the pveers that you scan down ask for the right to his salvage for a price of course i think that you will find that if you offer a fair price for the salvage most pvers may just be inclined to give it to you instead of wasting their time to have to come back and scrub the site which is the intent of the salvaging profession i believe to this end i think that loot and wrecks should be made blue after say 1 hours plus a random 30min i thought this was already the case no but before this time they should be yellow note i said wrecks as well i do believe that if a thief is tractoring your wreck with you present then you should be able to shoot them without concord i know this is against current ccp policy but hey this is a proposal afterall and i think that with the addition of the all things go blue after 2 hours rule then i think its reasonable to shoot before the timer runs out scanner should be able to find cans and wrecks after the 1 hour mark this seems to me like closer to the expected behaviour which isa if you are a salvager present during the pve battle you should need to ask for permission to salvage from him and give him money presumably for that rightb if you are a salvager and you scan down a site which has been a marked abandoned pass the 1hour mark then you should be able to salvage at will live battle sites can still be found but you will be notified of such perhaps use weak and strong fusion signatures as a story devicec if you try to tractorsalv any wrecks while they are still yellow before the 1h mark or without the pveer making it blue for you before the 1h then you should be shot without consequence
this andthis give mission runners more chance to aggress not less therefore not supported
no if i put in the effort in destroying the ship then the wreck of said ship is mine and mine alone unless i feel generous enough to abandon it willingly
next objection please
i think you have some good ideas let me share my thoughts according to the numbers you use in this post2 this is not my idea it was posted in 2008 when ank posted she capped 111 plexes in less than a week without a single pvp kill someone in that thread reached the obvious conclusion that this shouldnt happen and that the militias should be notified like you i just added that persons idea to my post so it wouldnt get lost the intel on plexes would not be broadcast to the militia channel it would be broadcast to a separate channel that no players can type in it would just say something like cearain entered auga minor merlin 9 mins pilots could refresh this list if they wanted to see whats going on otherwise the intel would just appear as plexes are entered or lefti addressed what would happen to rabbits in my assembly hall thread it was a long winded post but suffice it to say rabbits will not benefit from letting the other militia know where they are at and anyone who thinks rabbits want the enemy to know where they are is horribly confused if you want to avoid blobs you spread out the war zone as much as possible having set front lines that blobs can camp is just a bad idea spread out the objectives and you spread out the blob and get small gang warfare this is really pretty easy3 rats almost always discourage pvp i cant tell you the number of times i had rats rip through half my shield tanked rupture before i even got in pointing range of the enemy and therefore had to warp out rats are stupid and balancing them is a waste of time also you cant fly the best pvp fits you need some sort of active tank mod which is just stupid if players dont want to fight for occupancy then they should lose speed tanked frigates work against rats much better than they do against pvp ships so again i think the opposite is true here if there are no rats you dont need to fly a stupid speed tank or active tank ship you can fly a ship that you would like to fly in pvp
4 i really dont think we need to limit how many ships are in the plex i would prefer not to do this maybe 10 frigates would want to fight 2 cruisers in a medium i think if we make use of the entire map and all the different size plexes then blobbing will not e an issue there is simply too much ground to cover i posted some ideas regarding your first idea in the features and ideas thread im sort of neutral about it will the button disrupt everyone on the entire grid or just within the button range yes i am supporting this thread because it has good ideas that we should think about notifying the militia of plexes being taken is an obvious one until this is done fw will always be a joke the other basic divide is between people who want occupancy to be a pve activity and those who want it to be a pvp activity those who want it pve want better rats and more requirements to kill them you seem to agree that rats should simply be done away with for occupancy if you want to shoot red xs we have missions in faction war belts regular missions sleepers in whs incursions anomalies pirate missions etc please just keep them out of fw plexes  let the players win or lose that war in pvp
im interested to know this too
im curious to know whats going on too
i asked some ccp dev about this at fanfest and all i got as reply was a shrug and a referral to petitions
i dont know what you lot are on about i have received several tower bpcs as loot dropped in recent monthsnot supported rng rules
then your the only one also i demand pics or proof of some kind as i do not believe youkeep bumping ppl
dont really give a  as to whether you believe me or not you can demand but all i give to you is fingerconsider this a free bump for your whine thread
dont feed the troll
yes please moreover please do it asap i would say include it in the first small patch please psshame on me but i should to confess i once kill friendly logistics just because there was no way to identify its intentions
csm proposal raised for your comments
delete this post wrong forum thank you
hi my name is axemaster after fighting solo in lowsec for over a year i decided to wardec people in highsec but i have a teeny tiny problemmy name always shows up blazing red at the top of the local listas you might imagine this makes it very hard to sneak up on people in high sec and kill them fortunately there is a simple two part solution1 add an option to make your name appear at a random position within the local list that way people whose names start with a dont get screwed over permanently based on the spelling of their name2 add the ability to search local just like we can already search our cargo hold additionally make it so that you can right click in the local search bar and have a nice little menu appear showing any online contacts currently in system but you have to click to bring it up  it doesnt just refresh on its ownplease lets correct this unfair mechanic it unbalances the game and the fix is simpletldr  people whose names start with the letter a are at a huge disadvantage in highsec wars since they are spotted instantly by their targets this is unfair since names can never be changed we need the option to scramble the position of our names in local to fix this problem
would be nice to get rid of local all together i know its been a dream for 8 years but still
yeah in the meantime please support this threadthis is kind of a fundamental game imbalance it probably wouldnt take a dev longer than a few days to fix it and a lot of people would benefit
thats not an imbalance i know exactly how you feel but i cant support thislocal is just fine as it is
title says enough i thinkt2 strip miners detect the target they are activated at and automaticly switch mining cristals to the needed type simple and effective how many times does it hapen that you forget to switch crystals and mine a roid with the wrong crystal verry anoying realyi think this solution can be implemented without to much reprogrammingbecause a target type detection is allready in eve
less work for bot coders
sarcasmand people thought mining couldnt get any more boring sarcasmif veldspar crystals did not work for another ore than i might support this since its only a matter of losing the specialized bonus i dontmy missiles launchers dont autoload the best missile for my target why should my strip miners
i think you just topped him not that there was anything particularly wrong with his statement in the first place it would need to be a bit more than no social life to enable you to play 2357 and thats assuming you dont stop at all for bodily needs as for the insomniac i believe that after a certain period of absolutely zero sleep you wouldnt be able to even play eve probably end up crazy what ccps hitting is the accounts that are online and active read not afk from dt to dt continuously for days  weeks on end something which could not be accomplished without breaking at least one of the rules set out in the eulaperhaps im stupid for even responding to this troll 
account sharing is against the eula for a reason and it is not sharing it with your kids same client same ip same family not some stranger who is potentially going to steal your account or do something that results in you being bannedpeople who share their accounts with their kids are fine in my book and i dont see a problem with it picking on that is completely inane whatever the ops honesty this thread doesnt have to be trolled simply because it looks like fair gameim sure ccp would have no more problem with the idea of sharing your account with your kids than me and if you read the eula im pretty it tells you why account sharings is a bannable offense its a security risk and potentially a way for rmts to farm isk with one account and multiple computers in different locations for the sake of argument this is a parent with kids would you say no if your child asked you if he or she could play if you do youre either a shmuck or a concerned parent if youre a concerned parent turn the computer off and go spend some time with your kids wtf
ccp doesnt have a problem with that but it will hold the owner responsible for everything that happens on that account so if you want to be safe dont share your account with anyone its pretty clear the op is full of  though so im not sure why that would matter in this casefor the sake of argument i think you should let the kid have a trial account and if he likes the game pay for his own account there is no need to share accounts especially since you can only train a single character at a time so account sharing doesnt work that well in any case if you cant afford another payed account let him play a f2p game its not like there isnt any lack of free mmos in the world if a character is actively online doing things 2357 its a macro or a sweatshop and im pretty sure there are ways to determine pretty conclusively which one it is and it was likely done already we are just seeing a macro usertroll trying desperately to come up with an excuse for his behavior and no one is taking his explanations seriouslyeither way this is something that belongs in a petition by trying to get a mob going against ccp the op made himself a free target for ridicule
it is blatantly obvious that the op is full of  ccp doesnt ban a person for being logged on and playing 237 if they did that drf wouldnt still be here he obviously did something he shouldnt have and is just trying to incite hate against ccp
the only way to fix the bounty system is to tie it into a players skill points nothing else will work in eve
why why is it a good idea to be able to grief someone down to 0 sp
what part of fairness dont you understand of course their would be checks and balances maybe one would be a player who has bounty and is killed can not have another bounty until so much time has passed were not talking thousands of points lost per bounty maybe 1000 or less per billion dollar bounty this would determined by ccp for fairness
sorry what exactly is the problem you are trying to solve here can you provide a link to any previous discussion you may be referring to
what a bounty on peoples skillpoints i first read this as a system tied to skillpoints ie more skillpoints  more isk bounty which could be acceptable if you actually proposed the way of doing itbut a bounty to take out peoples skillpoints is just terrible the bounty system should encourage pew pew not discourage ita bounty system tied to the value of a players ship would be far more workable a system where the bounty hunter gets a portion of say half the value of the destroyed ship and mods paid from the bounty on a players head would work much better that way people are encouraged to go out and fight pirates and more pew pew gets to happen
greetings members of the csm and my fellow eve players for a long time i have looked at the capital ships of eve not including super caps and wondered why only two types well i have an answer for that what i propose is a subdreadnought capital ship geared towards killing off battleship and battlecruiser sized vessels a ship which would still run capital repair modules but not be able to preform siege or triage functions instead of utilizing capital weaponry it would be limited to large weaponry large turrets or cruisetorpedo bays with a damage bonus to assert its position as a capital class ship for instance a caldari ship would have 8 highs 8 launcher slots 7 mediums and 4 lows its skill bonus would provide it with a 15 damage bonus to kinetic missile damage per level also as a capital they would be limited to using an internal jump drive and would not be able to activate a standard star gate i understand my idea would need polishing before it was ever placed in game but i believe this would add some more depth to the rather bland capital side of the skill tree and ship market
agree with this would be great to have something  reminds me of the orca  but for combat still a cap but able to perform that role in between bc bs sounds cool to me
machariel comes to mind or rattelsnake
macharials and rattlesnakes are battleships that are not designed to hold up to the sustained damage that this ship class would be built to take
yea this sounds awsome would add a bit more variety to fleets
stupid idea carriers and supercarriers are already tremendously proficient at killing off subcaps and you want to introduce another class to further cement the idea that anyone who uses stargates is a second class citizen worthy only of providing easy killmails to the ubermenschen in their capital shipscap fleets and supercap fleets should be vulnerable to subcaps unless they are properly supported this suggestion runs counter to that basic balance concepthow would removing the need for any subcaps except cyno alts from a fleet add a bit more variety
no he wants a carriers defense without triage in an expensive hull without the capital remote reps etc
not supported this would effectively remove subcapitals from the battlefield
this ship would not be designed to be able to combat capital ships at all it would simply not have the dps to do it
in order to even further encourage everyone to only ever use capital ships
ccp should consider attaching reinforced support processes to fleets themselves  either at preregistration or after the fleet grows to a certain sizesystems are often unpredictable for manuevering fleet fights outside tournamentsunless the attacker achieves significant surprise by attaching the support directly to the fleet resources can be scaled to fleet size and be in the correct location for a fight the main complexity being the combining of resources when two or more fleets begin to meet and exchanging generic object location with local star system processes to keep data exchange with local star systems simple members of such fleets could be prohibited from nonfleet combat activity while in large fleets no mining no docking at stations no market information etc only major system features for navigation and ships it would be easy enough for fleets to drop out a few players to shop or whatever else is not supported in fleet  then allow rejoin the additional processes when two or more fleets meet could be held in reserve for other task like cases where the battlefield begins to drift apart or have multiple separate locations possibly in two systems like where local pilots are station camped in an attempt to prevent their rearming and rejoining the main battle elsewhere or like where defenders hit an attacking fleet passing through a gate from both sides  two systems battleanyway the key load on local star systems would then be exchanging generic information on targets present for indpendents not in either fleet before they attempt to join in battle or ninja salvage
its a huge pain for a corp especially one based out of 00 to unrent offices all over new eden i suggest we add the ability to unrent the offices remotely as a failsafe i suggest the offices become unrented at the end of the office billing cycle in addition a notification should be generated stating that someone has initiated the office removal similar to how the billing notifications are generated today this hopefully help people avoid getting assets in impounded
buffing up a cruiser to be able to effectively fight a ship ten times its size and dozens of times its cost is just absurd the main role of a hic was always subcapital fleet warfare being able to tackle supercaps was just a neat secondary function they could do back when supers were motherships and did no damage and when titan doomsdays were laughably weaktimes have changed though and thats why i think we need a different solutionboth of these would affect its capabiltiies in the subcapital battles that make up the hictors primary role the neut immunity just doesnt make sense supers and titans are immune to ewar and you can still nuet them and sieged dreads can also be neuted a cruiser being randomly immune to a specific type of ewar that even ewarimmune ships are vulnerable to just seems oddi think youd need a specialty ship for this role either a new class of capitals or tech2 dreadnoughts
why not increase the sph rate it would keep a lot more players 1 month to x rather than 2 months to xthere are enougth skills to keep people busy even at double the sph rate people dont just play eve for that next skill bookwhy not increae the sph rates rates across the board by either reducing the multiplier on skills or add things like 7 implantsin either case the change is trivial unless those who have ran out of skills that interest them get annoyed with some noob getting faster sph than they did 5 years agoi want to see more players stick around and i want to see eve stay with its unique skill system but the base or adjusted rate of sph is not some holy grail that needs to be protected at all costsmore skills completed in shorter amount of time equals more players exactly the same train of throught which led to the removal of the learning skillsonly been playing 18 months so my view isnt that important
people arent going to stick around because of what will probably be a close to 1 billion isk implant set i doubt many people will use them at all im basing the 1 bil on the price of 5 implants if they turn out to be priced like 6 ones 5 bil is closer to the mark
please note lots of updates are incoming i need to submit some petitions about something but will working on this this thursday
this understood that they are niche ships but currently the niche is so small they are more of a curiosity than something useful a little love would help
tengu is a nicely made ship its versatile and strong but mostly versatilegallente t3 is so limited in comparison and to add injury to the mess it cant do drones worth a dammhow about u at least make t3 balanced
i dont know if its possible to clear the acrimony herethe concept of suicide ganking being essential to the eve economy is lulztrying to call removing insurance on concorded ships anything but a nerf on suicide ganking is equally lulzthe point is this a suicide gank gang kills my t2 fitted hulk with 3 t1 fitted destroyers they use a covops pilot in an npc corp to provide a warpin point by the time i realize anything is up my ship is deadthe 4th dessie takes out my pod full set of 4s and mining yield implant toast covops pilot scoops the wrecks and runstheir loss around 15 million isk 2 million tops one strip miner ii costs more than that to add insult to injury their hulls are insured insurance on a t2 mining barge lolmining in high sec on medium ores with a hulk and an orca im using two accounts to generate 15m isk an hour if im lucky it takes me 20 hours of play time to replace the lossthe gankers on the other hand only need one t2 module to drop to turn a profit and if they care about their sec status it takes them maybe 5 hours in a stealth bomber to fix it most of them dont care they just use an npc alt to drop a fitted ship in system for the 10 guy to pick upand of course the gankers are adamant that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this riskreward ratio and why wouldnt they everything is in their favor in their view of the universe anybody not playing the game the way they think it should be played is a loot pinatawe wont even get into the arena of the us vs them carebear name calling schoolyard bully attitude that seems to have pervaded the game over the past couple of years what everybody knows and what nobody will say is that most suicide ganking is not rp piracy but mildly tolerated random carebear griefing and just because it doesnt meet ccps eula definition of griefing doesnt mean thats not what it is alpha popping the dumbass carrying a cap parts bpo in a shuttle in niarja is one thing using the same mechanic to inflict grevious loss on some unsuspecting pilot minding their own business because you can is something else againwe know the situation will never get fixed fixed would be1 transferrable kill rights gank my industrial player my bounty hunter of choice is coming after you hopefully when you are flying something expensive things would be a little different if pilots could have some reasonable fear of having the shoe on the other foot hmmm since most gankers are purpose built alts this has less utility than it might seem but player justice is the best kind and the current system is lopsided against pilots not specialized in combat2 make security status something meaningful less than 7 you cant even pass through a highsec gate anymore lower yourself to less than 7 inside a highsec system better hope your medical clone is in lowsec so you can destruct your pod back home or get ready to do a lot of belt ratting this will solve the issue of 10s flying around in pods until its time to do the dirty deed and jump into a ship handed off from a safe npc corp alt or kicked out of an orca oh and ccp supposedly doesnt condone killing pods in empire so killing a pod is an automatic 10 no matter where you started3 make security status harder to earn back system hopping in a stealth bomber killing one battleship rat in each nullsec system for a few hours is not even a fair trade for the dirty deeds being done introduce a metric that reduces the positive status gained for every npc kill for each negative incident the pilot has in the past 90 days what unfair you want to be a pirate then go live in lowsec4 fix the bounty system how does it serve anyone to have a game mechanic thats a joke since we know none of these things are going to happen all we want is to remove the insult from the injury no insurance payouts for gankers
support for logic
there is not should never be and i hope never will be any safe space in eve
agreed about as logical as the dea paying you for your henchmans life insurance and health bills from injuries sustained from their drug raid on your heroien operation yeah had to spell it funny to pass the child filter
farms and fields there is already a mechanic in use in the game to attack farms and fields and it just got a lot more powerful again since most alliances now have their most valuable space concentrated into a very few low truesec systems easily pinpointed on dotlan its called cloaky afk camping where a player leaves a cloaked ship and the threat of a cyno hotdrop basically afk in a system for days even weeks this is a widely discussed and widely used tactic to attack the morale and economy of your opponent the problem i have with it is this it should not be possible for any player to accomplish anything of any value unless he is actively at his keyboard playing his character afk cloaky camping is the same thing as botting in this sense and needs to be nerfed hard either put a module timer on cloaks so you cant afk your ship in space until next downtime or introduce some probes into the game that can detect cloaked ships albeit with long scan times or some other similar difficulty neither one hinders an active pilot much but puts an end to the afk camping posthasteim all for having a legit way of doing this instead that even small gangs can accomplish having raiders being able to accomplish something returns much of value to the game including penalizing large power blocs for concentrating all of their forces in one system right now there is little risk to such tactics since system sov cant be decided decisively in a short period of time and it shouldnt be but somewhere in this game the usefulness of small mobile raiding fleets has been relegated to the level of im bored lets go roam and see if we can kill something and i think thats a shamesome of the better and easier ideas involve making existing structures vulnerable to disruption by smaller units than sov warfare fleets ihubs and certain station services like refining and production are excellent targets for disruption disrupt pirate entrapment no anoms spawn until its fixed disrupt an ore prospecting array the system suffers a certain percentage of backslide in industry activity these are just examples that would need balancing and also possibly a limit placed on how many times these structures can be vulnerable in a downtime period having these structures vulnerable to disruption through a different method than hp prevents blob vulnerability gives defense fleets time to form and react and could give the archeology and hacking skills and modules a new lease on life once caveat no more than one module per ship if having more modules active has an effect on the amount of time we dont need to give rise to specialized disruption fits and ships make the attacking gang trade off a midslot per ship for how much faster they want it to move and put a limit on it say 10 modules or so im just freeform brainstorming here but you get the ideatwo more ideas more industrial based minerals and ores are going to have to be fixed soon anyway in case nobody has noticed the price of mega and zydrine are tanking fast and theres nowhere to look but all of the new miners mining abc in gravi sites in rental nullsec systems theres way more of these high end minerals hitting the market now than demand needs so either blueprints need to be updated abc rocks need to be nerfed or make high end ores more valuable because of the mix of minerals they refine into not that they provide an overabundance of a particular rare thing that can overflow the market this introduces more low end minerals into nullsec which is what builders need to build there for the local market instead of importing at the same time its past time that reprocessing got nerfed its ridiculous to me that anything can be recycled into its components and then rebuilt with no loss you should never with perfect skills and location be able to retrieve more than 9095 of what went into something when you recycle it
some pretty simple things here like someone already noted them beforebalance 00  low sec  high sec in percentages high sec only drops 25 of nullsec ores low sec 50 add more trash minerals to highend ores forcing a player to mine veldspar in 00 sites is just dumbcomet mining they dont need to fly around in space or whatever but damn let players mine moon mineralsmoon mineral spam double the number of tech moons just mirror the north to the south or something like that i do like the high amount of valuable moons but spread even more of them so individual corps can run their own full reaction chains im 00
mars shut up please you are not helping
i like this idea and could def use it on my second acct wow was that name a mistakeas long as 1 it costs somewhere in the neighborhood of a plex to buy 200300m isk 2 there is traceability aka or history tab and 3 is only available once a year like a remaphowever i havent seen any suggestions for ingame consequences for a name change imho all of the cons to a name change mentioned in this thread are simply not enough i want ingame agents and ourfriendlyneighborhoodspacepolice to look at that character down at their records and back up to that character and say and who are you again simply put i want any char that gets a name change to also take an across the board standings hit including sec rating something meaningful something that will really make people wonder sure i got isk out the wazoo from that last corp heist but do i want to have to go back to running 4seve  consequences lets do it
nearly 8 years ago i created a name based on a chat handle that i had been using for many years a chat handle i had grabbed off a cd jewel case alot has changed since then my character names remind me of a time i would rather forget i would love the opportunity to give my characters new names i would be willing to pay real money for such a privilege i support this very muchwhat about thisafter name is changed in game emails sent to any and all people in game who had this person in their contacts listcorp roster notifying them of the name change contact lists are updated with the new name just like in wow w the friends listedit i just read amarr priests post suggesting emails as well 
supported i love my name but i know a few people who started back in 20032005 who were confused at the character creation with the differences between logins  character names or we and ended up with numbers in their names these people always mention wanting to be able to buy a name change
pretty sure ive supported this one before but yeahup we go
i cant believe im fixing to agree with someone from nc but ya the current effect just blows was watching youtube yesterday and saw the original effect and was like omgwtfbbq so fing cool then i wondered why ccp got rid of such an awesome graphic
looks like we got to wait a little longer the new ui backbone is delayed again
i agreethe current cyno effect is terrible and boring the old one was awesome id like the lightning storm to return or something built up from that
ever since ccp screwed up my fitting system i cannot access all the fittings i have i use 7 different raven fittings for various activities as well as other ships needing multiple fittings also why should i be limited on what is stored on my hard drive what right does anyone especially a company i pay to enjoy myself have to say what can and cannot be stored on my computerfix this now
this a thousand times this
change the current drone user interface to drone slots similar to weapon slotsdrone  weapon hudproposal drone user interface

quoted for emphasis burn them with fire
i agree that right now af are generally a second choice to a t1 cruiser somewhere they need to be something more than a cruiser with a frigate sig radius and hitpoints if a fourth bonus is what it takes then im all for it
yes
i would think this would be a nobraineri disagree with the poster who thinks ccp has something against drones due to lag lag is only really an issue with heavy concentrations of player ships like fleet battles i think the issue is more along the lines of ccp not wishing to create parity with a weapon system that can run more or less automatic for fear the level 4 mission hubs would be crowded with multiboxed afkdomis simple solution give drones some love and remove the focus fire command let drones run on automatic but if you want them to kill anything in an organized and efficient fashion you need to be directing them from one target to anotherhonestly i dont see what some implants would hurt either waysupported
apparently the mining foreman mindlink is only available as a reward for doing the level 4 storyline mission shipyard theft and then its random which mindlink you getthe incursion 100 expansion dumped over 20 new level 4 storyline adventures into the mix debate about nerfing level 4 missioning aside one of the results of diluting the pool of storyline missions is that the supply of mindlinks has shrunk considerably the price of a mining mindlink is spiking rapidly recently passing 300 million isk all of the market hubs show a marked drop in units sold to match the price spike seeming to confirm the price spike is caused by a serious drop in availabilitysome of us are wondering if this is a case of unintended consequences and if so could we please see a fix maybe add it to industrial oriented npc lp stores like the prospector implants
all the mindlinks have spiked over the past few months i remember back in the day when id reprocess them because they just werent worth dragging to a trade hub and later on swapping them out of my ganglink alt rather than clone jumping those days are long gone however and while im not opposed to them costing a bit more it is getting a bit crazy ive also noticed a massive decrease in the price of pretty much all other implants and lp too not sure whats going on but something got thrown out of whack a few months ago
yes i believe that level 4 storyline mission is also the primary supply if not only supply of all of the mindlink implants meaning all of them have gotten a lot more rare i think there is not nearly the demand for the other mindlinks as there is for the mining foreman one so it is the one that is most notably spiking on the marketeven at 4050m isk the extra 5 yield takes a good while to make a return on investment unless you are boosting huge mining fleets in which case you are just helping your corpmates most likely not seeing a personal benefit at the prices this item is rapidly approaching its becoming more of vanity item than something that makes economic senseexample 2 hulks with an orca booster is a reasonable scenario for mining multiboxers max skills all around with t2 crystals mining arkonor the implant makes a difference of around 16 pieces of ore per cycle per hulk or around 13500 m3 per hour at this rate which is close to an ideal scenario for a single player it would take 100 hours of mining to pay for the implant at current prices if you boosted more hulks the number drops but then those hulks are not very likely to be yours and its almost impossible that larger groups will be mining arkonor all the time they will be clearing gravi sites in null or wh space most likely in which case the value of 5 drops considerablyim seriously hoping this is not what the devs had in mind unintended consequences hopefully
i agree and support this

support for gal ships and hybrid ships in general
support generally rebalancing gallente ships and hybrid weapons the two will have to be done together to insure its meaningful without creating another flavor of the year op setupmake damping where it cant reduce locking range below 10km what the race that uses the shortest ranged weapons fields an ewar system that isnt effective inside their optimal this makes much sense if the universe was an orderly place gallente would field jammers and caldari would damp instead of the other way aroundone of the underlying problems i see that nobody has touched on is that gallente have no choice at all in the type of damage they deal like amarr but unlike amarr emtherm kinetic damage is one of the highest base resists for shield and armor across the board in the entire game when you get into t2 hulls this becomes even more so there are certainly issues with fitting bonus speed and penalties that need to be addressed on various hulls as well as tracking and what not but lets not forget that everything in the game is more resistant to gallente base damage type than anything elseone way or another gallente need some love
have to say that i agree with most of what julius has said thus far it is very clear that he has quite a bit of experience when it comes to flying and fitting gallente ships of a wide variety of classesit is very clear that as a whole blaster platforms are not competitive on the same level as matari or ammarian ships when it comes to pvp there are of course exceptions to the rule such as the taranis vindicator and to a lesser degree the vigilantprimary the problem i believe stems from a number of issues stated a zillion times in every thread blaster ships are easily kiteable hard to fit and lack the real world dps to be chosen over ac or pulse boats in the majority of pvp encounters what we need to do is address the primary issues and i believe that julius foederatus first post illustrates these very well we need better relative fitting slightly better speed and imo increased drone bay size not badnwith to allow some flexibility in the extremely inflexible environment blaster ships work infurther more id like to focus on the both the astarte and brutix both of these ships need improvements as do all the tier 1 bcs and field commands due to my lack of extensive experience with anything but gallente bcs and the astarte ill keep my points directed towards them although i think universally all field command should be given full t2 resists just like hacs afs and fleet commands the astarte and brutix each need another low slot pure and simple if a ship is going to be stuck with an armor rep bonus then it better have enough lows to take advantage of this bonus the astarte like all field commands should be given a raw hp buff to give them more hp than their relative tier 1 or even tier 2 counterparts i do not understand why almost all other t2 ships have more hp than their t1 variants where t2 bcs have less these two ships should also be given another 25m3 dronebay to allow 1 wing of meds and 1 wing of lights to be carried
i reallyi dontwhatoh you guys
support for the lolz and futa
lulz and futa cant make something second life ish without girls with es
this isnt a proposal to add nudity so stop tossing around rating changesits just for letting people fit their vatgrown bodies with whatever rigs they want so to speak im honestly surprised we dont have even more esoteric options considering the nature of our immortality
up to the top for great justice
i support seeing nonplayer ships of the stations race flying about like in the movies like seeing some caldari fighters zipping around inside jita 44 but only as purely decorative effects i do not support the waste of developer and server resources it would take to render other players inside the station not yet at least too many other things to work onalso if they add in a visual undocking sequence instead of the black screen loading bar then at least give us the option to opt out of it in the settings menu id rather not have to wait five minutes while my phoon taxis out of the station ever so slowly
lost a carrier kill the other week no one saw it hitting self destruct another issue amongst the spam of drone notificationsatleast give us an option to turn them offsupported
perhaps a modification of the notification system so you dont just see the latest notification but the last few and also have the notifications separated out by type so you can see say the last few incoming dmg outgoing dmg and effects notifications simultaneously rather than getting them all one after the other in the same spot then also allow us to change where the notification windows appearsedit forgot to support
i agree the drone damage spammage is overkill either combine all the drone damage into a single item like with grouped guns or give us the ability to turn it off while keeping turretmissile damage notifications on
its simple if you have your drones grouped then their damage should show up in a notification by group just like moduleswe should also have the option to turn drone damage notifications offsupported

you would think that from a pr standpoint ccp would understand this already perhaps they should consider some pr help since they currently have a pr problem with a good portion of their customer base over some issue or another why are we having to take this effort to get ccp to do something that is so clearly in their best interest
thank delsie yes that was my point exactly i know of more than 1 beginner that i brought on who quit before their trial ran out because he just kept on getting ganked it is too bad though that i think you are right in the sentiment in ccp is to not change these game mechanics because they dont believe its an exploit my point was to put to discussion that they actually are exploits by way of inconsistently enforced laws and to propose an idea on how it may be fixed it needs a lot of refinement as a lot of you have pointed out but i think through collective discussion it has become something better than my initial one thanks for everyone who contributed even though it looks like it will never get any attention by ccp or csm rented not sure what you mean by interact if you mean communication then this is absolutely not part of the proposal only money transfers if by technically hard to implement i dont see why you think this i thought it would be a simple dt task to go over the player donation transactions in the wallet apply penalties yes you can still contract goods but as i mentioned before this extra part of getting the goods moved around is a pain that these people who are getting around the sec status penalties need to pay it doesnt cause any pain for regular players only those which are funding crimeone thing im not sure about is really how often do you find yourself transferring  to  toons or vice versa now how many of those times were either a moving cash from a ganking job to your high sec industrialist alt to buy shiny things making use of dirty money or b sending cash to your  status ganker alt to pop a fellow indy funding crime with clean cashif most of the crossstatus money transfers are not of this kind then i will agree that these new rules arent necessary otherwise i think we have a problem which this solution is just one of many that we can think of to solve it but feel free to suggest others i think mars did and i do see merit in that approach as well i would support thatthe actual problem being that isk transfers is an exploit to get around sec status penalties for crimes
i was mostly referring to annas insane extreme and bad additions to your proposal your original proposal is rather mild and even if i dont particularly care for it at least isnt plain awful like annas rabidly antired ideas for rules prohibiting all interaction with reds in contracttrademarketinspaceetcyougettheidea which would apparently even extend into nullsec despite there technically being no one there to enforce it well it just doesnt make sense in generaland i suspect the vast majority of crosssecurity transfers are from highsec alts to people who live in lowsec where you can scarcely do anything aside from lose sec status seeing as how lowsec is already nearly worthless i personally see no need to nerf it further unless of course i simply hate reds but thats not a terribly good reason
ah gotcha yeah as i said it would be interesting to see those statistics in the next qen but i suspect events like hulkkageddon definely are clean cash funded i seriously doubt there are that many true life career pirates really we are talking just about low sec living pirates here enough to mobilize to run hulk my suspicion is that most hulk gankers are alts conjectural if anyone actually knows please feel free to correct me
if its so worthless why would ppl even lose sec status for it oh right killmail whoring with no need to raise it back up which goes back to and lo and behold u still r
i think the majority of the people suiciding for hulkageddon are from highsec griefer corps rather then people who actually live in lowsecanna you say that almost as if ive ever been a red which i havent thats what they all say yes im sure youre very well informed about that oh wait you arent punish the reds for being naughty blahblah youre tiresome
let me go on record i like margin trading its an important skill it should stay on the other hand im getting really tired of these threadssuppose there were a rightclick menu option that let you query the current purchasing capacity of a given buy order that is to say you could right click and see exactly how many of the buyers 1000 unit buy order he could fill given his current wallet balancewould this be an acceptable compromise
no i read the dev blog but its been near 6 months and not a peep further about it im fine with them wanting to make things better and more detailed but what about the news feed theyve taken every bit of the story away even news about incursions has become a rare site whats the story where is the depth what the hell is sansha doing how goes the war who are the big names involved ccp as per norm are not answering any questions silence is not story telling and story telling is exactly what eve needs to be eve
have more patience the project announced in that devblog is more important
i like things that help haulers obviously black frogred frog however i think you may have overlooked one or two things first courier missions are an option for new players lp earned can be converted to items and then sold for isk second its not really possible to be a pure hauler and make real money in this game third you can already haul player passengers as clones in a rorq i like the idea of having a sort of ferry npc passenger mission type im not exactly opposed to moduleskillhull related ability to haul players but its a pretty complex undertaking and one i doubt theyll be working on anytime soon consider this what if the hauler logs off while in the middle of a job what if the contract then expires what if the hauler intentionally fails a contract while still in space
5 to warp speed per level would get my vote
not supported afk travel is already ridiculously slow in a freighter how about increase the base velocity lose the speed bonus and give it a warp speed bonus that will benefit both afk and atk pilots the time spent aligning is roughly 40 seconds with the best skills and implants you can get it down to around 20 so youre only saving something in the realm of 10 to 12 seconds per jump with your proposed bonus the bulk of time is spent in warp or if youre afk moving towards the exit gate
seriously this is ridiculousthreadhey lets make our freighters align 25 fastercool great ideax20if you really want another bonus for bonuss sake reduce the base agility for 20 before you raise it with the racial freighter skill for 5levelyou know freighters are actually meant to be slow right

you should bugger off to wormhole space if you dont like local it mean you either have to get better probing skills for when you jump in or be better at videogames to get kills
as a huge space i love my localhowever im also ok with making local in nullwhwherever an infrastructure upgrade that is challenging but possible to destroy by a 20m gang or so no timer limitations or anything plus there should be sov levels involved sov 4 system gets you a constellation beacon network for instance  which would also mark some kind of actual applicable reason for constellations to be therevov
i guess im a little confused about why there would be an argument over the merits of this ideaisnt it an obvious design flaw if people with names starting with a are at a serious disadvantage compared to people starting with zim actually quite experienced with both probing and pvp in general thanks ive been flying solo in lowsec for almost 2 yearsmoreover i dont have a problem with local in general im against the massive disadvantage i face simply for making a mistake in name choice 3 years ago when i created this character
because you can not know what your targets resists are a roid does not have resists its just veldspar or scordite or any otherbasicly a t2 strip miner would work like a t1 except you have to carry crystals with youill ignore the bot commentsupported
i have several mining alts and i dont find that loading the proper crystal for what im doing is an onerous taskthe idea is of even more dubious value considering its utility to those wanting to mine on autopilot with third party softwarethe devs have better things to do than automate tasks for lazy players and bots not supportedif we were going to be doing something useful here we would be discussing why the rightclick load crystal menu always loads a new crystal when one is available even when you choose to load a used one

quick bandaid fix maximum bounty payout  value of the pilots medical clone any left over goes to the next person who podded him and so on
at the moment a bounty does nothing except show a wanted text over your picture if you want it removed get an alt to kill you and nice isk if it would be fixed like picking up a contract somewhere and deliver the corpse to the bounty setter it would work better but then again people could ruin somones character by continuesly setting bountys on him or herid say get rid of it all together
i like this idea have something like a carrier except use guns its not like dreads are useful anymore and carriers only main purpose is for logistics and moving  so yeah having a 1bil ship that can kill like a carrier would be nice hell having something that could potentially effective against super carriers would be nice too
ccp cant reinforce on the fly they need a dt to do it
keep buying that tinfoil you need to add more to your hat
or you know run missions until i come kill you its all up to you
i think you meant the poor will always get poorerand yep youre right just like in real life thats the true nature of capitalism and being that eve is hypercapitalistic that will always be the case
though im only currently running l2s i too share some of the same feelings as the op i havent gone up against sleepers or done incursions yet but ive heard lots about the ai that seems like a good idea for all npcs fewer smarter opponents would be a welcome change
when i started eve i joined fw gallente as a noob in a t1 fit thorax with 400 mill to my nameblew the whole lot in 2 months and went to join a new 00 alliance that some friends were joininggotta say i have real fond memories of fw in the start it was a great way to get into pvp there were nightly fleets going out with fcs of various caliber and it allowed you to blow up some ships and get the feel of it allim sad to hear its not what it once was what i personally think would fix it would be some reward for claiming systems that helps your side pvp a few faction rats come help you with clever ais may be or perhaps the odd turret on the things you have to defend together with combat arenas that limit the size of each sides fleet and its makeup more so you get more alliance tourney style pewpew going down logistics and t3s in some all the way down to 5vs5 t1 cruiser slug fests for the newbies with a little reward for the winners a crate that opens when you blow up x enemy ships in the plex maybe that drops a shineystill miffed ccp didnt show up to the fw table even if i didnt go to fan fest
some interesting posts in here so far heres what id like to see1 destroy the tier system for frigates through battlecruisers per the proposal linked early in the thread having tiers just doesnt make sense anymore now that isk is much easier to acquire than it was back in 2003 remove tiers boost the capabilities of the lower tiers to the top tier and increase build costs to the top tier2 examine the ship lineup to ensure that all ships serve a distinct role for their race3 revamp gallente most people point to hybrid weapons especially blasters as a major reason why gallente currently suck one of the devs said that blasters were meant to fill the shortrangehighdamage weapon role and they still work fine in that role i mostly agree that the problem is not blasters but the ships they are fitted to however there are some tweaks that should be made to blasters mainly a slight boost in tracking its absurd that autocannons outtrack nearly all of their blaster counterparts considering the enormous differences in range i also love the idea presented earlier in this thread of making blasters a low rofhigh alpha weapon this would certainly add some flavor to short range weaponry as that role doesnt currently exist finally since blasters are so sensitive to range changes reduce their reload time to 5s so they have a bit more flexibility to adjust to different rangesfor blasters to be effective they need to be on ships that can get to their target quickly and hold them while they apply their dps several game mechanics changes have made this task far more difficult than it was in the past especially for larger ships namely the speedagility nerf the web nerf and the warp scram buff compounding the problem is the fact that buffer tanking has become increasingly necessary to counteract the larger groups of enemies that one faces now compared to the past since armor buffer tanks reduce speed and agility the problem just gets worse heres how i propose to fix blasterfocused shipsblaster ships require speed and agility armor tanks reduce speed and agility therefore blaster ships should not armor tank minmatar are a mixedtank race so we know it can work gallente should be a mixedtank race too change the following ships to be shield tankers thorax deimos brutix astarte megathron and possibly the hyperion changing the hyperion would mean that there would be no activetanking armor battleships and with the exception of the rigs at least it can active tank without losing much speed and agility for those ships swap low and mid slot count swap armor and shield amounts change ship bonuses where needed like astartes armor rep bonus and adjust powergrid and cpu to account for the change that simple change will make the ships far more agile and also leave more low slots available for damage mods to help the ships fill that high damage rolefocus on making gallente the most agile race acceleration and short sprints are more important than top speed if a blaster boat has to travel long distances its probably going to die anyway either from a lack of capacitor or simply that it cannot make up the damage difference once it finally gets into range minmatar should still be the fastest race but gallente should be most agile to help fit their role in addition to boosting base agility or reducing mass other ship bonuses could be introduced to boost agility like a reduction in the mass addition from mwds and afterburnersfitting ability on many gallente ships seems to assume that blasters are still king of the hill so they can be hard to fit the hyperion is the best example of this single rep  8 neutron blasters  mwd  cap injector  15 over power grid capacity thats just ridiculous compared to the other tier 3 bs especially the abaddon gallente fitting requirements should be reviewed
1 the tier system is there for a reason and its not just for isk cost you really want a bb to have the same hp as a moacaracal so the tier system should stay but i will agree on simular ships that are combat should have the tier system removed like moacaracal or drakeferox 2 cant argue with that suported3 i like that you liked my idea about atry blasters but dont forget rails too they also blow the other day i was in a drake fleet in a rail thorax and i was doing something 300 alpha on the other drakes either increase alpha on rails or make them high dps long range autocannonsi also like the idea of a 5 second reload time4 both us think gallente need to be fasteragile but i still think gallente should be armorfor me the way to achieve faster gallente should be in bonuses to the mwd 1st reduce the mass of all gallente ships2nd change the cap reduction bonus and 10 to fall off to a mwd mass addition reduction make it 10 per lev now you have fast agile gallente ships3 remove the tanking bonus from gallente ships and replace with w 10 to armor amount per lev now you wont have to put on so many trimarks1600s to havge good ehp4 if you are going to fix the speed isues and boost blastersrails there is no need to fix fitting issues as it would more then likely make gallente op
hhhmmmmm ship balancing well i think we first need to look at weapon balancing and then move onto ship balancing around weapon systems soweaponsguided missiles lightheavycruise need to have their flight time nerfed to compensate new modules similar to tracking enhancers and tracking computers to be introduced to bump the range back up this would go a long way to balancing out the draketengu problem but wont remove the strategic and tactical value of the weapons eitherturret ammo the current ammo with variations on range and damage and a small cap difference pretty much means that out of 8 different ammo types on average two types are used max damage and max range ammo needs a rework to remove this 75 redundancy of ammo differing ammo should offer vastly different bonuses if there was an ammo offering a high rof and some ships had their bonus changed from damage to rof this ammo would be more appealing vs just a high damage ammo tldr look at ammo and see if all ammo can be useful instead of a small portion of ithybrids balance this after the ammo rework shipsfrigatescruisersremove the tier system and introduce a role system but dont super specialise the hullsdestroyers general rebalance of stats and buff to make them real frigate killers maybe even a t2 hull that can ping for cloaked ships there is a demand for itbattle cruisersprophecy needs a defining role instead of just a brick either make it a ham spitter or change the laser cap bonus into an optimal range bonusferox is a hybrid boat so removereduce the launcher slots and buff pg while slightly nerfing cpu hybrid rebalance required before really messing with the shipcyclone needs a slight cpu buffbrutix wait till after hybrid fixmyrmidon remove one high slot and two turret hard points give it another 25mbit drone bandwidth and another 50m3 dronebaycommand shipschange the info warfare skill into assault warfare which will give a 2 bonuslvl scan resolution of all fleet memberskeep info warfare and its targeting range bonus however give the eos assault warfare linksintroduce 3 new warfare linksassault warfare  precision accuracy bonus to turretdrone tracking and missile explosion radiusassault warfare  range optimization bonus to turret optimal  falloff and missile flight time and drone control rangeassault warfare  targeting optimization bonus to targeting range  scan resolutionintroduce special ops command ships destroyer hulls which are covert high tank low dps with info war links bonuseschange the hullsabsolution  harbinger hullnighthawk  drake hulleos  myrmidon hullclaymore  hurrican hullmake fleet boosting less effective unless command ships are on gridslight rebalancing of all command shipsbattleshipsslight rebalancing of 3rd tier bss nothing majorstrategic cruiserstenguproteus remove the cpu efficiency gate subsystem and replace with a specialising subsystem the cpueg is completely useless give the proteus another drone sub so it can field 5 heavies when using this and the other two drone rigs give the tengu a hybrid subsystem tracking or somethinglegion is a bit of a fail boat with slot layouts review requiredthere is more but no roomblack ops has already been discussedmarauders give them something new the tractor beam bonus is now very underwhelming with the noctis now aroundactive tanking bonuses on ships this bonus has a fair bit of disparity when compared to a resist bonus the repair bonus should carry to remote repair received this would mean these ships dont lose a bonus when buffer fitted for fleet workcapital ships dreads and scs need a little rework and introduce extra large rigs for caps to increase cos
i would like capitals and supercapitals to be redesigned with a combined fleet composition in mind there are several ideasproposals floating around i liked the one that discussed the creation of separate fighterfighter bomber and subcap drone bays the idea was to decrease the amount of large to small drones that a supercarrier could vomit forth i did not like the idea of decreasing the amount of fighters and fighter bombers they could carry i see this as their role some other ideas i have been tossing around includea remove all of the logistics bonuses from supercarriers carriers should be your capital logistics backboneb give supercarriers another role this could be in the form of ship bonuses that act as command bonuses for capital ships only dread carrier supercarrier and titan onlyc allow dreads to move under normal power in siege mode they are still disallowed from warping and jumping although i would be amenable to allowing them to warp around on grid as long as the energy to warp increased substantially with distance this would allow them to warp around tactically on grid but they would not be able to warp any further without dropping out of siege moded allow dreads to receive remote repair from capital repair modules only place a diminishing returns on this repair amounte triage mode will still paralyze carriers i know you think this is unfair but it would add a layer of tactical depth triage and root yourself in place but receive more repair or forgo triage and stay mobile it would also make carriers that do not make good triage platforms viablei would like to see combined fleets of carriers dreadnoughts supercarriers and titans slugging it out you can do what ever you have to in order to make this possible please
i miss one  outpoststhey must be destroyable if peoples are afraid about the items in the outpost maybe cover them in stasis field like impounded but in spacenot dockableeve must be a cruel world or we can switch to wow
which made me think damn you el lip we have already suggested factory line modifiers hauler spawns and automated mining to help cover the lowend deficit whenif the jita umbilical is cutwhy not use a simple reverse alchemy process whereby more dense minerals is broken down into lowends with a boost to output ex megacyte is roughly 800 times more expensive than tritanium so would yield anywhere up to that ratio when catalysed
every single one of these ideas are horrible
i like the ideas to disrupt ihub upgrades but most of the ideas make the upgrade back active after repairing itthat will just mean that the owner waits until the gang is gone and then get a few carrierslogis on it and its back upi think that to be of any effect you should leave the upgrades offline for like 24 hours that way the locals will try to defend it instead of repairing it when the enemy is gonethat would result in more small gang fights as its hard to get a huge fleet together in the short time you have to safe the upgrades from going offline
i may have been unclear but i stated that this will persist for a minimum duration the reasons listed above are exactly why i did this if i can just repair the target up i will pos up until the enemies have gone 24 hours might push the worth of some of these upgrades too low though if they can be taken out by a small 520 person gang there is the very real possibility that they would be down a significant amount of the time due merely to time zone warfare increasing their ehp would defeat the goal to create meaningful small scale warfare in null sec space i lean towards a duration somewhere between 3 6 9 or 12 hours i favor one as long as 3 hours but shorter than 6 but someone else may want to do the math on this problem
its analysis and that is all ive played the game for some time and these are some of the observations ive maderegardless of that i dont believe half the voices in this thread were doing anything different than i most of what ive seen is singlessided views of whats wrong rather than suggestions to help with marketingno advertisementmarketing scheme by itself is going to bring players back into eve who are frustrated and have quitnew players see their frist 30 days in rookie chat whether they pay attention to it or not is dependent on the player but many do and voice their opinionsso why not use rookie chat as a marketing research tool if only to see what players who join the game are looking for no questions required just reading and watching new players interactthe suggestions ive seen here have been done and besides that many are not of much value on their owneve where you can train skills even while logged off  how much incentive is that really skills take time to train and instant gratification isnt on the menu either way not that a new player can see anyway until they figure out some aspects of the gamehigh sp is not required for success in eve online though it certainly does help not a lot of new players can see that and many do not know how to train their skills effectively or even know what they want to doeve is diverse not because of a phenomenal amount of content but because players have to choose where to put their sp to make every point count towards their eventual goalmuch of eves content is provided by the playerbase in reality there are only really 3 areas of play pve involving combat pve involving industry and pvp everything else is the result of player interaction with the assistance of associated skills and game featureseve is very solidly within a niche market many people simply will not be interested and no amount of marketing will keep them interested once they discover actual gameplay is not to their liking thats true of many things though and simply means increasing consumer base requires changes to satisfy the new consumer base and make them happy this also has to be done without damaging the current consumer base too much any change is too much for some while many others can adapt to small changes and some dont even mind sweeping changes to how the game is playedthis is for csm to read and make decisions on how to approach ccp and what they think is the best approach for marketing as a result of what they gather here ill let them decide whether any of what i have to say is relevent or not if you dont agree with me then you donti posted my thoughts and that is allmarketing goes farther than advertising so with that in mind why doesnt someone else post something

why nerf it why not give the smaller capitals a chance bring in a capital neut this way sc pilots will have to plan a little better and a small fleet of carriers who plan well will have a fighting chance something like setting a curse on a bs except bigger

just making sure ive shown my support for this
supported as always
10
in case i didnt support this already
yup
sure also ponies would be sweeti do support this but i think theres a rather idealized idea of how easy balancing it all would actually be by that i mean removing the tier system would be hard if you try doing balance on that many ships at once youre bound to screw something upwhat we really need is a team of designers called team judgement or something a team dedicated specifically to ship and module balance lots of mathematicians and hardcore designers you know what im saying i mean a team specifically dedicated to balance looking for trends and suchi support this topic because its a good idea but im not sure itd be even remotely easyalso one last thing that bugged me tiers provide progression within ship classes removing the tier system would kill that progression its not a huge pro of the tier system but it is a proanyway supported
supported gal sub cap hulls and turrets combined have way too many disadvantages compared to their small on paper dps advantage how in the hell is  shortest range  single dmg type  slow reloading  slow hull speed  armor rig speed penalty  crappy tracking at optimal  turret cap usage and anything else i missed supposed to balance out this small dps advantage please fix by the time i can arsed to come back to the game 
i support this also way to many disadvantages and no way to use our advantages the ships are a complete mess along with its weapons systems

cheaters bots hacks etc all exist in a half a hundred or more other games hackers are the biggest problem on the internet and its common as coffeewhy are you so ed at ccp for having the same problem as everyone else and trying to deal with it yes they exist im quite sure bots are verywhere in eve and its a big problem but there are limited means of getting rid of them and detection tools dont work nearly as well as you might think even pb is reliant primarily on real people actively searching for hackers with no more than 50 people to check on limited capacity serverspunkbuster doesnt really detect hacks unless they are old and well known it also causes a lot of lag and is borderline invasion of privacy many people hate drm and generally without considering that half the admins run private servers and are complete unknownsdrm isnt the answer at least not for eve detection in any case is limited and thats why many people get away with itit ruins the economy other things do too and id be hardpressed to identify the single highest contributing factor to a bad economy in any mmoits a problem but we arent going to be any better off knowing anything we dont already know we cant do anything to fix it so how can statistics really be all that helpful to know evidence is that knowing isnt helpful given what ive seen written here as a result of an article on eve24 newsunless they tell you directly you dont really know if someone is botting or not
look whos talking i assume u do not have proof of your highsec griefer claims or else u wouldve presented it by now so instead ure looking for scapegoats just so your 10s wont look as bad as they do cause its funny how if its done in high sec and not low sec its automatically griefing to u but hey claim all u want griefing or being a 10 your postings speak for themselves so plz continue
why would i present proof of something we werent even debating and if you had the capacity to understand plain english youd be aware i was quite literally referring to highsec griefer corps as in corps that live in highsec and who have griefing as one of their specific purposesand actually arent red most of the time but apparently you cant read ontop of knowing so little about the game does the tinfoilhat dance
heyi would like to see a complete change of war mechanicsaway from iskbased to sec status basedwhy should concord allow wars in high sec i would say to allow a corp to punish somebody who did something really terrible to them that wouldnt happen to many times in corp history i guesssoif a corp is deciding that it wants to dec another corp for revenge then let them do it with no costs at all just reduce the sec status from each corp member from the deccing corp and everybody who is joining that corp while it is in war by 1 or 2 pointsthat would automatically stop griefing wars mercenary wars fun wars or whatever as people wouldnt be able to move around in high sec after 23 war decsno isk based mechanics will ever stop the actual unfair war deccing mechanicsfly safe
and while youre at it ban fun
bad idea
i may have missed a more obvious way to check the damage on used factiont2 laser crystals but from what i can tell the only way is to load them into a gun and then mouseover the gun in the racksi propose that this is klunky and tedious and makes management of perishable ammo for lasers a pita an obvious improvement would be a way to access the information regarding crystal damage via the show info window andor with mouseover tooltips while in your hold or in station hanger
missions we need more different ones arent we more epic arcs more cosmos agents different storyline missions isnt it a time to finally add more to the gameproposal open a contest where pilots will make a story that will fit this universe agenttype region and constellation i will definitely contribute a couple of options myself reward having your mission ingame is the best reward
in all likelyhood ccp probally regards missions as having partially ruined the game not that theyre bad just that many others things they actually want you to do are poorly designed but at this point missions are so central to the game they cant really be removed or significantly altered so instead of developing missions further when they already dislike the dynamic theyve somewhat caused in the game they have and will seek to do other things to draw away from missions like wormholes and incursions
seriously didnt ccp just add a pile of new missions into the game across multiple patches werent people ing for months that the new missions were terribad for all sorts of reasonsa i dont know what to do theyre not in the missions reports list or more accurately theyre there but i dont want to search to find themb i did this mission with a 200k reward and got my l4 faction bs blown up wtf ccp why is a new mission with such a cheap reward so hard1one11c omfg why did you guys add so many new courier storylinesrepeat as above ad infinitum et ad nauseamas for the cosmos  epic arcs i seem to recall the lower tier cosmos arcs being called the worst idea ever in terms of dev time vs player time because theyre a one time deal and nonrepeatableon the have the players develop new missions that tends to go two routeshalf the community wants to know why the players have to do the ccp devs jobs for them and the other half would put together a l4 mission with 4 waves of 5x 14mil isk bss with a few small ships as triggers in each wave followed by a second room with a few more bss as the mission completion trigger technically something like this mission was added as well so players could pull 20mil isk in bounties and farm the storyline for a week straight
i find it weird that this thread have gotten any responseflaming a post isnt the only that need to be done if you agree our disagree please say sothis way ccp and the csm can know if this is what the eve community want our doesnt want
no
agree on an agility bonusas to afk pilots it makes no sense to buff afk piloting since they are afk ie it doesnt matter how long it takes they arent at their keyboard

i would like to see stations be destroyable kind of like a salttheearth carthrage option for invading alliances dont know if i agree with everything you stated mechanic wise
nowhy would an alliance ever want to destroy something that they can take and use for their own especially when it costs billions to build one even if we could destroy one i seriously doubt anyone ever would fitting repair cloning refining youd really throw all that awayand youd land a wrecking shot on an already crippled nullsec economy thats precisely what we need id be righteously ed off if i came back from a vacation to find myself podded by an outpost kill its risk enough already just moving assets into one knowing up front that your alliance probably wont own it forever
you didnt follow the wars of the last yearshere you did find the point currently some of the 00 ground is more safe as higsecwe got inflation for shipsbountiesstationsmineralswe need more sinks
huhright now i am led to believe that you heard something from a friend who heard something from a friend who read something on the internets about what null sec is like according to the last quarterly economic report something around 11 of eve players are in null sec youre pointing your isk sink at a very very small group of players who have already been hit hard by anomaly changes and a questionable complex spawning system what would this fixand please post with a character that at least shows you have some experience in dealing with the item youve proposed
reducing the time required to trade through sorting objects on the metalevelpropose to introduce in the dock sort items in the metalevel this will allow less time to sell due to the fact that many players selling items only above a certain price for example 100000 isk the remaining items are recycledU043CU043DU044CU043D  U043CU043D U043D U043EU043EU043BU044E U043FU043EU043EU043C U043EU043EU043A U043FU043CU043E U043FU043E U043CU043EU043DU044E U043FU043BU044E   U043EU043A U043EU043EU043A U043FU043CU043E U043FU043E U043CU043EU043DU044E U044DU043E U043FU043EU043EU043B U044C U043CU043DU044C U043CU043D U043D U043FU043E   U043EU043E U043E U043CU043DU043E U043EU043A U043FU043EU044E U043FU043CU044B U043EU043BU044CU043AU043E U044B U043EU043FU043BU043DU043E U043DU044B U043DU043FU043C 100 000 U043A U043EU043BU044CU043DU044B U043FU043CU044B  U043D U043FU043EU043A
do you mean something different to being able to sort items in a container by meta levelyou can do that already but need to add in the column type it is not on be default
indeed you can change to the detailscolumnwhatever view add meta level as a column and sort by it

i had hoped you guys would listen when ccp didntwontthanks for pushing  that has the potential to make this game harder for me to playif this gets sent to the thousand paper cuts project as written itll just be another worthless feature to meplease give us the ability to turn it off at least that way at least im not just kicked in the  by you guys
activating autopilot on double click of location links or overview serves no practical purposeremove autopilot activation when you click locations multiple times the ui is occasionally somewhat unresponsive for various reasons and players excited sometimes players do not notice that activation has overridden their warp to a way point station or elsewhere
i havent listened to it but it looks like allot of game design issues were brought up im sure mittani repeated the same line over and over again csm has nothing to do with being a game designer and its only the other liar candidates who claimed that im sure he didnt comment as some sort of lol amateur game designer so im sure there wasnt much to hear im interested in hearing how he fulfilled his promise to be ruthless manipulative bastard im also surprised that there wasnt a section on ccps managerial technique and the pros and cons of ccps flavor of the month scrum team set up after all we voted for you because you correctly identified this was your most serious concern facing the csm please do focus attention on that by all means advise ccp how their dev teams should be interacting and communicating with each other that way this managerial disease that causes the backlogs bugs half implemented features and schizophrenic development can stop can we have that added to your summit topicsim sure not only ccp and us players but the entire mmo world are waiting with bated breath for you to give a critique of ccps managerial process and what their best practices should be after all im sure that since you practiced law in a real life law firm for a few months you are highly qualified to do this please stop wasting time on these game design issues lolamatuergamedesigner get to the underlying problem of ccps management structure asapafter all we voted you in because we read and agreed with your platform we did not vote you in because we are pathetic drones lacking even that slight sense of independence and selfworth required to vote for someone other than our internet spaceship alliance leader again that was not the case no no no not the case at all so please write up a memo to all the ccp executives staff telling them how the devs at ccp are supposed to communicate from here on out

did i miss something wheres the fix hybrids main topic i didnt see it anywhere but its been a hot issue for quite a while now surely its more important than make motherships bigger ffs
second half is comming up it will be in post 3 on the front page i am still formatting it all so it is categorized properly is on his lunch  dinner break
a quick thing i would like to see changed is when you fleet up with an orca the orca pilot has to reconfigure the orca to allow fleet to use it great but it sucks if you are in a mining op and the orca has to drop off load in station the orca has to re reconfigure ship every time if not the pilots in other corps trying to put things in has to see the stupid message everytime they put in can you make it so that if an orca pilot is in a fleet he or she can configure it once as long as that person is in the fleet or just get ride of the message that pops up inform me once and check a box and not have to see it again miner and orca pilot help me out and get this fixed
1 eliminating the tier system does not mean that all ships have to have the same stats ships can have different stats based on role3 i left off rails because i have no idea what to do with them frankly i think the problem with them might be more about the nature of combat in the current game than rails themselves they are the long range low alpha weapon in the age of medium range highalpha engagements they need some love but i cant really be arsed to think about the balance of a weapon system ill never use4 theres more than one way to skin this cat but your proposed changes are an enormous buff just to overcome the incompatibility between armor buffer tanking and the need for agility also no t1 ships can have both an armor bonus and an agility bonus without compromising dps so changing multiple bonuses to fix the problem is only going to work for t2 ships if at all5 regarding fitting upgrades there are actually only a few ships where this is even a problem the hyperion being the worst the megathron has good fitting capability for its role for example im not suggesting a fitting buff to the whole lineup
can we make amarr drones usefuland the amarr strategic cruiseri am an amarrian loyalist and as far as i know the amarr drones just suck and the legion is the worst of the strategic cruisers by fari am no expert but that is what i always hearread i never read or hear that they arent the worst
on the topic of destroyersdestroyers are nearly as big as cruisers as such why dont they tank nearly as good as cruisers the argument for signature radius has been discussed for quite some time but it seems kind of silly that a ship as big as a rupture should have a signature the size of a shield tanked rifterit might be better to increase the destroyers slots fitting and strarmsh hp to that of a cruiser class vessel while continuing to give it bonuses to small class weaponsthis would do a number of things aside from making level 12 missions extremely easy ait gives the destroyer survivability in fleets bmakes it not only the bane of frigates but makes it significantly harder for that dramiel to solo killand cthis would increase the usefulness of the destroyer without interfering with larger ships ability to killhit them thus avoiding low sig thrasher gangs becoming the new anti everything
idiocywhy did you even mention lights and cruises when its painfully obvious that all you want to do with this is nerf heavies if this were to go through guided missiles mainly heavies and especially cruises would need a significant increase in speed as they already suffer major flight time problems at long distancesin fact buff cruise missile velocity full stop no weapon should be relegated to pve for being so worthless
this sums it up rather nicely for me personally by now ccp should have enough feedback to read on this issue to take them well into the next century
there will always be a best unless things are totally homogenous even small differences create this problem especially once you factor in the fact that eve players minmaxthere will never be a solution to the problem as you state it unless everything becomes completely static including player tactics stratagiesfittings and seemingly unrelated game mechanicsthis leads me to wonder if ayou and the people who have 1d you are really that terrible at thinking or byour troll threads with innane comments because your bored
why is it that timezone warfare is even possible why shouldnt there be some mechanics not the core ones but extraneous ones like upgrades that encourage actually banding together with people other than those living in ones neighbourhoodit is natural to gravitate towards ones own but look at what it has done to the game massive blobs reinforcing stuff massive blobs repping stuff and the occasional blob bash on the weekendeves greatest strength is the one server aspect but it has so far been completely ignored mechanic wise  time to make people think global instead of local
i think this is perfect taking some time to send out a few mails to ceos and directors after large fights to take a few quotes from them check kill logs to see how people are doing set the spotlight on large wars and also small tradesfights in pure blind we have people coming in and out constantly changing our tactics and roams i think this will also be huge when figuring out what may need fixing if it acts like a journal u will quickly be able to see that maybe macherials spelling are overpowered since someone just took out 15 people in one hour with one the idea of also being part of the big picture because of what we do is motivating it will cause drama and unrest to these boring giant northern alliancessanicity
pvp in eve is retarted you have more enemy runs enemy has more you run warp off log off no skill no fighting just trying to find a way to exploit grief and scamyeah i can kill a newb thats it anybody else brings x3 more friends if you argue with this argument you are stupidgrind to get gear wonderful loose it all to mission disconnect or stupid grieferfun combat in eve never had any if you are from 2008 pls do no bother to post there is more fun in battlefield 2 or real time strategy you have chance in 3v1 there in eve you dont
you know im  at solo pvp and i havent had much success at pvp in eve in general part of that is for the reasons you listed but its also because i dont spend a lot of time pvpingyour attitude sucks pvp in eve has great potential and can be a lot of fun if you do it right its not about dropping a massive gate camping and waiting for newbs to fly through though a lot of people do it that way and its not about warping off and logging off every time you see a force larger than yoursthe best fun ive had in pvp has all been in gangs roaming and skirmishing with next to no kills and most often no losses thats fun and thats pvp how it should be not great fleet battles where no one knows what theyre doing and everyone fits for max dps and no tank because they know if theyre primaried theyre done anyway 00 blobbing works this way crowdtanking lagfest and thats about it ive never done it but i know the basic theory behind it and it doesnt impress meeven without lag it wouldnt be much fun wait i have done it but only in a mass test on sisi and it wasnt the least bit fun i didnt even get shot at though i did get jammed out a few times by my target not pvplowsec is rediculous and its hard to believe bullies in a schoolyard could fly big ships like that thats all it is really with the rough equivalent to calling the teachers when they run into trouble being either petitioning a gm cause someone is spoiling their fun or using aggression mechanics to dodge the fight sure its technical but not really interesting also not pvp
x gallentiusyou seem to assume that no one in eve wants small gang pvp i agree the fact that ccp has never really tried to develop a mechanism to bring it about surely lead to many people who did want it leaving the game but i do think there are still many in game who like it and likely many who would resubstay subbed if ccp did it right moreover eve would keep many of those players who like eve and pvp but arent interested in being bossed around by some mope in null sec nor do they want to quit their day job to become a null sec alliance leader really just think about that middle road player and how neglected we are by ccp ccp gives these options 1 take orders from people who drop out of real life to play video games 2 drop out of real life to be an alliance leader yourself 3 stay in high sec and shoot red xes or 4 this game is not for youfor the guy who likes the game and wants to blow stuff up without having to commit key parts of their life to socializing with internet buds instead of family real life friends and associates  well they simply say this game is not for you so again if eve did something for the middle road player you might see more of them  a lot more of them more of them means that more fights would constantly happen across the regions and there wouldnt be anywhere for the rabbits to run now on to the specific points would rabbits prefer the entire enemy militia be informed when they open a plex or not you say rabbit alts but it really doesnt matter whether they are alts or not there is still a real person flying the ships and trying to accomplish a goal spending real life time now they can cap plexes without anyone even realizing what they are doing thats a big reason why rabbits are successfulyou keep equating plexing and running missions and because of the stupid plex npcs you may have good grounds for doing that under current mechanics need to fight npcs and so plex ships are often set up for pve that means they are of course going to run from a pvp ship no one wants to get in a pvp fight in a pve ship but if you remove the npcs from plexes there is no longer a reason to be pve fit so why not pvp fit your ship so you see the rats and the lack of notice both create conditions where plexing is best done by rabbits i go in plexes but i never try to capture a medium plex the reason i dont is because in general i like buffer tank pvp set ups if i draw agro from the rats they will eat through 2040 of my buffer tank and no i dont want to start pvping with other players with a fraction of my hit points so the solution is easy eliminate the rats so people can fly pvp ships and cap plexes you continue to talk about how people do things with the current mechanics and you simply assume that everyone will stop paying attention to the plex notifications because no one will want pvp i really doubt that is the case lots of people want pvp its just that it takes too long to find it in the current eve mechanics so people uninstall as far as a channel to arrange fights  that has nothing to do with this proposal you can set up a channel now if you want rvb does that if you want that the original proposal requires no stagedarranged battles between the militias the original proposal is simply a set of mechanic changes that both militias need to deal with yet will naturally lead to good small scale pvp fights requiring artificial agreed duels completely loses the feel of being in a real war what you propose is more faction war sparring instead of faction war fights yes sparring is better than warping around for hours with no action at all but it shouldnt be the vision we are striving for
please refrain from using the term rabbit in an attempt to further your own agendait means those who run always has nothing to do with plexes not being announced npcs being there or anything else you might think to userabbits are a tool used by isk s and win at all costs people just as a scrambler is a tool for the fighter  they provide massive and easy amounts of standings andor vp for the useless system occupancychase them out of one and theyll open another ad nauseum no combat has ever or will ever come from thempeople will ignore any announcement channel in short order because the last ten or twenty times they were foolish enough to respond to it they drew a rabbit  has nothing to do with people not wanting pvp they can quite simply find better quality by doing the same old gatestationpostdt dance as we all do nowps i have not plexed in a pve fit  ever if you are unable to do it then the fault is with your fitparadigm not the rats i have gone into plexes and assassinated whomever was there and got out and had it done to me enough times to know that npcs influence combat but are in no way defining it just be wary of full spawns
what if im right yoshida gets itjust adjust your proposal so that i dont have to orbit a button 20 minutes to win if 1 nobody shows up and 2 the rabbit bails
the fault is with my fitparadigm not the rats is this code for i need to start fitting fit an active repper to my pvp ships like you doin other words i cant fly what i think are the best pvp set ups i have to gimp them a bit to account for the rats but then when im fighting the rats in an offensive plex with this gimped ship i realize the enemy who comes in wont get attacked so he does not need to gimp his ship fit at all sorry i and most others are not interested in those fights that is one reason why almost no one does plexes you might make up for your subpar fits with numbers and indeed a repper on certain amarr ships sometimes isnt so bad but others fly other races this is a big reason why very few are in fw and of those very few in fw almost no one does occupancy plexing the fact that you do so much occupancy plexing does not prove that your suggestions are more valid than every other player it may actually show your perspective is somewhat out of touch very few players are interested in what you find enjoyable i may be out of touch too it very well may be that many players do not want allot small gang pvp like im suggesting i may be the only one ccp never set up any mechanics that would encourage small gang pvp so we just dont know how popular they would be but i tend to think there are allot of players would like allot of quality small scale pvp rabbits do not achieve their goals of standings isk or wins if they do not finish the plex so giving the other side a tool that can help them easily prevent enemy rabbits from finishing a plex will deter that conduct right now the only way to prevent rabbits from achieving their goals is to waste time chasing them around through several jumps a notification system completely eliminates the need to chase anyone again you are arguing against common sense just because common sense is not always common doesnt mean its not sensible i already addressed your claim about how rats force people to fly pve fits or at best suboptimal pvp fits moreover players just dont like starting pvp when they are already under fire from rats you and ccp can disagree all you want but youre just refusing to open your eyes this really isnt controversial im not sure what you love so much about shooting red crosses that you always take such offense at eliminating them from plexxes but after several months of shooting red xs most players grow bored of it deny it all you want its still true
if you are right we will have the status quo  virtually no one caring about fw plexes im fine with adjusting the proposal if i know what you mean and it makes sense but im not sure what you are suggesting lets discuss what should happen a pvper hereinafter referred to as pvper chases a rabbit  hereinafter referred to as rabbit out of a 20 minute plex the options would seem to be1 the pvper would have to run the entire 20 minute timer to win the plex2 the pvper would have to run the timer for whatever amount of time the rabbit ran it to win the plex3 the pvper would have to run the timer for some other set amount of time it would seem that option 2 would be the best for defeating rabbits lets say a rabbit enters a 20 minute plex and then gets chased out after 2 minutes well then he really helped the other side by allowing them to win a 20 minute plex in 2 minutes but there may be problems with that read alt in opposing militia exploit so it would seem option 1 or option 3 would be better im really am not sure what would be optimal i am entirely open to suggestions but this is really something that is beside the point of original proposals in this thread im happy to add other suggestions to the op if we think them through though i would encourage people to post any ideas that would deter hide and seek plexing rabbits and would lead to more small scale quality pvp
i stopped plexing in earnest ages ago when i went full pew even with exploration probing and forum whoring while orbiting it gets tedious eventually you still need to run there and chase them out do you think that they will run on their own just because someone knows where they are you get to see them run a few minutes earlier than now but the outcome will not change and neither will their behaviourviability  the only way to achieve what you seem to want is to make plexes so rare as to be redundant in the first placesuboptimal for normal pvp for sure just as a sniper fit is a pretty bad idea for jumping into an enemy the one fit to rule them all does not exist contrary to what fotm junkies may tell you different circumstances requires different fits and tactics you should know that
consider how it will work lets say i have 6 minutes left on a plex i am running then i see in a system one jump away an enemy plexer starts a 15 minute plex i wait out my plex and then jump over one system if he is a rabbit he will run and i will win his plex he just wasted 6 minutes all of my time so far has been toward doing plexes lets say i see that about 15 minutes later he opens another plex if he opens it 2 or three jumps away i may finish the plex im running and kick him out again now if he opened it 15 jumps away i will not go chasing after him if no one in my militia near him is willing to go fight for the plex we will lose the plex but i think the chances are pretty good that there may be someone from my militia who can finish up what they are doing maybe a plex and within say 13 jumps chase the rabbit out of that plex too see the rabbit will then have wasted allot of time whereas we will be spending our time optimally to win plexes really with only about 8 active plexers you can have the entire fw front covered rabbits would not be able to plex without having an opposing militia being able to get to them in 3 or fewer jumps this is why rabbits would not work in this system as far as pve versus pvp fits yes i agree that you need to fit your ship for what you are doing popular fits include 1sniper fits 2 kiter fits 3 pure in close gank and tank fits etc each fit has its own strategyone unpopular fit is the fit that is intended to have a pvp fight while you are getting pounded by unknown amounts of rat dps and ewar it just isnt catching on no matter how often ccp tries to tell us pvp and pve would be a fun mix its not a fun mix in fact i would even go so far as to say it sucks it may be fun some day but for right now very very very few players have any interest in that fit or strategy so for right now i think they should accept that reality and make game mechanics based on the reality of what players like later after they make the game fun for how the current players like to play the game they can then start trying to make pve and pvp mix together in some alternative mechanic but the misguided view that pve and pvp mix well has plagued fw plexing for long enough it has resulted in the majority of people fitting for pve and running from pvp
except that a supercarriers primary weapon system doesnt require cap and in the case of the nyx and aeon their ehp buffer doesnt necessarily require it eitherall you do with this proposal is bump the neuting caps way up the target priority list from free easy killmail to mild irritant while doing little to rebalance fleet combat and further cementing capitals online by obsoleting one of the few semiuseful roles smaller hulls have remaining against caps
theres a simple way to figure out that super carriers need to be nerfederebus potential ehp 36 mill max dps 12k excluding ddnyx potential ehp 36 mill  max dps 125khmmmmmmm

how about letting us just customise our own damn ui conan did it and while the rest of the game sucked that was a really nice feature to use
i like that idea  context sensitive ui1
assault frigates ie assault they should get hit points bonus so that they can withstand some punishment they need stronger firepower and much more hitpoints than normal frigates double assault frigates hit pointsassault frigates need to withstand heavy gun fire which they do with ab and have room to resist small firearms assault frigates are meant to be close combat focused extra toughness and extra armor makes sure that despite smaller guns they are interesting choice for combatassault frigates cost much more than a cruiser they need to be used against larger class enemies so give them decent armor and shields also 50 more firepower than tech 1 counterparts and focus on close range combat
up let more people see this
my alliance for a ponynot at all develop a standardized ruleset for stats and then make each deviation a subset of rulesfor example the battlecruiser class has 9900 hp total the standard would be 330033003300 hullarmorshield racial flavor would put minmatar at 20 hull and 10 armorshield caldari 10 hullarmor and 20 shield amarr at 10 hullshield and 20 armor gallente 20 shield and 10 hullarmor the cyclone is a shield oriented ship so would get a further 10 to shield and 10 to armor the hurricane would fit the standard minmatar deviationeach race will have at least one ship at the racial deviation of the standard then you simply tweak individual ships around that race neutral ships would be the purestccp could pay me 1000 to do it for them i have half a mind to do it for free anywayits only hard if you try to do it without a solid foundationactually they force progression but since progression in eve is entirely based on sp knowledge associations and isk there is no need for a mundane planned obsolescence of entire lines of ships

supported except for battleships there are useful battleships in all tiers and the prices 50m  150m are high enough that the separation still makes financial sense
this is something the csm are intending to push for in the very near future
battleships suffer from tiering too
1 i think perhaps youre going to have to explain this one2 never seen a jump drive but i think the idea is that they are supposed to result in ships popping up unexpectedly jk 3 i think a better idea would be to make the rest of the ships smaller as they are already scaled to proportions that make them big next to planets stations and pos4 so only pods should be selfdestructible something has to be or people could potentially require gms interceding on their behalf to get out of wormholes really so kill it faster than the self destruct sequence or lose the kill i dont particularly care as its not a real issue5 yeah thats kind of stupid but pirates are monkeys6 a little extreme basing rr consequences on security status there are other ways to do it7 i use drones and yet i have no idea what you are talking about 8 i believe this belongs in the ship balance thread requested by csm and perhaps could use a little more detail aside from that everything else needs to be picked up where drakes are about where they should be and could even use a little fixing in some areas9 what nothing is sticky that i am aware of though everything has cycles click it and it will cycle out and die anything else is a bug that you and a select few others may alone be experiencing10 thats just picky its not an fps game we cant really expect our accuracy to be based on graphics or vice versa we dont actually do any aiming11 curious notion no idea what you are talking about you seem to have a lot of problems12 i beleive you need a better computer i never have a problem with this and everything saves just fine problem is likely ram related and may be the result of memory errors or something either that or your character node is stored on a bad server13 lol maybe you can get a friend to bring fuel and pop it in the bay before the countdown completes 14 graphics stuff not sure what the problem is15 again with the computer stuff16 vague are you talking about the blobby white graphical glitch if so it doesnt require being far away17 really picky ive never taken the time to put a stopwatch on accelerationdeceleration18 yeah textures need a refresh gallente is blobby and grotesque caldari is grey and splotchy and amarr is kinda chunky larger the model the more the texture is stretched smaller models mean better looking textures
guess i should elaborate and you should play eve more1 is an overview bug when something leaves gridjoins fleet on griddies on grid you land on grid random things have the tendency to show up purple in your overview2
the ability to end your cyno cycle when you want to instead of it taking the whole 10 minutes before you can do anything
i suggest a complete redesign of the fof missile guidance system lets go back to what we really want the thing to do  target the sources of disruptive ecm and similar effects warp jamming webbing ecm target painting weapon jamming etc except those tagged as emitted from your own fleetin this way theyd be an especial hazard to ships and drones using those effects on us  which is what we want me no  i never use those effects on anyone do i fellasits ok with me if they have to be renamed in the processive only been here almost eight years now  see you in deep space when you least expect company 
well i agree with you that a complete overhaul of these sad unloved missiles is probably in order  but given ccps record on changing things piecemeal as opposed to outright altering things on a vast scale i think its probably better to ask for small things first to be honest i had been looking at the problem from a pve perspective and hadnt considered the pvp aspects but they are totally valid and add an interestiing dimension especially when you consider the effects from friendly pilots anyway dont forget to support even if you dont agree with all of the specific proposals here but would like to see an overhaul of fof missiles in general
hopelessfof missiles may have lower precision much higher costs shorter range but they must workfof missiles could be cool if they stayed on one target or even fired 3 times more missiles at the expense of longer reload time 3 missiles volleys long reload cycle like arty 5 volley time alpha potentially kills target all warheads lock the same target at the time of triple launch
so you were only addressing things from the the internets told me that xyz is epic fail lets make them epic win guis perspective
no of course not its just that for me personally the use of fof missiles in a pvp situation has never occurrednow do you actually have a point to make or is it back under your bridge for you
you know you want tothis stuff is pretty awesome and while having not yet used up my sixer i allready hunger for morefor added hilarity consider requiring a frozen corpse in the exchange
can we haz moar quaffe
frozen corpse for quafe
supported
this would be great
oh wow
well it does have postconsumer biomass in it so im all for itseriously have the lp store require a corpse to purchase a six packyou could even handle it like ships there are two ways to buy them alot of lp or some lp and some tagsbuy quafe zero with lots of lp or some lp and corpses
that would be great something to use my 2399 corpses for they arent my kills i just am a packrat

1drones damage should be a separate option in menu combat log does help but it is not as easy to read in realtime fights as the popupsi also support drone damage being lumped into one value like turrets though because drones hit at varying intervals
ccp is too engaged in space barbies to give an answer to this threadspace barbies  internet spaceships
for the sake of the miner who actually wants to feel like he is making a meaningful contribution to the market for the player who wants to feel that his faction ship is not merely an easily acquired isk toy and for the sake of all those kill mails i wouldve had flying through 00 i too support this
why would u even make a baseless assumption in response to something were not even debating cause we actually r debating this too now fyi derp for once explain how low sec isnt griefing and at the same time high sec is unless u wanna continue talking out your ass ignorance sure is bliss huh
youd know better than anyone else
well look whos talking nowgreat input there along with your repeating the same whining over and over again that i already addressed but plz continueid really love to hear it
ive never understood this currently character only have one gigantic wallet if you want to put some money aside you currently have to send it to another character on your accountit would be great to have even just 4 wallet divisions for characters for example you could have master cap ship savings plex saving misc or something like that all it would take is one extra column in the character wallet database walletidgive us more tools to organize our monies 
believe me youre not the only one who wants it

actually thats why we need a contest so that you and i would be able to vote for the best missions in our opinionbut after thinking for a while i understand that the voting will be won by the missions that you have mentionedso a little improvement on my idea the missions suggested at the contest must be balanced at their riskrewardagent level otherwise they will be excluded or afterbalancededit spelling
a time back i had posted an idea for incorporating countermissions and a fusion of pve  pvp it went as followsthis is an opportunity for ccp to handle some known problems and stale gameplay of missions there needs to be more risk involved to get the adrenaline pumping for mission runners introduce an added player element like in a sense countermissions lets say a player contacts an agent for a courier mission boring right he accepts the mission though cause its good money well what if another player goes to a competing npc corp or perhaps player corp agent this competing agent has gained knowledge on this courier run and implores this player to intercept that courier and to destroy the ship and said contents hes given a name and a drop off system voila instant cat and mousethe same kind of counter mission could be done for protecting a facility from another players attack even be it in the third room of the attacking players mission of course time frames for the mission completion would need to be greatly reduced and there would be a need for ship size limitations perhaps but you get the idea bestow a possible chance for ones mission to get countermissionedthis would increase the need for corp involvement perhaps there would be a need for a max amount of counter hired missioners say squad size only or as rewards get higher wing and maybe fleet size would be allowed i would think this could be a fairly easy way to knock out some of the stagnant feel to missions
analogy wormholers are kinda like coal miners they go deep into the pit and no one ever sees them againyoure right of course though im not surprised you havent received any replies the issue is that you are preaching to deaf ears nobody here gives a damn about you or your wormholes all they care about is nullsec and pvp i used to wormhole and i know exactly how boring it is and how profitable unlike most wormholers i actually visit these forums more than just when i want to ask for something your ideas are relatively sound and i have no issue with most of what you have to say except that i would skip the need love bit wormholing is second in profitability only to nullsec moon mining and its generally more secureits also incredibly painful logistically not impossible just worse than anywhere else and limited in player interaction oddly that last is also a benefit given some of the player interactions in eve are less than desireable but then ive fought nullsec pirates in wormholes before too so its not completely inaccessible1 ice mining sites good idea 5050 with regular grav sites the only issue is that of determining what kind of ice to drop in there and whether ice in wormholes is fair given there is none in nullsec im not 100 on that last but i know its not found in any searches using 3rd party sites dedicated to that sort of thing2 lesser moonmining is a bit of a dream for wormholers and one im not certain i share i did dont get me wrong but i also recognize that wormhole profitability is enough despite that its so seperated from everything else3 everybody should have this benefit bookmarks are annoying and generally a clunky method of handling what should be a simple data transfer in fleet4 given that wormholes only have pi and anomolies something else would be good though there is currently the constant threat of hostilities from nullsec lowsec and neighbours bluntly though despite all that wormholes are boring places where nothing happens for hours days or even weeks sometimes anomolies and sites dry up and the only thing you have to do is sit in a pos bubble and flip staticsif you can imagine nonwormholers im talking to you sitting in a pos for 8 days looking at a star shield ripples and effects and watching the sun burn endlessly while local sits dry and empty and corp chat sits in endless silence then you have an idea of what its like in the depths of unknown spacethere are no asteroid belts ice belts gates or anything else something to alter that might be good though i find i like it much the way it is and only wish i could better control entrance and egress from withinbut still it can get tedious and i understand not everybody likes it as much as i do and i get tired of sitting there endlessly myself sometimes too especially if i log in regularly for any length of time when there really is nothing to do
look up any nullsec region on dotlan
1 yes if players want to be independent they should be allowed to be as long as they have to work for it2 no moons are for t2 and this would have unknown effects on the current market and adding it just for the sake of adding it is silly3 yes this needed to be implemented 2 years ago4 content for content sake isnt going to happen in an area of the game that is already pretty good
good point on the rorq i didnt know that actually lets keep the proposal strictly to hauling live toons then not jump clonesi intend also to make these supplemental to courier missions that you can get from the npc corps for the npc corp hauling i intended it as a corp that would give 100 hauling missions and have it only haul passengers these pay more than the standard hauling job because there are potential hazards with failing the haul as described beforegood points on the edge cases perhaps we can tread logging off as if the hauler is in suspension in a station the haul is not failed but if it is not completed in time then the haul is failed if a contract expires or the contract is failed in space the hauler has the option of completing the haul to the designated destination for the nonbonus standard award or just jettisoning his passengers or dropping them off at the nearest station for sec status hitfor readers if you support this enough to keep the discussion going please vote so thanks
it is also called courier missionsit is insanely good isk compared to risk and you only need to invest like 1 million to get a tech 1 hauler and a shuttleincidentally you also do carry passengers on those missionsfor some odd reason all loot is worthless crap so no pirating there unless you just want to grief  out of some macros
actually for those last few questions in my previous post i was thinking of the passengers themselves if they arent clones then theyre real players who are essentially in stasis for the duration of the contract it seems like a really good opportunity for ransominggriefingetc there are a couple of other opportunities for gaming this system as well though those will depend on collateral will there be collateral as in other courier jobs how do you propose this system handle the player passengers implants what happens to the passenger if a contract is failed what about if the ship is self destructed as opposed to destroyed by pirates if the passenger can be captured by a pirate what if the pirate opts not to ransom at all but hold onto the person indefinitely i like the general idea that is being able to move players around as passengers but there are a lot of real difficulties i imagine from ccps perspective the contract system isnt really designed to account for something that isnt an item esp one that is concious and using the marketmail during transit coming from the other direction the rorq has a very similar function through the use of clone vats perhaps the clones can be more easily classified as objects for the purpose of contract creation anyway just a few things to consider creativity is a good thing
stronly support transportationtrade thing hauling must become a job a profession offered by npcs
yep we definitely need more npcgrinding in our mmo where we could have player interaction insteadnot supporting any kind of npc ferrying being ferried by npcs or any related stuffbut id support hauling other player characters or their jumpclones could be an interesting expansion of the couriercontracts
forgive me if this is already presented but i searched using this forum search and it didnt come upbut i would like a select all function when choosing items to add to an item exchange contract it becomes unwieldy to select them one at a time when there are a lot of them to go through add to that a search or a filter items and the dialog will be a lot more useful
select all items first then right click and create contract
lowsecurity space is frequently considered to be a joke it lacks the safety of highsecurity space the profitability of 00 space and is generally regarded as a wasteland dotted by factional warfare gangs an occasional highsecurity gate camp the few brave mission runners and thousands of cyno alts for 00 logistics lowsecs fallow state amounts to a notinconsiderable swathe of the new eden map simply going to waste regardless of the infrequent addition of a new feature to the region and despite the potential of lowsec my interest in invigorating lowsec is rooted in an internet forum argument the specific details of this argument like all internet forum arguments are irrelevant but resulted in my opinion that lowsec and npc 00 are the natural home of small gang pvp npc 00 is renowned for the amount and the quality of its small gang combat while lowsec is not renowned for much of anything this discrepancy led me to consider ways to make lowsec more attractive for small gangs and groups interested in gaining experience and resources before venturing into 00 without inviting the attention and subsequent domination of large 00 entitieswhat is to be done i believe that lowsec would gain from a system that encourages active residency and semipermanent settlement by individual corps and new alliances by offering benefits both financial and quality of life targeted at individual pilots and their corporations however these benefits must not be attractive or practical for 00 entities to exploit the system i envision revolves around the nowubiquitous anchored space widget in the form of the economic blockade unitthe system in action a corporation sets up in a lowsec station system drops an economic blockade unit a 250m3 module that costs 50 million isk anchors and onlines in one minute and can be killed by 10 guys in cruiserbattlecruiser hulls in 510 minutes this module has no reinforcement timerthe economic blockade unit cannot be targeted by capitalsupercapitalclass vessels and cannot be hit by fighters it will rely on high resists to provide its buffer over hit points to facilitate repairs during combatby deploying the economic blockade unit the corporation reaps several territoryrelated benefits ranging from systemwide to constellation and regionwide by making benefits related to pvp regionwide it is my hope that corporations would find it easier to launch attacks on their neighbors by making pve and corporate income benefits constellation and systembased i would offer a reason to launch attacks on a neighboring corporation in possession of more lucrative territorythe specific benefits of the ebu are as follows corporation members do not lose security status killing people in the lowsec portions of that region and npc sentry guns wont shoot them global criminal countdown no longer affects members of that corporation in that constellation  corporation members receive a 10 bonus to loyalty point rewards from agents in that constellation  should the corporation hold the system for two hours will cause the system to be identified as the turf of this corporationalliance should the corporation hold the system for four hours any billboards will be defaced with the corporation logo the corporation itself receives a financial incentive each hour the economic blockade unit is online the value of this financial incentive is directly linked to the number of stations within the system with a system of diminishing returns amounting to a 100755010 base value depreciation per station holding additional station systems within that constellation runs into a further diminishing returns equal to 66 of the base station value any ebus anchored outside of the constellation results in returns of 30 of the base station value
i believe this change would facilitate fastpaced small gang combat with frequent territorial gains and losses leading to a fluid and dynamic lowsec corps and alliances capable of more or less maintaining their grip on a given territory become regional or constellation powers my goal is to create the eve online equivalent of somali warlords armed with ak47s and rpgs and packed into pickup trucks which 00 powers nevertheless have to deal with because these gang chieftains are sitting on their logistics lifelines to empire whether 00 powers attempt to turn these residents into allies enemies or privateers turned loose on their rivals they have an opportunity to partake in 00s great game of war diplomacy and bribery on their own termsthe vulnerability of the economic blockade unit essentially demands residency in order to protect the module and the benefits it provides however the fragility of holding this lowsec turf is matched by the low impact of its loss losing control of your station system costs your corporation roughly 50 million isk this is a deliberate break with the high stakes of the existing 00 sovereignty widget system in 00 some alliances recover from the loss of their space most do not the savage consequences of territorial loss in 00 leads to a very conservative approach to the game designed to minimize the chance that trillions of isk worth of assets are destroyed or permanently locked away beyond reach a lowsec corporation that loses its system in the night could come and take it right back tomorrow the ephemeral nature of the ebu implies that the hourly financial incentive provided the anchoring corporation should be a significant percentage of the value of the module i had spent a great deal of time wrestling with the amount and nature of the financial incentive before i came to the conclusion that it was a detail that could only be addressed by ccp since ccp obviously has a much better idea of what they want the economy to look like than i do that said there are certain practicalities that must be kept in mind when creating lowsec financial incentiveswhile i understand that ccp is likely to make the financial incentive a new gimmick material or item this would link the success of lowsec to the success of the gimmick for example i am a shareholder in the only publicly offered revenant supercarrier bpc an item only available as a rare drop from lowsec incursions as of this writing we have not been able to turn a profit from this rare lowseconly gimmickcommodity because the gimmickship is junk as such i would prefer the reward not to be a new and unproven gimmickthe purpose of the financial incentive is to offer new corporations and alliances a source of corporation or alliancelevel income independent of taxes as ebu benefits revolve around encouraging mission running among the membership and the real value of missions is in untaxable loyalty points with which to fund corporation or alliance programsin 00 space this is frequently the province of rental fees or r64technetium moon mining but valuable moons in lowsec are almost always owned by 00 alliances and for all practical purposes untouchablethere is a fine line to be walked between providing a financial incentive for a corporation to get involved in lowsec territorial skirmishes and making it so lucrative that a corporation has no impetus to move on to bigger things like 00 space while it is possible that a corporation could decide that it is happy with a permanent lowsec existence the tradeoff should be a fixed income and less opportunity for growth
one of the recurring themes in the 2011 fanfest discussions was the attempt to break the tyranny of n 1 that is to say the natural trend in which more numbers becomes the ultimate method of winning fights breaking deadlocks and bruteforcing through any opposition to an extent it is a struggle against basic human nature my attempt to outflank n1 is to pit other aspects of basic human nature greed and sloth against this tendency to huddle together in everlarger social unitsquestions  answersby removing global criminal countdowns and gate guns from the equation you are removing the very essence of lowsecthat is one interpretation but i would counter that these specific lowsec mechanics are unpopular and do nothing to make the space any safer than 00 anywayas it stands right now npc sentry guns will not save you from lowsec pirates because lowsec pirates have the option to fly ships that can tank sentry guns global criminal countdown does nothing to prevent the destruction of or to avenge your ship it simply amounts to fifteen minutes that the pirates have to spend waiting before they can enter highsecduring my lowsec incursion expeditions we would occasionally find ourselves in positions to engage in pvp at no point did gate guns or gccs prevent us from blowing up other ships though i would almost have preferred not to because of the whining and subsequent boredom as we waited out our timers if the essence of lowsec is ineffectual mechanics that only serve to make pvp tedious well i would posit that this is an essence we can do withoutisnt there a massive control and territorial exchange system in place with faction warfareyes but this is not factional warfare this is spacegangs fighting over who runs this spaceblock regardless of the technical sovereignty of the system factional warfare corporations would not be able to drop ebus or to reap the benefits so long as they are a member of the militiai hate magical space modules come up with a better systemi cant however as a man who has shot many an enormous immobile space structure i believe that the magical space widget system can be finessed instead of shooting ihubs with 200 of your closest friends for a few hours a couple times a week this widget is designed to be both easily assailable by a small subbattleship gang in under ten minutes and easily defensible by utilizing high resists over sheer hitpointsalso you only shoot it oncewhat keeps 00 powers from monopolizing this like they do other lowsec resources like valuable moons and lowsec incursions00 powers monopolize lowsec moons because lowsec moons do not require them to actively defend the moon around the clock reinforcement mechanics allow for 00 powers to call defense ops well in advance and to titanbridge enough guys into the system that the only other powers capable of matching them in numbers are other 00 powersthe 00 power monopoly on lowsec incursions comes about through two factors the temporary nature of incursions and the same qualities of communication organization and scale that allow a 00 power to to rally its membership to fight 00 wars can be utilized to organize fifty guys to do what amounts to a personally lucrative three day deploymentsafari to lowsec the fact that it is a temporary shortterm deployment means that it is not an inconvenience for a member of a 00 alliance to clonejump down for a few days and the availability of cheap and quick freighter services in empire means that it is fully possible to simply leave your incursionrunning ships in empire and have them couriered to wherever a new lowsec incursion spawns within hourswithout reinforcement timers a 00 power would have to have a significant number of its members active in a specific lowsec constellation instead of in its own home regions indefinitely this is improbable
your plan specifically states a lp  increase but there are lots of lowsec stations without l4 agentssounds like lowsec could use more l4 agents then that said ccp is interested in making space worth fighting over through scarcity i expect lowsec systems to be valued on a mix of location popular entrances to highsec for example number of stations and the availability or quality of the agents some constellations will be less valuable than others some will be furiously fought over a new corporation could use an otherwise poor system as their very first base from which they would attack more valuable systemsthis is nothing but a spacepirate fantasythe mechanics can be utilized by any number of different corporation types the same mechanics used by a spacepirate corporation to make their constellation a dangerous hive of scum and villainy could be used by an nrds antipirate entity to turn their constellation into an extension of empire the mechanics are neutral the only question is how the player corporations choose to use themwhy does your system revolve around stationsbecause stations are where the people are nonstation systems are places you rat or mine or pass through nobody cares about them stations are where people live where you keep your stuff stations matter
i strongly endorse this proposal this is what i meant when i said that the game lacks goals for smaller groups and this would introduce a reason to go to lowsec aside from the desire to get to the other side
incredibly long post is incredibly longbut very interesting and well thought outyou did hit a good point of ensuring the lowsec is not as profitable as nullsec this maintains a system of escalation for players in which risk to reward ever increasesthe idea is sound but needs some more fleshing outsomething ccp would need to do of course id like to see more csm comments regardless of support on whether this is in the right direction for pumping up lowsec systembased this makes it easier for pirate to locate players running missionsor just pvp in general to happenthe change in gcc could be rocky but i think that is an excellent method for getting pvp only gangs involved even they get an incentive for taking a systemconstellation and hunting thereone point of clarificationwould the ebu be easily found does it show on the overview much like a cyno if it has to be scanned down how does a player know the system he has entered has an active ebu remember your mechanics dont show sov of any sort immediately
ive given this some thought and my initial reaction was to have it anchored like 5070km off a station im not necessarily sure this is a good idea due to the potential for docking games generally speaking stations are the most logical place to hang an ebu but if the complication of station games makes that problematic there should be no problem putting it at a planet or even the sun i wasnt planning on putting it on overview because it would be linked to a specific type of celestial anyway unlike tcus which can technically be anchored anywhere ihubs arent on overview but they arent that difficult to find because you just warp to planets until you see it
its an interesting idea but i see some problems with it lets say i throw up one of these things in my home system and am able to defend it my neighbors whom i hate 1 jump away also throw one up and defend it do both groups get the full benefits what if two different groups put them in the same system is that even allowed if so then there isnt much sense in attacking the other guys thingy unless i just feel like messing with them the other problem is this does nothing to address the n1 issue youve stated 10 guys in bcs should be able to kill it in 10 minutes but nothing is stopping anyone from bringing 100my own view is that low sec is working as intended the low sec systems with decent quality agents are populated and the agents heavily used the people who use them drive out neutrals for obvious reasons but when local is blue they are missioning typically so mechanic wise i dont see any need for a change in how low sec works reworking the way mission rewards are handled so 01 sec payout and 04 sec payout are the same would be good expanding the number of good quality agents in low sec would also be great since most systems the ones with no one in them contain no agents or other resources of value

short responsei dislike this proposal for two reasons first its very much an attempt to do game design rather than highlighting an issue isnt that supposed to be a big nono with csm proposals second i dont agree with your assessment of the current state of lowsec in terms of population and activity or with the implicit goals and attitudes behind your proposallongass response with numbers and stuffaccording to the q3 2010 qen 29 of all kills occur in lowsec compared to 16 in high 51 in null sov and npc and 4 in wspace however in terms of total system count lowsec is by far the smallest of those four sectors of space accounting for 86 of all systems to highsecs 153 nullsecs 446 and wspaces 315 that is to say on a persystem basis lowsec sees more pvp than any other sector of space in the game the assertion that lowsec is somehow underpopulated or a wasteland is also hard to reconcile with the data ccp have put out per the q2 2010 qen 8 of all active and loggedin characters are in lowsec this compares to 53 in highsec 32 in sovnpc 00 and 7 in wspace once you normalise for the number of systems in each sector it turns out that lowsec is significantly more denselypopulated than nullsec and unsurprisingly massively more so than wspace so while it may be your experience that lowsec is a wasteland that is not renowned for much of anything its rather hard to square that experience with the data its also completely contradictory to my own experience of living heresecond your comments about having the organizational capacity to bring 50 dudes to run incursions and giving people an opportunity to partake in 00s great game of war diplomacy and bribery overlook the fact that lowsec already has a fairly large and healthy community of people who have voted with their feet and said no thanks to all of those things lowsec isnt nullsec with training wheels and i dont think it would particularly benefit from mechanics that are judging by the tone of your post designed in part to make it thatfinally re the tyranny of n1 id actually say that the current mechanics of lowsec are about as good a way of countering that as is possible without introducing arbitrary restrictions on the number of people who can participate the only reason to be in a lowsecbased corp atm is to get fights however there are few ways of forcing people to fight in lowsec  no bubbles no valuable moons or stations or we to defend  so if you want to roam and get fights you have to fly in gangs that people think they can kill and will engage voluntarily if you roam around with gigantic gangs that none of the locals feel able to engage youre going to get pretty bored pretty fast because people will see you coming and go elsewhere or just dock up result you get bored and have a strong incentive to reduce your gang size or move out to a different sector of space its not perfect and its certainly not the case that theres no blobbing and ganking in lowsec but its about as good as i think it can realistically be
only if it also applies to npc stations
around 11 of characters are in the null sec end gameunfortunately because it is impossible to support a null sec existence from null sec resources so every null sec needs between 2 and about 8 empire alts to support their mainso considerably more than 11 of players operate in the null sec end game
heres what you do find a region of space everyone wants capture it have a huuuuge amount of isk and put a gallente administrative outpost in every system possible yay beuracracy
no more stationsstation spam ruin game
a station in every system a supercarrier in every belt
we are getting therei would support a way to destroy player stations and thus make them crap out all the loot the guys you just evicted couldnt evac any players who are docked in the stationofflineunsubscribed would emergency warp out in their active shipoffline and unsubscribed players would of course not show up in the system till they log in making them appear in their active ship
alliance spam ruins the game stations are but a symptom of that really you guys only do it to yourself but yeah i think they should be fully destructible and ejecting logged pilots into the reaches of space on destruction is a good idea i dont care for you to get the loot though and generally think the station should incinerate everything aboard in the process of its own destruction
this is an urgent matter 2030 stations are built every month it is unbelievable some regions are already completely ruined but others are ok stillstop station spam now before it is too latedestructible stations is ok as well
your proposal only cements the gap betwen the haves and the have nots
except most of the haves would never build a station
and with an okay region you mean a region that is pretty much a wasteland only inhabited by bots that dont need a stationremove station restrictions a supercarrier in every belt a pos on every moon a station on every planetedit also please several station on a planet with less stringent position requirements so we can make station conga line
get teh farmers out of my prairie
very simple proposal and because of its simplicity its just purely work on ccp with the upside only being much improved looking battles yep just eye candy but who doesnt like eye candymake turret misses actually look like misses currently turret hits on your ship look like hits even when they miss and do no damage this results in fleet battles where shots look like vertices of a graph instead of the chaotic lancing that lasers and hybrids should make as they both miss and find their targets it would also possibly give some sort of innate feel for the turret tracking ability of your guns when you are watching a target as it is under fire from your guns
thats actually in progress
ermyou vote for csm with your best selfish needs in fact you should vote for anything with your own selfish needs in case you have not realized yet people are selfish you should find someone whose ideas you agree with and vote for him because he is the one most likely to make things change in the direction that you would like them to change
make them individually owned and managed allow transfer of that ownership

there is little that can be done to make cruisers competitive against battlecruisers the tier 2s are miles ahead of everything else they fit more weaponry and have the modules to fit a decent tankcruisers cant fit as many weapons as battlecruisers to begin with and they cant boost the weapons they can fit and carry a decent tank since battlecruisers dont take much more in the way of skills it really just comes down to people being willing to pay fiveten times more for a hull thats more effective the only t1 cruisers that actually serve a purpose in fleet fights are blackbirds
quoted for infinite truthespecially when the fixes for a lot of them are so pathetically simple i have to wonder exactly how ccps dev team structure works or doesnt when it comes to ship balanceit took them what two years to buff rockets i forgot exactly how many pages that thread reached but it went on far longer than it shouldveseriously see my earlier post for a lot of tech 1 ships its just a matter of adding some more fitting and a slot or two
tier 2 bcs need to be nerfed to tier 1 levels cut their ehp fittings and slots tier 2 bcs simultaneously step on the toes of cruisers bs and closerange hacs too much  theyre too flexible too good at too many things and obsolete too many other ships not least of all the tier 1 bcs
dude what ever you are smoking can i have somealso bc  cruisers so of course they are going to step on their toesnext a good hac pilot who knows what they are doing will have no problem taking down a bcthird a good bs pilot can take down bcs easily too assuming the pilot is compitentthere is nothing wrong with bc in the 4 years the tier 2 have been around nothing has needed tweaking they are very balanced
you fly the prophecy and ferox a lot do you how about the not quite so useless brutix or crystal loving cyclonegypsio may be shooting sparrows with cannons but he sort of has a pointwould personally take a bit off the tier2 and add a little to tier1 to close the chasm between them and give a little more breathing room for tier1 bs
mechanics changes have been removedthis is now pure visuals
how about something along the lines of charging the warp core into a punch replacing the speed up and slow smooth shift to warp you would still have to align and it would take the same amount of time except instead of your ship speeding up slightly maybe its thrusters could go brighter and brighter until it hits the punching point and you warp this would both make it clearer when people are trying to warp make it look awesome and still keep the same mechanics of the game if anything punch makes it better because the warping ship will be targetable until the punch its really annoying trying to lock someone when theyre trying to warp sometimes they dont appear to be warping and you cant lock them it could also open up space for new modules like warp charge accelerators or warp core power boosters with a charge system
yes i support this awesome suggestion
theres an excellent post on another eve forum its the one that begins with k and ends with ugutsumen that im just going to quote here
in a word iconsif there is any and i mean any situation where a word can be replaced by a tiny little image do it graphical readouts beat text readouts almost unconditionally if only because theyre more compact icons for ship class speed direction whatever words bad pictures good
changing uis is very tricky for a number of factors involved  user acceptance intuitiveness and so on what one person sees as great others find completely frustrating to work with and counterintuitiveas such ill suggest far less in the way of exacting changes and far more in an overall vision of how to approach the design options  not here you go should be the core theme of the changeslook at a modular approach to the ui via launch pads and dockable toolbarsfor an idea of what i mean  look at some of wows old modules  the flexibility of layout and look based upon the users personal preferences but 100 optional on what you choose to turn on and not turn onsomeone wants to set 3 shaded bars floating in the middle of their screen  top left and right  fine whatever but it should be optional and modular enough to allow the user to lay out as they wantto put it another way well its liable to be very complex  eve is complex people dont play the game for its simplicity if its tricky to layout how someone wants everything  that is better than if they cant adjust it and theyll learn how to do it if it gets them the look and feel they wantjust allow for export and import of layouts and someone somewhere will build a sit of presets that folks can download from trust the community to come up with this if it is made possible

1 okay ive never seen that one would assume it has to do with lag or is related to it in some way resulting from serverclient communication2 nice i can see why you miss it assume it was dropped as part of the lag battle3 actually resizing ships is simply a matter of scaling the model as all the textures are formatted to the model surface so it doesnt mess it up i suppose that may be dependent on the 3d program as some are primitive but im fairly certain ccps isnt either way the texture wrap only takes about an hour per ship and the scaling is maybe 5 minutes using a model temporarily imported for scaling purposes4that actually makes the most sense 10 minutes for a supercap or titan would be good and 1520 minutes for a station just thought id get that int there 5 heh 6 well im saying that a person who has 5 or lower security status always has it so thats not really reasonable to base gcc on not that it really matters at least not to me7 well thankfully i havent used drones in awhile 8 yep9 again im going to assume this is serverclient communication error resulting from lag10 i assume you mean attention to detail is good its true and it wouldnt hurt11 yes12 ah i see13 yep14 see response in 215 i never used drones that much16 i will17 i like that it decelerates and speeds up but it could use less time on both this would make max warp velocity mean a lot more18
in a falcon that warps 375 au per second it takes 58 seconds to warp from an alighned position 946 au to another pointfrom those 58 seconds it takes 53 sec to get in warp 14980t 03848x inertafrom those 58 seconds it takes 37 seconds to get under 1 au from destinationit takes 21 seconds to slow down that is 36 of the total warp timemy proposal is to reduce this time this will encourange more traveling between systems and that is good for the quality of eve 946 au375au  252 seconds yet it takes 23 times as much time it makes no sence my proposal is to reduce warp time so people can move faster from point a to point b
so you want to make eve even smallernot supported
yes for making the acceleration and deacceleration scale with max warp speed to actually introduce a real difference due to ship warp speeds then decrease bs warp speed a bit and some ships are faster some slower but at least warp speed is relevant possibly warp speed of for example cov ops needs to be decreased to keep travel speeds a bit realistic but it should matter and not it pretty much doesnt unless you warp 100 au
i actually believe the complete opositewarping time should be at least 4x longer in my oppinionit would make eve more tactical and fun in nullsec maybe autopiloting distance could be halfed to correspond to thisthat way frieighters and carebears cant complainyou look at the solar system today and its huge and is still small compared to others weve observeddispite eve being in the future there will never be a technology that can bring an object to 6 aus in 11 seconds05 au should be the standard
why the hell not supported
no no it really shouldnt its already not fun to warp across the bigger systems why make it take longer
299792458 ms
nope  you are trying to level the playing field between ships  not supported youre also sugesting crossing a large solar system should take much less than a minute lots of people would end up on gates spamming jump due to session counters in smaller solar systems toothere is noting to recomend your idea in your own post other than you want to add a falcon to a faster fight from off grid  pffftt  man up and fight like a man
supported we already have macros that hide by being in constant warp frankly there is no advantage for the game in having long warps aside from the problems it cause
making them all fire at once might both prevent notification spam but also reduce lag for extra bonus win
the assumption being i know a guy from a top scoring hulkageddon corp and they happen to indeed be a highsec griefer corp hes not even a red aside from hulkageddon timeyou realize this is in direct opposition to your first statement right but thats okay because you dont really make any sensei never said it wasnt so what are you even talking about this is another one of those occurences of you not making sense perhaps you dont know what a highsec griefer corp is despite me spelling it out for you youre very confused or filled with senseless emorageafter contridicting yourself flying into random tangents and apparently still not understanding things as simple as highsec griefer corps which really do contribute the most to hulkageddon despite having this already explained to you this is pretty amusing
so these griefer corps in high sec who are blue most of the time and red during hulk do they use the same toons before and during hulk and just build back up their standings after hulk ends i really dont know any examples so im asking
translation no actual proof just claiming to know 1 guytry and keep up plz cause we werent debating it until u decided to make that baseless assumption with no actual proofnews flash u havent spelled out anything that i havent already addressed especially the highsec griefing part so ure now saying that high sec and low sec pvp is both griefing senseless check emorage checkclaiming to know 1 person does not qualify as proof speaking of tangents ure the one who once again made that baseless assumption with that sorry excuse of what u call proof plz try again
at least the guy i know placed 11th or 12th or something and used his main yes i got the general idea most of the people he was suiciding with also used their mainsthe 1st ranked guy actually being a ceo and yes they simply built their standings back up after being 10 for basically all of hulkageddon his corp does incursions in highsec as well as grief the guy i know being around 15 atm so hes fine in all of highsecanna let me google that for you what the internet nowai ill direct you to the 2nd link seeing as you seem unable to read for yourself the guy i know couldnt possibly be part of the top ranked alliancecorp which just happens to consist of highsec griefers precisely as i said thatd just make way too much sense for you to understand whew google that was hard good thing im here to hold your hand and guide you through it
1its the future and we cant divide our bank accounts lame
mission variety could be greatly increased just by varying the types of rats spawned within them so that a mission runner didnt know exactly what he would be facing before he warped in
add to that making the triggers in waved missions random removing the tip to tell you what faction youre fighting before accepting the mission and adding sleeper ai to the rats
support this 1made similar post a few weeks back 1 a random drop of ice here and there would be nice could be mixed types or one at a time have no issue working to sustain self in wh space 2 yes please mechanics to mine moons is already in the game we pay to play like everyone else in eve let us mine the moons even if the goo is not for t2 production 3 would be very nice for now whoever scans makes bm copies and drops em in a designated slot in a corp hanger for all to have access 4 dont think we need sanshas in there but some other things would be nice i see lots of posts about whs being easy isk and isk for no work or isk at no risk dont mind these ppl anyone that has lived wh space knows how risky and what a logistic nightmare wh life is get it straight flamers and those that are upset about true sec changes wh life is not easy money no intel chans shifting wh exits new whs that spawn 15 min after you complete a scan no auto localsome one must type in local to show up so yes give us wh dwellers some love
i agree we need bookmark upgrades we could use some new usage for moons solo mining of some sort of new materials needed for new wh content we could use ice gravi sites
by this logic because you pay to play you should also be allowed to have a supercapital in there tooface it there are limitations to every area of space one of wh space limitations is no moon mining and the fact that you dont even want it for t2 shows you just want it for the sake of having it you dont see the fail logic in that
because you are to short sighted to see the logic is of no concern to me i make the suggestion to moon mine that is all i leave it to ccp to decide what the goo would be used for we already have cap ships in our wh and if the corp decides to lay out the isk and time to mine the mins to build a super cap in a wh that should be their choice and investment into holding the wh they live in wh space has no concord or any other type of law so in my opinion we should be able to do what we wish in wh space
so content for content sake got it
nosaying there are still vast resources that could be used to improve the game and expand the markets from wh space moons and other things they might add is that clear enough
what vast resources you present no ideas apart from man id love to mine a moon dont really care what i mine or what its for but man i want to mine a moon
1 i already covered those suggestions in another post 2suggestions have already been made in this post as to what the goo could be used for 3 there is nothing wrong with making open ended suggestions that ppl can expand on called planting a seed 4 looking at your employment history id be surprised if anyone ever listened to your ideas it seems all the many corps you have been in either did not like your ideas or you tried to impose your own views upon them and they kicked you out your employment history is as long as my arm sad for a 2008 toon
you are a brilliant troll employment history really grow up man its a gameand this isnt features and ideas its not a place for planting a seed you really think csm is gonna go to ccp and say yo guys let us mine some wh moons we really wanna mine them please just let us mine them for somethingnice ad hominem attacks though that was pretty cute first time someones checked my employment history because they didnt like my posting
struck a nerve did weyep its just a game so why are you trolling againfight fire with fire gets em every time
sweet post browelcome to trolling
never really considered myself a forum troll i just despise egotistical people that cant join a discussion in a meaningful way except to tell everyone their ideas are crap if that makes me a troll so be it
i think what hes suggesting and it should be obvious is that moon mining in whs should be usable for t3 production extending to t3 frigates destroyers battleships etcps pretty sure you cant build a supercap or a titan in a wh as you dont get sov
ship hangars should have the same system corporate hangars haveit really sucks having to give rather full or no access to membersthere is presently no way to give partial ship hangar accesspeople who like to wreck corps can still do their job it would be like the corp wallet and such it will make corp bashing harder but this isnt ment to disable corp wreckersi dont have to give new members full accessi dont have to give rookies full accessi can allow my whole corporation to use a single posi dont have to keep poss secrets to new membersim sure other ceos directors and leaders get ed when 50 battleships and sometimes carriers disappear because we gave someone access to their cruisers and salvagersits nothing but benifit except for corp bashersinfiltratorswreckersnommers whatever give it 7 hangars namable via divisions from ceo home panel add to roles titles and edit member window simular if not idential to corp hangarthank you come againpointlesswitch
no support
smas have limited space in them right if so how would this system work with that
so do corporate hangar arrayscorporate hangar arrays have 1400000 m3 of global space the space is not divided between hangarsship maintainance arrays have 20000000 m3 of space making divisions will not effect the capacity of the sma in any way

difficulties aside i like the ideatho tbh itd prolly be best to restrict the ferrying of pcs to just jumpclones as said previously they can be classified as items for the duration of the contract additionally they become of course unavailable to the contractingpc until delivered and theres no worries about dealing with concious pcs whore in transit1
ah i seewell my current thinking that i touched on briefly somewhere earlier in the thread was that the traveling player will only have access to something like a modified station interface with access to neocom and markets and mail and such this is assuming the haul is going as planned if the haul is hijacked and the player is kidnapped he is stuck here until the pirate releases them or kills them they have to be able to pay the ransom aferall access to wallet they have the option of killing themselves if they like avoids any problems with pirates who can hold players indefinitely in limbo they obviously lose all implants if they die with upcoming incarna designs something like this in transit interface may be fleshed out even more with characters being trapped on a pirate cell unable to leave etc etc but ill leave the future possibilities that incarna brings alone for nowyes there will certainly be collateral demanded and along with that protection you can also specify a quality of the hauler that is allowed to take your contract so its not just money alone that determines who can take you for instance you may just want to go through empspace and you dont want to attract attention to yourself by posting a high collateral so you post small collateral but only haulers with 98 or higher successful delivery rate remember all haulers hauling records are to be kept and are public if they are to retain their license to ferry this incentivizes haulers to strive to keep high success rates and spotless recordson the topic of where the passengers go if a haul is aborted if not picked up by the pirates that destroyed the hauler then when their can is collected by the system dt or maybe after x hours then they can be dropped off at the closest station in storyline say by interbus emergency rescue services if the hauler logs off with haul nothing should happen until the haul timer is expired once that happens they appear in the closest station and the hauler is charged with a failed haul same goes for self destruction of the hauler except the haul timer ends immediatelyduring the trip while the passenger is in the in transit gui they still have access to all neocom they just have no mobility they can kill themselves if they wish say to self abort the trip but doing so forfeits the reward to the hauler after the login screen they go straight to the in transit gui
hello tsubutai if it is all the same to you id like to address your points individuallydont care im aware of ccps views towards amateurish game design they dont like the competition haha just a lil joke there ccp but i was asked to present my idea and i did so lets move on to number twomy experience in low sec consists of the aforementioned incursions and running reaction and production towers in amarr low sec the area i was was populated by five or six russian mission runners and it was so quiet that i was jumping unscouted t1 industrials through low sec several times a week for about a year without ever taking a loss or even seeing a gatecamp so my experience doesnt match yours thats how individual experience works perhaps the difference between my experience and yours is that i wasnt living in the big flashpoints like tama or rancerwell one might say that low sec isnt much of anything hence my idea to add a sandbox toolset to allow corps to make whatever they want out of it the beautiful thing here is that you have the option to continue your existence without participating if you do not want to my goal is to offer up additional choices and playstyles to people who are daunted by the investment in 00 but want to make an impact your argument here seems to be that lowsec is the perfect thunderdome because it is worthless so the only people who go there are looking for fights and as such that it is okay for there to be worthless space ccp has made the argument that they want some space to be more desirable than others hence the anomaly nerf in 00 but they explicitly put in resources to make low sec more attractive l5 missions incursions fw etc this says to me that they want low sec to have value and be worth investing in as of yet they have not been able to strike a balance to encourage lowsec investment by the general playerbase without getting smothered by 00 powers hence my suggestion it is a simple system but i am a simple smirksyours in christh ratli smirks
oh man sectionbysection answers and yours in christ i am being trolled i get that individual experience will vary which is why i provided all them numbers regarding the overall population and activity of lowsec to back up my point youre right that much of amarr lowsec is superquiet but thats not the case for lowsec as a whole i actually dont know why places like aridia and khanid lowsec are as quiet as they are if i had to guess itd be something to do with the poor access to trade hubs and the attendant massive pita of doing logistics but theres a pretty wild difference between those places and say molden heath or essence that said i dont see the heterogeneity of lowsec as being intrinsically bad if nothing else a trip to the backwaters of amarr lowsec allows you to farm 610s in peace and quiet valso i dont think that it makes any kind of sense to describe space that is used and enjoyed by a fairly large number of people on a daily basis as worthless which i guess is the root of our disagreement
i must have done that in the wrong amarr place then i have done low sec exploration in amarr space for months resulting in a total of one 610 which was bugged anyway regarding the proposal i think it just ends up as a module you ninjaanchor in a quiet low sec system and hope no one notices for a long period especially when it isnt on overview and can be anchored at the sun you dont want it to have too much hp but i also dont believe it will promote small gang combat in any way when you make a mechanic that is less tedious when instead of your 10 cruisers you just get 20 rr bs and take it down in a minute before any kind of response can be formed wouldnt it make much more to do something reinforcement timer related but then not one of hoursdays but one measuring in the minutes then also make it so that lets say the last 2 hours worth of income is in the module itself so also 2 hours delay on payout and if you take it down you get it then you actually got a reason to take them down besides lulz which means taking a rr bs gang with you since lulz end pretty fast after shooting structures and you got a reason to stick with a small gang more iskpersonthat said even then i have strong doubts about it and if the goal is to populate low sec with people who actually live there i would do exactly the opposite not removing sentries with a module but massively buffing them although still making sure you can travel with gcc and stop resetting it by sentry fire so effectively removing gatecamping from low sec that makes low sec unique and while usually the opposite of what pirate demand easier to kill targets since it is so hard for them i truly believe that will result in alot more kills for them simply because there will be way more people in low sec meanwhile one of the prime usages of this module will simply be to make sure pirates camping a high sec gate can employ interceptors to catch even more ships in their camps which will do nothing but decrease the number of people in low sec
lowsec is a wasteland because while a lot of kills may happen there relatively few people actually live out there on a daytoday basis lowsec has become a place that people enter roam around or camp a gate for a while get a few killmails or lossmails and leave again and even those 100 lowsec pirate groups often rely on a network of highsec alts to actually sustain their day to day activitiesthe benefit of a proposal along these lines without getting too specific on the individual mechanics discussed is that it encourages the development of lowsec as an actual place where people might want to go and spend a majority of their time rather than some kind of pvp arena that outsiders enter on safari trips
again this doesnt ring true with my experience although this time i cant cite a bunch of numbers to assess the state of things in lowsec as a whole however just looking at the membership numbers of corps who live in my own neck of the woods youve got us in hevrice 80ish dudes although some of us are running around molden heath atm invictas 200 guys 4 jumps away in murethand with their supers and l5s and whatnot spiritus draconis and the former rough necks two jumps in the other direction in aeschee maybe another 150200 characters all told plus various smaller groups lucifers hammer ministry of destruction and a few others in the aescheelisbaetanneadirain area then the gallente fw guys qcats and percussive diplomacy 150ish characters combined who live 5 jumps away in heydieles so just looking at the larger corps around here youve got upwards of 600 characters living within a 9 jump range and thats not counting the various smaller groups that live here plus the roamers and daytrippers im not sure how that compares to the density of permanent residents in deklein but at first glance 2700ish in goonwaffe 68 systems it certainly seems to be at least broadly comparableedit youre right that most lowsec residents need at least one hauling alt especially if theyre outlaws but how is that different from the situation in nullsec where youre heavily reliant on imports from jita inasmuch as there is a problem with overreliance on highsec for materiel and suchlike its a problem that affects the game as a whole rather than being a lowsecspecific issue basically there is at present no reason whatsoever for me to set up production facilities in lownullsec if i can do the same thing with less tiresome hauling and greatly reduced risk in highsec
remove low sec entirely it would make more sense from an rp perspective
like the mining drones i would think a salvage drone would be useful when you rather fit a weapon more than a salvager while you are missioning or mine in a barge in an asteroid belti think for new players that could be real helpful when they are missioning and dont have an extra lootingship to get the most out of the wrecksand to use said drone you could create a new skill disassemble drone for exampleiUFFFDm interested to read what the community thinks to that ideagreets
been proposed a thousand times before and afaik the skill book still exists in game although only as a very rare collectors item but i dont think its really necessary since the introduction of marauders and the noctis
i think its time that empire is divided into citystates run by real players these players elected for a fourmonth period would be in charge of setting a regional tax rate locals who claim to live in a region by checking a box or making a selection once per year could become citizens within a region and be taxexemptmayors would get a percentage of taxes remitted for their efforts at maintaining a region while having the ability to buy different kinds of upgrades what specifics i cant say  ill leave those up to the emergent community of eve but one idea might be to install more short range stargates at the expense of few longer range gatesi love this idea because it enables otherwise unaligned players an opportunity to learn some of the diplomatic insandouts of eve and perhaps develop new leaders in the game it might also have a soft impact on faction warfare or incursionsplexes any thoughts
do you have any reasons for that or are we just supposed to accept this assumption
sure ive got reasons first as stated in the op it would create a new dynamic that would introduce players to diplomatic channels and to interest them in taking a part in world shapingbut beyond that eve online is an emergent game where players increasing take a role in shaping the universe its up to ccp to make certain kinds of tools available to the player community to deepen and widen the scope that the players can participate but of all the areas of the game that have room for expansion i think the metagame is one of the most compellingby giving players the chance to more directly manipulate the game  a subcsm if you will  ccp creates an unprecedented chance for players to involve themselves in the meta game in a relatively harmless way if players screw it up it can be slowly undone and at the same time it creates a lasting consequence that compels players to be involved in the processit could be as far reaching as lowsec and faction warfare or as minimal as docking rates for ships of a certain class but not below we dont want to charge ships below battleship class in the off chance that a new player is aboard itnaturally this would need to have compromises made but while im a brilliant ideasman im not in a position to speak on behalf of the player base thats why i posted this idea id love to hear input on this idea to have it summarily dismissed as a bad idea but how it can become a good idearemember the key is to create a mayoral system that affects regions or heck even systems that can be expanded upon with ambulationincarna should mayors have the ability to ban certain activities how much worldshaping can they be a part oflets make it happen
ccp have revamped carriers supercarriers motherships and titans while dreads have been left in the dustissuesreliance on siege module the dreadnought class ships rely solely on the siege module to perform any role dreads need a role to play effectively while out of siegelack of bonuses other capital ships have a plethora of ship and role bonuses while dreads are left with a substandard 2 bonuses
in canada you always vote for a member of parliament theyre free to change parties or even cross the floor where they join the party with a plurality of seats for a cabinet positioni do not support recalling until eve no longer offers first past the post voting
your reasoning is fallacious you falsely assume that since people are selfish they will always support the ideas that benefit them the most which is not true though i do agree that most people tend to support those ideas that benefit them the most
everyone pursues their own selfinterest even people who donate time and resources to charitable causes do so because they enjoy the feeling they get from doing so altruism is a clever lie concocted by people with power to keep people without it from rebelling against them
the what now
yes because eve should be a singleplayer game besides better management options should allow what you probably want
forgot to do this
no he doesnt and unlike you he actually brings forth rational argumentsthis if you cant figure out how to make profit with t2 production you should go back to missioningbull to make money in eve you eitherhave to be smartor you have to spend enough time ingameor bothyes please dont get into t2 invention less competition equals higher profits for me by the way as far as i know akita t made most of his money by drumroll using his brain that was in 2009 so rather late in the game you know how many sps were involved basically zeroyep i couldnt have pulled that off but i dont blame others for the lack of my success
alternatively work your way up like everyone before you and if higher sp is what you want buy a character via isk sp really doesnt have that much to do with your wallet size its effort organization relationships and intelligence you can probably acquire more isk making skills than most old players have in a few monthsif you want to catch up you can do so by being smarter andor putting in more effort or you can complain but having been around a little while i can tell you that complaining wont get you very far around here
thispretty sure all the changes with the new csm represent a lot of work for you ob by the way good job but can we see fix hybrids apart from other topics like ships rebalancegallente being a weird race that can fight with rails or blaster or drones platforms that need all different bonusrevamp the weapon system it self deserves an opened discussion where newbbies like experienced players have already set their opinion in some important threads that you know very well
suported exept the range boost
something else how would everyone feel about splitting blackops into two versions one combat black ops with no portal for others but those nice t2 resists  all the grid  combat boni that were proposedone support black ops with increased jump range  much bigger fuel bay  maybe some kind of command bonus stuff
the problem with the tier system is not that it exists it is that some of the roles within that system need revising or adjustingcase in point the assault cruisers omen and maller thorax and vexor rupture and stabber caracal and moa i think everyone can agree here that the only serious problems here are the 2 amarr assault cruisers and the moa the moas problem is probably a lot more related to railguns then anything else but the biggest problem of all is the fact that the omen and maller suckthe removal of the tier system will not fix this imbalance in my minds eye the omen is the ganker and the maller is the tanker so the omen needs to be adjusted so that it does more damage and in this case the fix is simple give it enough grid and cpu to fill its high slots without gimping the rest of the ship or adjust the medium sized lasers fitting so the same result can be achieved the maller is slightly harder it needs to be able to tank but at the same time it needs to do less damage then the omen the bonuses are fine here so all that is needed in my view is either the replacement of 2 of its turret hardpoints with missile launcher hardpoints or move a high slot to a low slot and remove a turret hardpoint the latter would be my preferred fix simply because it would give an extra slot to enable the pilot to fit more of a buffer and would allow more of the ships capacitor to be used for tankingwhether or not those changes are worth doing or not is not important but it shows that the ships balance issues can be fixed without removing the tier systemthe second biggest issue with tiers in my eye is the battlecruiserswhen ccp introduced the tier 2 battlecruisers they were billed as gank boats what did we get gank boats that completely obsoleted the tier 1 battlecruisers in pretty much every wayhow to fix thisthe big one the drake remove that shield resistance bonus and replace it with a missile velocity bonus or launcher rate of fire bonus and make it a true mini raven the myrmidon in this case gallente already have a pretty decent gank bc the brutixsure it suffers from the usual blaster boat issues so what i would do is make it the tank bc since thats the general design of gallente drone boats anyway so dont hate me but i would remove the rep bonus from the brutix and replace it with either a tracking bonus or some kind of speedagility bonus to help it get into range the myrm could then be left pretty much untouched as it follows pretty much every other rule in the drone boat philosophypossible change could be a high slot to a low slot but it already has one less turret then the brutix and no hybrid damage bonus so not sure this is neededso there you go you dont have to scrap the teir system to fix t1 ship balance you just have to tweak a few of the ships most of the problems with the t1 ships themselves stem from bigger issues like hybrids sucking or damps making the celestis suck take a look at the bigger issues before you try to throw a slegehammer at something a claw hammer would fix
tier 2 bcsfirst of all the claim that bc  cruisers is kinda missing the point bigger isnt supposed to be better in eve its supposed to be different the problem with bcs in general is that theyre effectively better than cruisers at being cruisers as they use the same size weapons but have many more slots and weapons the problem of slots is particularly apparent when it comes to what should be the definitive advantage of cruisers mobility the additional slots and much greater ease of fitting of a hurricane allows you to fit it so that its faster more agile and has more ehp and dps then a rupture that should not be possible the result is obvious  theres little reason to fly cruisers and most people just go straight to bcs instead hence the spam of bcs everywherehacs versus bcs im talking here about the closerange hacs the ones that nobody ever sees because its much more sensible to fly a tier 2 bc instead suckrilege and diemost are the classic offenders even in armourhac gangs built to take advantage of the t2 resists these are rarely seen with people clearly choosing scorch instead its the same problem  the hurricane and drake and better than deimoses and sacrileges at being deimoses and sacrilegespeople complain about destroyers being weak and theyve got a point but quite frankly destroyers as a class relative to other classes are better balanced than tier 2 bcs are destroyers have a specific role while tier 2 bcs are just swiss army knives  too good at too many things and this is reflected in their popularity both for pve and pvp within their class the tier 2 bcs are pretty well balanced but the class itself is overpowered
yes it will  you do realise nodps brick that screams bait is not a role rightand did i read that correctly you want to give it a split weapon system are you really that stupid do you actually think its dps isnt low enough already rate of fire i could certainly live with velocity is worthless liking itumm sorry but that still wouldnt be fixing things too many ships are terrible at too many things for no better reason than their tier and buffing them as was done with the brutix basically is removing tier discrepanciesyou didnt even mention what to do with the omen which has the blindingly obvious problem of not even having enough grid to fit gunsplatemwd a large number of the lower tier ships need a buff in various ways see my post on page 3 to make them workable for many of them these buffs are very straightforwardalso regypsios entire post  umm basically yeah the hurricane imbalance is what sticks out most to me one time me and a friend added it up at the current prices of the region with a modest budget fit a cyclone wouldve cost 4mil more than a rupture factoring insurance  and thats when i gave up on cruisers altogether
well i almost agree everything you just said except that battlecruisers not only outperform by far cruisers but some of them can also easily outperform a battleshipflying gallente with 1 of my chars and all i can say despite all roxxors demi gods better than every one is that people must keep in mind that you fly a battlecruiser with less than 5m sp and at this point the reason wy people fly them its just because with same skills just about 6hours they can fly something that spit 3 times the cruiser dps and tanks tons more dps at that lvlnow why people fly mostly bcs to pvp there are a few oneshurricanes outperforming most of any tiers bs thanks to those stupid guns being used by the most fastest race in the game can dictate distance dps almost like his lasers counterpart at the same distancethx drones have a better dmg projection and weapon tracking at point blanck than blastersthere is no reason for me when i fly with my gallente char that i fly my trimarkedplated mega and his poor performances all t2faction fit when i can fly an hurricane meta4 and t2 fitted that does much better in 90 of all situation i deal with where my char lives 0302you say bigger doesnt means better well im sorry i cant agree my hurricane full fitrigged costs me cheaper than my 3t1 trimarks and my 2 rolled tungsten plates and now youre going to tell me storys about role im ok lets do it whats the role of a battleship in this game mission or fly only in fleets with over 10 men without fear the first hurricane or hac not the deiworst ocif you really think it should be like this bigger  fragile then whats the purpose of supercaps devs alts and stone age players i win button wow need to play that class too

one crucial change to destroyers reduce number of turrets to 4 or 5 remove rof penalty add or remove from damage bonuses to keep them at the dps levels they have nowresult destroyers no longer cost as much as cruisers via having to fit twice as many guns

i am not for or against timezone warfare i would argue that we are already working globally in null sec nc had 30k toons last time i could be bothered to check i would be willing yo bet they can cover almost any timezone they desirethe idea here was to foster warfare styles that diverge from the standard massive fleet engagements upon structures with timers we could foster the option of utilizing a smaller fleet without somehow limiting the time scale but this would very likely reduce the upgrades desirability enough that no one would bother building them no upgrades  no combat it would nice to see raiding for destruction and raiding for profit become workable play styles currently invaders must actively camp your systems with a fleet or they have to menace you with the threat of sneak attacks by cloaked ships once they leave though everyone goes back to what they were doing
upgrade amons in null sec and remove all l4 missions in highsec not going to happen but it sure as hell would balance nullsec to highsec profit
bump for a good topic
because everything gallente is supposed to be  why should towers be any differentbitter
back to the topagainccp for the love of god bring it backor something better 
player mods is the best option ccp has a one time upfront rewrite of the code and then players make custom ui mods ccp has very little to do after that except perhaps implement the best ui mods into their software look at all the other games out there with player mods
i would like to profit from creative players yeah those that pretty often have better ideascreativitydesign culture than most ui devs no matter the game they must make important discounts i hate that overview reminding me excellwtf its a space ship game with an ui just good to equip a 1970s amiga gamecant i just leave the text and make those ing borders become invisiblesame for all windowsthe neocommy htcs bureau looks better and any one having one knows its 9 years old design id like to see those icons resizeable changeable fontscolours being able to put them where ever i want and most important make it future guysat the same time asking for future ui stuff when some of those space ships are made of woodconcrete and use 2nd world war ammo i know its too much
given the thread title i realise this isnt what youre looking for but please could a csm member just mention that ideally we need a new ui built from scratch and entirely customisableback on topic theres just wayyyy too much stuff in the right click menu for me itd be ideal if i could not only customise it but have different settings perhaps stealing from the existing overview code i cant tell you the number of times ive added a station to overview when i was trying to click on dock
remove the notifications box that sits in the middle of the screen and never shows me stuff im interested in seeingin the contracts ui when i set up a private contract i should be able to drag a face into the recipient box from my contacts list alternately open up the character search interface in the contract confirmation the characters face should appear next to the name i shouldnt have to risk sending my valuable stuff to mara rim instead of mara rinn just because i have fat fingers yes there are a million stages in the contract process where i see the name but the awful font doesnt give me much room for detecting simple errors cant distinguish rn from m 1 from l from isessionchange agnostic chat interface if im in the middle of chatting to someone while docking or jumping i shouldnt have to wait for twenty seconds before i can continue typing in the chat windowsessionchange agnostic contracts interface if ive set up a search and filters i shouldnt lose the results just because i dock at a station or jump through a stargatereconnect with drones we can reconnect with probespush more of the combat ui into the 3d mouseover labels on objects in space target boxes yellowred status brackets even the brackets including colours for standingscorpfleetetc go replay some xwing vs tie fighter for ui ideasmove popup information such as ded database details to a video chat overlay such as from wing commander allow this to be used for pilot comms too and consider moving all local chat by npcs to this system too reviewing my local log at some point later to find that krull was smacktalking doesnt have the desired effectallow chat channels to be combined just like that major fantasy mmo use  commands to determine the channel to send to eg alli hello folks would send hello folks to the alliance chatput an opaque or at least minimally transparent background behind module buttons preferably a dark colour such as black black or blackhighlight the icons of agents for whom you have missions completedinprogressadd a docking computer which will play the blue danube when the autopilot warps the ship to the docking queue of the station and starts approaching for docking at the regulation 40msprovide an option for the autopilot to avoid incursion constellations and add gate camps to incursions in hisechighlight the ship in space of the active speaker on eve voice fleet channel highlight the ship in space of pilots sending messages in local or fleetif a mission agent is also a locator agent dont force me to pick request mission in order to talk to the agent about the mission i have just completed talking to the agent about locating someone should be a separate function from talking to the agent about a mission in fact the agent should probably be trying to initiate the conversation if ive completed the mission
yeah ok
yup
hi folks oi post my proposition in the ship balance thread but i guess its something you could like
i hate this shipunless im flying oneit is what destroyers should be without the speed
the idea behind this is to make it take shorter to travel xxx amount of jumps this encourage small roaming in 00
the impatience of kids these days a smaller feeling game is the opposite of what is needednot supported
so whats wrong with ratting the sec status back up cause they didnt stay 10 they took the time and effort to do so so once again whats your problem with them1 news flash the guy u know is not seeing as how u said he was 11th or 12th when the list only goes up to the top 10 derp way to provide proof that doesnt actually prove anything 2 most of the characters listed there r 10s most of whom belongs in one of those top ranked corps the other corps r mostly nc3 but gj for disproving your own point with your own proof
lowsec may not entirely be not griefing but it certainly is less griefinghighsec  place for people to hang out who dont really want to get into direct player combat and has game mechanic protection for said people although combat is allowed to be initiated there are very short sharp consequences for it concordlowsec  place where combat is allowed by game mechanics but with only limited consequencesnullsec  place where combat can happen by anybody for any reason with no game enforced consequencestherefore anybody choosing to enter lowsec and nullsec even more so is also choosing to go somewhere they can be shot at shooting at somebody who chooses to be in a place they can be shot at isnt really griefingor maybe im just talking out my ass
check my first response it was plenty meaningful unfortunately you morons think anyone that disagrees with you in any way however marginal is a trollat which point i will troll the  out of you for s and giggles
jesus guys stop this why dont you slap each other and stop this fightthe idea of moon mining in wh have been risen many times the usage of those materials have been propposed to be many things  t2 stuff like 00 this i dont agree with  should be something else  ice instead of putting them on gravi sites for pos fuell  new types of materials  something required to manufacture new types of t3 ships  something required to run new types of wh specific constructions many things have been proposed  wh stabilisers wh spawning structures and different types of wh specific upgrades  insert your proposal heremore over the basic idea of moon mining have been proposed to be implemented differently than in ksapce  for example people proposed solo mining people would plant small structures at moon orbit that would be totally destructible by attacking forces allowing individual players to gather the goods and requiring constant actions at least moving goods from structure to hangar and running new program but may be more  maybe a little similar to pi with a limit to ammount of structures at each moonso mr emperor salazar is that good enough and elaborate enough proposal for you
much better though i dont agree with most of itt2 stuff would be a bad idea people would farm it and then export which would have an adverse effect on the current t2 marketice for pos fuel is also a bad idea that needs to be in hidden belts ccps current policy is that they wanted wh dwellers to have to return to kspace for something however i disagree with this if people want to put in the effort to be self sustaining they should be allowed tomore t3 shipsmaybewh specific upgrades like the ones you are mentioning are bad ideas and would really mess up current mechanics of wh space wh stabilizers just means making wh space easier  bad idea and wh spawning structures just means making farming easier  also a bad ideaso really the only halfway decent option is some sort of resource for some sort of new stuff however you have to remember that quite frankly wh space is one of the more successful areas of eve thus the idea that ccp would buff it any time soon with new content is wishful thinking at best not saying they shouldnt just saying dont get your hopes upi do like the idea of making moon mining less of a passive action and something that can be interrupted by other players whatever resource is there needs to be rare and hard to attain and it needs to deplete
yes bookmarks we all know what need to be done ice yes limited the spawns tho so it will be put into towers not the market hub h3ll even a minute addition to wh content would be appreciated
sure not everyone have to agree thats what discussion is all about  discuss things and not just saying your idea is bad mkaywhat i proposed here are not my proposal its a collection of ideas regarding wh that i saw in many treads around here and fi forumsand yes wh will not likelly get any new content from ccp any time soon but still its good to have some opinion about what people are expecting and put them here  in ah for unlikelly csm attention and one day maybe it will be seen as agenda point at the csm summitnow regarding ice  yes it should be scarse and dont have to be from moons  it should be easy to get fuel for one pos but not for 10 and there are allies with 40 posses in system  most of them with forcefields wh upgrades would be nice things but as you mentioned it is something potentially gamebreaking and would have to be well thoughtout there are some interesting ideas out there though  many connected to wh moonmining goowhat im saying is we as wh dwellers should and maybe even need to be here in those forums and let our voice be heard or no matter what good and well thought ideas will be presented they will never be even discussed by csm not to mention ccp
suported 
sorry while i think ls space needs a bit of an overhaul im not truly in support of this idea two possibilities arise from this suggestionlow security space goes the way of nullsec with large alliances blobbing everything in site like it isnt bad enough alreadythis idea lands in the same realm as faction warfare or more likely worse and is kind of like a shoe horn without the shoe pointlessedit aside from that i could punch holes in your plan if i really fealt like it given the hundreds of flaws inherent with the idea
 npc 00 is renowned for the amount and the quality of its small gang combat while lowsec is not renowned for much of anything why are all these low sec proposals from people who dont live thereevery time somebody from my corp suggests we move to get more kills i do a search on dotlan and find that the low sec systems my corp patrols regularly outstrips any area in npc 00 space in terms of total kills  and they are all small gang stuff syndicate is thataway  why not make these proposals for npc 00 instead syndicate and outer ring are the true wastelands of eve fix them first
great ideas
while i think buffing lowsec should not be done by buffing lowsec i will support any improvement of lowsec i also happen to like this one
because compared to the other types of space noone lives there
lowsec is much more denselypopulated than both nullsec and wspace hth
i agree people who dont live in low sec should stop making proposals to improve it and the counter to those saying none live there is simple i live there i can also name a dozen or more 50 man corps who live there too and thats just in my roaming area the stats as given above also prove it there wouldnt be any kills there if none were there to kill yes people roam in but for every gang roaming in looking for a fight there is another that simply lives there and is defending its turfthe reason low sec seems dead when you go on your little incursions is no one there wants to fight your 100 man incursion gang with 20 logis we roam around in 1 to 20 man gangs with 5 or so being the typical size no one wants anything to do with you in low sec and we all have scout alts scattered around we see you coming from 5 systems away and make ourselves scarce before you show up now yes many systems are very sparsely populated and aridia as a region is that way too but the areas with significant resources mostly good agents that arent too far from a major trade hub thats the problem with aridia are heavily used and many players live there
please dont let the facts stand in the way of a good argumentanyways heres how i read it space pirate fantasy for 50 mil i can set up a perma gate camp and start farming everybody without having to worry about gate guns wanna gank others during an incursion slap this puppy up and have at it farm sansha and others travelling through while not having to worry about gate guns you can even keep your sec statusthere are tons of unused l4 agents in low sec right now there are also many very high qualityq20 l4 agents as well that are not even used there will be plenty of them out there with poor quality that will be profitable when the agent quality patch hits
actually rather surprised this thread got some responsesto address your issues which should be relatively obvious though i didnt bother to go back and edit them in after all that when i realized i had missed station undockingstations would extend their usefulness and versatility with the addition of new undocking areas designed for different classes of ships currently and busy station generally has a bunch of undocking vessels meshing quite poorly or well if you like as they exit the stationnew undocking areas would be for frigates and destroyers cruisers and battlecruisers industrials and mining vessels battleships freighters and capital industrial ships and capitals simple enoughnow we add an undock timer still allowing for 2030 second immunity on undock make it so know ship can realign within 10 seconds of undock and expel all ships at the same velocity from their respective undocking locations the undock timer will be a traffic control device which prevents ships from undocking all at once and introduces an order of undock sequence which allows no ship to collide with anotherdoneanyway this does actually stop bots and ill tell you why bots can only account for so many variables and colliding with unknown objects is not one of them any bot that beats this is going to be a most complex device and cleverly crafted most others will be outdated and incapable of the complexity required for the taskthe idea is that the player has to pay attention and stear away from objects which would collide with hisher ship maneuverability and speed of most mining craft should be enough to do this this actually makes mining a more dynamic and interesting way to pass the time with more danger looming than the occaisional can flipper afk m ining would generally be out of the question as even from relative safety some distance from the field asteroids would move out of range and your mining activities would cease some people might not like this but thats a price you may have to payanyway also thought of another possible solution so ill move onto that now
this is a possible solution that doesnt require banning multiple accounts and instead allows them to choose to continue playing without their macros or quit and move on to something else
warp to belt turn on mining lasers go make a cup of tea come back to podno
yes i too want to punish every single player in the game because of macro miners
this is something ive been thinking about for a while now and wanted to throw the idea out there the primary positive consequences i see are boldedlets say it were increased to something like 50 of the cost of creating an order what would be the effects these are the immediate ones i can see1 repeated adjustments of orders would not be practical and changes to orders would be a considerable faction of the overall value2 because of 1 micromanaging traders would be encouraged to use smaller but more numerous orders instead of moving large single orders around so a players that is constantly managing their trading will still be able to greatly increase their market share during their active playtime however this type of micromanagement wouldnt lead to whale orders messing up the market values when theyre offline3 because of 1 prices would better converge to balanced market values where supply meets demand as opposed to going wherever one person wants to drive the undercutting war current situation4 because of 1 2 and 3 it would be an environment where many small orders are constantly being added filled and disappearing while a few larger orders farther from the currently fine tuned market value act as backstops against rapid market swings this is a more interesting situation than a few highly micromanaged orders squishing any others and is thus better gameplay5 because of 4 those that do not wish to heavily micromanage their orders can more effectively use them to buy and sell goods6 because of 2 4 and 5 there is more room for varied types of traders those that focus on covering locations for customer convenience manufacturers and consumers that just want to buysell at a good price those that want to micromanage a single thing and those that want to do long timeframe investmentsspeculationmanipulation7 because of 5 players that arent really traders would be encouraged to use their order slots for passive income like they would their rd slots8 because of 7 more players would get into the trading thing meaning more order slots would be used and thus the overall coverage in the galaxy would improve better serving the players with availability of items on markets
this is by no means a fact rather a point of view it also kinda depends on your definiton of altruismvoting for someone who supports the same or similar ideas as you even if they do not benefit you or even ideas that affect you negatively is not the same as altruism
ok guys put up the two hybrid threads on post 3also added drone implantsok i think that is everything
thousands of drake users would disagree  having now compared the 2 ships on eft i now see that the mallers dps is indeed lower then the omens anyway so my changes are no longer needed posting at 5am for the lose however isnt that kind of the point the omen is the ganker its supposed to deal more dps then the maller or else why fly the omen in the first place if you can get the maller to out  dps the omen then the omen is obsoletereading the complaints on this very board most people complain that the omen hasnt got enough grid and cpu to fit a full rack of lasers and well almost anything elsei checked on eft and this is indeed true now as to wether there should be enough grid to fit an mwd to it well that then goes down the line of do we want every ship to be able to fit an mwd the correct answer is it depends on where you want to fly it or do we want every ship to be flown in the same way ccp has already said no to this which is why they do not want to buff the nighthawks grid to fit an mwdset up using all level 5 character on eftomen new setup 1heat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink ii800mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates iinternal force field array i10mn afterburner iifaint warp disruptor iempty med slotfocused medium pulse laser ii multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii multifrequency mruns out of grid and cpu if you try to swap the afterburner to an mwd but with standard it can hit out to 15km anyway and you can change crystals in about a second once you are closer the biggest weakness is the fact that you have now got 475 cpu and 585 grid to fill that last medium slotadmittedly using less t2 stuff can make things easier but if your an experienced pilot thats what you would be using most of the timeif you ask me the biggest problem with the omen is that they gave it the 5th turret and they did not adjust its grid and cpu accordingly or if they did did not give it anywhere near enough to make use of that hardpoint that is why i suggested giving it the extra grid and cpu in my last postall the missile velocity bonus would do is make it into a long range missile boat but then maybe we have enough of those alreadythe rate of fire bonus would certainly up its dps
from my experience in eve i feel following ships needs to be rethinked1 eosas it stands now this ship is really  hmm i dare say that eos needs to be deleted in its current status i understand it is a fleet commandship and it is not meant for omfgod dps but with its ganklink bonus nearly useless it has nothingand it is a creodron ship creodron id like to repeatfirst of all i would like to see it to have 125 drone bandwidth in doing so it must have its turrent hardpoint decreased to 3 it shall not have drone damage bonus modify its current 15 drone bay bonus to 50in addition its current 7  4  6 could be 6  5  6 or even 6  5  5 which puts it in line of other droneboats where they have fairly balanced slot layoutswith this change eos will be a gimped drone boat but at least it will have enough drone bay for waves of drones for support in a small gang 2 dominixnothing really wrong with it in its current status but may i suggest for eve designers to rethink its current shape it really needs a whole new design and appearancejust my 2isk you can tell that i am a drone user and a gallentne pilot
you mean the fools who take pve drakes into pvp because the view the drake is nothing but bait originates from somewhere around 2006 and is hopelessly out of dateill repeat this for youlowdps brick is not a pvp role you dont win fights by sitting there with double the ehp and no dps and having only idiots engage you because you may as well have a sign over your head saying baitpersonally im in favour of the missile boat idea thats been floating around namely give the maller hams and a drone bay there nicely differentiated from the omen yes mwd is mandatory for 90 of pvp ships something being completely unable to fit one alongside the lowest tier of tank and gank is utterly unacceptable my abaddon can outrun an average afterburning cruiserby the way your fit is an utter joke nice overpriced damage control youve got there i shouldve mentioned it needs a cpu boost as well as a significant grid boost if anything we have too many of them considering long range missileboat is a seriously debatable role at best theres a reason hml cerbs and cruise ravens are not popular in gangs this is why in the current state of the game a velocity bonus is a massive nerfrof would be an acceptable tradeoff but there still exists the possibility of it being overpoweredthe 10 applying to some frigates and the odd tech 3there are other workable ab fits but theyre incredibly nichUFFFD and frequently require gang links to work
big problems here giving it a missile velocity bonus just makes it a big fat caracal we really dont need two almostidentical ships like thatthe missile rof bonus would be heh interesting if youd find an 870 dps 1006 dps overloaded ham drake to be interesting
the cane is a big fat rupture and i dont see anyone complaining about thatwhile i could go for a tier 2 bc nerf nerfing them down to tier 1 levels would be silly  half of the tier 1s are terrible and the other two are only soso buff tier 1 bcs and nerf tier 2s so theyre both sort of tier 15 but with different roles and youd be there
fully support post no 77 these are great suggestions for boosting gallente hulls
you should have seen them back in 20062007 when they had those stats a fleet of rr eos with orgre iis were just amazing
but thats where they belong to one shouldnt expect much from a tech1 ship even if its a battleship much less a mere battlecruiser pennypinchers are really spoilt nowadays
every ship should have a purpose and be worth flying reducing all bcs to the level of the prophecy would be stupid
im kinda neutral on the nerf suggestion but it does have to be said that the tier 1s are only terrible compared to the tier 2s put a tier 1 bc against a tech 1 cruiser and the cruiser is gonna die in a fire price difference isnt even that much factoring insurance
yeap thats why we need to bring tier2 down to tier1 otherwise  should ccp follow your advice  the amount of battlecruisers will be even more overwhelming than it is nowits pretty evident really
also gotta admit looking at this objectively the stats some bcs can reach really arent far off bs level but with the added mobility and walletfriendly pricesgypsio may indeed have a point on nerfing tier 2s in general 
i started in the csm discussion on this topic it seems to me the easiest fix that makes sense is setting fines up for gankerssuicide ganker pays 50 base value of target paid to concordeach aggressor on the km has to pay the same amount insurance is paid at 50 of insurance levelplatinum insurance x 50standings hit stays the samenegative iskowed fines activate concord bountyhuntersforcing you to eject from current ship if fines arent paid within a set amount of timedont lie you love the idea
i like the ihub hacking module idea from earlier because its the only idea that would actually work with a small gangok so your small gang of 1020 ships flies into enemy territory they see you and try to get a home defense fleet up during this time your group heads to the ihub and whoever in your gang has the hacking module starts to work on one of the upgrades only one hacking module at a time can be used on an upgrade to prevent blobbingalso hacking an ihub upgrade might take 10 or so minutes of hacking to give the natives time to get a home defense fleet upbecause hacking only takes 10 minutes the home defense fleet only has 10 minutes to form up and chase off the attackers again this would mean that the involved fleet sizes would be on the small sideif a module gets hacked it shuts down for 6 hours this is annoying but not crippling that means its worth it for a small roam to do to someone but not really worth calling a cta forthis encourages small fleet sizes for both attack and defense
stopped reading here there isnt a single entity in the game who can form an effective counter gang engage and destroy 1020 ships in 10 minutes nor will there ever be if we assume absolute best case scenario there are enough people in system to counter the gang they notice their ihub is being hacked 1 minute and dock up 1 minute switch to the exact counter ship they happen to have in station and undock 1 minute warp to the ihub 1 minute they now have 6 minutes to wipe out a 1020 man gang if people need to come from 23 jumps out they arent even going to get in system in timewhat this comes down to every time is you want people to be forced to engage roaming gangs with an inferior gang that will do nothing but pad your killboard 10 minutes of effort for 1 person to shut down ratting for 6 hours is pants on head ed
well i stopped reading after i read thatok half an hour hack time or an hour whatever just whatever time it takes one alliance to get a home defense fleet going but not enough time to cyno in every supercap in whatever massive power block you are in and maybe it only shuts down the ihub upgrade for 23 hours
agree
mechanical change would be required to make this workyou would need to increase the speed your ship increases to max warp velocity 1s60au would be a punching warp effect like in the examples providedbefore you troll me to deathwarping time would have to be stretched slightlynow 5s align 9s normal to warp 30s warp 9s warp to normal doneproposal 5s align 1s normal to warp 46s warp 1s warp to normal donethis would make time the same and would accomidate this awesome effectdont change warp speed it would just be a graphical change to accomidate this

i believe that any product that is truly excellent must go beyond normal constraintsi am a fan of diablo 1 through lod i am a fan today i wait for diablo 3 with anticipation and excitement yet i believe that i must be patient but in eve we already have our diablo 3 the game sits before us waiting for us to take hold and enjoy so today i ask for something i think only a truly dedicated fan can ask for please ccp take your time i will continue to pay my duesand peer at your art through a tiny computer screen you have worked long and hardthe foundation is formed now it is time to plant the garden and paint the wallsit is time for a classic to be formed
i agree with the op also here is one of my ideas from another thread regarding super capitalscurrently super capital ships can be used for risk free ganksit is not uncommon for a supercarrier to log off with aggro and dissappear before anything but the largest of fleets can dispatch itmy proposal is thissuper capital ships should never disappear from space a ship that large should require the infrastructure of an empire to support itadd a new pos module for docking supercapitals at a pos this will keep them safe from bumpingthis will force players to have said infrastructure to actually support these behemoths it might also slow super capital proliferation as people will actually have to support them logistically with fuel for the posthis is a rough idea but i think it has merit
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesjust a quick design i came up with and maybe something like what id like to seeeditmight want to add expandable features to drones on top left like the overview only projecting down also cover neocom slider with current system and autopilot route when not in use and add flip switch to move between the twoadd doubleclick to chat slider to enter chat in channel 3 second mouseover to open channel window for readingadd all fleet commands to fleet channel as text including those from fleet command and wing command to squad fleet channel
which is exactly why i mentioned it  theres some great ideas in here but even if ccp read them all and said great idea they would never all make it to the final code where as if we had our own customisable uihell the more the better it could even be a new service ingame another money sink that ccps dying for
when opening the fleet window i am presented with form fleet and join fleet if i select join fleet i should be shown the find fleets tab not the my advert tab in addition the ui should populate the list with all fleets available to meif i form a fleet and then choose to advertise my fleet i should be shown the my advert tab not the find fleets tab
haha yall are awesome thanks for the support
did a dev read this change the name to time dilation and claim all the creditlol
the date of birth does not refer to the capsuleer but to the person the corporation that is founded to represent the human being so she can interact with the scc and isk can be pushed around and to enforce rules statutes etcthe person is then fused with a larger corporation and becomes the daughter of a n00b corpthe person can of course found heris own mother corp and enforce heris own rules statutes etcthe human being can do none of that so you see how important the wording is hereday of birth it must stay notice the capitalization dead giveaway for corpspeak
this guy nailed it about as good as anybody has imo
well the original idea from this proposal is that sending funds from positive standing characters to negative standing characters and vice versa should have some sec status or corp status consequence otherwise it seems like a loophole in the systempositive standing players sending to negative standing characters should take some sort of standing penalty while negative standing characters like pirates should be able to raise their standing by sending money to high sec status players but lose status with their corp if the corp is a pirate corp this is to prevent this sending money to positive characters used as a shortcut to increase their sec status i think that the rate of sec status gain should be less than sec status loss its harder to buy your reputation up to good again than it is to let a good reputation slip into badnow how can we tell what a pirate corp is is there a good way to do this perhaps the status of the ceo im open to ideas here
the baddie1 if your reading comprehension is too low to have found the complete lists i can not help you considering it makes no difference anyways i dont know what youre smoking2 if you cant manage to recognize half a dozen pirates who took par
you seem to use the terms standing and security status interchangeably these are two very different concepts to avoid confusion are you in fact referring to security status the whole timei still see this as an idea that addresses a problem that doesnt really matter remember that this is a persistent world that is meant to be played for entertainment purposes the most fun that this particular persistent world offers is player ship to player ship combatnot only that but the entire economy revolves around the construction and destruction of ships if players are strongly discouraged from engaging in ship to ship combat ships dont get destroyed if ships dont get destroyed they dont need to be built again if ships dont need to be built industrialists are out of work if industrialists are out of work and combat pilots cant pew pew then what the hell is left to doimplementing this proposal in any form would be game breaking still not supported
i dont follow how making sec status rules consistent automatically make people pvp less that it may just change the way the economy of piracy a bit but in my opinion if pirates are only viable if funded by carebear alts then the profession needs some fixing on its owngood point i mean sec status for goodbad transfers and sec status and standings with your pirate corp changes for badgood transfers you get a sec status boost if you donate to a good toon and you are a pirate but you may lose standing with your corp admittedly this is only a thought at this point and probably not the best way to handle thisat the end of it all i am for free markets and economy within a consistent set of rules with minimal loop holes which in the end will foster professions of all sorts pvp and pirates included to flourish under their own right not be artificially propped up by a loopholefor example if this was implemented then players will perhaps spend more time playing as the pirate to earn cash instead of just playing as a carebear gathering enough cash hop into a pirate alt to shoot some things with the carebears funds then log off again to rat as the carebear to me that make piracy a shadow profession and its use in the universe is more like a metagame and not people who live in the game the same way as the other professionsokay so im getting a little rpg on you now i apologize 
what does this mean do you mean i lose standings with pirate corps i might mission with or do you mean i lose standings with the player run corp im a member ofalso how and why does this affect people like me who live in nullsec im twenty jumps from concord why should they care who i send money to
i dont follow how current security status rules are inconsistent if they are whats inconsistent about them in fact id say that having a pirate as defined by security status paying a law abiding character to gain sec status would also be inconsistent why would the pirate be less of a pirate simply by being involved with a law abiding citizen shouldnt the law abiding citizen just take a sec status hit for receiving dirty moneyto clarify my point the proposal wouldnt directly make people pvp less but it would be a further discouragement to losing security status thereby providing a disincentive to go around blowing up shipsi have plenty of alts with which i transfer cash back and forward between most are trade alts but some are pvp alts this proposal would discourage me from engaging in piracy with any of my alts currently i almost exclusively fight in nullsec anyway so security status isnt an issue because it would just cause a chain reaction that would hamper my regular business it just makes a big pita like pi for no good reason unlike piwhich then begs the question  how would this proposal improve eves gameplay exactly i propose that it would make for more convoluted empire rules that only serve to confuse and add a platform to grief new players
that is a good point i thought at first that it would only apply to npc corp standings through some formula akin to how your faction standings are modified when you do enough missions for a corp in the faction or against it except that we take for a pirate faction all corps which are npc rats guristas bloods angels sanshasthe point of null sec is a valid point at first i thought that maybe all transactions would be monitored but it goes against the nature of free4all in null sec as somebody pointed out so i think that if the characters have a home system that is not in empspace then this penalty should not apply
hmm yes perhaps just the one sided hit for the law abiding citizen would be enough my thought was that pirates can earn back status by donating to good causes and corps but i think this would be a bad ideanot sure i agree with you here why would it discourage anyone to losing status a pirate is going to be a pirate regardless of these rules and transferring money between pirates neg status to other neg status players have no penalty what this rule would reflect is the real fact that if you are funding pirates then you are becoming a pirate in the process albeit slowlyso are you saying that without your trader alt your pirate would not be able to sustain a regular source of income doing pirate things like gank hold for random steal and run missions for pirate corps if this is the case then this is my point exactly if this is true then the pirate profession is gimped and needs fixing a proposal of how would be out of scope for this discussionbecause i think that piracy or bad professions should not be a meta game feature make  with a good alt then transfer  to a low sec alt to play bad boy for a day but be a real part of the economy incidentally i think the new black market booster trade coming in incarna may make smugglers and pirates more of a real profession a working bounty system would too so why is this loophole hurting the eve universe well imho and you are free to disagree1 its hiding a problem with piracy profession which is gimped and ccp is avoiding fixing it a pirate toon should be able to play pirate 100 without metahelp from a good alt2 metagames are an artificial factor in the economy which sees money flowing not because of true supply and demand but because players are just moving cash between good and bad alts essentially allowing good toons to commit crimes like assassination without any sec rating consequences thats the inconsistent part3 it gimps the bounty system if there were sec penalties for moving money to an alt to kill someone then you would have to resort to posting bounties on people if you want them dead which creates a true market demand competition and jobs for bad players which is good
the one topic that i am still struggling with is whether or not nullsec players should be subject to the same rules on one hand concord does not police null sec and doing anything will not affect your security status so a 10 pirate killing someone in nullsec vs a 50 player in nullsec killing somebody are treated no differently and neither of them are considered to have committed any crimes so we would want to preserve that spirit of the law in nullsecthe problem with locality is when is a player considered a null sec player and when are they considered an emp space player clearly we would ideally want this rule to apply only to empsec players but how can we classify the playerone choice is we can use the home system of the player which is where their med clone is located this is clear cut but allows for exploit by way of moving med clones aroundanother choice is to use the corp of the player so what would make a corp good or bad one idea is maybe make restrict isk transfers be a choice that the ceo of the corp can set onoff if set on then isk xfers to criminals would incur sec status penalties if off then nothing would happen so then why would any corp want to set this setting to on to restrict their members we could incentivize the corp somehow perhaps by way of lower taxes or a tax rebate from concord on all bounties collected because they are compliant to the concord clean money xfer lawsthis way carebear corps that enforce this level of financial reporting will have all members subject to the penalties but the members in corp in general will make more isk or a corp can choose not to report finance xfers of its members to concord pirate corps or null sec corps and there will be no penalties to isk xfers i think that this half solution should keep most people in the universe happy and achieve the goal of keeping the clean money earned by carebear or mining corps clean while enforcing a more clear ingame as opposed to metagame segregation between the good and bad professions in the game and the respective parts they play in the economy it also sets a good foundation to when ccp fleshes out the bad professions more with the black market changes and incarna
earn bountiesget rebateceo changes corp settingstransfer moneyceo changes corp settings backi think that this whole proposal would increase the learning curve at a time when ccp is trying to lessen it cq npe rework
less griefing compared to high sec explain how high sec is more griefing when theres stronger security around security that punishes not protect if u cannot adapt to that then thats your fault for taking high sec for granted as a wowstyle sanctuary to hide behind on an alt the only possible way this would be griefing to u is your alt flying an expensive carebearing ship thinking high sec is 100 safe but heres the thing since u choose to undock even in high sec u chose to go somewhere u can be shot at so thats not griefing eitherso yes u r talking out of your assit is for u when u still dont show your work because the burden of proof still falls on u if ure mentally incapable of doing even that then go back to whining some more
no thats not what im saying  im only commenting on my own personal choice and what would be a pita not about whether an entire profession is economically viable or notmy pvp alts are there for fun not for profit this is where i fundamentally disagree with the proposal  because it would make the pvp part of the game less fun simple as thatbtw while i am very much against your proposal id like to thank you for listening to feedback and providing reasonable counterpoints without misinterpreting anything that disagrees with you and throwing a tanty and getting insulting ie annas posts its really quite refreshingtry not to misinterpret what ive said i thought i quite clearly explained how shooting somebody in lower security space is less griefing but for your benefit ill indulgesure the place they can be shot at includes highsec but there are as i said usually very short sharp consequences for it concord there are less consequences game mechanic enforced anyway for shooting people in lower security space therefore shooting in lower security space is less griefing i would argue that in nullsec shooting somebody isnt griefing at all its just the pvp area of the game that you chose to be in and expect to be shot at even by blues and lose ships so to explicitly clarify sigh when i said place they can be shot at i was also implicitly inferring the previously stated with less consequences part tooplease note i never said anything about highsec being a wowlike sanctuary or 100 safe ie youre presenting a strawman here
meh anna is incapable of doing anything except misinterpret you get used to itbaddieshow your work lol ive no need to spell out the obvious honestly id thought i had dumbed it down enough for you do i need to explain how addition works or were you confused by the percentages why continue crying and demanding proof you apparently cant understand im fairly sure theres not even a point to your qq as amusing as it is and if youre too mentally stagnant andor inept at eve to wrap your mind around a chart of 10 alliancecorps its simply not my concern
the war dec system needs to change at the moment anyone can war a single corp without anything bad happening maybe some people dont want to constantly be attacked for no apparent reason
that would be the pointcome up with a better system or stfu
if you can pay concord to look the other while you war dec a corpalliance then why cant you pay concord to cease a war examplecorp a war decs corp b 2 mil per weekcorp b pays concord to remove the war dec 4 milcorp a really wants the war dec so war dec again 8 milcorp b is an industrial corp and pays concord again 16 milthis goes on until corp a or b no longer pays concord each time concord is involved the fee doublesquite quickly this can lead to a massive isk sinki know what people will say  hire some mercs  but why cant i hire concord 
eve online was about taking big risks to gain great rewards whats the point if youre always at risk of non consensual pvp in high sec what exactly is the gain on either party in high sec a one man corp war decing a bunch of hulks just to pad his stats on battleclinicthis was the intended result
wait wait wait let me see if i understand your postyou start by saying eve online was about taking big risks to gain great rewards then you immediately contradict yourself by asking for the removal of risk what
thank you suptraderany more supportcommon it helps everyone
new type of scan probe that can be launched as normal and moved to any position in space once there it can be deployed for corporation or player as a beacon visible to corporation and alliance or current fleet and the deploying individual respectively the beacon will last up to two hours and provide a warpin point similar to an scanned down to 100 anomoly use prior to deployment will be same as for a combat scan probe with limited scanning abilities of 025 au and low scanning strength
whywhat are you trying to solve
solve nothing directly the idea is to have the ability to warp to an unknown location in space and to have various other uses besides you can use it to create safespots fleet rally points drop points and whatever else you happen to like it for its a toolcurrently we can only warp to celestial objects or scanned down ships anomalies and the like safespots are only available by bookmarking during warp between two points or logging off in space and bookmarking on login thats actually quite limited and doesnt really provide a realistic means of navigation
what is realistic about warp navigation and more importantly how is your proposal more realistic
what would happen if i was a passenger on a hauler and the hauler was blown up do i wake up in a new clone when i log in do i appear in local where the hauler was destroyed 
you either wake up in a new clone if you were part of the destroyed cargo or into kidnapped gui if you survived depends if you are floating in space and not picked up by a pirate or not if you were picked ip you will be kidnapped as described before if you are floating in space then after a certain amount of time  the standard non anchored can persistence time  you will be rescued by interbus and show up at the closest station
if the passenger player could self destruct and abort the trip defaulting the contract payment to the hauler that would be good otherwise the hauler could delay things to the absolutely last minute in effect the hauler has the ability to keep the passenger player out of the game not entirely but anything involving a ship which is just about everything after accepting the contract in the case of pirates if the passenger player cant pay the ransom the pirates would be able to keep them out of the game indefinitely if the passenger player can self destruct to escape the contract and the ransom then the capturingransoming mechanic is pointless since no one will pay the ransom pirates could also ask for an unreasonably large ransom guaranteeing the player couldnt pay it griefing will be extended to include actually keeping people from playing and thats not good the core idea of player passenger travel is good but the interesting creative tidbits youve added on to it have some real issues also from a usage angle for what purpose would a player travel without a ship the only really good answers i can come up with are avoiding travel through dangerous areas like losecnosec which only protects your ship and avoiding having to make a bunch of jumps in hisec autopilot handles the latter and what good is it to be in losecnosec without a ship of any kind so why pay someone to move you
i can see this working but would need a tweak here and there thats already been listed but ill give you a thumbs up in support
werent you that guy who got those people to blow up my hulk
people who play the game the way i play it the correct way should have their votes count more than people who play the game the way you play it the wrong way sure there are fewer of me but thats just because not everyone can be as smart as me and you have to be pretty smart to play the game the way i play it the correct way otherwise i would be playing some other way
yeah the mittani directly ordered three pilots to infiltrate crystal industries and disrupt a mining operation hehget real
the mittani can sodomize kittens in his free time for all i care just so long as he gets results
currently on sisi the loyalt point modifier skills have been given the axe so skills like military connections will no longer be there when you log in for the next patch that goes live now i have run some missions and comparing to what i and others have earned lp wise for a missions it seems to be a bit less than what is currently live on tranq first off i want to call upon ccp to explain what exactly they are doing as far as loyalty points go because so far this is looking like it is a loyalty point nerf keep in mind this doesnt just affect all lvl 4 high sec mission carebears this affects all lvls of missions in all securities of space if this is indeed another nerf to missions i vote no pending any word from ccp i propose not to lose these lp modifier skills
i have no problem with the possible removal of loyalty point modifier skills as long as we get the sps back like we did with learning skills it has always seemed more than a little odd to me that any additions to lp earned come from a group of skills rather than from the level of your standing with the faction or corp you are running missions for
iirc your loyalty point reward does go up as your standings with the agent go uphmmm i have to say i am pro nerfing missions brings more balance to the null sechigh sec riskreward personally i would have preferred to see them do it through dropping mission rewards and bounties though as by dropping lp payouts your dropping the isk sink a little
sarina your right its been so long since ive done a mission i forgot that
its potentially a catastrophic nerf to lvl5s im updating sisi right now to take a look but if we are really talking about a 33 reduction in lp pay for lvl5s then high sec lvl4s might actually pay more per mission and per hour the reason is lvl5s frequently pay less actual isk than lvl4s but they pay far more in lp with such a drastic reduction in lp it looks pretty dodgy to me but as said i still need to look for myself
this is precisely the problem tbh although it does effect all missions lvl 5 missions will be hit the hardest for example tranquility live wrath of angels mission pays 80k lp per mission on sisi the payout is 65k lp per mission with the new changes that is just an insane drop in lp payment and huge mega nerf for lvl 5 missions
it would also be a nerf to low sec lvl 4 missionsedit but i am sure ccps causality models predict something else
this may be a precursor to the removal of agent quality as well this coupled with that leading to a little less lp seems aok with me
a little less lp seems aok how how is 3040 less lp considered a little also are you freaking high no wait you must be a proud owner of rat bots or mining bots so this will only increase your rmt business sales better yet this will increase ccps plex sales now i know why this is being done
i finally finished updating sisi results are as follows100 personal standing for the lvl5 republic fleet agent in auga 04 sec rogue spy 1 of 3 73k lp on tq 60k lp on sisi100 personal standing for the lvl5 imperial navy agent in sahtogas 03 sec rogue spy 1 of 3 78k lp on tq 65k lp on sisii rejected multiple missions to see if standings had any impact on payout my test showed no such thing it is possible that standings may only be counted up to a certain point however and since lvl5s require 86 standing on tq 70 on sisi to accept you cant drop it too much both results show a 1718 lp payout reduction not nearly as serious as the 33 reduction predicted from the loss of the 50 bonus from skills but its still pretty heavy handed i find this particularly true since i dont know of anyone who thinks lvl5s should be nerfed i did not check lvl4s and tbh i havent run one of those in years
meh missions could use a nerf
theyre making agent quality dynamic rather than staticthis means lessheavily used agents  better lp
enough said
will agent quality be removed or does it stay the same as it is nowanswer
i for one support this new change1 to the proposal this rocks 
it appears to be removed on sisi as does the effective quality description that said security status still clearly impacts the agents actual payouts
the 11 tax on npc corps was a poorly thought idea and cheap way for ccp to nerf mission runner income thats allit really was an irritating tax to force pilots to leave over chump change it didnt make me or many others leavebecause we have our own reasons for staying in a npcrookie corp ill give ccp props for the pathetic attemptat describing the tax as a some added immersion one would have if in a real player corp any rules forcing pilots out of a npc corp have to be very specific not time based and put in for a reason thistax wasnt it this is a sandbox after all and if pilots want to stay in a npcrookie corp they should be able toif ccp really wanted pilots to leave they would design tangible benefits for joining a player corp that would beabsent in the npcrookie corps even so that wouldnt guarantee pilots leaving doesnt matter though ccp got somepilots to leave so mission accomplished
isk sink solo guy corps can be wardeced
as my tusker pirate colleague pointed out lowsec itself is very different populated just like 00 the are several hotspot regions like black rise metropolis molden heath aridia placid and genesis sure there are systems in that regions which are quiet and empty but there are also several hotspots systems in each of the regions i named some are famous like oms tama and amamake some are notanyway the major problem with lowsec from my point of view is from a very different angle itUFFFDs the security penalty this is not a problem for a fulltime pirate as the pirate has alts to secure logistic and whatelse is needed the full time pirate is used to it and deal with it the security penalty is a big problem for part time pirates  highsec dwellers who just wants to roam check out shoot looking for pvp etc pp there is no way i can see to get a fulltime highsec carebear into lowsec but without any security penalty in lowsec the more risk adverse highsec player may have a closer look as it is now most highsec player fear the security penalty as they may canUFFFDt get back into safe haven after the lowsec roam that has to be changed just make lowsec so you wonUFFFDt get any security penalty for shooting anybody
so every time i log in for the day ill have to online a new ebu because some 14 year olds blew it up while i was at work no thanks
i am given to understand by older players that bookmarks in the past could cause severe system lag if someone started copying massive numbers of bookmarks all at once and thus bookmark copying was limited to 5 at a time however manually copying only five at a time is tedious if one wants to copy a large number of bookmarks especially multiple sets thereof to share with alts friends corpmates andor alliancematesi propose that players once again be allowed to masscopy bookmarks but in such a way that the operation can be spread out over time to prevent lagging out systems when a player attempts to copy a large number of bookmarks the game should put up a confirmation dialog saying copying this many bookmarks at once will require approximately insert time estimate here during which you will not be able to dock jump or change ships you might also experience significant lag this is best done docked in a station are you sure you wish to proceed the player can then dock up in a station proceed with a masscopy operation and then walk away from the computer to go get a sandwich or something while waiting on the copy operation
so if i sit in a system for 2 hours in a cloaked ship waiting for someone to pass by and no one does then i get logged offcause there was nothing for me to do idea not supported too vague what constitutes inactivity the very nature of having thecloaking module on in a cloaked ship implies activity if i make my cloaked ship orbit a random object in space and afk thenive beaten the timer cause my ship is doing something the problem isnt the timer but what constitutes inactivity ccpwould have to define what it means to do nothing which makes this idea unworkable
good ideasupported as well as need to define what would considered as inactivityedit forgot thumb up lol
only if the pilot in question is docked at a station any other scenario would be too detrimental to a great many local intelligence agencies
not supported good scouts often spend long periods of time cloaked and watching systems its nobodies business if a pilot is afk but their own
super capitals are large in size much larger than a standard capital ship as such they should require a more substantial lock onto a cyno field in order to jump to itmy proposal is to limit the strength of a cyno field similar to wormhole strength therefore a single cyno may be able to support 30 capitals in one go or 5 super capitals at oncenow if you want to cyno 120 super carriers and 30 titans onto a field of battle you will need at minimum 16 active cynos in order to get your fleet in once the cynos strength has been depleted the cyno field deactivates but the ship that activated the field is still stationairy for the 5  10 minutes it normally would takethis can be active for titan bridges toosub caps  100 per cynocapital  30 per cynosuper caps  5 per cyno
the main problem with this is a cyno is not a wh creator by eve lore for capitals a cyno is effectively a large energy source beacon which capital navigation computers can lock onto and use their jump drive therefore by lore this cannot be done however there has been talk of making different types of cynos similar to covert  regular to limit ships that travel through
add the following to the lore and it would work each jump to a cyno causes feedback the intensity of which is based on the mass of the jumping ship eventually the beacon has to shut down or risk the destruction of the next ship that jumps
so you find the only bad thing about this proposal to be that it does not fit with the lorewhy not make it so that jumps in proximity to a cyno disrupt it there are many other ways one could explain why it would be possible to only jump a limited number of ships to a cyno
wouldnt really change anything except making capital blobbing slightly more annoying by requiring a little more coordinationplate bs pops initial cyno first wave of capitals through all pop cynos  poof fully established blob on scenenow one could disallow cyno gens to be mounted on capitals to prevent that but then you are giving a massive boost to defensiveturtling tactics while making titans mandatory for any serious battle bridge in cyno shipsin short not a very good idea
there are still more than enough carriers arround to make cynos then first cyno gets in 30 carriers they all pop a cyno and you can get in 150 supers and carriers barely sacrifise anything by fitting a cyno not being able to move as carrier is also pretty irrelevant in supercap fight
this im with you on the intent behind it but such a restriction could be easily gamed
most battlefit carriers have cynos anyway this really wouldnt change too much other than allowing the carriers to get out of their cyno stasis sooner in short this would actually be a boost to large fleet warfare
nonsense battlefit carriers have four dcus and a salvager silly
lets have it optional firstperson like mode with wasd up left down right controls and velocity controlled by scrolling the mouse wheel or button 4 and 5 or something remappablei cant say the difficulty in implementing this but it seems most of the elements are already present
this is the 500th thread on this subject congratulations you win first person modeunfortunately first person mode is a black screen since you are seeing the inside of an unlit goo filled pod
nope most of the elements are certainly not present such as the predictive ai that each client would need to run to reposition where each ship might be this sort of thing would be needed because of network latency the time it takes for the command from your keyboard to reach the server and then be redistributed around to other clients who need that info ie those on grid with you and without it things ships mainly would jump all over the place as your machine catches up with the latest version of the network dataccp have dodged having to use a whole pile of network traffic by having basic commands that you send to the server approach this orbit that activate this module on that object etc which capture the movement that you want to do in a very efficient way this works well for a system that is hosted in one place and services the entire world simultaneously in fact it enables such a system to run at allyour alternative might be good for an fps hosted on a geographically close server and played by at most 2 digits of players where each player is constantly sending movement commands move forward slightly left forward forward right right forward forward forward etc and where ping is such an important factor in how you can perform eve is not that game
youve got the black screen part but because of the lag wasd would produce in fleets
so i would guess youre saying the bubble system doesnt cut it i get that wasd adds a lot more in the way of directional modifiers but a lot of players doubleclick to change direction continuously in pvp thats probably minus about a hundred commands a second or so i guess with the amount of control applied by incremental movementsanyway bad idea i guess just thought id throw it out there to see what response it got informative reply thank youi posted a pseudo first person mode in the summit thread on ships i think it was just inverted cams over the ship and using the standard doubleclick for directional modification would at least give the impression of first person mode without any real alterations to game mechanics aside from the way the cameras acted
i am unsure about this idea because i tried black prophecy and battlestar galactica games it is extremely unbalanced because navigation speeds are so far from realistic close combat combined with leak of target locking and tracking options is cause of intense screen glimmer and migrainein another hand having target locking and tracking options makes unnecessary such type of control pilot needs just lock and shoothowever pilot can navigate by clicking twice in the space and that is good enough
how about a ton of coding and rewriting of the game as we know itsounds pretty easy right
i can itd be a right pain in the ass to implement and would probably require ten times the server resources the eve server runs at 1 fps internally shifting control to client side would also introduce performance and security problems and if you didnt do it controls would be clunky as all hell to the point of being practically unplayablethis isnt even speaking of the fact that eve just isnt designed around that kind of gameplaysorry as much as i love being a fighter pilot this is a game about being a spaceship captain
i think you may be exaggerating the danger a bit
ok this might sound totally crazy but you might be able to fix macro mining the way you fixed rmt with plex just make marco mining part of the gamefirst introduce a macro mining module since most hulks are shield tanked have it take up a mid slot and use a sload of cpu basically while mining you target whatever can you are using then use the macro miner module on it the module automatically dumps whatever ore is in your hold into the can and if a roid gets mined out the macro miner module starts cycling on any other roids you have targetedsecond give all mining barges a huge amount of maximum targets this would make training the multitasking skill worthwhilethird if you are worried about runaway inflation on minerals due to everyone mining 237 just make the roids give out fewer units per cycle so if you assume people will mine 5 times as much on average make the mining output 15 as muchyou could even think of this from an rp standpoint imagine you are a capsuleer who just bought a new mining barge whats the first thing youd want to do id program the ship to mine on its own like a big drone or something while i go get a sandwich because no sentient creature would willingly inflict the boredom of asteroid mining on themselves
everyone claims the forge citizenship
supercarrier nerf  dread revamp
fixed it for ya fixing sc does not make dreads work out of siege mode
fixing supercarriers might mean that entering siege mode without supercap supremacy is no longer an act of suicide though

what is the problem youre trying to solve the current system is working just fine allows the markets to adjust rapidly to changes in supplydemand dynamic and allows the manipulation of the market making it a more interesting system for traders to play with yes this means tricking 01 isk micromanagers too so you can profit from people blindly outbidding youthe current system can also be used for easy passive income already so the current ability to micro manage orders doesnt prevent that it just means you have to think for a second at what price point are you going to put your order up and how large youre going to make ityou also cant be serious about the cost of altering an order it would freeze many orders on the market and stagnate the whole system or youd have to increase the number of orders used by manyfold to compensate the number of orders is already too small on one character for a serious trader and you want to make a system that is designed in a way that people have to split their orders to multiple small ones or stop playing the current market games entirelybasicly i see some serious downsides to this and cant see what significant benefit your proposal would provide for the system or the players that would warrant such a change
alright here are a few of these things in terms of problemsproblemtrading is rather robotic in the sense of maintaining market orders this makes it ripe for botting and such while that is not in and of itself a reason to change it it is symptomatic of poor gameplay i think many people would agree that maintaining market orders feels like a chore how this helpsit makes price something you have to actually think about this means trading becomes an activity about thought decision and consequence as opposed to who performs the same repetitive action over and over the mostproblemthe market buy and sale values for a given item tends to move like a train of lemmings and that does not represent a balanced market value therefore it leads to all the orders getting filled and none being left or backed up amounts of stock in certain items and yet the prices still dont move toward a value at which they will sell its a broadly shared feeling that changing your price doesnt generally do much to improve your sales it more or less just decreases margins for all the traders how this helpswith players thinking more about setting things at the correct price the market maintains a more balanced market value where orders live healthy lifecycles and buy and sell orders are less likely to get backed up or stripped furthermore larger orders are more likely to be used with larger margins meaning they will act as a buffer against wild market changes as opposed to acting as a wall right on the current market value that prevents smaller orders from going through
why not just boost the dreadnaught a bit to be a cap ship killer right now people only use it for pos bashing anyway

bryan havoc is our guilds master of wizardry and is also responsible for crafting and distributing dwarven armor sets as we get the necessary components from our epic raid dropsi have one of those on my battleship right now its pretty nice
hello i am a master of wizardry fear my various charms and spells
such as if you change corps  having the ownership of the pos follow you without having to unanchor and reanchor it such as being able to store items into some storage that others can not access i believe you can anchor a can with a password prior to the shields going up  but once the shields are up an individual has no storage within a possuch as having corp members who become more willing to anchor poses because they know that they dont need to have roles to access the pos  so even if things go sour they can get their stuff outheck individuals fly their own ships in this game  if it were a true mmo wed all be crew members on a single ship right if the game were initially designed as crew members on a ship and someone posted the idea that people should be allowed to fly their own ships would you be one of those saying but then it wont be an mmo  of course you would
gj thx
good idea would deffinaly solve some issues most t2 ships have 2 or more variants exept the black ops
iirc the qen works by taking a snapshot at a given moment of how many of a certain ship is being piloted bops are an extremely niche ship and will only be flown when being used as apposed to titans that have to have a pilot in them at all timesmy point a the qens snapshot can be borderline useless as it doesnt take into account length of time the ship is flown or the number of a particular ship owned i am pretty sure if you counted up the number of bops owned it would exceed titans by a extreme marginb quoting qen as a reason to buff bops is a flawed argumenthowever i am in favour of buffing bops but not their base stats i would only buff their jump range and either decrease the amount of fuel it takes to bridge people or the increase the amount of fuel they can hold in their fuel baythe fact they cant bridge a proper recon fleet to their max jump range due to fuel limitations i think is what cripples them the most they are and should be imo a mini titan overpriced and only really useful for bridging gangs ontop of people and should relatively weak for any type of solo worktldr only buff jump range and either increase their fuel bay or decrease the amount of fuel they require to jump
dont nerfbuffnext thing you know well all be flying glass hulls with pee shooters cripes
battlecruisers arent used anything like overwhelmingly and havent been for around 69 months now since people switched to abaddons and maelstroms and began comfortably demolishing drake fleets over and over again nerfing them at this stage would be pointless and stupid
evekill is down atm but last time i looked drakes and hurricanes were more common than maels and abaddons and when you look at the overall top 20 ships that are primarily used in smallscale fights are noticeably more common than those used in fleet warfare even with a massive allwar on largescale fleet pvp probably accounts for a minority of all kills in the game and tier 2 battlecruisers really are ubiquitous in smaller fights
nice slogan shame it lacks any actual argumentyou do realise there is a time and a place for both
this argument deals only with the balance of tier 2 bcs vs bs in the fleet environment it does not address tier 2 bc balance in other pvp enviroments as pointed out theyre ubiquitous in smallgang stuff and it does not deal with the balance of tier 2 bcs vs cruisers and closerange hacs sac and deimos although you can add automuninn at a pinchas also noted by others the tier 1 bcs only look terrible when compared to the tier 2s  theyre still quite capable of kicking in the faces of a cruiser or two but their fewer slots and generally trickier fittings means that its a lot harder to make a tier 1 bc better than a cruiser at being a cruiserleaving aside the nerf issue for a second its indisputable that the balance between tier 1 and 2 bcs is awful with the result that theres little reason to fly the tier 1s so its selfevident that either tier 1s need boosting or that tier 2s need nerfing the normal response has been to propose boosting the tier 1s  but i believe that there are fundamental problems with the balance of tier 2s relative to cruisers closerange hacs and even field cs and that these problems strongly argue that the tier 1s are a better model for bcs than the tier 2si dont expect proposing a nerf to probably the most used group of ships in the game to be a popular suggestion and frankly i dont expect ccp to enforce it cos itll just  off too many people hell the first time i saw the argument for nerfing the tier 2s i reacted angrily too but over the next day or two my reaction was something like this but angrier at the start and in extreme slow motion
im gonna admit i hadnt actually considered a nerf to tier 2s as the solution but looking at it now it does make sense the cyclone is a very usable bc as is the brutix and the ferox but the prophecy i believe needs a fundamental rethink ccp dont appear to understand the concept that being a nodps brick is an extremely nichUFFFD role if it can be called a role at allit probably wouldnt be too hard to tone the tier 2s down a bit while keeping their roles distinct caldari  guns vs missiles simple enough reallygallente  gank vs tank myrm would still have enough dps to be worth flying but more staying power than a brutix amarr  just go back to the drawing board with the prophecy to be honest im in favour of the ham suggestion personally does the harbinger really need much of a nerfminmatar  im not sure what to suggest here but frankly the hurricane is the postership for the cruiserbc imbalance it has the speed and agility of a cruiser and the firepower and tank of a bc not sure what to suggest nerfwise here to be honest
one should always keep in mind that in computer games combat strength is relative so the point of boosting all the other things  instead of nerfing just one  on grounds of progress being made and other rp crap is nothing else but a pathetic demagogy game development is not a rl history and its always easier and better to bring down one overpowered ship instead of making all the others equally overpowered which at the end of the day inevitably results in everything becomming equally mediocre its nice to deal 1000 dps when your rivals deal just 500 but whats the point in having 2000 when everyone else has 2000 as well and tanks proportionally better its just a useless inflation of game valueslets think for a second that ccp indeed becomes insane i mean even more insane than theyre now  and boosts tier1 bc up to tier2 level but they can not make them 100 equal with tier2 so these new shiny tier1 bc will occupy another role  a role which atm belongs to some completely unrelated hulls nowadays closerange hacs are kinda obsolete but with those buffed battlecruisers so will become longranged hacs too or something elsethen ccp will finally admit the balance is completely broken and obsolete classes need buffing so they buff those and your beloved battlecruisers end up getting the very same relative position where they could have belonged to long before thatis it really what you want 5 minutes of fame for few ships at the cost of justice dev time etc
 i believe the term is power creep and yeah it does need to be avoided especially with a ship size as delicate balancewise as bcs the thing that made me realise there might be an issue was when i was shopping around for some new throwaway pvp ships and honestly couldnt justify a cruiser to myself cost of fitting the things is almost as much as a bc but their performance is so much lower not sure if i mentioned this in another post sorry if i did  but me and a friend added up costs in the region we were ina shield buffered cyclone was approx 4mil more than a fully fitted rupture factoring insurance
which is why most are talking about a buffnerf to let the bcs meet halfway  individual bonuses is more than enough to differentiate them easy when there are only twobenefit of such a balanced approach is that the powercreep in minimized and it should give a little more breathing room for lesser ships  especially if combined with a bc price increase to better represent their power
fixed 4u lets see1 abaddon 1538252 drake 1169863 hurricane 100188then19 lachesis 1578720 megathron 15576indeed for those claiming gallente are fine they are overpowered for expensive wrecks
how is the abaddon not attracting nerf threads anyway i have no particular view on the subject but statwise it seems to be in a league of its own compared to other battleships
because it is pretty well balanced when you think about it just scales horribly well as does all things and works exceedingly well with proper support read guardians  it is the same for most amarr hulls actually mediocre solosmallgang but pure awesome in numbers
caldari missile ships need to have then kinetic missile bonus replaced
fix for what remember that suicide ganking is intended gameplay ccp have explicitly confirmed this on several occasions
i like the idea of using hacking modules anything that implies a breaking of secured computers should be more then just a pve container keyso heres my idea building on the ideas of others earlieradd an sbu like object to the game that disrupts services in the target system but it has no hp it needs to be hacked to disable it and its vulnerable to being hacked for a period of time between being anchored and going online the period of time is determined by how much of a disruption the attackers want it to have meaning its configurable and as soon as its anchored it has the intended effect so even if it gets hacked 10 minutes later it still disrupted thingsif you want the im going to call it an siu for service interruption unit to disable all ratsanomssigs for 1 hour its vulnerable for say 15 minutes because who really cares if ratting isnt available for an hour but if you want it to disable ratting for a week well now its vulnerable for a couple hoursother things it could do are off the top of my head  prevent docking at the station high cost to siu vulnerability duration  jam all mining lasers in the system  jam all moon miners in the system  turn off local  disable jump bridges in system  turn on a market tax in the outpost in system if there is one that filters money into the invaders corp wallet  use your imaginationthered probably need to be some amount of limiting so that every single effect couldnt be turned on all at once andor for the maximum duration also please keep whoever designed the ui for poss far away from this it would need to be used quickly and possibly in a combat environmentfinally the siu should be 6000m3 so it can be hauled in a blockade runner but no more then 1 at a time per cloaky hauler
wouldnt that be considered the cost of bloat empires consider how long it takes insert federal acronym here to respond to insert tragedy here off the main roads out in the sticks  hell it is often a problem if a tragedy happens next door to response unit hq due to all the youtube s with videophones needing to be smacked around first there is absolutely nothing in the way of guerilla options at present and since any such option will have a massive impact on the set in their ways read cannotwill not adapt null who make up the majority ccp will have to endure a lot of crap to make it happen  in short your blob  all lifestyle is safe for a long time dont worry
so you want to be able to do damage deserving of a serious response without actually risking any of your own assets sounds fair to meits irrelevant what size of entity youre attacking in fact a larger alliance will probably have a higher chance of responding with a 10 minute warning than a smaller one the overall chance of winning is still basically zeroim all for having something like an anchorable which shuts down services in a constellation or even region if you want although not docking thats not going to encourage fights at all as long as you can defend it id also be quite happy for a 10 minute hack to disable services so long as they could be restored with a similar amount of effortdamage should be proportional to the effort the attacker puts in regardless of how much more the attacker feels their sense of selfsuperiority entitles them too
im not convinced hacking the main two ihub upgrades is really the path to take the presence of your gang in system is already affecting the farming of the mining sites and rat sites what does that leaveas i suggested earlier in the thread have new structures to attack and link the sov pos fuel discount to them old bonus new mechanic new vulnerabilitythere could even a small strategic aspect to this if pos stront usage is able to be messed with along with the other fuelsif they were ever made to work properly and be desirable or have they already the wormhole and ded site upgrades could be made vulnerable to some kind of interference the way they work means the simple presence of a roaming gang doesnt make them useless  chance based of spawn over time vs constant anom respawn
i agree but if you need an hour to hack a the ihub you will get dropped by a blobi would say that the hacking is halted the moment 1 uncloaked ship no noobshipshuttle is on grid something like within 300k of the structurethat means that you can send in some huge buffered ship to get more time for the rest of the fleet
tie actual production in the system to the industrial indexif i produce rifters in any facility the index goes up a teensy bit if i build a supercapital the index goes up a huge amountlink the ability to anchor certain structures directly to the index scrap sovereignty levels the tcu goes online and sticks your name in the top right corner when the military index exceeds 1
to give you some credit this is the most transparant alliances should feed me easy killmails whenever im in their space ive ever seen
depends which metric you use geographical size  on show info or actual active players not charactersthe ebb and flow of eve sees numbers change dramatically while size can remain relatively static due to the ehp based blob friendly sovereignty system that favours defenders through jamming bridges reships et alefforts involved should be proportional that much we agree on question is how to get the idea of disruption by guerilla warfare through the threadnaughts that are bound to crop up if it is even considered by ccp  they have a nasty tendency to cave in when the emos start rampagingone could make all ihub upgrades vulnerable with a built in 4hr autorepair cycle add manual repair to cut it way downcould make it a costly affair to just posdock up when a roam comes around without impacting tz xenophobes too harshlyat this point ill settle for anything that doesnt involve lol hotdrop as the solution to everything from defence to killing ratters
not really at the 10 minute mark none of it matters unless the system owners are prewarned youll be in and out before any meaningful response happenssee this i could actually get behind even without the autorepair but not without the manual option id even go as far as to say ihub upgrades arent really enough damagethe trouble is it still doesnt incentivise people to actually come fight people are pushing for longer lasting unrepairable damage as the solution to that but effects that persist hours after the gang has left remove far too much risk from the equation for the attacker instead id argue for more severe and widespread disruption for gangs that are willing to commit if the sanshas can apply constellation wide reductions to player resists damage and income why not have a range of siegelike modules that do similar things you could even stick the mods in the incursion lp store for added roleplaying give it a 12 minute cycle  make it aggress and immobilize the ship even throw up a beacon if needed then youll get your fights
even if the upgrade hit was a strategic one imagine if csaas were offlined for the duration ie a 3rd state or bridges only allowed travel in or out of affected system or jammers allowed titan bridging but not capital jumps ie with cynocapital revamp or  you get the idea i hope damage from ihub disruption in random system x is negligible but in important systems it couldshould be devastating  just as an attack on a metropolitan area has greater impact than a fire on some farm in the country
i was more implying that knocking out ihub upgrades as they stand right now isnt really very much inconvenience again assuming they can be reppedif youre discussing offlining csaas then youve strayed back into the realms of attacks that should merit a full alliance response without allowing one to take place and knocking out jump bridges can be done as is anyway plus if youre looking for a good fight you shouldnt be preventing people from bringing onethe problem with something like destroying an ihub upgrade having lasting effects is that the definition of a reasonable response time changes depending on both the attacker and the defender you cant balance a highskillpoint high isk value fleet incapping an ihub upgrade without making it impossible for everyone else and likewise you cant balance it for a more reasonable gang without making it impossible to defend against the elitepvp gang
disclaimer i dont live in nullsec i have no idea what im talking about disregard etc so likewhat if tritanium was exclusively found in nullsec
ok we can work out timer length later on but from what i have been reading people want something that encourages the attacker to field a moderate sized gang something large enough to defeat one alliances home defense fleet but the event doesnt inherently encourage blobbing other than whats needed to defeat the home defense fleet so for example hacking a structure always goes at the same rate no matter how big your blob is while shooting at something with a lot of hp like a pos depends entirely on how much dps your blob can put outpart of encouraging the attacker to only field a medium sized gang is to make the reward for completing the event to only be worth it for a moderate sized gang so the penalty to the defenders needs to only last a little while something that is worth it for a small gang to try but not worth calling a cta forthen for the defenders the response time needs to be long enough that one alliance can mount a home defense fleet but not long enough for them to get a huge blob from whatever power block they are part ofalso the penalty for the defenders needs to be short enough to only penalize the people who were around when it happened and not people who logged on later on since there are no reinforcement timers tied to the event this also fixes the time zone problem if one dude in a rifter hacks the ihub at 3 am when nobody is on the penalty should only last long enough to effect the handfull of people on at the time who couldnt be bothered to blow up one rifter
okay ive been sitting here mulling over my random brainfart aboveit is my extremely limited understanding as a highsec carebear that the basic sense of balance is thisin highsec youre safe and protected and the primary industries are in mass produced base stuffin nullsec youre unprotected and the primary industries are esoteric rare stuffwhat if it were the other way aroundwhen i think of farms and fields i think of the typical way that such things worked in history you have the cities where everybody meets and trades and a lot of the more advanced industries operate then on the outskirts you have the farms and the mines and what have you the dirty industries the places where they gather basic resources and produce the stuff you need to survive the farms fuel the citiesin eve its pretty much the reverse of this there are esoteric things you can only get through dangerous places but whats the main ingredient that goes into everything tritanium right its everywhere its also used massively in absolutely everything but lets suppose just for a second that we threw the entire economy on its asswhat if mineral availability was effectively reversed this is as much a thought experiment as a serious proposal in highsec you have your small mineral fields of megacyte and morphite and what have you on the edges of highsec you start running into noxcium around lowsec youre hitting stuff like mexallon and isogen then as you keep going further you start hitting sparse pyerite deposits then you get to nullsec and what do you find theretritanium lots and lots of tritanium and loads of the other minerals too but mainly loads and loads of tritanium extend this inverse rarity principle to other resources and try to picture what would happentheoretically what would happen is that youd start seeing mass low end production not in the safety of highsec but in nullsec living in high security space would be safe and expensive living in nullsec would be cheap and easy besides the lawlessnessof course theres tons of  that gets screwed up with all this like npc rats and what have you but ultimately as a fulltime highsec carebear i can tell you that the biggest draw of highsec is simply that its safe its safe its easy its relaxing and its fairly profitable this probably shouldnt be living in highsec should be expensive ships should cost more modules should cost more everything should cost more because thats the price of safetyall this is really just a thought experiment i wouldnt put it forward as a serious proposal simply because i know nothing about the practicalities of nullsec also i havent read the thread at all so for all i know this is already all being discussed or maybe its just stupid i dont knowanyway yeah looking forward to the summit notes
yes but you can balance this for precisely one combination of attacker and defender on precisely one occasion ask most of the people in this thread and their fleet size will be roughly what they regularly field and the response time will be just under what it takes their targets to form a fleet that can beat them wider ranging and more severe active disruption is far better than local persistant damage unless all you want to do is hurt an entity and leave before it can respond
between freighters and jump bridges it just isnt cost effective to mine low end minerals locally for most 00 entitiesbeing surrounded by friendlies only further adds to the effect if a more rigid sovereignty system was adopted forcing sovereignty to be linked directly to adjacent space hostile wars would be easier to manage and 00 alliances would be less inclined to be friends just because they are neighborsi will now direct you to sovereignty 20 in my own words linkagedoes that need to be modified and updated certainly eve was very different back in 2005 but the solution is the big picture not just the individual brush strokes
before freighters and jump bridges almost all ships were built in empire and we flew them out to 00 one by one it has never been cost effective to mine low ends in 00 because you can mine high ends instead and convert them into isk which you can then use to buy ships most of the low ends that arent flown in come from reprocessed rat loot being surrounded by friendlies has nothing to do with itit isnt too easy to source stuff from empire its way too hard to produce it locally
excellent proposal
this is actually quite true the noob ships as they are leave a lot to be desired and generally dont go much beyond the first days experience while being something we are forced to have well after that every time we pod into a station where we have no ships in the hangar or one way or another achieve the same end result through being podded or otherwiseamongst the new player experiences should be an attractive sleak vessel which will prove of use and appeal throughout the game even years lateri would suggestsleak and designed similar to a space superiority fighter with transport capability barely larger than a shuttle and much more capable possibly even a bit like a dropship and appearing capable of atmospheric flight add some cool vectored thrust and afterburners such as would be seen on a vtol craft that are unused in space for effect take that last or leave it as its not really neccessary andor may give the wrong impression still might be coolspechigh 2 mid 2 low 2 powergrid 12 mw cpu 70 tf callibration 100 upgrade hardpoints 1 launcher hardpoints 1 turret hardpoints 2max velocity 400 ms inertia modifier 394 mass 1820000 kg volume 14500 m3 cargo capacity 164 m3 structure 253armor 116 em 50 thermal 35 kinetic 35 explosive 10shield 182 em 0 thermal 20 kinetic 40 explosive 50capacitor capacity 310 gj recharge time 215400 smax targeting range 176 km max locked targets 4 sensor strength 4 points signature radius 27 m scan resolution 367 mmrequired skills spaceship command iremove the autoreplacement feature and replace it with ship claimable through esc menu
the issueover the years the corp role system has become increasingly antiquatedat its inception it was designed around fairly resourcepoor corporations with 1050 members and 13 offices even at that time the roles were a bit too sweeping but weve always made it workin modern day eve when corporations and alliances can have a dozen offices and hundreds of billions in assets it is far far too wide a scopecurrently there are certain roles which are carte blanchecontracts allowing someone to make one contract on behalf of the corporation means they can delete any outstanding corporate contractsdelivery hangars unlike corp hangars there is no perstation control access to one means access to allscienceindustry jobs like delivery hangar there is no location restriction if someone wants to build some ammo for the corp you have to trust them not to cancel the titan build 57 jumps away that they didnt even know aboutwallet journal currently to allow someone access to view the wallet journal you also have to allow access to delivery hangars equally granting any type of view role means showing the current contents of all wallet divisionscorp hangars the current system is based on 3 choices headquarters based at and everything else in the entire universe  need to give someone pos hangar access you also have to give them access to every hangar everywhere that isnt the hq or their based at locationpos access in general giving any type of access to one pos means the same type of access to every posthe fixesgranularitycontracts  can create and can modify roles modify can even be broken down to created from wallet div x  but even without that change just a can modify flag would eliminate 90 of the problemdelivery hangars  at the least enable the same flags as currently in place for offices ideally the flags as suggested below for office role reformscience and industry  the same as contracts can install can cancel cancel can be broken down to installed from location x for further granularitywallet journal the same as hangar roles view and take roles per divisioncorp hangars there is no issue with assigning a contract or market order to a specific station why not expand hangar roles in the same way allow roles to be set on a perstation basis ideally the above science and industry roles would fall into this as wellpos access if not possible to assign roles through the corp interface for a specific pos then at least make it possible from the pos equipment itself an allowed list rather than an access roleoverall these seem to be fairly lowhanging fruit from an outsiders perspective yet any one of them alone would represent a massive change in the ability for larger scaled operations to function in a more decentralized wayroles as they stand now remove the ability for any significant asset usage delegation as the trust must be nearlyall or none it provides no opportunity for newer players to work their way upward in their corporate responsibilities in regards to corporate assets with these changes the importance of trust in eve is no less important  but the ability to place a more finely tuned value on that trust becomes far more possible
1being able to have stationbased roles for things like security officer and whatnot would be really cool but slightly unncessary but i agree that for things like hangar access itd be nice to not have to rely on basing someone somewhere and limiting t
agreed some roles would usually be set universally instead of perstation but that would be the beauty of a all or specific station flag  the ability to choose 
currently the only way you can link your fleet in chat that i am aware of is to drag it from the available fleets window
as with most of the above implementing a custom ui building tool even for only a small part of the ui would be a massive improvement one major thing missing at the moment however is an ability to export your current ui even with its limited customization for use on alts  second accounts i have tried and failed to get my three accounts uis to look even remotely the same and to say it is tedious and frustrating is an understatement something similar to the overview export function would be brilliant
not sure if its ui or sound team but we used to have doppler effects when warping inout of places that was cool but now its gone since the trinity engine along with the      warp scrambler sound
bump
i strongly support this no changes to missile mechanics only to their appearance the same should be said for all weapon systems many of us have seen ccps improved turrets video this is taking it in the right directioni would like to see all weapon systems look cooler when firing especially when grouped there should be some delay between turret shots even though the mechanics would still work as if it were grouped and please throw some variations in the sound effects even slight changes in pitch per shot would add some depth rather than the pounding monotonous phoom or kakaka

self explanatory its dumb they cant
indeed
over powered battleship much
make them have a doomsday aswell and ill support this
it wouldnt be overpowered
its more like an underpowered bc in term of tank or gank supported
as opposed to virtually useless battleship
hey they finally did it for stealth bombers any ship with a class that implies stealthy or has a cloack bonus to it should logically be geared to fit a cov ops cloak if it then needs a tweek to not be opd then so be it but this should happen signed
black ops is more like quasiops without proper cloaking it is relatively pointless and the ships are generally underpowered with limited combat capability the primary make that only if you like benefit is the lack of targeting delay when decloaking surprise is good but it only goes so far and doesnt do anything to make this ship worth the cost current best reason to buy its cool
black ops have lots of problems a covert ops cloak is not one of them
since canflippers act in gangs mostly there should be equal rights for all there are few approaches to this1 every pilot with an agressive mod on their ship from the flipping players corp will get aggro towards your corp and your gang this could also be reduced to a range of 32au oh exploitable to 3 jumps out2 you can fight back with less risk his corp mates cannot interfere nor do you get a timer for their whole corp3 expand the aggro timer for the canflipper that guy stole your stuff maybe even get killrights4 protection rights for dedicated mercenary corps this would give a corp or member the option to take care of the ones they love without the need of a wardeceither way players should feel more responsibility when making a quick steal or try to be a pain in the ass im just sayinalso would this add more need for a slightly better balance of players within corps people would work more together and for those who want to see the world burn they get all the heat they needother changes to the game mechanics should be done aswell if someone in a fleet agresses a player all gang members should get a limited aggro timer just for the heck of less concordokken exploitationedit did i mention my idea of having an extra window to see who you can kill oh well there we go and while were at it another extra window to see where the players are you have killrights on that would be nice
htfuno
i envision this setting be permanant part of the corp like its name or at the very least something where changes will take a day to take effect like quitting a corp or have a number of times per year it can be changed like attributes
thanks to you and others as well although we disagree on the underlying philosophy of the use of goodbad professions as a metagame being valid or not its nice to have a clear and reasoned discussion as opposed to some other certain csm comments which were harsh and denegrating without justification
1 economic viability and pain in the ass r pretty much one and the same here and if its a pain in the ass and not viable on its own then it should die out look at low sec farmed to extinction pain in the ass to do anything nonpvpwise so not economically viable and yet the remaining 10s cant sustain themselves either without high sec alts2 wheres this fun since ud rather waste all that time camping a gate all day or avoiding targets u might risk losing to instead of spending the time ratting the sec back up and generating a little income to help sustain what u do u pretty much brought that on yourself and as a result of that not only is low sec deserted but the 10s have to desert as well sooner or later because they dont want to make the effort to generate more income via ratting something theyll have to end up doing anyway pretty selfdefeating3 if its so insulting to u then try to think outside your perspective for once and maybe u wont be insulted my proposal just encourages u to rat back up above 5 to give the prey more breathing room to actually do something in low sec no more no less if ure too lazy to do even that go to 00 or learn to sustain yourself without hiding behind an alt in high secthis is the basis for what u feel to be insults because once again its only from your flawed myopic and selfish point of view not anyone elses try to look at this from someone elses eyes or the big picture for once if low sec is less griefing than high sec then why is it so deserted even by 10s who have to go back to their high sec alts sooner or later because the lack of concord and ppls reaction to that only reinforces that low sec would grief more and gasp thats why the 10s hide behind their high sec alts in the first place derp so how is high sec any more griefing when u choose to hide behind high sec alts under concord just to sustain yourself it all depends on whether ure killmailwhoring or hiding behind your high sec alt at the time do u get it now because a strawman is nothing compared to your own flawed myopic and selfish point of view oh and if u feel u got insulted again wise up or deal with it
translation these r my numbers and u cant question me cause i said so its u who doesnt understand that anyone can pull numbers out of their ass not just u so thx for that sorry excuse that u call trying but hey while ure at it why dont u go back to whining some more about how the proposal griefs the hell out of u cause u cant handle consequences after all that is what this thread is about or did u go off on your own tangent cause u made yourself look even worse whining about it so plz continue
i think what he was referring to was that empire still has the big risks arbitrary wardecs by anybody but doesnt have the great rewards mining veldspar isnt exactly great iskhrlol players with 50m skillpoint toons wardeccing a startup empire mining corp with 10m skillpoints between them to feel big and for lols is hardly a player social conflict aside from the likes of privatears and 0phanage who predominantly wardec nullsec alliances there are so many wardecs by long term players on new players for no better reason than wanting some easy cannon fodder to shootim all for players being able to resolve conflicts without contrived game mechanics getting in the way but as mentioned before wardecs are contrived game mechanics themselvesif you want pvp go to lownullsec or join fw or rvb if you have some beef with some empire based corp then perhaps a wardec is an appropriate outlet but currently no reason is required to declare war all you need is to get your corp shareholders to agree to ithaving said that i dont think isk amounts will change anything so not supporting this topic requiring the addition of terms of surrender might isk items leaving a system etc
can i just throw int he idea that players can not leave a corp for the first week of a war so that the people we actually want to kill dont just leave before the 24 hour notification time is up so if a war ends after a week then so be it they are still there but i think more corp ceos get ed of the fact that as soon as that dec mail comes throuhg 75 of there corp leaves just couse there could be a bit of pew pewif you join a corp be expected to help out when times are rough
agreewhat about the merc grieffers corp using isk given by the contractual corp 20m first week then increase by 100 2nd week 200 3rd week and next ones 500 small grieffers couldnt stand the rithm while real big alliances wars yesby the way whats the point of wardecc a 2 men corp for ever unless grieffers are just stupid and unfortunately there are too many in this game destroying ships is the purpose of the game every one and his mother are aware of that but sustain vicious acts with simple game mechanics is bad for every one has neutral repp
can you please explain to me the definition of a greifer within the context of this game
quoted for truth all types of player interaction is ccps goal thus war decs wont change albeit a surrender terms option like what jerika posted would be a good idea btw its also cheap because its too damn easy to just leave a corp and decced corps disband laughing wo any ill affects on them saying u just wasted whatever wannabe price hike wardec the low cost allows for less war evassion to a new corp to be fair any corp in a war should be locked nobody in or out the 24hrs after notification is for your preperation only you want out time to negotiate a surrender again loke jerika posted page 1 i would add though to apease you balance claimers the initiator pays a war dec cost per how much isk damage they would be satisfied to inflict ie a 2 mil wardec allows you to inflict 500 mil isk damage per avg market value a 10 mil wardec allows 25 bil etc etc not saying thats a solution just a thought yet better contrived than the drivel balance that the 40yr old virgin carebears singing i want an oscar meyer weiner have come up with thus far in a sad attempt to escape pvp altogether true story corp a has an internal dispute some members split to form corp b corp b viciously decs corp a but corp a knows a good merc corp merc corp decs corp b and deals them heavy casualties corp b retracts war on corp a corp b having ruined their ties with corp a and continue to get hit by merc corp disband corp a very happy with mercs and establish commerce with them mercs happy to get good deals get paid and had some funin carebear dreamland this kind of exciting social interaction wouldnt happen
warp navigation doesnt have to be realistic as this happens to be a sciencefiction oriented game in spacerealistic idea what isnt realistic about using scanning technology to direct a probe to a point in space and deploy it as a warpable beacon you warp to beacons in missions in anomalies well this isnt really that different and may be considered a covert beacon in that it broadcasts a signature only usable by a limited number of people it isnt really that hard to grasp
i think this is a good ideaeven if you were to make it so that interbus actually did something such as offer haulers missions hauling passengers that would be an improvement currently you can buy passengers such as tourists strippers freed slaves etc and sell them in another station at a greater cost this is hardly a passenger service more like a slave market another option might be to make it so that a hauler can take on passengers in addition to their freight so they dont have to ever fly with an empty or partly filled cargo hold in this case npc interbus passengers would pay you just like a hauling mission you might not get paid until you drop them off at their final destination or half up front etc transporting players as passengers hmm i suppose this could be done as transporting clones there is an option in the game for transporting clones which happens at the press of a button i just assumed that this meant there was a clone bank of blank clones and moving your clone meant switching the location where your mind was uploaded into the blank this would mean that its possible to upload your mind into the blank of any clone just as you can check your email from any computer with an online connection it might be possible to move a players jump clone with a courier contract
yep exactly why not im sure there are cases where you dont want to lose your implants and hardwireswell you may need to move an expensive med clone across to null sec or you really cant be bothered to autopilot yourself across the universe before a rl vacation and you would like to pay someone to just move you so that the next time you log in you will be there also if there are options of this kind of transport then more players can be pure traders or pi or business professions without having to learn to pilot a ship that can survive the journey to get them to low or null sec it opens up access to different professions in the economy while at the same time gives haulers a new income stream or a income stream
yep thats exactly what i was thinking in terms of the npc passenger market side of it and if the ferry records of all haulers were public there will be competition among haulers to have the best passenger transport record in order to get more lucrative vip passenger contracts it basically makes hauling a complete profession right up there with mining ratting and pvp pirating
i was thinking professions like traders who only need to be in station or move around to maintain orders or logistics managers  making out courier contracts for a 00 corp and paying out to the delivers in fact any business only professions corp management or planet interaction
lol true thanks for the feedback
so can the passenger self destruct his pod to escape the capture by the pirates or not if not heres the scenario1 you get captured2 you cant clone jump away3 you cant self destruct 4 pirate sets ransom to 100 billion5 you dont have 100 billion6 stuck forever
excellent proposalneeds adjustments has we can see in the counter arguments but the initial idea is just awesome adds new stuffopportunities and most important different game play opportunity  better game
as much as i despise the big power blocs dominating the csm particularly goons im not surprised it happened welcome to politics you win because you are more popular you have more votes how good of a delegate you will be how seriously you take the csm and how good your ideas are dont matter its the same in the real worlddemocracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried there really is no fair way to improve csm delegate selection so we get what we get i voted for candidates that had no chance of winning i wouldnt change my vote if i could these candidates that have no chance of winning though they could try to rally the same type of large bloc support as the goons do you will need that to win
while i agree with you on popularity being the primary contributing factor to election results in a democratic form of government i have to say everything indicates the mittani and current csm is doing what it should even if the did scam their way innot saying its right for them to do that but this once it is funny
makes me less likely to mission run in the future i just bought and trained them all to level 4 about a month ago to give some purpose to mission running just another nerf
having fully read the thread it seems missions may improve despite the loss of the skills and lp bonuses yet i will reserve judgement untill i see it in effect so long as we get the sp back i dont really mind as ill just drop it somewhere else long run makes everything equal and less skill training or skill crosstraining required for all thats a plus
tbh i dont understand how this change would actually lower mission runners income surly a drop in lp per mission by 33 would just lead to an increase of lp value by 50 as there is 33 less lp to go around p alas though your mission running income is still the samethe only real affect i can see coming from this is an increase in price on lp faction gear  oooo market speculation buy now while its cheap 
you are correct that it will increase lp value theoretically but there are a few scaling problems first of all lvl4s will not have any noticable change in payout lvl5s will however the reason is because lvl4s pay almost exclusively in isk with a tiny amount of lp given out lvl5s are the opposite it would be like a 18 bountylootreward nerf for all the lvl4 runners while leaving lp aloneedit forgot to mention it also removes 4 items from the lp store yes those military connection skillbooks and such come from the lp stores so even with the reduced lp it may not actually increase lp value implants come primarily from lvl4 story lines and with those skillbooks soon to be gone that leaves us with spec books ammo and maybe 12 worthwhile modules for each faction ships are produced mostly from fw lp as they get a huge discount and thus can undercut everyone else without flinching i know from personal experience i was fw for 15 years 
just a quick note to the mathematically challengedif lp numbers per mission are nerfed the average value of lp will rise depending on the elasticity of demand this counter effect will wholly or partially mitigate the income reductioneg ccp change agent quality and social skills resulting in an overall 17 reduction in lp consequently the effective value of those lp rise by for example 11 the reduction in the mrs lp income will actually be 1083111 7787 not 17obviousl those are made up example numbers but i suspect that they wouldnt be all that far out i am sceptical that a 78 reduction in the lp component of the mission runners rewards would be enough to completely obviate losec00 mission running given the very high rewards currently obtainable its certainly a much lesser nerf than the one recently endured by anomaly ratters
this will certainly be interesting itll kill the compensation of lp you get from missioning in a higher sec compared to a lower sechopefully this and the agent division changes will spread people out more
that is the other side of it with agent quality and divisions largely removed all agents are now equal assuming same system sec it is of no impact to lvl5 runners as all lvl5s are currently q12 but it does make all those lvl4 q20 agents scattered around suddenly perfectly good options so in all honesty this could be a buff to lvl4 runners as it will open up agents in better locations that were unused due to their low quality but no matter how you slice it its still an unnecessary nerf to lvl5s this is assuming the lp skills are truly removed from the looks of it they may actually still function i think its too early to judge exactly what ccp is up to it may be that they are compacting agents into just 2 classes combat and noncombat and the lp skills simply havent been updated yet
if the main target is that only a few ones can fly super capsif the main target is that regular players spending just a few hours ig cant make 100m in a single evening 3 to 4 hoursif the main target is that every one fly frigates and cruisers because they can afford bigger than thatyour goal is being achievedbut i cant see how this changes something for all those big corpsalliances sitting on trillionsim making my break of eve just connecting to set skills que and some times move some pi tired of broken stuff shipsweapons of game mechanics nerfs affecting more my wallet since i cant harvest moons and pushing me to do more boring stuff than i was already doing thx for all this im re discovering that even free to play fpss are more dynamic and rewarding
can someone from the csm plz comment on the csms position on this horrible change00 seems to be getting worse by the patch less anoms now less jump bridges whats next
source of this change
ccp is making changes to gather tears from those who think null sec should not require effort op success
vincentthere was a time when 00 had no anomolies and no jump bridgesimo those were better days people actually worked for their spacebitter vet here supporting the jump bridge nerf
ok so lets think of what would actually change if jump bridges went away1 itd be harder to ship in everything from jita which would force people to actually mine and manufacture in their space honestly i dont like how the majority of the materials that are used in null are harvested under the protective blanket of concord2 id be harder to defend an empire ok so imagine you are shooting at an empire that is 30 jumps from end to end your fleet has to go 20 jumps to go shoot at whatever target you are going after maybe you are sieging a pos or something the defenders on the other hand just have to ride their jump bridge network 5 jumps or so to cut you off3 there would be no safe jumps imagine you are in a hauler in one 00 system and you want to get to another 00 system fortunately for you there is a jump bridge chain in place you undock from you station and head to a pos with a jump bridge on it you then jump through to another pos full of turrets then warp directly to another defended pos and another jump bridge if the chain is set up right you can warp to and from death star poses and never have to risk running into a gate camp or roaming gang by the way this is how i got in and out of fountain for 3 months4 renters and pets would be less viable right now if you are a renter or pet of a bigger power block if anybody heads into your space and disrupts your carebearing all you have to do is scream into an intel channel till your overlords send a rent a home defense fleet through the jump bridge networkso yeah i love nullsec but hate jump bridges
many people conflate easier with better the jb changes  and theyre a small change  make living in highly developed sov space a tiny bit more challengingthe hysterical complaints that being forced to use a gate or two to cross a region will destroy sov 00 leave the inhabitants of losec npc 00 wspace and even empire wardecs dontchaknow bemused and baffledwe can manage it  why cant you
if wormhole inhabitants can manage to regularly fuel their stations i think you guys can manage a couple extra jumpgatessupporting the change 1
there were also what one quarter as many people in 00 as now
coraline you wouldnt mind if i fleshed out your idea into a new item for purchase via shady industrialists it woulduse existing game mechanics designed for a variety of ships and provide a similar situation to your following post aboutexploding surprises give me a day and mrx will design you a tft construct detonator remember that the evilengineer creating this must remain anonymous and a fee of several billion isk for the first bpo must be in my account beforedelivery only in the safety of a random wh can this transaction take place concord can never suspect this device existsend of transmission
forgive me if this has been brought up i couldnt find much reference on evesearch other then this thread from 09
quoting this to thank ccp regarding the recent dev blob for anyone that has not seen itlinkage
i dont fly a wolf and i also do not like jump bridges they make it too easy to blob people too easy to set up pet alliances and too easy to avoid gates by warping from one pos to another
itt we need current jb mechanics to stay relevent up northedit clusternorth colition has a nice ring to it
after 3 month of eve playtime any player in a npc corp automatically joins the fw militiaproblem solved
yes the best way to loose more fresh people playing the gamecan you figure out since the very first day all rookies have the right to is to be suicide ganked can flip games from older players ganked by concord because of game mechanics exploit from older players scammed and a lot more of juicy stuffyes force them to be the baits of all those deviants over present in the game its the best way to add new targets in long term
as long as those people are making 12man corps that can then be properly wardeced and griefed like the holy ccp intendedworking as intended
swynet my main beef is with old players that hidde in npc corporations to prevent wardecs3 month old players are not fresh people its more then enough time to learn the basic game mechanics and startget into a player corporationalso you only listed the fun stuff new players stop playing eve becouse they get bored of the solo carebear playstyle leaving eve without having played eve its sadso the sonner new players start playing this game the better
vajuthe thing is that we play in a sandbox you can choose to pvp or pve and no one should be obliged to do this or thati do agree now after all my ig experiences that a 3 months player can perfectly get in the games mood but at one conditionthat the player corp where hes getting in assume his implants and ships losses for a yearyou know has well has i do how hard is for a newb to get some isk how hard is for him to evolve in missions and get the good standing to do better missions since the skill gain is not proportional to his investment in the game but to something linear unchangeable no matter what he does meaning that maybe hes able to do better missions but he cant because hes not skilled enoughnow he can pvp im ok with that but what does pvp means to him losses implants he hardly can getsp lossships he can hardly buyfit and when he looses them what we expect him to do spam local begging isk in my humble opinion the whole way the rookie gets introduced in to the game is screwed by older players more than the game it self even if improvements are needed and most of players corps recruiting newbs ask more than they offer to themthis is my point this is what i would like to see changed and for that the whole players corps system has is today must be revampedalso some proposals here are excellent
all that needed done was to treat pilots in npc corps as employees of those corps in that they do not get to choose missions but are instead are given missionsjobstasks to do or face losing standings rapidly they are essentially employees and should be treated as such
supported replace the velocity bonus for an agility bonus
supported reward those flying their freighter instead of the autopilot massesthough as jf already have 5 agility per skill level for one of their bonuses it would likely have to be something smaller like 3
not convinced as yet although im a hauler and welcome any change which makes my life easier i value the play balance of the game and the economy of eve as a whole more so can you support why you think that freighter pilots need this benefit are there other ship type bonuses which seem ill conceived for instance i always thought that having a 5 bonus for every level of racial industrial skill seems funny for a transport ship as you need indy 5 to fly it anyway
thanks silly me
i like this proposali also really like the corruption expansion proposal from a few years ago by someone you might recognize
di like
i do not support bottingone of the miners suggested that ccp should not ban the botters but if they suspect you to be a bot you have 10 min to respond to a bot request and then you go red and anyone can safely kill youi like this idea as botting is cheating period however i do not support the idea of 10 min  perhaps 20 or 30 maybe even an hour ive been afk for that long and sometimes longer so i dont agree with the 10 minjust a thought
but it makes isk easier to produce for everyone else thus the market share of rmters is vastly reduced when there is no need to buy isk when you can print it yourself not that i agree with this proposal but yeah giving the green light to botting would effectively destroy the rmt market
so make copying bookmarks like copying blueprints
yes in some ways you can get it started then go afk you dont have to develop carpal tunnel syndrome to copy large numbers of bookmarks the rate would be throttled so that it doesnt lag out the solar systemhowever you shouldnt need skills or a science  industry slot to copy bookmarks like you do need for copying blueprints
re jita  you dont know thatre gates  what about camps where people are just chillinre safety  dont pretend this is some sort of altruistic proposalre afk cloakers  nice tryall in allno
um nomacro mining and bots ruin the game periodthis will never happen and if it does youll see a large player base just walk away from the game
as long as i believe that it is possible to get rid of macros  ill oppose the well everyones gonna do it anyways approachand yes its very possible use more randomly spawning rats that are fairly nasty
ok i guess in theory ccp could make mining less mind numbingly boring but come on seriously which of these two options do you think is more likely to happen
this ignoring the rest of the idea dont let players choose their citizenship base it off of their medical clone or something
true though even then dreads will still rely solely on the siege module to be effective at anything
dreadnought were used to kill capitals and were effective then motherships got their boost and dreads are obsolete nowif there is any ship that needs to be examined to fit the role of capital killer then i would look at the dread first
for the dread to be the cap killer of choice then for its dps vs capitol ships it has to have a better isk wise bang for your buck than motherships so if you are going to take down another capitol ship it should be more efficient to buy a pile of dreads than use one mothership assuming your dread pile costs the same as the mothership
excellent point sarina you know what they say 90 of people blindly use statistics without actually knowing what they mean
noes the effective 17 dmg you get out of it replaces very well lower dmg missile in another average resistance and nothing absolutely nothing tells you your dmg is crap if you choose to use thermalexploem dmgdammit if my ing hybrids worked that well than your racial kinetic bonus i wouldnt be spamming all gallentehybrids threads with my issues encountered using that stuffget out please
they are the only ships in game with a damage bonus to an ammo not a weapon system it would be like you only get the hybrid bonii if your shooting iron
errrmhelios 10 to drone thermal damageeris 5 to thermal missile damageall the bombers are racial damage type bonusedthe kinetic bonus is fine its the caldaris damage type live with iti still think that reducing the range of guided missiles and introducing modules that will increase that range again is the first major step to balance of battlecruisers
fixed it isnt about guided missiles at all you just want a drake nerf light missiles are fine and cruises are broken so id be rather surprised if you were dimwitted enough to want those nerfed as wellheres a more elegant solution reduce drake lock range max skilled by 20km or so there it now has to use a slot of some sort to reach max range mission accomplished without your moronic ideaoh in fact while im talking about missiles in this threadreduce flight time and significantly increase velocity for cruises and to a lesser extent heaviesno weapon im looking at you cruise missiles should be relegated to pve for being so utterly useless in pvp
and the last two are the breacher and inquisitorthen you have no problem with changing gallente so the are only bonused on the thermal part of hybrids and thermal drones caldari the kinetic part of hybrids armarr the em part of lasers and em drones and minmatar the explosive part of projetals and explosive missilesnow everyone has racial damage
the proletariat did anyway
so 00 should be painful to live in for anyone but the super rich elite which you happen to be one of because youre elite obviously
which is what this thread is all about  some pretty nifty and some outlandish ideas alreadythread as a whole is worth a read if you havent done so already
super ultra dense veldspar  trit is a bottleneck in 00  if you cut down logistics there wont be enough of it
assumptionin modern societies specializing is common and to force an entity not to specialize is retarted because everyone cant focussed on that he is able to do best the proposition is a failurethe analysis og ccp doesnt start with the goal to get into 00 more prodders and miners its a idea without a concept how we get more carebears into 00a analysisi according to the game theory no one chooses the maximum profit if the lower profit is more secure the reason why the carebears arent producing in 00 is that production in highsec is much cheaper and much more secure you dont need masses of guards pvp pilots and your investment cant be deleted by a random invasion and every 00 allianz is based on that the assets bpo are protected in high secii the marked in eve is not developed and is based on one big hub everyone want to have a picture of todays prices and everyone wishes to have a fast access to all types of wares this is mostly garanteed by the hub jita as long as the current game mechanism dont provide a better marked access its like in the good old socialistic countries we will get a tendency for a big hub and 00 entitys are based on jita too because they want to sell minerals and moongoo there and buy modules and ships to a good price its a center to exchange wares like tech against dyspro and there is demand by all 00 corps that are running reactions iii ccp wishes more pvp but didnt provide something for smaller alliances because its impossible as long as bigger raising the chances to win a fight big coalitions will be rewarded by this system and alliances in big coalitions dont make war against each other this is contradictionary to ccps wishes and fundamental iv to produce something in 00 includes transport of huge amounts of minerals accross some sytems its cheaper to produce in high sec because the cost in 00 are the transporting ship plus the guards in high sec there is only the working time for one pilot b propositioni develop the marked todays concept is resulting from a time when ccp had no dedicated server for the marked develop a game mechanic that makes it possible to exchange products across sov borders so everyone that has capital can be a part of a global marked with this proposition allianzes will be able to produce all ships and modules in 00 and carebears will be able to produce in 00 for every other entity in 00 todays trading system is the death to a globalized marked and forces carebears into high sec because they can meet each other there until now without jita an entity in the south hasnt access to tech and vice versa ii make production in 00 much cheaper than in high researchtime for bpos should be shortened in 00 reduce production times and demand for materials in 00 so investent in guards for transport will be rewarded by the lesser effort to produce somethingiii make it easier to mine and transport minerals at least one or to years to start a movement to 00 iv change the mechanic that bigger is better raise cost at least quadratically for alliances and sov about a certain size prefer better strategy over force in fleet battles remarkspecialisation in game is not a problem its a problem of the game mechanics that specialisation is located to certain areas like highsec but to force specialisation into other areas will take away the fun out of game of many players
sadly youre right in the point but all you get for saying truth its trolls and stone age commentsi have a sun aged now of 18 and tried to bring him to evein just a few days he just said to me that eves for fools or masochists no feeling he was doing something good or wrong grieffers can flippers scamers someone took him to pvp obviously he lost his ship faster than he got in to the fight or understood what he had to dohe just left he just told me to try some fps free me that hates that stuff where every one shoots you from every where and always head shots you he was right when you cant or dont want to spend more than 1 or 2 hours playing internet games any fps is more fun dynamic than any activity in eveunfortunately this is not ready to change because of those stone age players and centenarian minds incapable to evolve they are happy with what they have why change itedit its pretty nice to talk about eves marketing but what tools do we disposedoes ccp fixed any goal to achieve that we know nodoes ccp fixed any kind of player interesting them more than another no opposed to some nerds comments nothing says witch is the kind of eves player or not and their player type target and its certainly not some nerd devs signature the official version so at the end what are we talking about right here
firstly pos modsremove that horrible drag system give us a grid based on the towers that shows valid locations and let us click anchorsilos miners reaction arrays etc etc need to be combined together into set objects which have bays for each areas there is no need for 6 mods when there is no flexibilityfuel needs a work over in general make different mods require different bits rather than having only 2 that change im pretty sure lo and heavy water do not make my guns fire where as mechanical parts and enriched uranium probably dopos mails need to just say what is the problem ie i need liquid ozone i need oxygen isotopespos statuses should be viewable from the corporate tab including hp and fuel amounts if we can get mails why cant we get a nice ui about it tooshield resists need to be more even with a 0 a 125 a 25 and a 375 depending on racepos weapons should not require ammo but should instead use up fuel reserves and preferably should reflect the drones that each race uses and not use the standard normal ammopos ewar they should have bit in racial electronic warfare to reflect the recon ships of each race i mean why would you build a object with a shield and no weapons to defend itself
i think the velator is a wonderful noob ship it just needs a teensy bit more powergrid such that a pilot with engineering 5 and advanced weapon upgrades 5 could fit two neutron blasters the reaper is the quintessential minmatar ship  bunch of parts flung together to produce a fast light craftthe ibis and impairor are rather dull looking
i like this idea give them more of a guided experience of their choosing ie pvp industry exploration i dont know about a 3 month term but a ccp protected academy for the first month to show them the options of eve and basics to the main styles of play as mentioned military academy could set times ut for fleet combat to opposing factions yet wo risk of losing sp or their own isk were talking t1 frigs maybe cruisers then after the protected month or trial period they graduate and now its off to rl eve upon graduating they could recieve lp a new ship and standings would probably make for much better immersion into the game plus you establish more friendships with ppl that you went to the academy with of course they could just drop out get nothing and take the hard road this would also avoid forcing alts to go do the academy thing again
excellent idea both starting players in factional warfare as a bootcamp recruit helps add some life into fw and introduces future pvpers to the mechanics of killing have other player corps like red frog offer positions for new haulers give rf some sort of tax benefit for taking on noobs and pay noobs to do simple courier contracts for a salary etci think that either having both npc institutions like militia pvp and interbus courier or concord policing and player corps like red frog or eve university play a part in the training of new characters with incentive for the player corps of course that would make the npe much better also if we stop the necessity of every player having to play 2 alts in order to survive in this game that would open up the player base as well but discussion is better left to the other thread 
hells yes id go with option 3
supported
great idea but just one question what is supposed to happens with those battles that take about 3 hours to end are those gonna take 30 hours in our time relatively speaking of course
ladies will agree bigger it is better it issupported
mmmmm
while the concept of fixing small day to day things that annoy players is awesome im very concerned at the quote above which got buried in the massive pile of tinfoil and fetal alcohol syndrome that is the eip thread game balance changes with such wide implications should not be sat on a list next to now theres a picture of your face in the trade window
not supported blackops are fine as they are except the sin that does need some work but all the others i feel are balancedthe only change that bops need is a bigger fuel bay and bigger jump range so they can actual achieve their intended purpose of being able to surprise jump people and bridge recon fleets they were not meant to be solo gank machines and should require use of support and proper planning i run fleets with bops with corp mates quite a bit and the only thing that we feel greatly limits us is lack of jump range and stupidly small fuel bays tbh its more the fuel bay than the jump range but you get the idea
supported
supported would make people actually use them offensively instead of just covert portaling in the bombers
people already do use them offensively in fact in my corps recent bop fleet weve been asking for bop bs only and not offering any portals as it too much hassle controlling fuel consumption
have you ever fit a black ops
not supported black ops dont need covert ops cloaksi dont really understand the argument that having a covert ops cloak would make more people use them which would somehow make them better id love to get an explanation from someone who supports this endeavor rarely if ever are you using gates with your black ops even when you do use gates being able to align at more than 75 speed while cloaked makes it simple utilize your jump drive and drop onto the people you want to kill why warp around cloaked when you can covertly drop your black ops anywhere in a system without the need to warpi just dont see the logic actually make an argument so we can discuss your thoughts blacks ops needswants1 modest jump range increase id even be happy with 55 max jc5 is and should continue to be absolutely essential for intended black ops use if you want to be able to insert forces into hostile territory make it so i dont need to be next door with jc52 fuel bay increase to be honest im on the fence about this while id love to see my bo carrier 13k topes without playing with my fit i dont believe its entirely necessary if im just bridging i fit my sin for gas can and can carrying upwards of 30000 oxy topes if im bridging and fighting i need to bring a transport ship for the ride if im just dropping solo the standard fuel bay is typically fine
there is already a thread on these which can be found hereplease remember to check the thread hot topics of the assmebly hall before posting duplicate threads
im not sure if you are being serious or just trying to troll forgive me if the former but you may want to choose a better name but if you want people to consider your proposal and even then sometimes they wont  you may have to spend a bit more time laying out exactly the problem you are trying to solve for here and how the proposal will proportedly solve it and point out any unexpected potential side effects it may have although the veterans in the forum will no doubt do that for you if you miss anythe first point alone seems a little too far fetched with way too many negative reprocussions what is an aggressive module to accept without more clarificationi usually take the side of the carebears in these matters hey someone has to as our csm are all nullsec alliance pvpers but even then i find it hard to support this
cool story bro
i too feel that nullsec alliances should have all of their logistics guys commit suicide
oh you find numbers confusing this explains alot
i actually agree with anna in principle though i cannot corroborate her facts on lowsec as i have never personally lived there but in the occasions that i have been in lowsec they were deserted except for the factional war zone in low secso if the situation she is referring to exists then i agree it needs to be fixed bottom line every ecosystem and economy needs a balance of all participants if one side out weighs another the system eventually dies predators like lions survive because they only kill what they can eat and only when they are good enough hunters to do so prey like antelope survive as a species because they have the numbers to do so if you allow pvpers unchecked open season on haulers and indies then you risk killing them all off starving yourselves of a steady income and living now this eventually forces everyone in this game to have both a pvp alt and a carebear alt in order to survive as a team metagaming which some on this thread argue is the point of eve but i dont think it needs to be i think that ccp can get a lot more players into this game if you allow people the freedom to economically viably choose to play completely in the space of farming or rogues without mixing the two in order to survive why do you think there are so few girls in this game because this forced economic necessity to be a fighter in an alt is a turn off for us free the people from the burden of having to defend themselves if they just want to play a business mogul or a hauler or a ratter yes this opens up the game to farmville players and im sure our manly man csms wont have any of that but i think if they really thought about it adding more people in eve only helps the game lines ccps pockets and makes one of the best virtual microeconomies even better by ensuring future sustained growth and there will still be plenty of places in the universe to be a guy
you were spoon fed the figures and thier source its not his fault you have a room temperature iq and cannot comprehend them
there are not several definitions of griefer just scum that fit it or not
yes a group of bombers can create havoc small group even a solo bomber  solo bomber but the fact remains that jump bridges have done nothing but help create nothing but carebears and blob warfare when a fleet can just run to there jb and safely retreat several systems away at the slight hint of a loss or call in that insta blob of 100 pilots for a solo ship is just rediculous 00 has become nothing but a carebear land of blobs that cannot fight solo and rely on there 10v1 odds to win a fight i myself cannot wait for the nerf
i think you dropped some straw when you made that man
i fully understand that margin trading is a helpful tool in making you richerhowever the issues with it is that its not helpful in the game as it standsif it effected game play id totally agree with you but as far as i can tell it doeshowever i did think of a solution some may not like this but i think its a nice easy and good solutionmarket orders made by margin trading ability are subject to a negative isk penalty of the base order ie if you had to put down 24million out of 100million it would be removed from your characterunless the order comes to a natural end by the time limit or there is enough isk for the sale to go throughlegitimate buyers are more than likely to not enjoy this penalty however scammers would be at risk of loosing isk adverse to gaining isk if someone caused the buy order to faili also like this idea very much itd be even better if it highlighted them in red editor even just removed them from visibility on the market
this is no problem because all of you have to be aware of scams and its easy to avoid them
isnt there some fine that is charged to the toon if they cannot cover a buy order can we not have negative balances i dont see the problem really cant you avoid this problem altogether by testing out any fishy too good to be true buy orders by lifting a couple from the bid before you commit to obtaining the large quantities
itd be easier if there was no minimum quantity as most scammers put it at a number just below the amount they have
and then when youre trying to buy components for somethign in bulk you have to warp between 50 stations picking up 1 trit in each as opposed to all in one
yes absolutely in fact my original statement was
thanks can i ask that you support it by clicking the support this topic checkbox so that csm may read it and consider it
why would anyone generate a contract to have themselves hauled somewhere elsei can imagine a wardec target trying to ship themselves out of a station  would the wardec extend to passenger transport what about when the transport is killed do you have pilots sitting in capsules or some form of special pilot carriagewhat happens if i log in but my ferry was blown up and im still sitting in a pilot carriage
i think most of your questions have already been answered in the chaingreat point about the wardec though that would be an additional reason you may want to travel like a civilian as for whether the wardec extends to the carrier my preliminary thought is no you should not be able to endanger the carriage by your wardec thanks for the insight
do gate campers get to inspect the cargo of a passenger ferry can you identify the passengerswhat benefit does a passenger ferry service provide that a shuttle on autopilot cant
i think we should let cargo scanners see the passengers how else would pirates be able to judge which are the high worth targets we want to help the kidnappingpiracy industry as much as build up the hauling profession after allbut this by no means allows a pirate to attack a ferry without consequence even if he has a passenger which is legally wardecd civilian transports should be protected by concord up to the sec status of the system allowsas for your second question1 security shuttles have none but if you make a lucrative carriage contract and insisting on a high quality of ferryman clean record high success ratio then it can be presumed that they are good at their job perhaps they take you on a battleship ala clear skies or a freighter both are safer than a shuttle2 convenience i have to actually be online and preferably not afk to use a shuttle what if i dont want to be what if i am a fb farmville industrialist who is hired by an alliance to take care of their pi for a sector and i log in only once a week to play i really wouldnt care for flying 50 jumps across null space to get to my next job location and since i need to only login every couple of days to earn my pay urgency is not a problem3 and of course this adds the dimension to the economy that both feeds and grows more haulers of every level not just big time bulk freighter captains but small time mom and pop ferry operations and it makes a new isk source for pirates making them less dependent on carebear alts to survive
i am entering text into a troll discussion
you know there are other systems of democracy out there that work better namely constituent based representation parliamentary system if 100 of players see themselves as 00ers then 100 of csm should be 00ers if its a 302050 split then so should the number of seats be allocated in the csm to reflect this ratio right now the problem with this system is that its more like a high school prom queen contest or a dictatorship puppet democracycan anyone think of a good reason why the number of seats in csm7 should not be determined by a census of players or something like a qen snapshotim totally fine with goons dominance of the portion of csm seats alloted to nullsec delegates assuming they get the popular null sec votes i am against the whole of csm being dominated by nullsec players unless 100 of the players in eve are nullsec players just because of a flaw in the voting system leaving a large portion of the players unrepresented with little csm expertise in some areas of gameplay by the way the flaw in the pseudodemocracy system here is that its a popular vote system every player gets 1 vote each is worth the same and there are no limits to the seats on csm up for electionwhat this is analogous to is this have anyone who is an an american be allowed to run for congress there are 20 congress seats up for grabs with no restrictions on where the candidates are living to determine validity of candidacy does this sound fair if it does your congress would be full of californians and new yorkers as they have they highest populations and everyone will likely vote for their owntaken to the next level if we let ccp run the elections for the united nations all your representatives would be chinese sure lots of these chinese ministers do have it in their hearts to do a good job representing you westerners but when it comes down to it if it came to a point where they have to make a decision that would harm china in lieu of benefiting americans do you think that they would would you trust them to be impartial
given that the last csm is working on things for 00 from the devblog about the jb nerf there is plenty more in the works does it not make sense to have a lot of 00 input on things a bunch of empire carebears are not the people who should be deciding how sov warfare changes even with a nullsec dominated csm were getting hit with the nerf bat over and over again with an all empire csm it would only get worsewho would you rather put in charge of a ship the guy whod been commanding ships for years or the guy who once went on a ferry and got seasick in the harbour
why is this stupid thread still opened
 so you think that the world should be ruled by chineseseriously though i agree with your point put the experts to do what they do best but that isnt the problem the problem is not how csm executes their job the problem is misrepresentation of the population in eve which is contradictory to csms reason for beingi dont know what csm5 was up to and if you say it was 100 00 stuff then my arguement is that it shouldnt have been if 70 of paying eve players are carebears csms job is to help decide the priority of changes to be made and it makes no sense if csm doesnt represent the population distribution of their constituents in doing soyes and i wouldnt be putting a nascar driver at the helm of the boat either and being a 00 expert nascar star doesnt automatically make you a good ship captain csm needs to have all representation from all citizens of eve because some people are in ships while some are playing nascar in the game if 50 of players operate in 00 then you only need mittani and 5 others on csm the other 6 seats should go to people from other backgrounds in different parts of the game i seriously dont see why anyone should think that this isnt the right thing to do especially when you choose to identify yourself as a member of whichever constituent you wish in the census but anyway its all too late now for csm6 im not advocating we impeach the existing representation they were voted in using the flawed rules of the current system after all and i am no anarchist i am just suggesting an overhaul to the csm election rules for csm7 which should make csm more true to their espirit detat and for that and only that i wish to support this thread
so where do you draw the constituency lines people in eve dont have permenant addresses on top of that it sounds like what you really want is one constituency per playstyle in which case who gets to decide which groups of people are worthy of their own representative and which arent even then thats basically the equivalent of saying every political party gets one member of parliament and they can vote interally as to who it is constituencies at least here in the uk aim to be roughly equal size how do you propose to work with that the closest you could get is probably dividing people by character age but my gut feeling says youd end up with the same result as we got in the last election with way more overhead
i too think this is an urgent situation that demands ccps immediate attention the csm have barely finished moving in to their offices at the start of their term and its already evident that theyre doubleplus ungood and will destroy eve then the real world followed by day 3apparently the op and i are the only ones here who can see the future either that or op is a mittani alt looking for more attention in which case im a bad llama for feeding the troll
actually somehow this issue isnt that stupid at all yes the csm delegates have been elected by players every account had a chance to vote for a candidate they likedbutim in one of the big alliances and its absolutely usual to ask the members to vote for our own candidate more because the alliance wants more political power or better oportunities to alter game mechanics the way they like then the candidate to be a representative for all eve players however you have to understand that thats the way politics work in the real world too  just consider alliances as political parties they normaly vote for own candidates its the same in evejust my 2 cents
who cares who calls the tunes who cares who pulls the punches the damage is done
if ccp wants to keep changing skills around then they must reimburse the isk and sp for the things they are taking away thats my only concern these books are aprox 15mil each with lp costsway more than the learning skills
holy oldpost batman no dynamic quality devs cleared that up on the next page or so of that threadalso brand new devpost is best post
thanks for the update i guess this means that l5 agent lp will go up since they were all l12 before run run to the l5 agents my friends
except my tests showed their pay decreased due to lp getting axed small boost from the being q20 is far outweighed by the loss of that 50 lp bonus
the lp is worth more that aside its horrible for the economy lp shop is a big isk sink what they should have done is boost lp payout nerf bounty and isk payout drastically increase isk cost of shop exchanges and remove tag requirement
which would send the prices of implants and faction mods into freefall
well originally i thought that we needed to remove the rats and add the warp disruption create a place where fights were inevitable and where both parties could have a reasonable chance of victorya place where people could choose to commit to combat and not be able to retreat until the combat was resolvedhowever this would never work on its own because any pilot or small gang would inevitably be overwhelmed by a bigger gangsthe buttontower locking anyone on grid means cloak traps will not work in plex so roaming counter plexers will be able to see exactly what ships wait for them on dscan before committing to combatthe plexers would diethen i thought the easy way around that is to limit the number of ships in the plex at oncewarp gates have all sorts of locks and conditions why not set it so that it only admits fw parties and then only allows a certain number from each sideoriginally i wanted it to work like a wormhole with a mass limit and a max hull weight cap coz this would indeed alllow people to try and take on ten frigates in their solo bs or suchlike but for now im happy to talk about a simple 5 activation limit per team per plexthe only problem i can see is thiswhat if a plexing party each dual boxed an alt in the opposing militia and locked genuine counter plexers out of running plexes by bringing their alts in with them to each plex yeah its a lot of effort but this is evewhat ifin this case the system is brokenso im going back to thinking about it for a bit morefeel free to chuck a few ideas in 
or do we accept that any system we devise will be exploited in some way so by this standard the above exploit is difficult enough to pull off that it can be overlookedalt spies in the same plex as the mainswould people risk exposing their spies like that
i dont see what people are complaining about the game worked fine before jump bridges were implemented
i like the first change that will go live there goes the cap advantage for the defenders in a cynojammed sys
a step in the right direction i use gates 90 of the time and ignore jbs i feel that we in 00 are to dependent on them
the game worked fine before supercaps and t3 ships were implemented we should probably remove those too
considering that the raison detre of bridges is no longer part of eve pos based soverignty and associated logistics the nerf is actually very reasonablegoing to require a period of adjustment for the people who have never lived without them but somehow i think theyll muddle through in the mean time lets hope and lobby for ccp making the industrial side of null the first thing to be addressed out of the long term items so the jita withdrawal symptoms are cut as short as possible
its common knowledge that nullsec is safer then highsec this is huge problem nullsec null security no existent security void security zero security nada security rien security whatever you call it the only security that should exist in these areas should be provided by players not by game mechanics and last time i checked jump gates are not playersalso another big problem with jump gates they make the universe a small place being in the far outer regions should have a meaning instant travelling shouldnt be possible it should always be a difficult task to travel inout o nullsec with the distance involved and the dangerous around it players should have to plan convoys for logistics fleet travelling would be fun and challenging again
did you just put convoys and fun in the same sentence lol this will not result in more small gang pvp short term it will result in more ganks long term just in more high sec lvl 4 mission runners you can claim what you want it is alot safer in high sec than in 00this will not result in smaller naps it will result in larger naps by making it much harder to get caps in cynojammed systems it is harder to defend against an opponent that outnumbers you simple solution make sure you outnumber the opponent nap more this will not make it easier for smaller entities to get going in 00 for the large entities jb expenses are only a small part of the bill much smaller than the ammount spend on supercap production small entities will spend alot more relative on jbs and now they need many more jb systems for roughly the same network so a much steeper increase in total cost than large entitiesthis is an indirect boost to supercapsand what it is all about for ccp most likely in the end it even more forces you to have several accounts either to run missions in high sec or cyno alts to just transport more with jump capable ships and less with jbs and  new players who dont have capsapparently this is all offset by some new ideas of ccp that are supposed to be not total crap which is doubtfull if ccp has the idea but they will come some time in the future i expect it right after iterations on fw storefronts and a pi that resembles anything close to what ccp promised in other words that can take many years before it comesedit not that ccp has any clue about 00 with their causality model made by a 3yearold but luckily we got wis coming
what i really want to know from the csm is if ccp made them aware of these changes or if this was another time when they have not even consulted if this is the case what is the csm even for if ccp doesnt seem to use ithopefully someone in the csm will comment soon
the full daily production capacity of all conquerable 00 is enough to let a full 250 maelstrom fleet shoot t2 ammo for a bit over an hour most other ships use more ammo the other 9975 of the 00 population wont have ammo that day so no nerfing jbs isnt going to make the littlest difference in how much ammo is imported from jita if ccp wants nullsec to be more independent they need to boost its production capabilities
this has been tried in that place known as the real world to some benefit the idea is simple concord decides there are to many super capitols in capsuleer hands due to this hard caps would be set on a per chassis basis for example 24 titans of each racial and 30 scs of each racial this would once again add value to them since they are now everywhere its becoming super capitol eve online this is not a troll but with all the threats going around on how to kill them and op just leave as is and make them more rare once one is lost then a new one can be placed into the cooker and then all others are locked out just a thought ill try and refine it more later but any thoughs or comments
and when one alliance owns all of them
then a lot of other alliences will start working together to kill thembut due to lagg there is no way to kill a suppercap fleet without lagging out the serverand what would happen to all the suppers in game atm i dont think ccp would just take them all away
hard limits like that are bad for the game hell it is bad for any gamemake them more vulnerable in combat and let constructing them require more than the ability to crash a node every two days and it sorts itself out in time
thats dumb
what do you expect its element115 that suggested it lol
ccp wouldnt take them away they would just go via attrition and no new ones would be built i mean for a ship thats supposed to be a pinicle of death and destruction and rare there are a lot of them i mean lets consider some other options for a momunt nerf the ships possable listnerf ehpnerf dpsnerf ewar immunityhow about increase built time and up the materialsbuff dreads to kill supers in gangsmake all new supers alliance owned property after all it makes logical sense nerf 00 moon goo they already got sanctums capping the  limits the need for other nerfs if its an issue of one alliance rules them all eve has plenty of history with the rise and fall of alliances
after reading the asinine jb proposal i dont trust ccp to chance anything anymore
i would like to see a ccp dev statement that ganking is working as designed because honestly ive heard so many people say this so matteroffactly as if by the nature of everyone repeating it it must be true i really dont know myself but i refuse to believe something blindly without justification somewhere else in the threads somebody mentioned that long time ago in eve it wasnt as easy as it is now to gank whether it cost more to the ganker in terms of lower insurance payouts or their were less alphainstapop ship fit outs that can kill most indies without any fighting chance i think since then ganking has gotten too easy and there are pretty much no real negative to ganking save a sec penalty hit what has happened is that the system is now imbalanced to the point that the small time hauler is almost an endangered species and hauling as a profession is almost dead unless you can pilot a freighter ganking is part of the game yes it has a place but it shouldnt be as easy as it is now such imbalanced ganking was likely an unexpected side effect of some other unrelated play balance changes to some modules or insurance policies and i dont think was intended by ccp
just make the insurance company think of its bottomline like it should removes the lolsuicide while leaving suicides a viable professionin short void insurance on concordokken
i move my valuable items in an agilityrigged blockade runner with a covops cloak fitted in over 4 years of play i have never ever been suicide ganked it would be incredibly difficult for anyone to gank me in empireganking is only ever easy when the victims choose to make it easy people who afk autopilot people who dont tank their ships people who use an 800k industrial to move hundreds of millions of isk worth of modules  these are the people that get ganked because they make it easy and profitable for the gankers to do so dont complain that ccp isnt doing enough to make ganking dificult blame the lazy ignorant arrogant players who do everything they can to make ganking easy and profitableand before anyone tries to dismiss this as blame the victim yes i am blaming the victims because its they who are at fault with a minimal amount of effort and attention they could completely obviate the problem but instead they choose to whine and cry for mommy ccp to protect them insteadit is so ridiculously easy to avoid being ganked that anyone who gets ganked deserves our derision not our sympathy and certainly not even more protection from concordincidentally suicide ganking has been made more difficult by 2 concord buffs and the insurance nerf last year however it has been boosted by the artillery and torpedo changes id say its about even compared with how its ever been im certainly not seeing anything that leads me to believe that its more prevelent than it used to be
this discussion has veered from an idea to provide a deterrent to getting ganked to the pros and cons of gankingi myself am in favor of ganking even though i have never been a recipient of one what the op wants is a situationwhere she is flying and gets scanned the bad guy tm sees the bomb in the cargo hold and has to decide quicklywhether to go ahead and pop a ship knowing he likely wont get loot or start looking for another target thatswhat this proposal is about is it a good idea some will say yes others will say no i like the idea for tworeasons first its an active option a pilot can take i want to decide what to do with my stuff i may not getthe goods from point a to point b but the ganker wont get my goods either which is what i understood from theop two its a great isk sink against the hauler if pilots start putting bombs in their own cargo hold i bet allgankers will really make sure no one has the goods also the bomb itself will be an expense for the pilot whowants that peace of mind my response to the op was tongue in cheek but my offer was serious a bomb for the cargo hold is something that canbe implemented but even if ccp likes it i think some time will pass before this is even considered anyway iwill be posting the tft construct detonator in this thread so everyone can see what would be involved in trashingcargo besides putting a menu option for the cargo hold where pilots can trash items in space
hello eve community i think that player should be able to customize their ship with decals or skin it would be really interesting to see different skins for ships after all player buy their ship so why not costumizing them since its their property and not the empire one just like wwii pilot liked to paint their planes and bombs it would just add a touch of creativity to the game and would make peoples more enjoying their shipsoption 1 ingame costumiser just like the caracter creator you can modify your ship paint and add decals to it and then a optional feature would be taht you could save this skin and sell it on market for some isk i think it would be a good idea and artist would have a place in the gameoption 2 out of game editor that artist would use to craete skins and sell them for some isk to player wanting to feel specialnote of course custom skins would be togable onoff deffault offthis little addition could increase the game population i think and isnt really hard to realise i guessif you ever played trackmania you understand how the editor would work a bit or well this is how i would make it so its easy usage so everyone can have fun with their shipsjust my two cents sorry for my bad english im a french speakerany idea are welcomednote if you are new in the forum to support the idea you need to check teh case when your posting that say you agree with general idea thx in advance 
i like this idea just make sure you dont add annoying colors like neon hot pink cutter would not like that at all
lame lame lame
yo
seems its easier to track and figure why some stuff is on top and other does not since is classed by general players votecant see why or how this tool could be harmful for the game so 1
yes this was suggested many times and at fanfest ccp was commenting on possibly having something like this in the works
wow you are a big fuking baby no wonder your corp left you stupid treejb makes super coalitions possilbe i remember when an super coalition was mad pact in drone regions which took up 25 regions when there was no such thing as jb i cant wait to see your nc fall to fire and dust the only reason why the nc is still together is because of jb its such a joke so many jb to mm home systems now you might require skill to rule so much space death to all super aliances
supported kill bridges
lolwut more macro miners  cheaper minerals  deflation  inflationin any case i think this is a good idea the core of the game is pvp whether it be in pew pew or trading or whatever and mining is just insanely boring content so is missions imo and really pretty much everything you have to do to get ahead in this game and get to the fun stuff which could be manufacturingresearchhigh level industry or pvp why do people think it is so important for someone to have to go through the boringness of mining in order to make a few isk if manufacturing required you moved stuff around the factory all day there would probably be botters doing that too and people would be whining about it and would insist that those poor carebears keep spending their time on it goddamn it but luckily manufacturing requires no real life time investment next to the isk investment i dont see why mining should because its definitely not more fun than the hypothetical moving parts around in a 2d factory screen so an isk and skill investment for the modules to engage in mining should suffice and require no further investment of time because if you think mining is more fun than say any other pasttime then and yes obviously you will have to invest some real time before you get to the part where you can automate the whole iskmaking process but it wont be an endless grind and it will take away the botters advantage and probably run them straight out of businessfull support good idea ccp should do this yesterday the only reason ccp will not is because of the intense oversupply this could create on the mineral market and distorting the economic balance heavilyive not once heard a convincing argument on how macro miners are actually bad for the game for pvpers with isk in their wallets its good because more supply  lower prices  more stuff you can buy with your isk and since the amount of isk you get from missions isnt priceadjusted afaik the only people who suffer from botters are actual miners who put in their time because without macros everything would be a lot more expensive
not supportedremove the plexes so it will remove the botsi prefer play with 25k players than 25k players  25k bots
this is an interesting idea it would completely change the markets to one where you placed new orders instead of updating old ones updating becomes impssible in most markets as each update severely cuts into you profitability basically doubling your fees one place i can see a huge problem with this however is in large ticket itemsright now if i want to trade in towers or faction ships i pu in my 1300 mil for a 1 unit order and update the order to grab the item generally looking at a 510 profit with this system it would turn into some kind of horrible price is right game where the nex dude puts up a 01 bid and i now am stuck with 2 choices update and eat into profits or do nothing and hope that his order clears if it doesnt the only way my order will clear is if there is a market swing which could see me loosing money if it does clearoften times i will update orders down if i see the market shifting youre removing that optionanother problem is that you are giving a massive advantage to people who have superlow fees due to standings those players will have massively lower update costs so they have a better margin to beging with and are able to update more ofteninteresting idea but i dont think it would work
im on the fence on this one as i have never piloted one but just playing devils advocate i would like to ask if anyone has considered the unexpected side effects of these buffsi mean i think buffs to other ships in the past though meaning well and did fix the problems with the ships that they were meant to fix caused shifts in the play balance in the game which were unintentional for example i think somebody in the forums once mentioned that suicide ganking is now much easier and cost effective for the ganker than beforei would then hypothesize that allowing a bo ship to use covert ops cloak would make it the griefing ship of choice
im just going to leave this here for the people who think black ops cant fight toe to toe you just need to have the right setupas for what boosts i would like to see for them i dont think a covert cloak is going to be helpful its supposed to be a support ship not some solo gank mobile however i certainly wouldnt argue against boosts in their tank dps and jump range or against a substantial increase in their fuel bay size because that increases their ability to do what they were supposed to do in the first place to support and enhance covert gangs
propolsal to create new module or ability to black ops to see cloucked ships on grid and be able to warp to them and declouck that wil give defenders chane proteckt agenst afk clouckers hoo siting in systems days and weeks 
bellicouse  needs compleatly gutting and reworked from the ground upomen  small boost to grid and cpu destroyers in general need some tweeking to make a bit more newbie friendlywell thats just my 2 isk for the time being in terms of balance
needs significantly more than a small boostumm what being newbie friendly is just about all destroyers are good for right now they need a total rethink to be honest antifrigate would be a very nice role if there werent a large selection of cruisers that can do the same job better while also not being made of paper with a bloated sig radius
theres more than enough arguments here thank youi shouldnt really need one but since you insist nerfing makes ships die faster and makes them less likely to be used the more ships get nerfed the less time each player who flies them will last on the battlefield and battles will become shorter players with less good ships to choose from will end up all flying the same thing which is pretty much what is happening nowpeople want to stay in the battle not float in a pod or wake up 10 jumps away with a session timer or three buffing ships means more likelihood theyll be used in combat and generally and that theyre more likely to stay in the battle longer currently ships are stupid and very poorly balanced and i am beginning to think that is the way it will stayunblancing things a little is good a bugati veyron should be better than a camaro but lets face it they are also much very expensive things dont work that way in eve fact cruisers category is completely unbalanced and most should be faster and stronger so should their tech ii counterparts battleships should generally be better too and destroyers should have their placedestroyers are not roughly quoted too easily bypassed by beginning players in skill traing sorry but that opinion is blind and utter bull and ccp needs to rethink their  also roughly quoted intended to have strategy on ship functiona tier system is fine as long as you actually use it as intended putting 4 different ships into a single tier within a class of ships then reworking each of them to suit their faction philosophy while ignoring how that affects their use and effectiveness is dumb and possibly just plain stupid fictional quote its not gallente it shouldnt have a reasonable drone bay qfs it should have one and no bonuses as only gallente should get thosethe latest bit from the devs in the question response thread was very disheartening in this regard with answers to related questions revealing an attitude that intended is always right thats stupid and naive not to mention lazy to balance ships within a tier all you need do is give them all approx the same stats then apply their faction bonuses if they dont balance then its because the factions dont balance and this will hold true through all tiers and classes randomly selecting crap doesnt work so stop doing it creativity has no place in the design process involving creativity with real statisitics and effectiveness in gameplay is completely stupid and should be avoided at all costsbalance ships by weight measure somethings effect on combat in real terms and use that to balance removing it from one ship within a tier and adding it to another while removing something of equal combat value from the first and applying something of equal value again to the first 1 tier at a time and one class at a time but see if the factions need to be rebalanced a little first this should also be approached assuming all other things are equal that are equal and making those that arent equal equal or using that to determine how you bend each ship in this fashion either make all turrets equal like missiles or make all ships fit only specific turrets by faction or cause turrets to adjust the ship with modifiers that bring it closer to the turrets faction and prevent if from being an exploit while allowing it to be a way of changing ship characteristics better to just eliminate role bonuses applying to a specific faction of turret and make them apply to any turret rather than making a ship unusable because of them
thanks for your passionate and quite frankly offensive replies i do enjoy it when people assume what my agenda is although i admire your passion please be a little more civilised on the forumsanyway i agree with your proposal about increasing missile velocity however as far as i understand it guided missile velocity is already at or very close to the maximum it can be this is of course taking into account skills implants and ship bonuses the game physics engine just cant handle it from the blog i read many years ago i think ccp said that missiles behave very strange at very high velocity i understand that you want to use missiles to snipe with however the pain of waiting for that initial volley to land can be uncarebearable this is why i suggest a flight time reduction and not a velocity reductionso to defending my argument about reducing guided missile velocityi agree a little that light missiles are okay however a slight reduction in flight time and i mean slight and a reduction to fitting requirementsheavy missiles they simply project their damage too far when compared to other weapon systems this is why the drake out performs most if not all other ships of its class in the pve environment i fly the drake all the time and reducing heavy missile flight time will hurt me but i accept that its probably required when looking at the pvp aspect any heavy missile using ship far outperforms all other ships of their respective classes due to the fact that they do not require to have to sacrifice tank and gank slots to achieve the same range turrets also must use t2 guns and t2 ammo to achieve similar capabilities where as t1 hmls still perform very wellcruise missiles these are very much the same as hmls however their use in pvp is limited due to the fact that current in game strategies when fighting at extreme range require shock tactics read alpha striking and players being able to see these missiles flying towards them for 30 seconds before they hit gives them more than enough chance to escape or call for repsthe issue isnt the weapon system but current player tactics due to current game mechanics allowing unlimited people to focus fire on a single target even if their los is blocked
target painter bonus on rapier and other mini hullsthe target painter needs to be more effective in what it does especially for these ships as mid slots are at a premiumthe 75 bonus is not huge and target painters are better off on other ships where the mid slots are not at such a primumthough mostly a pilot would fit ecm insteadpainters are further hampered by diminishing returns and thus again not worth stackinga painter increase the sig radius of a ship by 30 un bonused or 4125 bonusedso your 30m2 frigate goes to42m2wow your still not bigger than a destroyerso even 2 and a frigate only goes to 57m2a 10 or even 15 bonus would make them actually worth equipingcurrently the bonus does not increase a gangs dmg on target enough to be worth it
fail matar whine fails
oh please your agenda is blindingly obvioushow many battlecruisers use guided missiles one the drake and as i stated light missiles are fine while cruises are broken so what else would you be talking aboutcombine this with the fact the drake is one of the most whined about ships currently ingame and your agenda couldnt be more obvious if you had a nerf caldari bumper sticker on your foreheadi am aware of the issues ccp ran into trying this however i also know there is currently a theoretical maximum of 11kms on missiles with current fittingship requirements thus missile velocity can likely be increased to at least thiswhy how exactly are light missiles overpowered rangewiseagreed 8 power grid 9 on t2 is absurd for a shipline thats already power grid limitedpve balance is purely coincidental and should be kept apart from pvp balance drake mission performance is irrelevant to this issueapples and oranges missiles have a completely different damage reduction formula to turrets i can alpha quite a few frigates at 70km with my artycane this wouldnt be possible with a draketheres also the slight issue that turrets lack flight timewhen your lasers take 20 seconds to reach their target then you can talk about nerfing long range missile firerecruises it is completely the weapon this is a launcher intended to be used at long ranges which is competing with 3 other weapon systems that do comperable dps with instant damagehaving flight time is an acceptable limitation to cruise missiles  taking 30 seconds to reach their target is not said example is a velocity rigged cerberus with light missiles
as a lowly corp members in nullsec storage is the problemwe need storage space in corp hangers most corps allow members access to 1 shared taball this allows us to do is put cans in there that we name to know who owns what we have to remove them to open themthis limits us to cans that hold 3900 m3 of space at least change it so we can open cans in corp hangers again at possthis would atleast allow access to station containersa private member tab on corp hangers would be great but just been able to open containers in pos corp hangers would solve issues short term
a let alliance members with starbase defence use pos gunsb let alliance members actually access and use assembly arrays and hangarsc let alliance members do something other than me and pe research at a lab copying invention reverse engineering etcd base corp standing for anchoring in hilo sec on ceodirector average rather than the whole corpto be honest the first three have the permission mechanics in place at the moment you just need to actually allow use of a pos hangar when specified in the dropdown menu
it all needs to be remadeawful torturing buggy slow neffective in many ways prevents from cooperation within alliance etcwhy anchor only at moonswhy not everywhere
 increase the capacity of the ammunition assembly array it is useless for building bombs add advanced assembly arrays with no material penalty and no manufacturing time bonus

more free gametime three years and so little has changed still praying for that miracle
some ingame tutorial vids that apear on the large main screen in your cpatains quarters would be a great start and a huge reduction in the amount of reading that needs to be done one of the main turn offs for me when i started was the sheer amount of reading that had to be done when i started in that tiny print of course text is also good as something to refer back to so a compromise woudl be cool
that free implant that is provided to the first character on new accounts created with the eve retail version should be extended to the first character on every new account activation years ago youd start out in a decent frigate with 12 million sp and now you start in a terrible ugly ship with less than 100k sp
bring back character background and base skills developing your character background and skill base doesnt have to be exactly what it once was but it should be more than it is it helps to develop a connection to the character while preventing the need for a great deal of skill training just to get into the game current sp limitations about 54k sp at start leave a new player unprepared for pretty much anything resulting in even the crash course and base tutorials needed skills to be trained just to complete the missions when ive done the tutorials under the new system ive found myself potentially held up for hours waiting for skills to train just to complete my next tutorial mission this leaves new players with nothing to do except chat which most likely causes a loss of interest in playing and a greater interest in chattingi know as it has happened to me with several of my characters i wait for skills to train and plan out my skill training and remaps and end up not playing because my training queue is limited to core skills or charisma skills or just ships and no support skills i dont really consider a character to be ready for eve until they have a chieved more than 10 million spready is dependent on an assorted variety of skills and with 54k sp to start and remapping required to train efficiently that 54k might as well be nothing whats the use of flying a ship with only 2500 sp in gunnery and missiles combined even if you have 7 million split between electronics engineering and mechanics that is insiufficienti remember as a new player my sp went everywhere with little concern for attribute bonuses i wanted to play the game and i trained to do it as fast as possible it was totally inefficient but got me what i wanted in the short run at the time i even had the benefit of having the starting sp from gallente engineer which assisted my game start even more so i was playing right away i refined the training later of course and guess what i soon was at the stage where my training took precedence over my playing because i was not training fast enough to achieve the results i needed even then i was ahead of the game wanting to do more but suffering from a lack of skills to do it with obviously im not talking about metagaming but rather skillbased gaming new ships modules tech ii guns and missiles etc between 20 and 28 million sp i lost interest in playing due to skill training when i start an alt with 54k sp i stop playing right from the start and try to get into it when they have achieved 1014 million sp so far ive not succeeded as i have no real connection to any of those characters and little use for their skills or little interest in using themeve has become a hobby for me but not one i take a great deal of enjoyment in its just something to do between working every day and sleeping at night when did that happen i wonder no idea but it was sometime after i got my old corp situated in wormhole space with the help of my friends at the time all people id met playing eve and not people ive known in real life that first experience of eve was awesome though i remember being a bit bored until that corp started rolling gaining members and actually doing something against uncertain oddsthat doesnt happen anymore theyre still there but their success has nothing to do with me now and even if it did i wouldnt have the interest to log in at some point i became redundant and thats when i lost interest i had no unique skills and even my t3 production science alt was outdone by 2 or 3 other members i had little or no place in pvp as i was mostly indy trained and i was but a ship among ships in wormhole sites even as the ceo i felt they had surpassed me or any real need of me and im sure they felt it tothen i looked again at eve and realized i was just sp grinding
would caution strongly against boosting new characters above 10m sp on go that would just allow for more goon recruit 100 noob swarm tactics sp should be earned make it more user friendly for noobs but not handed to them on a silver plate they have to earn their place if they dont make it then they should play some other game the last thing the game needs is more guns in childrens hands
the concept is good but i am not sure about the executionyes ok from a fleet fight point of view knowing what you have done will eventually actually happen is is good but from a gameplay point of view its still unplayableyou will still experience the same lag same slow down the fights will take just as long if not longer do you really want to see some jittery screen or will it actually be really sloooowwww and if so do you even what that eitherit will kill the game from a gameplay point of view imo do i really want to go into a fleet fight wheres its supposed to be fast action fast pased everything and everyone going mental to something thats dreary slow and cumbersomenosorry i dontyes for now in support that its a temporary measure but i feel ccp will just implement this and it will stay like thisi think personally these are the problems1 badly coded and non performant modules that need looking at2 database queries and transactions need some serious love3 is python the best language to use rather than c i know some changes are happening4 but the biggie for me is are we kidding ourselves thinking that eve one shard universe can actually work isnt this why many other mmos have more than one world you can play one are ccp trying to keep this look we have a single universe game but infact as eve hasnt constantly grown this is just not feasible anymore
thank you for your support
id like to see negative icons effects working just like the targeting brackets you can set the icons vertically and where you want on your screen they would be a bit smaller than target ships and they would display web scramble weapon disrupt etc
sure  just remove the no targeting delay bonus and replace with a covert cloak the only one with both is the sb  a paper thin frigate with weapons that suck against other frigates so leave it that way
you are a  black ops ships have always needed a covert ops cloak i support this thread
say that was true do you think the game would be better if bcs were able to warp cloaked it was a bad idea when it was first proposed all those moons ago and since nothing significant has changed give them better ability to support the troops through specialized ganglinks refitting and ammo hauling 
ccp is scared to death of making a decent t2 battleship their whole we want tech advancement to matter philosophy has all but disappearedgive us a t2 bs that is worth a damn not all of us are wanting to be capital lag generators
no we dont need a cloaking solo pwnmobile
we allready have its called t3s they can even warp trough bubbles aswell something a slow bs cant do ps its realy easy to decloak a battleship in a bubble
ok let me break this down for you on the prenerf black ops recieved when it was released1 shield armor and hull were reduced by 25 from their tier 1 counterpart2 the lock range was reduced by 25 from their tier 1 counterpart3 the power grid was reduced on some of the black ops compared to their tier 1 counterparts which makes for fitting issues4 the base resistances were never given a proper t2 resists like the rest of t2 ships compared to their t1 counterparts5 their base jump range was 15 light years if i remember correctlyi am sure there is a couple other things i have missed but the only thing ccp has addressed to help black ops out was add a fuel bay and increase the base light year range to 20 thats ityes i understand it is a role boat for covert bridging and i am fine with that but the other prenerf stuff compared to their tier 1 counterparts needs to be lifted also have a look at the ship bonuses to help balance them out and make them a bit more useful on the battlefield if the pilot chooses to put it on the front line instead of bridging the sin is an absolute disgrace then they will have a higher survivability and offensive capability like what people wantadding a covert ops cloak as some golden bullet to fix black ops and calling it a day is just plain naiveand yes i do fly black ops i just mainly use my alt with a covert cyno on a recon and use this character to do the bridging

right you do not know what is considering greifing with in the context of this game
thanks cheeky and danikaseems like a tough problem to solve then as many in the thread before have mentionedbut what exactly does the scammer gain besides causing wasted time in manufacturing for the mark im going to assume that the traders will be smart enough not to hit in the asks just to fill the suspiciously toogoodtobetrue order
fairly simplesome guy with margin trading ivv and piles of isk buys up all the garbage on jita sells creates a buy order for 500k each sets a minimum quantity orders of magnitude beyond what anyone would actually have creates an item exchange contract for a ridiculous amount beyond the market value of the item and empties the remainder of his wallet to an alt they then spam the item in jita local for hours until somebody gullible enough to fall for it buys it up after seeing the ridiculous buy orderyou walk out with 1 billion isk minus whatever the useless items cost you on sell orders the other poor fool walks out with well garbageim sorry but if youre dumb enough to believe that someone is buying up useless items for a price that is way beyond what is shown on the market history i hope the scammer puts your isk to better usethe skill is used for legitimate purposes moreso than not while its a bit sketchy to use what is a trusted game mechanic like the market to scam its allowed forcing characters into a negative balance would be akin to creating isk out of thin air even if you couldnt biomass after going into a negative wallet balance accounts can easily be disposed of plex is amazingly cheap
there are a couple alternative suggestions here that i think could use being put forth as fixes instead of pursuing a removalbeing as ccp has been easing things for newer players this removal might happen if an alternative isnt found as such perhaps the market folks might put up a working fix vs such a suggestion as this and see if it can be pushed through insteadseriously  no no no that didnt save a few things weve seen and this is exploiting a game mechanic it might just get fixed in the easy way  removal  and some of you point out it is important to how you do business
thank you andskiokay im off then fence now and very against this proposal if people are dumb enough to fall for toogoodtobetrue orders then they deserve to lose their isk im a trader and very against removing this legitimate skill
im honestly only against it as i like graphs and i dislike when people mess with my graphs i do think the best solution would be a mark to show that an order cannot be fulfilledthis way at least the scammer has some element of riskalso less jita local spamm is also a win
in principle i agree with you the principle of making it harder to use as a scam and i even like the idea of marking the order as nonfillable but in practice i think that would be very technically difficult to implement it would add a lot more lookups to check for fillability at each refresh of the market data which would burden the system not to mention it would flucutuate with the wallet of a usersomewhere else somebody suggested having multiple wallets for users that would be a start then we can have the margin account which must be filled with a buffer of isk if that buffer goes below a certain level you would need to fill it up else your top order will get autocancelled successively to replenish it up to min levelsthis should make it close it how it works in real life but you still have the issue of not enough isk on fill of the order if we are not going to allow  isk amounts because of other reasons that people stated then along with the existing fine why not make a standings penalty hit with the station corp make sense as you are losing credit with the station market you recall that the broker rates depend on the standing with the corp do it enough and it will penalize the scammerdoesnt help your graphs though sorry 
up
my proposal was earlier on in this thread  can you read that and let me know if you see any potential problems with it about 20 posts up same page 4
kind of only those who are towards the top end of sp invested in the skills will take a hit in their income those coming up will find they have far more options than before those options are available sooner and they pay out betterif you can access l4 agents for a corporation all their l4 mission agents are available for use same with l5 agents and youll make as much lp as anyone else doing those missions for those agentsas such it should help more players make more lp than before but some will take a hit this more getting should far exceed the number losing and that should prevent an escalation in the value of the lp all told its a mixed bag as usual some get smacked some get helped and in the future few will remember that it was any different just like learning skills and those who lost at the all 5s that was a hit too but you dont see it discussed much
apparently all the agents will be set to 20 qualitynegotiation is still in game but it is not sure if it do anything it dont work for rd agents and it is fairly hard to check if it do something for other agents as there are too many possible changes in mission payout between tranquility and sisiso lp payout will be reduce for the people that had trained the special connection skills to a high level and it will be increased for the players that hadnt trained thema nerf to top income a increase to minimum income
i dont see where you draw that conclusion from if youre running with a q20 agent like 99 of players your lp rewards are getting nerfed end of story even if you only trained 1 relevant connection skill to lvl1 youre still making less lp as said this is less of an issue for lower level missions as their pay is principally in bountiesloot its really only significant for lvl5 fw lvl4 and pirate lvl4 runners and thats what i see as the real problem it substantially reduces overall pay for these higher risk activities while barely scratching the low risk high sec missioners
true rothgar the only guy that will get more lp than before is the one that hasnt trained the connection skill and hadnt get a enough standing with the agent to get an increase in his true quality on the other hand that is the situation of almost all the guys new to level 4 just to confirm it negotiation dont affect the rd payouts
around low and 00 and pretty much all systems where deadand this was as peak timewhy because being in a system is boring as hell especially in the middle of nowhere why live thereso what are the csm or ccp proposing to bring life into these systems like colonising or something i think there needs to be real interactivity in eve it just doesnt feel aliveand yes im sure people will saywell in space its dead well firstly this isnt real life its a game and new eden is supposed to be a colonised universe its supposed to be full of lifesurely we can bring more random races npc nebulas npc ships flyingtravelling through space rather than around a belt or gate etc etcplease bring life to eve
ever sat at a gate camp for several hours only to kill a shuttle if you cant find anyone it is because you didnt go to where the people are the people are in the space worth holding the rest of it is just junk filler space that no one wantswould it be nice to see stuff flying around yes is that the problem no the problem is that most of low sec and much of null sec is worthless space why isnt anyone in those systems because there is no reason to be in those systems
stealth eve is dying thread
eve is boring because the majority of eve players and the creators of eve are boring and nerdy  its a simple fact but true
are you not proving his point therekind of
what regions did you go for chances are those were the problem
lonetrekblack riseessencesyndicateouter ringother than outer the others are not known dead regions
and how big was your blob and how many falcons did you have in tow
lol seriously it was only a few of uslike 4 canes no ewar no logi
retooling the jb system isnt that bad i mean ships w jump drives is long over due and now you have to use a gate to get to the next bridge it makes roaming more fun since people wont be traveling from pnqy to 6vdt w only 1 standard gate jump i mean its a 10 jump route so you can see the issue plus test wore out the bridges so i can see your ire
this pretty much sums up any other reply i could think up
honestly with the anom change theres less isk in most of null with the bridge change it will be harder to move minerals in for these large construction projects the proliferation should naturally decrease simply from those changes a couple alliances in the west are going to be rolling in supers more than they already are because those changes didnt effect them much but for the most part there will be fewer supers wonder if there is a freighter haulerescort bot if there isnt already i expect there will be one soon
sc numbers have grown 150200 per month the past year it may slow down a little dues to logistics concerns but it will be a drop in the buckethell last i heard some people didnt even bother with minerals at all but bought carriers and reprocced on site for easy materials  that little trick wont change so all that will happen a slight price increase to where they were prior to dominion 1517b

naval and land warfare has used mine fields to deny access to certain territory and help in the defence of an area if i recall correctly a mine does actually exist in the game in one of the missions dont ask me what mission it was a good while back so how about the introduction of a player usable mine give it a detection radius of 2500m  3000m with the damage of a bomb and can be anchored in place like a secure container usable only in null sec just like bombs unless they can be used lowsec as well as for proposed detection mechanics could use a leaf out on how pos guns work with enemy detectionideas or suggestions on this
there used to be mines in eve before i started playingbut they where deactivated by ccp you can still find some minesbpos on contracts some times but they are not usablethe main reason why they where removed was lag too much mines on gates cause massive lagg and what happens if your mine kills someone while you are in high sec i heard that you got concorded when that happenedi dont think we will get mines again
ah fair enough i was unaware of them having been a player item before also as i mentioned would keep it as a low and nullsec device like bombs are
they used to exist apparently but theres two issuesapparently aoe damage is vile for server health and any decent mine field would lag the hell out of the grid on load making it even worse part of why its an exploit to drop 50 gscs around a warp bubble to stop cloaking
currently there is a way to invent augmented drones using elite drone ai i propose to put in a new item something that can be attained like an elite drone ai that allows an inventor to invent a pirate ship for instance gila is a combination of caldari and gallente technology adapted by guristas for invention use a caldari cruiser blueprint such as moa and a gallente cruiser blueprint such as vexor plus the elite rabbit aianother example would be rattlesnake combine scorpion bp with dominix bp plus more of the elite rabbit aithe only question is where do you obtain the elite rabbit ai and how rare is it should it beperhaps these drop in certain anomalies or appear as loot in some pirate faction missions
should we have invention for every faction mod too not supported
show us on the doll where the evil missioner carebeartype person grinding pirate faction missions touched you inappropriatelyedit yah im doing the meme wrong but why screw with the profit of other people when the stuff already drops  is obtainable through lp
 and to make an officer module just need to sprinkle some dna on the module bpo and poof
i saw the advert for the quafe thing at the login screen for the game and it got me thinking if the character in the advert can wear a quafe shirt why cant there be ones for the other ones like fed navy or spacelane patrol my idea is that tshirts or jackets that can be worn by your character can be purchased in the lp store for a certain amount of lp points that way you wont have to do a microtransaction with real money for the shirt just your time and toil with missioning and getting lp pointsas for what purpose this will serve maybe you just got 100 with roden and want to show the universe that you have carebear pride maybe youre roleplaying a caldari character that is one of those megacorporation types and wants to show where your loyalty is or maybe you just think one of corp logos look cool the shirts would be a purely vanity and aesthetic item and have no impact into giving the wearer an extra step above if this gets implemented perhaps a way to put player corp and alliance logos on tshirts for your character could happen but putting this in for the npc corps seems easierbeing a vanity option if ccp have other priorities as far as rebalancing the game go id prefer those ideas be kept at top priority but this sounds like a cool idea to put in once all the big stuff has been taken care of
i petitioned your name because it is offensive to have a gallente named fdr in eve
i couldnt get a caldari to look like fdr pthats what you mean right 
something like that
yes but can you move ships in your blockade runner no there isnt enough room then what is missing is a ship setup that can move at least 2 packaged ships with reasonable chance of gank proof in emp space make that available and i dont see the current situation as a problembut i do still support the destruct cargo holdi dont think that an orca should be the only one to have not stealable cargo
i like this idea this could prevent hot pink space craft which is my biggest fear when ship painting is discussed i cant forget everquests armor temper hot pink warriors fighting dragons definately took the game back a few pacesthis skin idea could be the ticket the editor could check to make sure the main colors of the craft could be screened that way i could have pink or yellow on my ship but the main color would have to be something more metalicthe skinpaint editor could have preset colors for the main ship then more colors for decalsdecorations anyway i like the idea of changing the look a bit
because i forgot to agree with my own idea doh
 the haters i want a neon pink rifter
sorry but i dont suport this
i support this and hope to hear fcs call primary on the pink one some day p
i dont surport this it will add my lag to the game
like the idea of decals could add corp emblems or like suggested nose art but the dreaded pink or the color palette threw up on the characters armor from eq did suck
confirming bots did not exist before plexseriousyou need to understand two things first that plex was an idea to make it possible for the hardcore to feed resource to the casual so that the causal would not go outside the game to purchase resourceisk second every game i have been in has had some level of rmt activity even dead games like aoc policing efforts only go so far so i agree with the previous poster ccp need to change game mechanics so that the bot become drasticly vulnerable or unable to adapt to changing enviroment allowing botting will absolutely murder the game in every shape
while i dont approve of botting rather i am in favour of making automated mining part of the gameplay i still havent heard any real substantial arguments on why they really are bad for the game apart from the obvious one that its sad for the people putting their time into miningbut then again why would a sensible human being put their time into mining its not fun
interesting idea make it based on the least expensive regional averageand yeah i thought that people would want the forge but remember its prime realestate and the regional mayor is free to set tax rates as they see fit they might decide to increase taxes in the region for many kinds of reasons one reason might be because the cost of making changes would demand a premiumor that the average amount of commerce could invite more incursions but thats going outside the scope im aiming for
sounds awesome especially the fact that it would allow us to set rediculous tax rates to get all those carebears out of highsec p
well one can dream anywaylets face it eve is dying and this is just more proof
this want mooorrre
it would be nice to be able to hit sleepers with a dread when doing a capital escalation
playing the 001 isk game is a symptom of a poor playing style so dont do it is perfectly possible to trade in the way you suggest and make isk i rarely modify my orders and make billion
what do you suppose would be the result of changing concord intervention to being chance based depending on the sec status of the systemfor instance in a 10 system there would be a 100 chance that concord would intervene as it normally does for any criminal act but as you go down there would be a lower chance 90 in a 09 80 in a 08 an so forth strait down to a 10 chance they would show up in a 01 sec systemany individual action that currently causes a concord response would have its own chance unless there was a concord ship currently on the same grid as the violator in which case there would be a 100 chance of responsethere could be a way for a fc to hide the actions of his fleetmembers so that larger gangs would not always attract a responsei would say that the shipsguns at stations and gates would stay as they are so that there would still be limited mobility for those with low personal security statusin addition to that you could train skills to increasedecrease the chance of getting a concord response andor use deployable items like distress beacons that could be targeted by a pirate but if they activate they have a chance of calling for help alternatively a pirate could deploy a dampening fields that would help hide criminal actionsjust pontificating and figured i would see what others had to add to the idea believe me i know how much this would change things for those who rely on the current highlow sec divide
my god youre serious arent you you should look up human nature in the dictionary sometime mateif youre truly that naiive about why people do things then i dont know if i should salute you for your optimism or pity you for the abysmal ing you will receive at the hands of the titan known as life oh and fixed it for you

the drake uses guided missiles because assault missiles are netirely useless and see no benefit from skills like guided missile precision or like implants the reason its the only one is becauste the rest of them only have two launchers at most and a more effective use of high slots is to drop in neuts rather than fit an unbonused launcher thats applying dps that is less effective than a nos
i completely disagree pve and pvp balance should always be considered for all ships and weapon systems i agree that no ship or weapon should be relegated to only be useful for pve or maybe even just pvpif missile velocity is capable of reaching 11kms why is it still sub 6kms i agree that cruise missiles need this buff but light and heavy are probably fast enough already however i am going to stick by my guns on the flight time reduction of all guided missiles some more than others heavy and cruise over lightthe sml needs a rethink fitting requirement wise and the whole t1 frigate line up needs a complete rethink and rebalance the tier system is terribad and hits frigates the most
better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubtconsidered and kept separate meaning no nerfsboost to a ships performance in pve because its too good at pvp and vice versabtw any overpoweredness perceived or real of the drake in pvp and pve can be addressed by calling for a nerf to all tier 2 bcs
t2 frigs already obsolete a lot of tech1 hulls like cruisers tech1 frigs are just crap for 2 days noobsthe next step with 4th t2 bonus and t3 frigs will make it even worsthacs and all t2 cruiser lineup need some love some extra pgcpucap recharge med and low slots base speed increase drone bay and bandwich increased specific bonus reviewbattleships need a lot of loveonly a few of them are viable hi pirate bss tiers system is screwed marauders need titanic love medlow slots sensor strength 5th weapon hard point tractor bonus changed to something useful drone bay pgcapcpu such skill intensive ship shouldnt be the shadow of any pirate bs with production costs insane compared with pirate stuffmining barge mackinaw needs some real tankcap and some cargo extra 2k imho right now its just an expensive mining barge that can be easily ganked by any t1 destroyer small gang should be little harder than thathulk would be interesting to fit 5 sentry drones hello some belt rats are bss and some are really nastyboth need love to warp capabilities give those low secnull belts some life by improving mining barges without making them un catchable stuff
not to mention the fact that if pvp ships were nerfed based on pve ability youd break an entire race or twothats why its a monumentally stupid idea not to keep them seperate because like many imbalances in this game ccp havent got round to fixing it yet judging by your remarks on guided missile precision ill assume youre talking about hams being useless hereas such ahahahahahahahahahaha yeah sorry but you just lost all credibility and should stay out of missile debates this tbhthat post pretty much beat me to it on the points i was going to make

fix is not the right word i think rebalance is better and fines isnt the way to achieve this not the least of reasons being the difficulty in determining what a gank is vs a regular aggrojust add a mechanic that would either make it less attractive for gankers to take out a hauler which also costs the hauler some utility in order to improve such mechanic or a mechanic which gives haulers more of a fighting chance subject to skill again or a incentive for there to be more haulers so that haulers get safety in numberspenalizing the gankers directly is not going work
why dont we discuss the topic of the stupidity of multibillion isk ships without locks on them frankly i have recently become less involved in wormhole space every new corporation you go to seems to have a theft problem and things coming up missing then they start blaming everyone in a revenge quest no legitimate spacefaring corporation with assets to protect would allow a starship to be boarded without access controls hell even the starship reliant had a console security code ok wow it makes it neat that people can steal items but it certainly doesnt make the game more playable if anything starships should have locks on them and if you want theft playability then have the hacking skill allow a small increasing with skill level chance to break the access code

supporting this ccp should start at least showing some degree of working toward excellence instead of the crap that theyre doing now
was thinking more like 5600k sp to start off not quite what we used to get and definitely without the racial attribute adjustments we had before but still something to give a good base for getting into the game
hey now wed definitely love to get every newbie into a t2 fit maelstrom on day one
the kind of player you describe will not even loose time trying to play eve those who try earn their sp just like you by filling the skills quemost of those who could get some interest by disposing of something attractive since their beginning in the game loose it fast thanks to guys like youthe last thing eve and devs need is adopt your point of view witch is masochist and extreme in all terms of game conceptgiving noobs better shipsskills for starting some ways to earn more isk is attractive instead of handed
i want interface players made add ons right nao cmon ccp dont be afraid it will only hurt the first time like many things in real life

hmmm i will support the following change lighting a cyno cancels self destruct but im a huge fan of using collapsed cynos to explore a solar system and would be a sadpanda if such a mechanic disappearededitits a lot of fun to appear in the middle of the sun and be ejected out at some insane velocity dont take that simple pleasure away from me
zupported ya 
i dont know how drones stack up vs other weapons systems that such would be seen as op  thats a ccp call but the idea id like to see it
 main char gallente 15m sp cross trained matar tried a lot of stuff and its just crap i just use it for missions and get bored fast  tenguhulk pilot 11m sp now training industrial stuff caldari ships have their issues missiles have their issues but some how i manage to have tons more fun and almost none of the fittingdps issues i have with my gallente char missiles are not op but hybrids really suck and blasterssuck is just the first namealso if i really want to blast missions all i need is a cnr sure hell outperform the navy mega all day long in any case
whats the use in high dmg short range blasters when the ships fitting them have serious isues getting in combat range fast enough to actually use the turret weapons
supporting for my own reasons
thank you for your support
i propose that when an alliance has sovereignty over a certain 00 solar system that the alliance would be able to rename said solar system there would need to be a profanity filter or some sort of approval system and the solar system could revert to having a letternumber designation upon loss of sovereignty up to the playersi think that it would add a bit of dimension as opposed to having alphanumeric codes for all the systems it would really be awesome if you had just achieved your sov 5 somewhere and were able to rename that something cool having owned it for so longthis is a thread i have posted in the past and i would like to hear some more player input please and thanks
name it jita for extra courier scamming and noob farming
 do something to make them good thats not even an opinion or a you say that cuz you cant use it well no im pretty sure the fact there are more titans then bops pretty much says that there is something seriously wrong with bops
you sir are a fool quoting myself from the other bops thread giving covert ops cloak would do almost nothing in the way of fixing bops they need bigger jump range and more fuel allowance thats is all 
people already hate falcon altsand now you want the black opses to have a cov cloakthose falcon alts will turn into widow alts and i would love to show up in my widow with its 14 points of jam strength and ruin your day
they should get the cov op cloak and a buff to fitting and either gank or tank
sin needs fitting help the rest are fine as they are my current redeemer fit has 92kehp and does 950dps not ohbaring in mind that these are not meant to be front line battleships but support ships for recon and bomber fleets i would say they are fine as they are fix blackops by increasing jumprange and fuelbay that is all covertops cloaking device will do little  nothing in the way of balancing them
from devs answer your every question answers yes drone assembly arrays need to be bigger  have you ever tried to put in a 30 day run of a t2 original medium drone  not enough roomalso component assembly arrays  you have to micro manage them if you are building cap ship components
you have a good point on the component assembly array but your reason for th drone asembly array is a bad one if you have a t2 bpo get used to shorter runs like all those who have to run inventions to build t2 drones
cant you build your drones in a station
fairly certain not every single player in the game has access to standard station services
invalid argument  nearly every bulk producer likely to hit to the 30day limit is based in empire space and has access to hundreds of slots within a 5jump radiusthat said i dont think this alone is a good enough reason to buff arrays component arrays are an interesting case  theyre already nearly as efficient as chas for storage i think a better solution would be a component array with 20x the capacity 5x the slots or a bonus to build time for capital components and 10x the fitting requirements or something along those lines
both your trolling helps keeping this thread and my revision proposal bumped and if u can keep repeating what each other said for long enough then this thread will reach 500 so plz continue
so the only upper limit to price is the price of creating a new corp to wardec withthat will sooooo fix thingsto avoid cooldown just wardec with new corp before the war created with old corp expires
does ccp even know what they want to do with null  because they have nerfed two things recently and then they are saying after they have done this then they are going to look at what there doing with null this makes no sense at all and then they also said that they want the industry in null sec to be able to keep up with the population how are we supposed to do that when they nerf jump bridges in which is vital to our logistics for industry they really dont seem to know what they are doing and say they want more people wanting to play in null where as they are making it less worth while being in null sec its starting to get to the point that you can make more isk running level 4 missions rather then null sec ratting and then there removing our logistics capabilities aswell  and all this before they actually look at what they want to do with null csm please get ccp to look at what they are doing with this game and how they are seriously affecting those in null in which ccp say that they wish to help with updates fix things that dont work dont break things that do
theres just so much idiocy and whining in this thread it makes me cringe its so easy to avoid getting scammed in eve ifyou can readyou dont interact with the market while youre drunkhighvery tiredyou apply the basic amount of scepticism required to play eveas for some of the stupid solutions offered in this thread this post pretty much sums it uphowever there is a problem with margin trading and an easy fix if you have an order for 100 items up and only have enough cash for 50 items then if someone dumps more than 50 items on your order those 50 items should actually be bought and the order should be taken off the market after that reason if youre a legitimate trader you want to fill as much of your buy orders as possible
its called a planck generator and they have them in game now
this is relevant to my interests
that not for chars bt for corporation to simply 7 wallets ans hnagar sections not inaf there culd be good tingthat you can add your own divisions for corp wallets and hangars
wat
as multi role corporation wie have difrent projects and difrent finaces for them now its big mess and need use eve alts to hold that meny seperated
ahhhh the ancient language of hibberjiberish lucky for you guys im an expert at translating ittranslation not for characters but for a corporation 7 wallets and hanger sections are not enough it would be a good thing if you can add more divisions to your corp wallet and hangerstranslation as a multi role corporation we have different projects and different finances for them currently its a big mess and we have to use alts to keep the money separatedow and i support this
totally a good idea and perhaps a way to designate a certain  of income to be distributed to each divisionfor example each time i complete a mission i receive x isk i want 25 to go to my casual expenses division 25 to my savings division and 50 to my strontium funds
thanks for the translations warzon3as a character i too have different projects with different funding i have a pi thing in which i want 100 of the proceeds to go for plex at the end of the month i have wh ops in which i which the funds seperate of general income i want my own wallet divisions and it isnt too hard to dohell id love to have multiple hangers also currently you can kinda do this with station containers but its not the same and very clunky to work withmultiple wallet divisions for corporations have help a lot now its time to think about characters
why stop there add the ability for multiple characters to share the same wallet add that and ill give this idea a thumbs up
suported it should be same with hangar too i mena we should have division in hangar instead of being forced to use container to put order in our stuff
no the idea of eve is that you need to know exactly where you are warping need 100 singal on it to warp there you have to actually been there before bm habe someone bee there warp to fleet memebr or it has to be other object that game put there anomaly if you allow people to just warp anywhere they want whats to stop them from warping 100000au from sun
have the pilot loose a level in his highest sp skill when the supercap is destroyedthat is all
how would that make a difference please dont post if you arent going to put a minute in actually defending your proposali fail to see this would actually nerf scs though they would need to die for this to be effective which they dont not often at least you would still have people like pl that will still continue to stomp people so yeah this idea makes no sense 
clearly the more appropriate course of action would be to award sp to a super capital pilot when hisher ship blows upseriously though yeah making a group of already incredibly resilient ships have an splossondeath drawback is only going to discourage brazen use of them and force players to use even more conservative strategies and fittings read just bring more and spider tank harder
supported despite not being a nerf directly if t3 pilots lose sp why not supercaps

as far as i have noticed there are new social skills buyable from lp store like security connectons which gives you 10 more lp payout per level i am surprised that you have missed itof course i am still talking about sisi
i saw those too they are new additions that didnt exist when the previous posts were made so our previous speculation that they were nerfing lp payout turned out to be premature the new lp skills give a 10 bonus per lvl and only one is relevant per agent class the new skills are rank 2 old were rank 1 and are for sale in the appropriate lp stores the price is slightly higher than the old lp skills though not doubled as you would expectso with this new information it looks like an across the board buff to missioners all those crap quality agents are now just as good as the others and it certainly opens up new areas as potential mission hubs this will likely turn into a lvl5 lp buff as well since on tq all agents are q12 and on sisi they are allegedly q20 now it also reduced standing requirements for all agents they are now set at q20 standings requirements i believe
personally i just think there are enough players in eve who would like more small gang pvp such that if ccp just 1 let us know where plexes are being taken and 2removed the rats enough of that crowd would join fw and we would have constant combat i do realize that the number of people who claim they want good fights is much higher than the number of people who actually do want good fights however even if we figure that of the 35000 that are on average online at any given time there are 2000 indeed looking for good quality small gang pvp i think at least 10 or 200 would see that fw gives you notifications of others looking for good pvp fights within a few jumps so fw would end up with roughly 50 people per faction who are looking for pvp in these plexes now you only need 8 people to basically cover each front that means that even with these very low estimates there would be allot of good pvp fw that you cant find anywhere else in eve once people started having some fun with this the numbers would grow they would not only grow in the current community but more importantly eve would keep many of the people who got tired of waiting for blobs to form andor spending their whole time warping around looking for fights since ccp never really set up a mechanic that promoted small gang pvp i do not think there is any telling how popular this would end up being its really an untapped population since eve as it exists now involves so much down time no one in their right mind would stick with the game if they play it for pvp and only have short amounts of time each day to commit to computer games i really think if ccp did those 2 changes they would have 600000 subscribers in 3 years they would have to add the pirate factions and maybe even other factions because fw would be so popular
as i said somewhere in that terrible terrible blog comment thread we were told about the changes before the blog went up some folks on the csm were in favor some were opposed we did get some changes made mostly in the timing of when it would go live and the expanded fuel baycontrary to some popular belief we dont get veto power over what ccp wants to do we do give them our opinions and sometimes they listen and sometimes they disagreepersonally i think this change was a good thing people whining about not being able to move around 00 in perfect safety makes me
define dead please the systems were totally empty beside your gangthere was no one in the easy to reach spots beltsgatesthere was no one that you could probeseeing that lol seriously it was only a few of uslike 4 canes no ewar no logi i bet it is the last one as you had no prober so dead mean there was no one so distracted to be a easy target and no one was interested in coming out and hunting for us
because nobody just roams around low or null sec aimlessly unless they want to die or hunt everyone is in stations and high worth assets are in guarded locations deep in alliance territories if you want activity emp trade hubs are about the only place youll find it i dont see a problem with this
dead as in no one in there yes maybe some had like 12 people in max the simple fact eve is dead and boring outside the hubs simple fact
declaring something a simple fact does not automatically make it true especially when its false
there are a lot of low sec systems empty for hoursdaysthe reasons may be different for someone to not go there but when i see ice belts with rare ice in valuable ores and no one mining even with a cruiserso are those valuable oresice really not attractiveor is just because in those systems the moon goo is the worst
with mineral compression the requirements for a sc fit in a single freighter for a titan you need 3 freighters so once in a while you just titan bridge a couple of freighters in other words will do nothing to stop supercap proliferation
it be cool if all the ships in the game had some sort of ventts thing built into it when your talking a small light would light up that persons ship a api controlled featurefc could browse your fit just before an opi could see this as being useful
what do you mean the eve voice thingfc could also ask nicely unless you want it to be dead easy to tell if random moron 4645 you just pulled into fleet has anything on his ship worth stealing
just because something is good for a particular player doesnt mean its good for the game  if a dev spawned a trillion isk into your wallet or a sabre bpo into your personal hangar or mine would you say that was good for the game as a whole toothat isnt a good thing because one of the pillars that eve is based on is meaningful combat where losses have value and consequences attached unlike other mmos where the material cost of getting killed is essentially zero and so pvp only matters for bragging right purposes if i get my battleshiphactitanwhatever blown up and my response is lol whatever because macrominers have crushed the mineral market to the position where ship loss has become meaningless where has that aspect of the game gonethat was one reason for the insurance nerf a little while ago  t1 ships had become more or less free because mineral prices had crashed so far that the hull costs were at the same level as the insurance payoutsas above any pvp entity engaged in combat suffers from bot miners because the crashed mineral market dilutes the value and meaning of a kill if i kill some wardec target who has lost battleship after battleship without a care in the world because bot mining has flattened the market and cushioned the blow why even bother youre right to say that one reason why people bot mine is that mining is mindnumbingly terrible and no human being in their right mind should want to do it but the solution to that is to make mining interesting not sanction those who cheat
is this the only information we are gonna get about the meeting i can not find another post about it
in the discussion surrounding the recent announcement of changes to jump bridges it was mentioned that there were significant differences of opinion within the csm on the desirability of these changes and in terms of the way they approached the issue with some being strongly in favour others taking a hard line against and still others being opposed but taking a softer stance and trying to negotiate a compromise solution since the csm discussed these changes with ccp on private forums rather than in documented meetings the general playerbase cant see which approach and position was adopted by individual csms although this information would probably be of interest to at least some of their voters to remedy this i requestsuggest that the individual csm members who participated in those discussions briefly express their position on the change in this thread or on some more highprofile platform
i wont devote hours to looking through that terrible thread but i am pretty sure most of the csm posted with our personal opinions in theremy view on things like this is that it is up to each csm member to decide to make their positions known if someone doesnt speak up you should take that into consideration when voting next time

big stuff tends to be able to crap on small stuff a bit too easily in serious fights this issue extends from supers to frigates a small sig and speed just isnt that much in the way of protection for the following reasons larger ships have larger range so tracking doesnt matter much when they spread out how about changing the angular velocity portion of the turret equation to perpendicular velocity a good tracking situation can compensate for a bad sig radius ratio or vice versa  neuts drone bay flexibility little to no costconsequence for bringing a wing of lights on many shipsthe limitations on concurrent bomb usage greatly limits the effectiveness of bombers against t2t3capital targets those ships already have much higher health for their sig radius and thats enough of an advantage for them against bombswith the jumpbridge changes capitals are going to become considerably more mobile compared to sub caps and iirc in the dialog from late last year where grayscale was talking to the old csm about bridges and such it was noted that capital mobility was also an issue shouldnt these things be addressed at the same timegood luck with your push to get constant balance iteration ccp is way behind the times and their competition on this matter its high time this happened were rooting for you
all ships should be balanced for pvp and pve should recieve the benefits of advanced ai and be brought up to spec for pvp that makes pve content better and insures that all ships are equally effective in both arenaswhile i agree that missiles should travel faster reducing timetoimpact i think your perspective is a little skewed it takes a little more work than simply adjusting the velocity and flight time as changing velocity will change missiles usefulness in pvp specifically at 11 kms they will catch even interceptors with mwds travelling at 5000 ms or better while that vessel is seeing a 500 sig radius penalty and quite likely being target painted after that the only thing to reduce dps is explosion velocity i would assume changing this also means that the physics engine would have to be adjusted to account for the additional velocity somehow the same as onboard targeting systems or guided missile control systems would have to be adjusted to account for higher velocity missiles and reduced flight times and fuel obviously their is some leeway here given the dynamic nature of skill implant and other effects on missile velocity and flight times but the faster it travels the faster the physics engine has to calculate adjustments to speed and directionlets talk torpedos explosion radius on a torpedo is 450 m min with rage torpedos being around 650 m a megathron has a sig radius of 485 m while a typhoon has a sig radius of 320 m highest and lowest of the armor tankers respectively armor tankers dont have their sig radius increased by any means outside of fitting an mwd which means that outside of skill use or implants intended to reduce a missiles explosion radius battleship class assault missiles are suffering from the inability to apply fully dps against half the available battleships in that fashion coincidentally the signature radius effect reducing skill and implants only affect guided missiles and have no effect in this case meaning that torpedo dps is significantly reduced against most battleships unless theyre shield tanked with extenders or using mwds now lets look at explosion velocity 61 ms for rage and 71 ms for all others the slowest battleships are the rokh 500 m 89ms and the abaddon 470m 89ms this means that torpedos are ineffective against even their own class of vessel and of more practical use against something larger ironically they are generally most effective against caldari ships which tend to see increased sig radius as a result of shield extenders though plate might slow down an armor tanked vessel enough to remove the effect of the lower explosion velocity on otherscough bs cough
have you tried training skills past zero

rather than saying no self destructs how about the obvious one of leave the beacon visible even after the ship is destroyedpersonally i ask in local to be blown up people always think its a trap but i hate being stuck in a frigate for 10 minutes
you can always initiate self destruct after you light the cyno
i support this proposal it would have to be reviewed by some sort of filter or something but it would be nice to see some named 00 sec systems instead of those wierd names that have no real meaningsupport
the existing names have plenty of meaning to the people whove fought over the systems not supported itd only complicate matters
so long as its like stations where the original name is still there
supported conditionally1 the static catalog number should always remain with the renamed version appended to the end after a semicolon such as 74ytj rattingville2a the renamed version must not match the static name of any other solar system or at least not match the static name of any solar system held by npcs2b the renamed version must have one capital letter at the start of each word all other letters must be lowercase only one space inbetween words letters and numerals only and no leading or trailing spaces this is to avoid similarity loopholes with 2a above
this gets brought up a lotthe problem is you the have to have some gm sit and babysit people naming systems or youre going to end up hearing the following on commsok well fly through crusty vagina hot drop into my left tit and then kick their asses out of poopsackleaving the system naming to ccp outpost names are bad enough as it is
problem would be the same as allowing full choice in ship colour schemestime to pns would be zero
not supported
no absolutely not never going to support thisjust looking at naming conventions for alliance built stations and pos should be enough to prove that this is a dumb idea
sounds awesome i am supporting it jump into poopsock system

standings requirements for agents disappear if its high enoughso you have no idea if the corpagent standing is enough in case your faction standings take a derived hit yes i know you can work it out or look it up
faction standings gainloss needs to be balanced currently this system results in a general loss of standings with npc factions across the board and no gain of npc standings except with one or two factions by completing cosmos storyline and data center missions which also result in harsh penalties to other npc factions id call it 90 loss to 10 gain for npc faction standings personally i think this is rediculous and see no reason why a player should suffer enemy of state standings with 1 or 2 factions not including pirate or npc variant factions to have relatively good standings with another losing the ability to enter various security levels of enemy faction space as their standings decrease diplomacy skill or notthis should be changed in favor of increasing faction standings gain without also losing npc faction standing elsewhere in some missions increasing the opportunities for npc standings gain by awarding it in all missions and decreasing the loss of npc standings in general the current system is a deterrent to mission running
read the whole thread but all that has to be said was already said on page 1as for the topics that keep coming up it seems that everyone agrees that the dramiel is op and then tries to come up with reasons why it shouldnt be brought in line with everything elsebalancing by costwould be ok with me if the price goes up significantlyyou can kill poorly fittedpiloted dramielsi find it silly to balance ships based on the lowest common denominator the problem is that you cant kill the good pilots with other frigates which would simply avoid your scramwebab afs if they want to and murder everything else a single ship shouldnt be the best af and the best inty in the gamedont nerf it boost other frigatesnerfs are not a bad thing they are a good thing things will never be perfectly balanced and when something gets too strong or too weak it needs to be adjusted ideally one would have an equal amount of boosts and nerfs trying to boost every other ship in the game to compensate for one of them being oped is in my opinion very silly you then end up with power creep and creating more imbalances in the process since you cant do it perfectly do the other faction need a boost maybe but first it is important to bring the dramiel and line and see if the other frigates become more viable

i might actually be worried about that aside from the overwhelming notsupport youve recieved the general crappiness of your proposal and that i wouldnt care if it did as i said previously pink megathrons garner more support im not concernedthat and i finally gave in to temptation and looked up your killboard deaths and gained the very unprofound understanding of why you hate pirates so much near as i can tell you attempted repeatedly ratting in very bad places with very bad fits among my favorites were a stealth bomber fitted with warp stabs and a megathron with a large repper but no resistances there were others and everyone gets a couple newbie deaths but seriously you really cant go blaming the pirates for your mistakes its part of the game that or you can build up an irrational hate of pirates fly into a state of permanent rage and take up the hobby of suiciding mining ships with battleshipslol as you seem to have done
lots of little problems with it and without massive reworking of many game mechanics very easy to bypassi put 1 trit on the market for 1 billion isk my alt buys it i use contracts so on and so forthif you try and prevent this then you block general buying and selling being as the buyers sellers and contract types would then have to specify who can and cannot accept their orders  by sec status talk about overly complicating the market and contracts systemsif you did do all this reworking  now i make a bunch of trial accounts use disposable alts or what not then trade with the new char and get my 10 his sec status back without spending large chunks of time rattinglets not make things easier for those who do get their sec status trashed via some transfer mechanism so they can buy their way out of trashed sec status
since you are thrilled to have so many replies ill add mineits a bad idea addressing a problem that doesnt exist and the solutions to address it are onerus to the programmers and easy to circumventin short no matter how many essays you write debating the finer points your best case scenario is to end up with a turd wrapped in shiny paper if presenting this idea could teach you one lesson it should be that when its been proven to you beyond reasonable doubt that it is a poor idea you should drop it and move on
1 and how long ago did these deaths happen because unlike me uve never set foot outside high sec for a long time looks like ure the one who let them scare u out2 the difference is im not scared to take risk unlike u i have more than 10 times the kills u have even though i inevitably have more losses of course thats part of the game as well u obviously wouldnt know it since ure too scared to take a loss judging from your own killboard might wanna finally find the courage to get out of high sec maybe then ull have a reason to talk about your own killboard instead of crying about someone elses3 u wanna compare lol losses lets see u lost a ratting cruiser battlecruiser oh and my favorite u lost an assault frigate to a mining ship in high sec and that one was pretty recent 4 fyi suicide ganking is pvp just like low sec pirating especially when its the same persons alt being ganked not surprising that u cant comprehend the simple concept of gathering intel u dont even understand the purpose behind a warp core stabilizer fitted stealth bomber and your experience with pvp only involves camping high sec trade hubs with a fleet because ure mentally incapable of anything else and so u cant handle any less safety than thatanything else u wanna whine about in either case plz continue crying about killboards because yours is even worse and u know it despite a fleet babysitting u in high sec revision lowest sec status applies to every alt in the account and trading them between accounts makes both accounts take the same sec hiteven though they still have to continuously spend real money to sustain this which is good for ccp anyway thx for bringing that uplast time i checked suicide ganking isnt a problem either but apparently the 10s cant handle even the slightest risk to themselves
anna i think you need to go take your meds
1 ive gone outside highsec not really done much though mostly wormholes really and none of this is surprising considering im into industry2 it is amusing how according to you im both scared to pvp and a murderous 10 in disguise make up your mind lol3 cruiser shopping in lowsec happensi find it disturbing however that you see a notfit cruiser as a ratting cruiser battlecruiser this is my favorite death ever took the guy 5 alts and 3 hours to take my completely disabled but notwebbed low skilled myrm down i was loling the whole time would do again assault frigate yeah the mining cruiser was antifrigate fitted gave it a try it was close would do again there i talked about my own killboard but yours is moar funny4 fyi you dont have to use a battleship to gank mining ships in 05 you do so because youre awful warp core stabs lolololololfyi you realize youve now claimed im obviously a selfinterested murderous 10 in disguise opposing your ideas to protect myself claimed im afraid to pvp claimed i camp trade hubs with a fleet failed to realize the above are mutually exclusiveisnt it strange how im barely active in pvp and im often in a trade hub if only there were a profession to explain this behaviour oh wait there is durrrrrrrrrrr oh well it will forever remain a mystery to those who suffer from being braindead these may even be the same people who think warp stabs for combat are good somehow or who use battleships in suicide ganks on mining ships in 05 perhaps i too should should lemming crappy fits into low and null over and over and over and over again to become a pvp pro like you now after running all the crappiest fits i could think of to their deaths repeatedly id better waste billions of isk using battleships for suicide ganks that cruisers can easily pull off like a baddie who doesnt know what theyre doing perhaps after ive done these things ill be a pvp pro and awful like youi also like long walks on the beach puppies and butterflies
extreme examples like yours make it look obvious ill put out another examplei buy up all the dread guristas diamond tags on the market in sinq liason everyshore etc i then place a buy order at 15 million each in amarr while putting the contract up in jita the amarr order isnt for 100 per only 40 per order 720 units on the order  a number that means they might be using them for lp bpcs type stuff or datacenter turnins etc but also a number few are going to have on handso our stupid sap trader sees 626 for sale on a contract in jita at 1 mill each and a buy order at 15 mill a nice 300 mill profit for a normal hubtohub runall told the scammer paid about 70 mill and walked away with 626 mill for a couple hours or so gotcha work that would be extremely difficult for most traders to detect  you could pretty much buy out every last one of those tags on all markets like this to score a nice hitthe garbage for billions scam is kind of obvious but specialty items that suddenly come into demand like a batch of criminal tags not so easy to spot and very easy to scam even a seasoned player who knows what to look formy little example can make a scammer some solid daily income casual scam style not a billion an hour but a fairly solid steady income with a little research on the markets its a game mechanics abuse issue not some if youre smart enough you can avoid it issue
yet another great ideaim not for or against scamming i just really dislike it when they make it harder to sort through the legitimate stufflike all paying player most of us just want to get along with our business at let you play with your toys but the point where you make me spend an extra 20 minutes a day overlooking something to make sure its not a scam not a new market opportunity is when i start getting annoyed
its a good idea but it doesnt get around the problem the scammer can easily just leave little or no money in the account that way he cant even afford any units of the itemwhat about this  along with the existing fine when you are hit with insufficient funds you get a mark on your record each mark on your margin record reduces your effective margin trading skill by a penalty say 5 marks on the record can be erased by time for instance 1 day without any further margin incidents will erase one 5 penaltythis should make successive violations of margin trading noneconomical and still be fair to the legitimate users of the skill
supporting becuase it is not how margin trading works in rl  and it sucks

why shouldnt they be able toi actually think having the ability to quickly set a warp point through an interface like that used for probe launchers would be nice how do you think they explored the galaxy in the first place has it occured to you that using a telescop to look at a far away system is also a means of setting that destination as a location to travel to you can determine distance travel time at velocity and any number of other factors to make that opoint your destinationim suggesting a balance between that and nothing at all which is what we have currently drop a probe or even three send them to a position in space cycle them once and they send you back a 100 signal on their location so you can warp to it using current mechanics i think thats pretty reasonable
concept increase skill points gain when online and useing said skill being trained example mineing if i am online and mineing and training a mineing skill increase skill points gained by x amount if i am training missle skills and running missions were i am shooting missles increase skill points gain by x amount
i too would like to encourage and reward the use of macros
if they want to use macros then they deserve to get shot by pirates
sounds like a great idea maybe we should add mount as welli cant wait to ride a giant space turkey while i do my instanced 1010 complexes in my throax with level 70 gear seriously go back to wow
omg please tell me you are an alt for the op because the look is creepy similar
no im not but i do know him
so ive been thinking yes that is a dangerous thingthe problem with super carriers is one of two things1 their jump range it could do with a nerf of which im not going to talk about why2 fighter bombers are too cheap which i will be as this is the biggest problemas everyone should of noticed their are many people foaming at the mouth about super carriers as you can see by the number of threads about themhowever i cannot fault their current design they work and the problem is that they work which makes it hard to find fault with themso i took a deeper thought and went hang on how much do the bombers costto my surprise the value is about 20 mill each now consider the introduction of the carriermothership remember that they were given fighters which had about the same ehp and dps as a cruiserthen there was the whole overhaul of capital ships and the mothership lost its name and super carriers gained fighter bombersthese nasty brutes have 4 times the damage and 2 times the ehp of a standard fighter yet effectively making them into a battleship yet they cost 20millionso this simple derp in maths has caused the issue with fighter bombers being so overpowered not because they do extreme damage but because they are not worth killingyou loose 25 fighter bombers in a super carrier that is nothing really 500 mill they can farm that back in a dayso i propose they change the fighter bomber costs to be inline with a tier 2 battleship so about 100 million per unitalso if this was implemented to stop people exploiting it to make a quick buck all fighter bombers not in a super carriers hanger would be returned in its current mineral value lets not have another pi disaster
wtcyou looked at the supercarrier hull and decided that the two things that made it overpowered were jump range and the low cost of fighter bombersboth those things are way down the list of why supercarriers are broken
i dont think i know any super pilots that buy their own fighters or fighter bombers if youre annoyedworried that they cost too little then instead of ramping up the price ramp up the material cost which tbh would ramp up prices toomaybe making fighter bombers become t2 fighters requiring t2 materials to make could change the attitude to keeping fighter bombers alive even so youd probably see large alliances create reimbursement programs to replace for their super pilots
well they need to make it worth killing the bombersif bombers cost next to nothing and yet do loads of damage and have loads of hpcurrently you would be wasting money to kill bombers and that makes them not worth killing in the first placeif killing them made the super carrier pilot think twice then they wouldnt be as over powered as they are nowand yes i dont think the ehp is the problem  the problem is that the weapons they possess are cheap and far too effective
if i could make one change i would make the loss in security status a more significant hit example tonight friend o mine was heading into motsu he gets blown away yea concord blows them away they loose a 70k ship they get a million in loot ok no problem the problem is they do it right in front of the so called police should that not result in a huge loss or is concord the most corrupt police department in the galaxythe results of this would be a reduction in piracy right in the middle of the major trade hubs and the constant offenders would soon find themselves expelled out of the empire
i suspect that this game might not be for you
wtf is this why would you want to reduce piracy roflif any change is needed is to reduce de security penaltys so i dont have to do rat all the time
you already take a huge security hit for highsec piracyproblem is that the suicide ganker will go to the limit and then spend a day in perfectly safe null napland resetting his security and be back in motsu immediately afterwardseasy solution is the one proposed by a veto member you know real pirates limit security gain to lowsec ratssuicides will still happen but repairing security will no longer be something you can do semiafk and since recycling characters to skip the security hassle is a bannable offence ps the dev qa thread alludes to unprobable ships going byebye so the tengu swarm will never happen most common objection to the idea
add it to your watch listgank him with your main put your smartbomb alt on top of it f1 smartbomb before hes ship popsprofit revengehave a nice day
yes
its lose not loosecrap idea  poor troll pick any two
not sufficient fix by itself but in combination with other changes sure
1 would read againno problems with mittens and i am not a goon it is just amazing to read all this
i dont think making mining fullyautomatic is a good idea as this would lead to a total market crash this however doest mean i dont think mining should be changedimo a compromise would be to give mining barges and exhumers the ability to only automaically move goods from their cargohold to another window for example a jetcan or the hannger off an orca that way they either had to jetcanmine or have a hauler with them this wouldnt be a huge challenge for wellorganized groups of players while still leaving them somewhat vuernable see that afkorca lets wardec themor force the player to choose between max yield and afkmining  make it a high slot item with heavy cap use only fittable on mining bargesexhumersall this wont really fix the macroing though as it would still be more profitable than legit afkminingrun a script through the server logs one dt per week to look for ships doing the same actions in the same intervalls for hours
modern bots are much more sophisticated than this ccp is catching some of them and working on the rest anyway
given the nature of the meeting almost all of it was nda voice discussions about the summit there is nothing else to report
its generally a good idea to have some knowledge on a topic you wish to speak about before you start speaking on it in this case i would highly recommend you read up on concord response mechanics specifically related to the relationship between high and low security space
not quite sure this problem is only in this topic i believe the new forums were supposed to fix a lot of problems but it seems they were not tested properlyseems to me a basic problem the forums has is the advanced search functionality there is no advanced search functionality you can type commands into the search box to make the search more complex but you have to know what you are looking for to find it in the first placeif all you do is type a keyword into the search box returns will contain that keyword but identifying if the forum post can help you quickly and simply would require more text area for each return of text for a keyword matchobtaining no results for a keyword search should not also clear the search text box requiring continued searches to retype the entire keyword combination this would allow faster editing of the keywords and commands also listing the commands available for use in the search window would also be very very helpful below is the list of commands i use plus sign  keyword or phrase must be included in results minus sign  keyword or phrase must not be included in results openclose quotes  exact phrasekeyword to search forexamples planetary interaction install a command center moon probe did not match any documentsplanetary interaction install a command center moon scan 10 resultsmight i suggest taking a look at the forums architecture it seems slightly unorganized to me with over 390000 topics you would think a simple and straightforward organization method would be the number one priority aside from data securityintegrity might i suggest looking into some sort of topdown architecture like a filetree each main root of the forum needs to have a full description of contents on the front page of the forum including subsection headings contained within it think windows file manager in folder view with all the  plus signs on areas with subheadings listed below clicking all the  plus signs would show all selecting a topic to read should be simple is it possible to put the tree structure of the forums as a hideable part of the eve online main page ie clicking on eve online then eve forums then forum index 
i hate that after 5 years the game is still minmatar for pvp caldari for pve i really dont care how it is fixed but im getting bored of seeing the same 56 hulls all damn day
train navigation and the speed of a ship increases level 5 abaddon achieves 111 ms train target navigation prediction and explosion velocity increases explosion velocity becomes 106 ms either way explosion radius remains 450 m for standard and advanced long range torpedoes and 650 for advanced antiship torpedoes so what is your point exactlyi am fully aware that with the assistance of target painters on your own or an allies ship you can make assault missiles functional but it also applies bonuses to guided missiles and turrets when was the last time you saw a battleship with short range guns miss another battleshipwhy dont you try formulating an argument that has some content and actually uses a more convincing argument
the point is that the numbers that you so smugly quoted in your post were nonsense its also a form of nonsense to state that an abaddon travels at 111 ms its eft warrior nonsense posted by someone who see numbers in eft but is unable to apply them to the real game torps hitting an abaddon traveling at 111 ms requires that it a is not trimarked b is not webbed and c has been struggling up to top speed for a about a minute this combination of events is so rare that basing an argument on it is nonsense but even when they do occur a torp with explosion velocity of 107 ms does 100 damage on an abaddon cruising at max speed of 111 ms because the abaddons sig is sufficiently larger than the explosion radius of the torp so what was your point againat this point youll start blustering about other bs here are the facts all tier 3 bs and all caldari bs have sufficient sigs to receive no damage mitigation from signature from torps ignore speed thats what webs are for unless you have too much space honour to tackle your targets and dont you dare mention abs on bs the other bs sigs range from 320 m to 420 m leading to damage mitigation from sig of 29 24 18 11 and 7 you seem to believe this is a crippling issue but torps do so much raw damage  more than a neutron blaster cannon  and with the luxury of selectable damage type the resultant applied damage even without painter support or standard crash is completely satisfactory and yes i have seen a bs miss another bs very many times everyone has i cant believe that you said that lolmoving on to hams well they do full damage to all bcs and to pretty much all webbed cruisers so ive no idea what youre talking about although the fact that you call hams their correct name of assault missiles makes me think that youve never used them because nobody who has used them calls them their strictlycorrect name because its so confusing
well at least you answered with some degree of consideration this timei deliberatly limited the factors with regards to the torpedoes because not everybody fits reduced speed tanks and it simply wasnt neccessary its a control group using only the factors that are present in every scenario sure under certain circumstances i suppose a bs could miss a battleship with turrets and certainly they can apply reduced dps as a result of the various factors at play i use the term assault missiles not to identify hams but the group of short range unguided missiles as a whole thats what they arethe fact is that sig radius plays an important role in many aspects of combat whether it be pvp or pve decreasing locking times allowing for damage to be maximized etc why do you think caldari vessels are generally so poor in pvp its an obvious problem which many seem to fail to grasp there are so many factors at play in eve and notwithstanding they are all calculable variables it leaves a lot of room for balance problems assault missiles have limited range and you cant directly improve their explosion radius by lowering itshield extenders increase the sig radius of vessels they are on making them easier to scan down faster to lock and increasing the ability to apply dps to them with missiles or turretsguided missiles outrange nearly every other weapon yet they take long enough to reach their target at range that its usually destroyed before the first one hits in pvpmicrowarp drives can make a ships sig large enough that a dread could hit it with near full dpsfaction complex and officer modules are the only effective way of making a ship truly effective in pvp or pve yet they cost so much its not worth the bother they are very nearly required for any operations in c5 and c6 wormhole space against sleepers such that without them two cap ships and 1012 rr strategic cruisers andor battleships are required to run a site in a c6 reducing individual rewards to less than 70 million isk per site assuming the corp gets nothingenergy destabilizers make local repping nearly impossible in pvp and even completely render afterburners stasis webs ewar and other modules useless in short orderrecons can be used to such effect at long range that solo pvp is near to impossible applying ewar painters webs and the rest while safely out of range of neuts and most common pvp weapons you need a handful of everything to combat anything which means you have to have at least 510 guys to even realisticly approach lowsec these days and even then youre likely to be outnumbered in some places yet you can safely fly through fifteen systems in nullsec without seeing a single persontheres plenty of problemsi like how you can only throw 13 small drones in a cruiser battlescruiser or hac depending on which you choose to fly multifit highs for turrets and launchers rendering both obsolete and useless yep we got that tooassault missiles bite
going back to my analogy of bugatti veyrons and camarosits actually not a bad idea in lieu of a full rebalance just change the bp specifications to increase manufacturing time and material costs on the ships that are considered really good and reduce the costs of some of the others which are considered really bad in the same way drakes will end up being 6070 million isk putting them on par with lowend bs and ferox will run in at around 20 million isk rifters will probably be near a million isk and bursts will stay down around where they are currentlybetter ship  higher costits an alternative though id probably prefer the rebalance
i have to be hounest i did not read all the reactionsbut if its not already saidif ccp would only make it possible to offlineonlineunachorachor modules at the same time or online 50 modules in 1 go like copieing 50 pictures in windows it would make poses allot beter i think thats the only option i would like to change on poses right now tbhwe fly in spaceships and shoot stations orbiting around planets up the air but our towers computer cant handle more then 1 task at a time give us a brake sitting 8 hours streight in a wh just to online a tower for your corp is a bit well redicilous
no no no no no no please noam i playin battlefield heroes right now do i need to purchase blonde hair with blue eyes and a tatoo to look as awesome as my ceodo i need to purchase uber guns or uber modules to have a chance to compete in a blob where i die anywaythe reason i play eve online is bacause its not like any other game out thereeve online is a complex game for grown up mature people well not always matuer pplease dont give this game mechanics you would only use in games designed for 6 year old girlseve online dosnt need micro transactions to make it interesting and if its about the money for ccp find a way to minimize the plex usages or whatever i dont know its possible but its just an ideait will seriously affect game play and i think allot of players will end up leaving or playing less we are not 14 year old spoiled english brads we are eve players we play eve for a reason and its defo not micro transactionsps i might have been reacting a bit overdate but i was so against the idea i had to put my voice in heregreetings visione
definitely supported
supported and if ccp is looking at rebalancing ship sizes they shouldnt only look at supercarriersyes the supercarriers are the best example but there are allot of ships with a weird sizes my golem is like as big as my harbinger greetings visione
supported if the nidhoggur gets on the list as well
unfortunately seems a lot of people neglect the importance of your proposalim not trader not even industrial making dozens of contracts per week but has eve player who likes this game to become better every time i log this idea would be awesomedont loose hope link your proposal in the industrymarket topics people will come support you
thank you for your support and your vote of confidence i realise that this proposal perhaps isnt at the forefront of peoples minds when they think of things that could be fixed  hybrids come to mind  but as you say this issue is indicative of the underlying problems affecting the economic aspects of eveas you pointed out an industrialist setting dozens of contracts over the period of a week would find this lack of data sorely frustrating as a professional contracts trader  such as myself  setting dozens of contracts a day i am near to tears when i think of all of the contracts data that is efectively going to waste all because ccp wont tie them into the api in the same fashion as market transactions it would be so immensely useful plotting the course of ones business using this information but alas we have to make do with such crude methods as dragging and dropping finished contracts into notepad to create a record and then tabulating by handas for your idea to link it into si or even md i would dearly love to do that but i think it might get slapped down rather quickly by the mods for crossposting thanks again for your encouragement
currently when it comes to frigates it isdramiel or gtfoit should not be this way nerf it already
lordelfa is 100 correcti do not support this nerf dramiel proposalpswheres the thumbs down option
fof fail so hard right nowsupportingfofs absolutely need a ccp reviewas its already been typed up fofs are ewar countermeasuresif its hitting targets like lcos and friendlies its completely uselessfofs should hit random targets yes but nothing inanimate or friendlyi agree with the aggressor only idea itll hit what needs to be hitno reason to nerf the missiles damage or volley you paid for the missiles and had them ready in the cargo you deserve to have them function after you spend time reloading and activating youre not overpowering fofs by making them actually hit something in an targeting emergency in pvp you planned ahead by training stocking and loading them why should they hit anything that isnt hitting you
how about eliminating the 10 second reload time if youre switching to fof missiles that way you can load them as soon as you get jammed
its an interesting idea but i think it breaks too widely from an rp perspective to be feasible from what i can gather from the other posters as well as agreeing with it myself to a degree a change in targetting ability or damage would be more helpfulthoughts
that only works if the drones are in the same place at the same time and if 1 gets webbed then it might not bealso some people split their drones as well
i think having the floating damage scroll through several lines before fading out similar to other games would help fix it with that having drone damage a different color then turret damage would also help
okay steering the discussion back to the original topic and proposal id like to post to consideration a potential fix to the contract 1 trit for cash loopholewhat if the the price for contracting to private toons were not fixed at 10000 if the parties involved were of different sides of the law instead they will be scaled up in proportion to how far away each of them are on the sec scale from each other exactly what the proposition is for the transferring of money itself simple and elegant fix to that problem not to mention its consistent for if we are to start taxing cross secstatus isk transfers then why not private contracts as wellso the next thing someone will point out is what about public contracts no we will not put fees on that what will stop this being a loophole then nothing really but putting a public contract for 1trit for 1bil isk is putting the criminal at risk of losing lots of isk its sufficient deterrent that most wont bother and hopefully we keep the flow of clean money in the clean economy separate from the money gotten through greifing meanseconomists will love this because they will more accurately be able to track the money flows on either side thus have better visibilty in which part of the economy needs more dev lovekeep in mind despite many people misunderstanding the point of my original proposal this is not a greiferganker nerf request this is a request for regulation of the money flows so that sec status penalty system is consistent and visible to the devs and an attempt at making piracy a self sustaining part of the economy and not a shadow metagaming market
and you would do this by nerfing griefers i dont think that word means what you think it means by banning them from using the market using contracts etc etcthis is not needed by any stretch of the imagination it is a terrible terrible idea and it would take an hour at most for its intended target to figure out exactly how to get around it youd only end up ing off the casual crowd not the hardcore 10 all lowsec all the time piratesnot being able to enter highsec is enough of a punishment we dont need layer upon layer of overcomplicated completely unnecessary stuff like this thrown in on top of it
who said anything about banningits not nerfing anymore than tweaking insurance payouts was a nerf its a tax if you are moving mony between a 1 to a 1 its just a 2 tax now if you think thats too severe a measure please do explainmaybe i shouldnt use the term griefer it seems to carry with it too much meaning associated with people who deliberately want to make others lives difficult i want to stop the goodbad toon metagaming exploitation of the sec status systemyou say making it hard for them to come into high sec is bad enough but that only applies to 5 status toons why do 5x0 toons get off scotch free in your view do you think they should with these changes a good toon moving 100mil over to his gank toon will pay 5 tax on the transfer i think that is a completely reasonable deterrent we can tune the exact s but the point is that they should be taxed its the cost of laundering your isk if you dont want to pay it then get your rich pirate friends to fund your ganking not your own indy alt
1 i can see why uve stuck with industry or to be more accurate uve shown why u are scared to pvp2 ive dispersed 00 gate camps as soon as they see 1 bomber nearby just because they cant handle a possible loss and ive had low sec pirates docked and safespotted just because they knew i wasnt a carebear from their exhumer loss so yes they r 10s and at the same time scared to pvp just like u what have u done besides a few easy ganks nothing really3 shopping in low secand in a cruiser too and ure calling someone else a baddie as for your battlecruiser loss there were only 3 involved so l2countit helps with adding so u wouldnt have to pull numbers out of your ass like before as for antifrig fit kills take a closer look at my killboard it may take u a while to scroll through kills ull never get but its there on more than one occasion perfect for pirate wannabes like u who think uve got a guaranteed easy gank and what difference does it make if your battlecruiser loss took 23 hours or 23 seconds either way u still lost it only its even worse in your case because instead of selfdestructing u chose to wait out those 3 hours like an idiot and still managed to pad someone elses killboard so looking at your killboard when will u do it again at this rate oh thats rightnever4 and u dont have to hide behind a fleet to get killmailsoh wait u do have to because thats why ure into industry ure awful as for mutually exclusive feel free to refer to 2 as for the trade hub camping it can be done with high sec chars as well glad to discover the existence of alts for uits a profession that uve been scared into because ure scared to pvp especially without a fleet to hide behind grats and thats from your crappy low sec ships and fits in fact that 3 hour loss of yours wouldve been prevented with the same warp core stabilizers u lol about since ure too stupid and incapable of taking a loss to selfdestruct epic fail so here u r back in high sec so go ahead suicide gank an exhumer with a cruiser and see how that works out for u and if u cant afford throwaway cruisers let alone billions as a selfproclaimed industrialist then that makes u a baddie industrialist too
anna can you do me a favoursince you rewrite the proposal when we find a way around it can you go through this thread and give us a summary of the changes you would like to see made to ensure this proposal works they way you want it to
so another completely ignored thread for ccp  grats i wonder if there is some form of award for services to industry for ignoring customer feedback back up your halfbaked ideas with consultation support it with data and provide intelligent responses to points raised until then stop playing with stuff that you have demonstrated little understanding of
supporting the un nerfing of jbs
there is a well known workaround to this snip spitfire some isk buy a high sp toon and supercap
so let me get this rightyou are ing about having to have 2 accounts to use a ship that1 has an insane tank2 does a ridiculous amount of damagei would say its a fair trade as far as ccp giving you back your wasted sp if you didnt know they couldnt dock then you clearly dont know  about super capitals and should not be in one
op has obviously never heard of the term play balancenot supported in the slightest
if you have sc by your own i hate you i want you to diewe should remove 99 of scs make them impossibly hard to maintain and make them take 10 times the resources and time to build
havent read all the replies here but figured id mention this you do know players train alts and sell them on the forums for such purposes right if you can afford one of those you can sure as heck afford to drop a few billion on a holding alt and put it in one of your free character slots problem solved
just as the title says the nerf to how null sec survives and exists needs to be reverted back before its to late and it turns into a ghost town we the players like the way null was before ccp interfered with null politics and how we operate we the players worked long and hard through years to develop it into the place it is now not only is it unfair but for ccp to give in to the tear filled raging losers we destroyed using the game mechanics is just uncalled forwhatever happened to the sandbox philosophy that the game was built on one thing for sure is if we the nc fall it is only because ccp beat us not to pl not to drf not to ncdot not to anyone but ccp ruining the gameso let your voice be heard and tell ccp null is working as intended thank you
bring back sanctums 3
ccp sees large alliances as a hindrance to their goals and against the market so im gonna support this
this isnt going to happen and would just be a waste of csm time ccp is formulating a vision for 00 and these steps are all taken to reach that goal whatever it is the time for objections was some time ago and ccp said they didnt see arguments they thought warranted a change to their current plansyour crying about fairnes and destruction of the sandbox are laughably bad and you cant really think ccp is going to take them seriously when every nonhysterical player can see youre just spouting bs hyperbole about two minor nerfs i can understand youre butthurt about them but it really is adapt or die time for you and no amount of whining is going to change that
the anom nerf was hardly minor there are whole regions without any worthwhile anoms anymore but i do agree that its better to see where ccp are going before whiningmaybe if theyd bothered to roll out the nerf as part of the wider 00 changes things would make more sense then again this is ccp were taking about
ill half support this the jb changes are nice but the anom changes are not
not supported both changes were definitely for the greater good of the game
the changes were needed not supported
maybe for your game but not the game i am referring to the game as a whole that involves everyones experience combined you on the other hand are being selfish and only thinking about what you want and like do try and take a step back from malcanis land and take in the rest of the picture dear lad
ha ha ha ha ha ha stupid carebear crying i love this
i know it hurts poor lil nub but you do not understand before sanctums before jumpbridges before warp to zero we all just did fine the only benefit the above things have added is making it easy for scrubs to be scrubs i believe eve online is the hardcore game for the hardcore gamer there are a million games out there where you can have it all easy with no effort let me point you to wowtytia manny
the one problem i got is that large sections of 00 are worth less than highsec jb are not realy needed that much anyways thanks to titan bridges and caps but that nerf will make the pubbies happythis nerf may hurt the drf more than the nc for they are spread out over more regions but both have large numbers of titans that can be used for fleet movementpstinfoilhattimeccp doesnt listen to csm they want the csm to basically be public relations yes men to make everyone happy and spend more money on the game and to take the blaim if something goes wrong
youre right titans need to be nerfed too also sanctum nerf is needed in order to shut off the broken hydrant of liquid isk thats ruining the economy
do you mean level 4 missions
pl troll best trollso on a more serious note you made a troll post to make sure ccp reverse it for when you get sov lolcool story bro
no i think theyre doing it right once your logistics reconfiguration is complete youll probably agree maybe not but if you dont i dont care obviously your attitude is completely skewed in favor of a me only perspective anywayalliance tears best tears
i see what you did there
safespots that are effectively unprobeable are badreplace afk cloaking with 100000au safespotting
i think that the op is using too many in story reasons to justify this proposal what makes you think that all original explorations where not done by warping to celestials at any rate any discussion in strictly story terms is going to inevitably turn into a enterprise vs star destroyer argument game wise what about this cant be achieved by simply being able to share bookmarksthe only thing you wont be able to do is to dynamically create warp in points without going there yourself which i think is a good thing as i sense that this can be exploited youve essentially made all warp bubbling traps useless good if you are the kind of player always getting caught in them bad for those who use them netnet bad for the economy and play balance if your enemies spent the time to bubble up all routes in a system that you have not been in before you should be caught and not be able to just arbitrarily warp around to safe spots continuouslynot supported
as far as i know its not possibly to go 100000au from the sun anymore if it ever was i know players used to continuously log off to create distant bookmarks in space and have heard of some ship being so far out it would not be feasible for them to warp back a bit silly thatthe earth solar system is roughly 100 au across with orbital ice and debris well beyond that which is known as the oort cloud the oort cloud is something which would be common to nearly any solar system and may extend as much as 50au beyond the outermost planets concievably this could be used to prevent 100 scanning of safespots beyond a certain distance from the sun signal loss on probes due to interference from the oort cloud could prevent scanning farther out for similar reasonsthere are some very larger solar systems in eve of course some of them being more than twice the size of our solar system teonusude is a good example of this and im sure there are quite a few others so distance has to be determined in a dynamic fashion being based mostly off a certain allowable distance from the outermost planetary object i would say more than 20au but less than 50au its probably already determinedany obstacles interference or ships in the area a scan is attempted would simply return a red result with less than 70 and quite possibly a random number under 100as for getting around bubbles and gatecamps ive done it many times and no matter how much you bubble up a system barring it has all celestials beyond scan range from a gate with no other means of detecting what is at the gate except eliminating numbers with regards to count in local and known player locations it is possible to slip bybubbles are limited in their ability to catch ships and generally only fuction well from one angle which means that you have to account for every possible warp in and get them right on target even then you might miss that covert ops this isnt an exploit by any means and if it costs people a few tears well im not disappointed you might also want to note that a player has to drop these covert beacons as probes and operate them as such then place them where heshe wants them and run a cycle until the probes are deployed as covert beacons on 100 you can see them on your dscan and you will know what they are and why theyre there id say thats pretty fair
i am a paying customer and have been for over 3 years in this time i have lost many ships to unknown circumstances everytime i petition i get the same answer sorry but we dont know what happend and we are not reinbursing your ship it usually takes 23 days for to be told that  recently lost my last mission ship and 3 days later still waiting to hear back  i cant afford to go buy new ship for missions while i wait on ccp telling me they cant find a problem and they not going to reinburse my ship  if you want any form of cutomer support dont hope for any from eve onlineso from me alot and alot of thumbs down and dont think will be telling friends or family to start playing eve onlineps anyone wanna buy a 3 year old 50 mill sp char will sell for UFFFD2
cry me a river
the logs show nothingand selling accounts is bad
ive lost ships under suspicious circumstances a couple ive gotten back most i have not i have always gotten a prompt courteous answer most of the time the reimbursement was declined i was told what actually happened even though it looked suspicious on my endonce way back on my original toon at about year 2 i was blasted down to a newbie frigate and a handful of cruiser mods i couldnt fit to it end of game pffft i started missioning and ratting with that newbie frigate until i could afford a better one that got me to a cruiser then a bc then back eventually into a battleship and my l4 missions you always have the means to get back to where you left off though it may not be convenient ive been a paying customer for all 8 frickin years of eve heres to 8 more raises a glass of quafe
this was spun out of ideas brought forth in this threadpetition of distrust against csm6but now as it is a proposal for a fix in the way csms are elected it deserves a thread of its own i suggest readers to familiarize yourself with the topic in the above thread which brings to light the problems that we currently have and the proposed solution belowwhy didnt more non00 players vote and why didnt more non00ers run for csm6maybe they didnt bother because they knew that for example given that only 2 of accounts are active in fw then what is the point on campaigning on a fw platform even if they did get all players in fw to vote for them they wont dent the 00 votesnow if ccp dictates groups of constituents based on a census or a survey of all players and how each player choose to identify themselves as then that would incentivize more minority players to run for csm because frankly who wants to bother if they have no statistical chance of winningfor example before the next csm have a survey that all players are encouraged to fill out which asks each player 1 per accountwhich best classifies what you spend most time doing in eve in the past year1 pvp2 pve3 mining4 industry5 exploration6 trading7 corporate managementpie8 faction wars9 piratingwhere do you spend most of your time1empire2lowsec3null4empire null5whthat should bucket the population into groups which can then be assign a number of seats depending on proportioneach player can then vote for a candidate for that seats ie players who are identified as null sec pvp can only cast a vote for the candidates running for the null sec pvp seatsas an aside i believe that any argument that a goon or better 1 goons on the csm sorry i dont mean to pick on goons just a handy example is not biased is going to be flawed even if they had the best intentions in mind i doubt that a player that spends 100 of his time and experience playing in null sec is going to give the same mindshare to a suggestion that affects empire space or fw than one that is more familiar to them on a daily basis they just may not have the experience in the other aspects of the game to be able to contribute as well as somebody who do spend all of their time therethis system is not without its flaws but i think it would at least give a chance at letting the lesser in terms of population aspects of the game get some coverage and spotlight and chance at improvement its arguable that those sometimes forgotten aspects are the ones that should get some more attention after all
i support this in principlemy iteration of this idea was to make it geographical but that would require some changes to the game
ccp many times has said they wish to see battlecruisers flown less they are more often then not the prefered choice of ship to fly for solo fighting for there damage and tank it relative easy to get into a battlecruiser even starting off newso instead of rather trying to nerf the battlecruiser variants of shipsie the infamous nerf the drake threads so many months ago rather the cruiser class could be boostedthe caracal is one example of this often used for antifrig work with assault missiles it often excels in this type of combat but if trying to engage another cruiser it often dies in a horrible fire since it tank is relativily light it cant fit hams to engage cruisers as it will have no tank fitting hmls to it is a pain i only use the caracal as an example as it is the only cruiser ive flown alotmy idea for a solution would be to change the racial battlecruiser requirments those id leave up for discussion and hopefully the decision by the csm and ccpsignedsilva
agreed look at the moa and osprey nobody really uses those a boost is much needed
i agree with this one the t1 cruisers are way too underpowered and only a selected few like the blackbirdrupturestabberthorax are good for combat vs other entitiessigned
agreed there are 4 types of cruisers in this gamethere is the rupture the arbitrator the blackbird and the not a rupture arby or blackbirdthey should really put some focus on that last one
cruisers in dire need of reworking1 bellicouse2 omen3 moa
this is the complicated and difficult way round and for cruisers the problem isnt the drake its the hurricane  which is basically better than almost all cruisers at being a cruiser the solution is to nerf all tier 2 bcs
commit tiericide and the rest will fall into line rather nicely
and exactly what play imbalance is this attempting to fix or are you just asking for a handout
massively abusable dumb adds nothing to eve encourages macros and other afk activityno
sounds like a handoutand no just because someone can go afk 2357 doesnt mean they should get more sp as far as more sp for certain activities thats practically impossible if you were to ap around the universe wouldnt that mean you would get ship sp and navigation sp boosts and yes this would also be buffing all the drf bots so no thanks
nobut rewarding the accomplishment of an epic arcs rewarding a 1000 standing corp rewarding a 1000 standing faction rewarding a 1000 all corps in the same faction rewarding a 100 lvl5 skills set ex full mechanic or whatever yes
yes more rewards for bearing is what this game needs
give each fighter bomber killmails and they will be worth killing
you do realize that people who can afford to drop 20b on a sc can easily afford to spend even 100m on fighter bombers right your nerf would be pointlessand nerfing the range thats got to be the most stupid suggested nerf i have ever read they already have a short jump range how about we leave supers alone and work on fixing dreads
dreads were fine until the supercap boostwhy not make fighter bombers only able to attack structures and other supercaps
i think fb should be more expensiveand yes a sc cosr 20bil but if 1 fb costs 100mil and a sc pilot loses a whole set 25 he has to pay 25bil to get a new set he will think twice before launching them
well ccp have always stated that supers are designed to be anticapital shipstheres always a struggle to make supers vulnerable to sub caps and i think the 1 way to do so is to make supers not able to field regular fighters but only regular drones and fighter bombersalthough it seems very illogical that theyd have that restrictionso id say the nerf should be to restrict supers to carrying fighter bombers and regular drones only and increase the material cost of fighter bombers to either 5x what they are now or require the t2 components that a typical t2 cruiser requiresbtw dreds are always designed as anti structure ships and thats why ccp are redesigning them into the the nukefromorbit button for planetary assaults titans are just a massive step up from dreads and i wouldnt be surprised if they end up having antiplanetary weapons too
no regular drones fighters and bombers onlya wing of ogre iis will rip apart subcaps as fast as fighters if not faster
the cost still need to reflect the ability of the dronesi admit that drones need a revise in regards to pricing but bombers really need to have a cost nerf
bumpis this going to catch the attention of any csm6 or should i just shelve the idea until the next csm convenes
lucknope
i cant believe its been 6 years now and this still hasnt been done
fleet command ships needs a 1 high slot or 1 weapon high slotwhybecause when you fit 3 gang modules there is not enough high slots left to use all of turretlauncher slots 1 remains unused its not because of dps its low anyway but this is not right when you need to remove 1 of the link to fit all maximum turretslaunchersits for vulture and damnation at least
and with that sentence you just proved both myself and gypsio absolutely right that you are utterly clueless about anything to do with missilesherere a couple of basic facts for you as you dont seem to know the first thing about cruise missiles or missile damage reduction in general1 a cruise missile max skilled trvels over 8kms from a raven and flys for a good 30 seconds good luck outrunning that without overheating2 now heres the bit that makes you look like an utter tool that same raven firing cruise missiles at the inty is doing all of 12 dps yeah thats so game breakingstop posting about missiles you know nothing
feel free to check interceptors bonuses
they need to be able to be stolen there is a lot of trash in wspaceanchored offline towers and modules that cannot be reclaimed by explorers or other less than savory individuals maybe expand the codebreaker module and let these modules and towers be able to be flipped ownership so they can be recoveredthe other pos issues are well documented i like that link to the dead horse
well to play devils advocate here the orca will likely be using a mwd to increase its mass while transiting the wormholeof course the option is to be more crafty with the wormhole closing operation
i approve this messageif you really want to move about your caps in relative safety you still have optionsa use station systemsb set up a pos chain infrastructurec move in groups and use cap transfers logi augorersto me a capital ship is more of less a flag ship  fleet ship imho movement is part of the combat like rl naval maneuvering magically appearing on grid unleashing your dps and then throwing a smoke bomb and disappearing again is a terrible mechanic you want awesome power and a massive sword you have to carry that sucker to the field
great idea would like to see ccp consider this
sure seems fair
please offer this at some point i know it is highly talked about and shot down but combine it with very harsh terms and i doubt everyone will use it 1 name change is final forever one name change per account not per character 2 the character that had the name change can never be transfered to any other account you are stuck with it forever number three is optional and might not be needed but maybe3 name change service only available after a legit character transfer to an alleged new owner number four is optional and might not be needed but again maybe4 name change service must be paid with cc paypal or whatever means ccp accepts that does not include plexname change service possible price could be 20 i would be fine with a much harsher price tag of 50
players let us change our namesccp we dont want players to be able to escape their reputationsplayers so let players have a name change historyccp
 thisname change would be nice i would love to change my own name as well its been a long time so what i thought would be a cool name then has changed from nowand i agree have name history and keep corp history thats what people look at anyways its not like someone in the nc block going to recognize the name of some random drf member if they try to join their corp maybe put in a dot or something around the portrait or name so players can see that they had a name change and if they care enough they can easily check info on that player hell put in different view options to select what you can see if the person has a name change such as the dot or some other symbol as just said or even have it in parenthesis next to or below their new nameplus that means more  for ccp
5 display original name option ticked on by default other players original name is displayed to you at a glance instead of new name
once a mission runner in their dominix hits gallente battleship 5 and sentry drone interfacing 5 there is nothing left to do except add rail guns and start training hybrid weapons eventually that upgrade path will take them to a megathron or hyperion no more dominixalternately start training caldari battleship and missile skills fly a rattlesnake end up in a golemthere are so very few factiondeadspaceofficer drones or modules where is estamels modified omnidirectional tracking link or shadow serpentis gardei with more damage or the dread guristas warden with higher rate of firei want to see 35b isk drone boats where the isk is embodied in the drones part not the tank and rail guns part 
i vote yes for time dilation and i am glad that the csm is making it their priority
im so sick of people in pods or ships logging off right when im about to finish them off i gate camp a lot in a hound wt pods will warp in i open fire but they log off im surprised this is even possible to begin with eve online is all about real consequences for your actions but this is such a weak carebear move its like something you would see in wow if you log off your ship should stay put for 15 minutes before dissapearing no warp outs there shouldnt be such an easy way for people to escape danger
good idea that way the next time you experience a power hiccup and your pc reboots your enemies will have a few minutes to pee on your ship before they cram it up your assnot supported i understand your frustration man but the current system is in place to protect you as well its an issue that is indeed exploited but removing it would be unfair to those who get disconnected for something not their fault
 this go to null if you want to fight people that want to fight instead of griefing everyone because you are too lazy 
they said the same thing about the bomber and cov op cloak for years and it was never truley fixed till they added it with a couple other perks i would rather them get it right the first time i also said add gank or tank not both this would stop them from being in the front line imo thanks for the reply i like you range and fuel bay ideas
i dont see how you can compare bombers to bops they are completly different smain point being bombers dont have a jump drive
a covert cloak would be too much for a bo i say this as a sin panther widow pilot not supportedthey are in dire need of some hpresist adjustment and if they get that then a covops cloak would be even more imbalanced
they are both designed in a stealth type role but did not have cov op cloaks bos are made to work hand in hand with cov op cloak type ships
they are still one of the most expensive ships before capitals and least used if we got the cloak and a buff to either tank or gank not both it would still not be over powered they could still be countered and destroyedthere are so few options for smaller fleets to accomplish anything in this game i think this would be a move in the right direction for what they say they want to do with 00
put a covert ops cloak and a black ops and it will become the standard ship to fly by all pirates in low sec hell even small scale pvp in null sec and high sec wars
they would still be foolish to go toe go toe a vs a well organized roam even less vs a hellcat drake or bs fleet imo we are still talking about a lot of isk here this could be a nice new niche if ccp truey wants to open up small scale warefare and objectives for such fleets in 00 i am thinking long term if they add new objectives in 00 low sec id still take a fleet bs over a bo w cloak and a buff to either tank or gank costs much less and more effective imo
im supporting this only because i love cloaky ships
lol like they would go toetotoe with a hellcat fleet they would just stay cloaked and warp the  offput a covert cloak on it and everyone would train for one and fly nothing else you say the cost is high now but when the demand goes through the roof all inventors will be making these and due to the price competition they will drop in price sounds good but when it is nothing but marcopolo between black ops everywherei hope you get the picture if not then there is not much else i can say to get you to stop seeing in tunnel vision
not everyone trains recons now so you saying all would train that is a weak counter imo dps of bos is camparable if not less than a well trained bomber in most cases bombers cost a lot less and will be traveling with them i still see bos being more expensive than tier two bs by a long shot bos playing marco polo is far fetched when bs that cost much less can kill them people already play marco polo btw so this won change anything just because someone does not agree with you does not mean they have tunnel vission if it did i could say the same of you i made the points i wanted to already
even if they component assembly arrays that is have mineral bays so only minerals can go in them it would be fine if the where bigger
i suspect this would be tricky to implement cf why cant i compress ore directly from the ore bay of my rorqual
that would still be unpleasant in a super or carrier
it removes the annoying lag i get when i try to look at someones standings to see if theyre actually neutral or if its an overview bug thats a good thingyou can still check your own standings but after it hits i cant check yours why i would have been able to in the past i have no idea
no its on a separate tab from your relation to the character default tab is whatever you have open last time it produces no lag unless you click on it whatever overview bug youre referring to if it exist need to be fixed you do not break something else for a workaround in this case the workaround works fine even if you dont break character info tabi need to check standings of clients who may be afk even if theyre around i cant ask them every other mission or take their word for it also you own standings info is bugged you dont see standings updates unless you relog so asking wont help
default tab is always npc standings for me its not something ive ever looked at so i have no idea why that is but iut always opens on that and please dont doubt that the overview bug exists i dont know why it does but blues show as neuts on entering systems sometimes ive lost ships to it before and ive almost shot friendly caps more times than i care to think of
that has to do with overall tab count its a separate issue if you open the character info of someone with an additional tab such as medals and achievements it opens up that tab even though you had relationships subtab in the standings tab open last time on someone without the medals tab because its the xth tab counting from the front then when you click on the standings tab it defaults back to npc standings subtab an easy fix would be to put medals tab at the back or even relationships subtab in front of the npc standings subtab
you wont be able to easily tell if someone is a frequent mission runner or pvpercurrently you can take an educated guess which of the stations in highsec someone is likely to be docked in based on standings and also work out where you can run to for faction police help if they start chasing youon a pilots standings towards npc corporations does that mean someones faction standings will still be visible how about a corps standings for pos setupim going to reserve judgement on this until we know the reason for this flat removal but it seems like removal of useful info for no real benefittinfoilmaybe doing a background check on someone is something that is being moved to incarnatinfoil
most of good pvpers are vets whos been around long enough to have standing records anyway if you see someone without standings it means hes a noob rather than pvper mission runners will have numerous standings with numerous agents you wont be able to tell anyway viewable npc standings has been around for a long time the fact that people dont trail carebears with it already is because it works in theory but not in practice
fully
1 yes because industry is obviously something that isnt a core part of the game after all who needs ships mods and equipment the true pro pvpers like you can do without if only you could fit warp stabs on your pod2 yes people run in fear because you do really fail ganks on exhumers with battleships yeah its on the internet it must be true3 i still shop in lowsec obviously theres no possible way more accounts could be involved in a kill then showed on the killmail nowai you speak almost as if i care oo4 shame on me for being into industry shame its not as if its a perfectly valid thing to do or anything how dare i play eve how the crap i feel like how dare i durri dont think words mean what you think they mean them fearsome exhumer suicides obviously display your mighty pvp prowess to the enemy run and hide yes people run in fear because you suicided exhumers uh thats not deluded at all riteand warp core stabs lolololololololbrutix tops you even use battleships for mackinaws  facepalm and yes they can be done by cruiser no problem perhaps you need to l2overload unless you happen to be continually running across the most heavily tanked ultraparanoid miners of all time which you arent and even if you were l2scout scrubif griefers ever got embarrassed theyd be embarrassed of you
i still think your trolling are a far to serious role player got blown up in low sechigh sec by piratesi think this idea is terrible and really dont get why you keep pushing it id understand if it was a real issue that was currently making the game unplayable but it isntalso last time i checked drug dealers and other illegal people pay the same if not less taxes as me so your point is invalidpseven if this was a problem which it isnt its a very very very low priority issue and not worth the though let alone attention you are giving it
are you talking about my proposal or annas add onswell you are entitled to your opinion thats your right and i do agree that its not terribly high priority but i have a vested interest in this game and its unique economy from an academic stand point and i have other ideas to expand the depth of realism in the game but they all would involve the building of trust in players  ask yourself why bonds cant work in eve right now  because of a lack of trusted institutions and a credit market  so many things would be possible if the currency of trust were guarded  loans bonds stock market futures market  the broken money transfer system is pivotal to all these things so no its not a problem now but it will become an issue later if we want to add these things and if we dont oh well then some other game will do it as for game terms in the here and now am i the only one who thinks its wrong that i was play a trustworthy model citizen you may rub me the wrong way so i go create an alt give him 100mil isk hunt you down and gank you and have my good character pick up the loot and then delete the altseems like that should have cost me more than the insurance shortage of a ship and some modules to do but thats debatable im mostly pushing this from a future value to the economy standpoint its low pri though so im happy to leave this idea ferment a bit
personally i say make the war decs cost more ill agree with some of you that war decs do get out of handwith people randomly declaring war on one another war is alos important as to some extents it keeps the economy rolling and as some of you hvae said nowhere is safe in eve dont fly anything youre not willing to lose righti only say make it cost more because in reality these wars would be insanely expensive declaration of war shouldnt run you 100mil maybe 10mil is a good starting place if you up the price you also make the wars just a bit more meaingfulwhile its true no matter how expensive they are people are still going to declare war if it costs them a bit more or they have to work a bit more to declare war well that just shows that the corp or alliance came together and said yeah these sobs need to goonly other thing i can thin of is if after 2 weeks of war and no shots have been fired between the agressor and the deced corp why not null the dec or atleast make them pay a much larger fee to continue i mean if youre gonna war dec you might as well get out there and fight and diethose are just my ideas and opinions anyone elses thoughts
a corp war dec should cost no less than 250 million isk an alliance war dec should cost no less than 500 million isk fighting wars are expensive and thanks to eve anyone with an  and a couple of isk can file a war dec on a corp then not fire a shot there should be very stiff penalties for the aggressing corp that does not want to fight but war decs everyone example let us sleep corp i fyou are the aggressing corp and you havent fire a shot at enemy corp during the first week war dec fees double if no shots are fired after the second week war decs fees are again doubled plus war dec is voided if your not going to fight then you should not be allowed to continually file war decs that is the biggest problem in this game
ok so what is concords deal then for 2mil they turn a blind eye to a wardec i call bull the concord i know and have been killed by wouldnt give a damn if you paid them or not they would still smoke you and laugh i had a wardec last over 50days in high sec it was the most pointless 50days ever   ever the wardecing corp would kill noobs during the day and hide for 68 hours in station from the older players logging in that having been said eve needs its wardecs and its dark gloomy god forsaken themenow stay with me on this concord for a small fee will allow aggression in and around a system and for extra you can include other other systems constilations and regions higher sec systems cost more to wardec in lower sec systems would then cost less this allows concord to monitor and contain conflict but at the same time for aggressing corps that really have a reason to fight can pay the premium and have no containment issues this gives the option for corps and alliances to fight over systems in highsec for any social conflict you can think of it gives carebears the option of spreading out to make a wardec cost more but at the risk of going solo now you can still fight outside of the designated fighting zone but you risk sec status taking regualar sec hits like you would in lowsec still without concord intervention for either party involved with the wardec that can be used for the protection of the defending corp as well as for ambushes for the agressing corpbuilding the mechanic for ending the wardec via contract of some kind is a great ideaby charging more for a larger area to fight in without penalty would help keep pointless wardecs minimized
this proposal its agenst afk clouckers hoo its siting in systems like days end weeks duing noting just disturbind ppl live there they need to be nerfed to my proposal its make like 50 unitsper cycle a heavy watter to run a cov ops clouck
this is a good idea in my opinion cause afk cloakers are very nasty and there is no way to detect them this would make the game more active if they have to check their fuel consumption
afk cloakers are harmless it is when they are just normal cloakers is when you need to start paying attention
no afk clouckers are not harmes until they where cov ops cynos fuel means sortern time to get target or go away so no siting stil in one system for days
good idea this needs to be changed definitely since all other things have been changed in nul sec
the troll it is meant to be on a diet
no that means more tinking how to use fuel not just hop in system and sit there for weeks
jesus christ shut the clouck up
may i direct you all to this answer by greyscale halfway down the post
quote from grayscaleafk cloaking i dont know if we have internal consensus on this havent asked recently and i know theres not consensus among the players there was some lively discussion of this at fanfest but im very much of the opinion that its a problem that players need to be given tools to solve
cloakers are not the problem the local tab that gives you a free warning a hostile is in system is the problem remove local
afk cloakers generate false intel  so they get benefits in game while being afki too would like to see 00 turning into barren wasteland
and how long would you propose a cycle lasts would there be fuel bays on bombersreconst3s what is the point of this
bump 16 may 2011
i am basically in support of this i had just finished creating a similar proposal when i encountered this see belowthe fair way of doing this would be to charge a plex or account fee for one month for each active training que you are paying this already for the first que the difference is that the ability to pay for a second que is fair to ccp allows you to train an alt simultaneously but you can only log into one alt at a timeit is effectively fair and limits the total server load at the same time heck pay triple normal and train all three altspoint for ccp this is a clear win over a second account since it gives two advantages1 only one character is online on the account server load is not increased2 players avoid spending on a second account due to hassle costing ccp potential revenue if they are able to pay for a second training que on demand that will be a convenient way to increase ccp income and allow characters to explore secondary aspects of the game more readilyjust my thoughts
so you either have drone protection near you during mining or out at your container or a little of both based on your skills what about secure containers another layer of theft protection for you but if your irritating new pirate buddy has a hacking module and some skills think an actual hacking panel pops up and you have to solve some kind of hacking puzzle that gets easier as your skills increase say goodbye to those rocks what about another tier of mining for those that dont want to go and get the ore right now well travel deep into the field and install a mining operation with real hired npcs that work it they mine the ore and accumulate it and when they are full to the gills with ore a message is sent to you to come get the goods now you have to fly your special asteroid field hauler down deep to get it these mining ops would be a pretty darn good target for pod pirates also but again they would probably be pretty deep in the field and tracking sensors would not be so great penetrating all those rocks in the way but still a very fun and challenging activity for ore theft pirates or those who just want to take out the whole operation i sense countermeasure for the miners here and that would be another skill at putting up defense at your proud new mining op i am also thinking some kind of manual flight fast maneuvering scan drones designed for asteroid fields would be a really cool addition for both miners scanning for ore deep down and for pirates trying to find you or your new mining op one final thought arent planetary rings supposed to be made out of rocks ice and various other types of debris yea that is on the wish list alsoi think that fairly sums it up at this point in time i looked down some of the proposals at the eve csm and saw that there are a lot of fairly good ideas out there and fixes that could be made you know repairs for simple ui stuff however no one seems all that concerned about the basic fabric of the game like the fact that ccp put air in space and that there is an up and down out in the void so hear me i am hoping that all players see and support my vision for a real space environment if these issues are bothering me so much deep down arent they bothering you to we need to band together and let our voices be heard to get these changes made my final question is are we happy flying around in an unrealistic environment that our senses of reason never really fully buy are we happy just jumping around to a limited set of fixed warp points doesnt it all kind of feel hollow i know planets feel real hollow when i warp or fly through them eve is a great game but i think with some base foundation overhauls it could be an incredibly immersive and exciting experience

the hell if i gonna read even one your threads entirely
paragraphs are the new rage i hear
lolwut can someone put all this together w punctuation so i can read it
i am sure that this idea has been brought up on several occasions but i find it necessary to continue expressing this idea so that the possibility of this idea can come to lifei would like you to consider the idea of creating a system that allows to either scan down cloaked vessels with considerable efforts of course or using special weaponsmods it should be difficult to scan down a cloaked ship or create a new weapon system which would for example explode in a given radius where you might think an enemy might be cloaked for instance a mobias missile would fly straight 25km and explode with a radius of 10km and anything cloaked wouldnt take damage but would be briefly exposed to other ships this idea is spawned from the constant issue with rival corpsalliance members coming into a system cloaking and going afk just to instill fear in others preventing them from rattingminingetc there should be a method for tracking these ships downif it works in other scifi worlds it should be considered in this one  not necessarily true however i really do find it particularly interesting that there hasnt been anything done with anticloaking on a more hightech levelthe difficulty in scanning down cloaked vessels would be a mix of requiring particular skills in order to facilitate this action and the time spent scanning down the particular ship in other words rather than shooting out some probes and being able to get a general scan of the system it would for instance require a pilot to scan down a general area where a cloaked pilot might be located then to concentrate the probes in that certain location to get a more specific location of the cloaked target and so on meaning that it would take considerable effort and time to scan down a cloaked target the idea is not to nerf cloaking in sense but like everything in game there needs to be a way to counter it the idea that a ship can sit in one spot in a system over several hours cloaked should be reviewed since it can be argued that even modern day physics could be used to conceive ways of detecting cloaked ships in space while i wont go as far as doing that i do think this should be reviewed considerably
what exactly does it mean to be difficult to scan something down do you mean high skill requirements or do you mean difficult from a gameplay standpoint because i can tell you scanning somebody down with probes isnt exactly difficult its just a question of how much theyre moving around and how small their sig radius isthe key question and no i dont have an answer is and has always been what are cloaks designed for if you can answer this youll be able to figure out if cloaking needs a nerf and if it does what that nerf might be
so another super op ship that almost nothing can stop but can be moved through highsec huh thought thats what we were trying to avoida t3 frig or destroyer wouldnt be op just so highly specialized with its subsystems that it would be a niche ship pros a highly specialized ship that could be refit on the fly to counter everchanging battlespace one ship with multiple subsystems instead of 12 ships each with its own not cheap fitting cons such high specialization means inherent weakness in other areas oh wait thats not a con thats an op fix
my god a minmatar t3 frigate would be the only ship i ever fly until they realize how grossly overpowered it is and nerf it into oblivion
from here
well i think the new system  that will go live on thursday  is not bad but a bit oversimplifiedi suggest the following 5 quality tiers  qua 20  qua 10  qua 0  qua 10  qua 20this way you feel like having progressed when you go from 20 to 10 for example plus you have to find a new agent and relocate which is a good thing imho more dynamicstill having only 5 quality tiers will result in more qua 20 agents and thus more spread out populationsi would remove true sec levels  in regards to missions  and only use 10 levels  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10because otherwise players will still find the 045 systems and overcrowd there then nothing has really changed in that regardend result should be to keep some flavor to the game while still simplifying the system and spreading out the population
supporting myself
no because then everything would be essentially the same way before tbh it would probably just be better to just find a new agent thats most likely not too far to mix it up
there has been something that has been bugging me its like a little gnat that wont go away i try to just forget about it and pretend that there is not a problem just use your imagination i keep saying but my senses and reasoning just keep at me and now i guess i just have to try and do something about it i think that all of you will agree with me that this little issue has been bugging you also i am sure to some they have just gotten so used to the status quo that they have fooled themselves into believing this is normal and shouldnt be fixed well what is it you ask the big bomb that can and will change the fundamentals of eve for the better and if you really think about it for the better open your minds and really envision what eve could be with some very fundamental changes it is this emersion and a taste of reality it is what we have all always really wanted to feel like you are actually there in the vastness of space spinning out of control hanging on to your wildly maneuvering ship by the seat of your pants just imagine racing through a vast asteroid field thousands of km deep fighting another pod pilot or npc with the consequences of hitting a floating rock at high speed ending in a wrecked ship also imagine if you will you are at full burn accelerating rapidly then you cut your engines and guess what you just float at a constant velocity because the last time i checked there is no atmospheric friction in space to slow you down it just makes sense to fix these little problems now that eve is over 8 years old but wait dont fret the point and click system will still be there for large complex ships that have a lot going on at one time making ship maneuvering difficultso here is what i am thinking remember keep your minds open and let me entertain you first off is to have a fixed camera panable mode that is somewhat representative of where the ships bridge or cockpit would be this mode would also give the pod pilot a real sense of ship scale so when you bank yaw and pitch around like a crazy person on fire you are really immersed in the action of course the normal camera modes that we all have grown to love so much would still be available and frankly would still have to be availableso how do we navigate this ship that is not really and airplane flying around in the troposphere ok hold on i am thinking 4 simple maneuvering modes i almost said flight modes oops flying is what we do in airplanes not ships in the vacuum of space these modes would include 2 combat modes and 2 free maneuvering modes i know what you are thinking combat will be so hard if you are falling all over the place with no friction to slow you down or help control the ship well we have the most advanced machines ever known to humans and they have control computers to help us out lets talk about the 2 combat modes first because i am sure all of the point and shoot pilots are shaking their heads about nowcombat mode 1 point and click almost like you have it now great for large complex ships that take a multitasking mutant like all of you battlecruiser and larger ship pilots out there you point and click where you want the ship to go and your ships control computer does all the work for you there is one hitch though and that is speed control thrusters wont work like you see them now they will only burn when you are accelerating or decelerating here is how this goes before you enter combat or during if you are crazy you will tell your mighty computer what maximum speed you want under combat situations you see ship mass and maneuvering thrust now becomes a factor as your speed increases so a large ship just cant swing its large fat well you know what i am about to say around as quickly as a small frigate it comes down to what is acceptable to you as the gods of space in turning radius and maneuverability for the ship you are piloting cont to next post
why the hell you needed to spread this trash out over five threads we will never know
according to this come may 19th the agent change will be implemented fragmenting all the current agent divisions into their respective divisions before i knew the specifics of the change i was all for them but now im probably going to augment my mission running strategy differentlyi run missions for impetus ikr lol because ive looked through which gallente corp id want to mission for and as id like to eventually go into exploration as well impetus had a lot of agents in border space that had fairly good quality however most if not all of these are either in the personnel or public relations division the administration agents are in low security space for the most parti could but i do have quite a bit of lp accumulated from all the mission running and it would be grudging work trying to get that back up for something as small as this also a post below states that more courier agents would serve the purpose of catching bots who earn effortless isk botting is an independent in this issue i would say because if there is a courier agent anywhere that generally gives good awards the botter will most likely go to them anyways there are bots that run encounter missions as well with irjunen being a big example of that there are a minority of people who do run courier missions on the side ie miners industrialists but they would already be running for say distribution marketing or financial agents this change gives people who run missions on the side for the most part more agents than they most likely need while a smaller pool is available for those who run encounters while my personnel agents do hand out some couriers for the most part ill be getting wellpaying encounter missions changing these two divisions at least to encounter agents will spread more people out instead of having every one run missions for caldari navy or federal intel officeside notesnarky comment iirc fed navy at least has personnel agents why would the main navy corp of an empire give out missions like rancorous researcher or lost that bet tldr come may 19th 10 former divisions will become distribution and 7 of them will become encounter for the most part people do encounter missions for isk both of the divisions listed above have over 50 encounter possibility as it is making them encounter division will diversify the new mission system even further
support the current scheme means many corps that used to have combat agents will now have none plus majority of agents in eve will be courier despite the fact that theyre mostly ran by just bots
might make identifying bots easier if ccp hadnt also cleared out the ability to see npc standings on other players in the same patch
there wont be much to see anyway corps with combat agents will usually also have courier agents bots can run those too there will be so many more courier agents everywhere
helloyou all might know that it is pretty healthy to delete the eve cache from time to timeproblem is whenever you do that all your saved passwords api keys in the ingame browser get deleted too for example blink jb planner etci think it would be very nice if the ingame browser isnt affected by the game browser cachecheersfiftyouts
and do you really need to activate a jump gate or even more silly a wormhole wouldnt it be more fun if you actually had to fly into the natural or jump gate generated wormhole i see lots of new and wonderful tactics here i am thinking the jump gate would actually generate wormholes at each end of its structure so that no matter what direction you come from you are going to end up almost right at the wormhole then all you have to do is a quick burn and the ship is off the nice thing about this is you dont have to worry about hitting the actual structure of the jump gate and be deflected off into nowhere what if someone puts objects around this new wormhole entry well that would be a new tactic for gate campers would it not lets talk about warping through planets and stuff like that all i can say is arent warp computers supposed to check if there are any large mass objects in the way before actually warping what about having curved warp paths around any large mass objects like planets stars and moons what if you come out of a station and your jump destination is directly on the other side well your jump computer wont allow you to jump until the point is clear of the station all of this is how things work in the real world and would add so much to the fun and emersion factor of eve i can hardly believe this stuff hasnt been fixed yet you wouldnt have to pretend anymore that you didnt just fly completely into a station on warp exit or travel through the center of a gas giant oh yea and planets and stars and moons would be solid also until we get the famous planetary flight option which would be very cool i think that if one approaches one of these objects too closely in an orbit yes i said orbit you will get a warning from your lovely computer voice advising that you are about to burn and die or in the case of a moon with no atmosphere get sucked down into its gravity well never to return or at least until we get moon landings from ccpwhat about mining yea i get bored sometimes how would it really be if you were out there hunting around for the good ore first of all arent asteroid fields usually pretty huge like small moons or planets that either didnt form or got blowed up so what about procedurally generating fields that stretch for thousands of kilometers and the deeper you go into them the more abundant the valuable rocks become and remember that collision system we already discussed now you have the challenge of piloting your mining barge deep into these fields to find the better rocks without hitting something solid and you cant just warp out because objects are in the way so you have to be clear of the field to be able to warp to safety of course everyone else has to travel into the field with the same risks to come and get you sorry capital ships may not fit oh and npc pirates may have to come in and get you also if they dare and they are probably just stupid enough to do it so now i am down deep mining my heart out on some kernite wait how the hell do i get my ore back to the station without having to haul my hinny back through this field welcome your new drone buddy the hauling drone this sweet baby can haul all yer precious rock back to a secure or nonsecure container that you dropped off at the edge of the field before entering it you just fill it up and then either a buddy hauls it to the station or when it is full you now make the trip back out and go get your hauler so what about that container if i was a pirate looking to steal something your container would be a sweet target for me and shouldnt npc pirates be interested in sealing what they can carry also so how do we lone miners protect ourselves from this well we now have 2 new abilities that allow us to anchor combat turrets near these containers and to program our little scout drones to stay and play watch dog cont on next post
i think that instead of having to arse end the ship around every time you want to slow down we have the technology to make temporal thrust reversers that actually create a temporal bubble behind the ship that takes the thrust from your powerful engines and reverses it this would be a really cool graphic effect also so you want to get from where you are now to your buddy who is 200km away ok select your bff and a little menu pops up well pretty much what happens when you select something in space now except you can enter a velocity that you want to be at when you reach your bud so i want to be stopped when i get to 2500m from him or her you dont want to run into them cuz that would not be cool set 0 in an entry window and the computer will calculate a switch point where you need to go from blow to suck lol that was funny at least i thought so set 100ms and you will blow a little longer than you suck ok sorry my apologies just try not to run into your bud as i will explain later now i have to admit this reference system isnt perfect in this mode because for it to really work well you can accelerate however you want to a certain velocity but when the computer tells you to pull back on the reigns you had better do it now and you had better do it at full reverse if you dont you will not be at the speed you entered into the window at the beginning of all this one last thing coming to a full stop can sometimes be hard especially now that the ccp gurus have removed all atmospheric friction from space again no problem hitting the all stop button will give control to the computer so it can stop you completely from any speed or maneuveracceleration mode 4 is the famous autopilot mode from airplane where the blowup guy pops up to help you out pretty much all you do is select an object 0ms will automatically be entered into the window because the autopilot thinks you want to be stopped when you get to 2500m from said object and hit the engage button the autopilot does all the rest and gets you to where you need to go so now you can sit back a drink totties i dont know if it would be necessary to be able to set a thrust setting for the autopilot for those that dont want to accelerate at full in something like a dramiel so what do you guys think of the flight modes i am thinking pretty coollets talk about collisions because i just hate it when i fly through someone i am thinking 2 types of collisions one would be between 2 objects that both have shields and one would be between you and an object that doesnt have shields like big rocks and debris shield vs shield collisions would basically deflect based on the mass of each object so the smaller object would be deflected a lot more than the large object to the point if a frigate ran into a titan the titan wouldnt even feel it but the frigate would be deflected fully i sense some new tactics here shield vs solid object collisions would suck a lot more for the ship with shields because the rock dont care if it gets hit and it is usually a lot more solid i am thinking there would be damage to the shields on your ship based on how fast you hit the rock and at what angle ie did you head on or did you just graze it so for example i think a reasonable speed to head on a rock is 500ms when you do this all your shields are gone but you still have armor and hull which arent as good with collisions so now when you hit an object you are dead unless you are going at say less than 100ms ok you head on the rock at 600ms sorry you are dead do you see some really exciting possibilities here whipping through those huge asteroid fields in a pvp fight where one wrong turn could be the end or the end of your shields now dont you hate it when you warp through a planet or after coming out of warp you just smack right into a jump gate cont on next post sorry post is so long
can you see how this opens up so many options for you to fine tune how you want to pilot a particular battle just give us options and control right if you use your keyboard or a joystick to control your thrust going full throttle is just telling your computer that hey i want full speed as entered previously say 200ms for a battleship or 700ms for a frigate pulling the thrust lever all the way back tells the computer that you want to stop what if you are using a joy stick that is spring loaded to center well no problem just put the stick where you want the speed to be and you program one of the joystick buttons to lock that speed into the computer and voilUFFFD the computer adjusts the speed to match what the stick was at when you pressed the button combat mode 2 is for the small ships and the control freaks like me who want to really be in charge of where the ship goes this mode would also go hand in hand with the locked bridge camera mode speed control for this mode operates exactly the same as in combat mode 1 where you preset the max speed you now actually pilot the ship on all axis points that joystick you were using also controls roll with a left or right movement oh and you can also do things with that mac daddy joystick like program other buttons to fire groups of weapons or activate armor repairers again the choice is yours the mouse would have 2 modes that you toggle back and forth from the first being the normal curser mode and the second pulls up a little direction targeter that the ship will follow in pitch and yaw what if i want to maneuver the ship in pitch and yaw with my mac daddy joystick again no problem you go to settings and tell the game you want to pilot with the joystick instead of the mouse now your mouse only acts in pointer mode like we are all used to and you would use 4 keys on your keyboard to control thrustspeed and roll acceleration mode 3 is the first of the you guessed it acceleration modes this mode is how a ship should really act in the vacuum of space the control computer still helps you though so that you dont go tumbling around like you are in a dryer however if you really want to you can turn off the maneuvering control computer and just pitch roll or yaw the ship on any axis while still moving in a straight line through space so yes you can well fly backwards or sideways with the control computer active maneuvering acts the same way as it does in combat mode 2 just watch the velocity because your maneuvering radiuses will get real large as you zip around at high speed thrust control in this mode is a lot different than the combat modes there is no max speed to set into the computer and yes you got it there is no max velocity on the ship because there is no atmospheric friction in space instead what you have is max acceleration and conversely deceleration based again on the mass of your ship and the available thrust it can put out along with how much thrust you set via your trusty joystick or keyboard so lets say a battle ship can accelerate at 20mss it would take 10 seconds at full thrust to reach 200ms and if you want to go 1000ms you would burn for 50 seconds and if you want to go 10000ms you would burn for 500 seconds now here is the catch i am thinking that there would really be a max velocity more on you than the ship at say 5c or one half the speed of light where the laws of relativity would destroy your soul without the protection of a warp bubble can you imagine the possibilities in eve to really go where no human has gone before or at least be able to get to the star lit side of a planet that you never get to see because there is no bookmark at that location one more thing what about deceleration there are no thrusters on the front of the ship cont on next post
i full heartly support the nerf but i was expecting a few things to happen with ita no local unless ihub mod is activeb longer range on jump bridgec rework faction spawnsd rework complexesby rework i mean make harder tougher back to it needs a 10 man fleet to do a 1010 and a 5 man fleet to do a 510also make factions spawns have sleeper ai most people are sick of tags and ammo
do try and think about what you say before you look like a total foolafter all using your own words one would think your definition of this game is just as biased as you blaming malcanis for the same thingand ditch the red text totally fail when it comes to seriousnesstldr version  says the pot calling the kettle blackpersonally i dont have too many issues with the changes if it breaks the status quo in 00
hahahahahahanot supported
this dude really hates the color blindalso not supported i like my worthless 00 all the greedy types left i think that they should make ships randomly explode reactor failures happenpersonally id like to see eve rolled back to the apocrypha client but thats because it was less laggy
the tyrannis deepsafe nerfwhen the tyrannis expansion went live the poseidon method of making deefsafespots was disabled sometime during the expansion all objects including bookmarks were moved inwards to the deepsafe limit this limit is a sphere centered on the local star with a radius of the celestial object most distant from the local star plus 20 astronomical units so for example if the celestial object furthest away from the local star is a regional stargate 67 au from the star then the deepsafe limit is a sphere 87 au in radiusif this proposal were to be implemented it would be a simple matter to limit the probebeacon to the deepsafe limit additionally it would put everyone on equal footing with players who were collecting old deepsafespots from pretyrannis and who still have those deepsafespots today granted those deepsafespots would have been moved to the edge of the limit but old players could very well have collections of bookmarks surrounding a solar system sitting on that sphere because their bookmarks were moved in to that sphere during tyrannis for large solar systems thats still a lot of volume to hide in not impossible to be found by probes just a little bit difficult combat probes are really only going to have problems in solar systems that have celestial objects 300 or 400 au from each othersupported
when you need a fleet warpin this would replace the need to have a friendly ship at the destination with the need to have had a friendly ship at that location some time in the last 2 hoursi can see lots of uses for this to get around the current crushing unworkability of bookmark propagation then again might be better to just fix bookmarks
make them findable and destructible by enemies and ill support  but not warpable by enemies a ship that is used as a warp target has all these characteristics that should be preserved im concerned though about the case where if a bubble is dropped on the routes from a gate to every other celestial in the system currently that will snag anyone that doesnt have a saved safe spot bookmark which is good say the system is my alliances home sure normally the gate would be bubbled toowith arbitrary probes then i can make safes without actually going there which is bad that eliminates any home turf advantage to people who do know the system and chasing people around in the system can be extrodinarily difficult making hiding in any system too easy one tweak would be to make probes get stopped by bubbles but that would have consequences to scanners but perhaps that isnt a bad thing 
welcome to online gaming customer care starts off great with loads of well never be those peoplethen after dealing with 100000 petitions a week people start to grow a hunch back and rsi from copy and pastingi do not evny the gms i would prefer a simple sorry i cant help you here let me forwards it to someone who can rather than copy pastabut in some areas they can do everything perfectly and you will need to be patientif you get a reply which equates to logs show nothing and you know its ccps fault then ask to be forwarded to a senior gmhowever if you lagged out because of your internet had a poop or didnt have enough tank etc etc you will likely get nothing backi can also recommend that you post a thread in missions  complexes with has x ever happened to youid suggest you do this every time you loose a ship in a mission to weird space voodoo magic see if anyone else has been effected and see how the gms responded to themfrankly posting in assembly will get you no where
terrible troll is terriblemost petitions get answered in what 10 hours these days and if you get a bad answer from the gm you can easily get it escalated to a senior gm and go from thereive lost two ships to wonky circumstances this year and they were willing enough to replace my ships within a few days maybe you need to try harder next timeinb4 lol dont fly what you cant afford to lose
ok here it is im not whining for no reason i have a 193 sec status i jumped into a a 10 space i know i have to be under 20 which i was after 2 weeks ratting in 00 i double checked everthing and it was fine i jump in and boom my abaddon dies so i petition and 4 days later nothing not even a sorry we dont show anything on our logs i have stayed in same system and only left station 1 time in a ship to see if i would die againi didnt so that means they have bugged and i have to wait 4 days without a reply and its not the point of dont fly something you cant afford to lose i had no intention on losing it i was setting a course to jita to sell it to replace my nightmare that died due to unknown circumstances which didnt get replaced either after waiting 3 days so in all im not whining just feel that ccp dont give a fuxx about its existing customers only getting new 1s every day i wait it makes me want to stop playing why should i give my UFFFDUFFFDUFFFD to play a game that thinks it can rob you of your rights when it wants
week long delays in dealing with petitions is the biggest problem in eve

you are doing it wrong  caracal is a damage projection platform not a frontline tankertackler  moa excels at that sp meh you see the same thing with amarr and the glass omen vs maller gallentes thoraxvexor is loads more fun as they have completely different tactics due to bonuses both are actually capable of doing anything they want be it short or long range minmatar have the rupture that is capable of everything no further ship required the single most boring of the lot but also one of the bestcruisers are borked mainly due to tiers they should be differentiated by rolesbonuses first and foremost the differences in ehp can remain largely unchanged
supporting this
so goons would control jitastainwagon would control amarrand drf would control renswould be awesome
bah i completely missed this thread months ago you know when i was actually playingbut i certainly read this as mittani being a lobster to end of eve converter not exactly sure how one might benefit from such a device but there you have it
so youre saying there is an actual end to eve
big changes whos going to determine what is a big change and what isntccp could change one variable on one ship  but if it happens to be the only ship that i fly id consider it a big change even if most eve players have never boarded the ship
feedback from a  1year playerthe agent system was confusing between tutorial agents career agents mission agents storyline agents etc all representing they are in a corp it was very confusing to get started with this game faction agents telling you that sorry i dont work with people i dont know after you just ran an important storyline mission for them made no sensethe corp system was also confusing i spent time trying to figure out how to join the military school because i wanted to train my military skills but you cant because the military school was just another npc corp i tried finding an agent for my npc corp to run real missions for of course thats not necessary and ultimately pointless players are expected to instinctively know the difference between their starting npc corp a player corp and an npc corp that you run missions for very confusing at first typical help channel discussionnew playernp hey i finished the profession tutorial missions what should i do nowhelp join a corpnp im in a corphelp which corp are you in oh thats an npc corpnp okay but im not sure i want to join another corphelp then go run missions for a corpnp which corp my npc corphelp no a real corpnp like a player corphelp no like republic fleetnp how do i join republic fleethelp you dont need to join it just run missions for itnp i tried they said i wasnt experienced enough thought that meant i needed to join ithelp you need a lower quality agent like this one linknp thats 42 jumps awayhelp look up one closer linknp there are like 200000 corps how do i pick the right oneetcyou need to implement a better transition from running the tutorial missions into running real missions give new players suggestions as to where to go next after the profession tutorials are done i went from doing all of the profession missions to the soe arc where after 40 or so doable missions i got blown up repeatedly attempting to finish the storyline if someone had pointed me toward a low quality caldari navy agent in a nearby system i could have saved many hours of frustration why not implement a simple focus option at the end of the profession mission lines asking them if theyd like to do more profession missions or move on to a real agent and give them a quick rundown of nearby agents in their profession of choiceat a very early point i was evemailed by a ccp rep asking if i had any questions or needed any help i said no thanks why did i do that when i was struggling because i didnt even know the right questions to ask maybe if that mail had been a bit moreengaging for example ask what i was working on if i was having trouble accomplishing a goal etc not surei wish i had written this post months ago because now the frustrations i experienced in month one are fading being pointed to the eve survival guide helped a lot but i was weeks in before another player sent me there a collection of outlines might help with typical career choices made by successful players in the past in their first few weeksonce i got back onto track running missions for an l1 combat agent for a randomly picked corp roden shipyards i started to get frustrated by some of the missions mining for dolls really look i have a sense of humor but a new player trying to grok this game doesnt need something ed like that thrown in and how many doll mining missions did my combat agent give me same mission at least 45 times in the first week oh and its a 4part mission lovely why not decline em because it gave me a very ominous warning about not doing so that i didnt entirely understand so hours chipping at rock for yet another doll woot
we need to remeber that we all were noobs beforei like eve because its different from other games it hard when you pop you dont just jump right back into the picture with your ship at that point in eve you have to think am i saying that other games you do not have to thinki guess i did go figure but i will help out a noob like i was help out when i started go figure
im totally constrained by this i prefer unlimited local fittings
signedi use way more than 50 fittingsjust for my pvp ships i fly every subcap in the gameeasy to blow through 50 fittings
defeniently supported 50 fits doesnt cut it plus i wanna know how to fit ships i plan on flying in future and being able to save that proven fit helps alot when the time comes around when you have the skills to do this
the time you find your self in the middle of all that mess with over 50fits you can use your brains and do it faster50 is already a big number for dumb actions click  go there is a lot of other small stuff that really needs to be improved than thatnot supported
yes yes yesyou pay isk and time to get in onego figure
good idea
those limitation dont solve the problem as perhowever an alias history just like the employment history would fix that while requiring a degree of due diligence on the part of investigators
the issue is indeed that ccp keeps claiming that changing name removes consequences this contrary to the use of disposable alts see jita local buyingselling chars and the impossiblity to see who is whos alt yes i know that last one wouldnt be trivial also i want api access to who is online name change should just be implemented for those with horrible names like me with a few constraintslimitted uses no list of 800 aliases although cost would also deter thatalways being able to see what is the new name when you got the old namealways being able to see what was the old name when you got the new name then it is much less a removal of consequences than all the other mechanics already present
if you own a sc or have ever had the bad touch put on you by one support this
flying the flag for great justice
i am not supporting this however once a ship is tackled in a bubble it should not be able to get away there have been too many times i have seen the logoffski trick used to save supercarriers and titans that it is just ridiculous if a ship is engaged and tackled it should be there until the end of the fight
i think a longer timer is warranted in the case of tackled supercapitals other than that things are fine
the 60 second log off and 15 minute aggression timers both need a reworkthey need to be relative to a size and class of ship b nature of aggression
ive only lost one kill in 35 years of playing due to a logoffski it was a freighter jumping blindly through low sec and when he saw my little 2 man camp he logged since he wasnt aggrod when he logged he would have vanished after 1 minute but whats worse is we couldnt even lock him while his ship slowly emergency warped away that said i think the basic mechanics are fine the only ship class i think that might need a change to that are titans and scs principally because they take more than 15 minutes for a subcap fleet to actually kill i would support having super caps never disappear from space no matter how long the pilot is logged
or to play devils advocate we could change the game so that ships stay in space regardless of whether the pilot is logged in or notthe catch there is deciding whether a ship in space is abandoned and needs to be cleaned up by the janitor after 30 days or so
i agree they shouldnt disappear if they are tackled but other than that everything is fine
i give you the benefit of the doubt and suppose you havent thought what you are asking so i will explain the game effect1 lowsec00 end of my playing time i log off at a safespot unagressed by anyone2 after 1 minute something wander in and use dscan to locate my general position 3 after another 23 minute he has pinpointed my ship with probes4 he warp to my unoccupied ship and still has 10 minutes to kill my ship without the harderners workingi hope this is not what you want i think this is what the op want and this i can support
1st your dumb because those mechanics are there to protect every one including your dumb ass2nd if your fun is about kill pods then youre just too lazynot prepared masochist kill some pod in war ok just for fun3rd tasty tears moar pliz
stealth bombers covert ops force recons black ops should all be able to warp while cloaked after all they all are paper thin 
bops arnt paper thinyou clearly have no idea what your talking about please stop postingbar the sin bops are fine as they are they simply need bigger jump range  fuel bay and not by much either or they would become oppersonally i would say 20 extra jump range and 300 more fuel bay
nothis is not stoyour not going to see qit takes time to travel that is the factface it you can have everythinggo figure
travel times are a bit long and traveling is boring and discouraging they could be reduced a bit supported
id be in favour of a set of changes that make warp speed more meaningful with greater variation between ship classes bigger ships should be slower than at present and smaller ones noticeably faster
damn i like this ideal at lest it keeps it going now let me guess which npc corp will have it in its lp storenow if we can get ccp to let us consume the other quafe drinks
i support the idea of creating some way to purchase quafe zero not necessarily the original suggestion
noquafe zero was a gift if ccp puts that item in the lp store then that will defeat the whole purpose of making quafe zero a limitededition item and if you want to make this product available in the lp store why not add the limitededition snowball turrets as well what about the primae or the echelon what about the zyphers that cant be attacked by sleepersalso lets not forget that people are collecting these rare items as a novelty item sort of like a collectors edition if you add these items to the lp store or make them sold by npc agents then the items lose their novelty value
that would be kool
good idea docking  undocking could stand to be a bit more glamorous as long as it doesnt add to docking  undocking timesnow we do have these timers which prevent ship changes  redocking maybe ccp could work out the mechanics to fit within these time frames
what about the idea of a blank skill that can be trained while you are away on vacation or in my casemoving across the country and will be without the internet for some time once you are able to come back online you would be able to allocate those points where you want them
sounds like a wonderful way to train up a skill you arent remapped to

1 its one thing to take up industry its another to troll about other professions u have no experience or knowledge about especially when u have such a ty killboard despite a fleet to hide behind2 oh dont take my word for it check the killboard ure crying so much about3 right cause ppl would disengage from a guaranteed lol killmail on a smacktard like u great thinking there and u have a funny way of showing indifference with all those caps4 refer to 11 it means that they can be one and the same ure just unable to comprehend that2 when u cry so much even about the costs of suicide ganking of course 10s r gonna cry about losing their own exhumers3 lol and thats why u fail at pvp and industrynews flash seeing as how ure too stupid to figure it out by now money is no object to me but apparently even pennies r too much to u because u still fail at industry its your own fault ure poor not mine and 10s as riskaverse and ultraparanoid as they r arent gonna leave their exhumers untanked unless theyre as stupid as u and even then its their loss either waybased on the length of your trolling ure possibly one of my suicide gank victims because once again ure probably too poor to afford a replacement exhumer since that would apparently be too much money for u and the best part u cry about embarassment when ure in no position to judge anyone at all because a loser like u is so scared of failing that he doesnt even try even with a fleet to hide behind as shown by your sorry excuse of a killboard and a hater like u would naturally talk smack about someone else when uve got nothing to show for yourself so unless u have something to show plz bump the thread and hate some moreid really love to hear it last time i checked money laundering aiding and abetting criminals and other illegal dealings r still illegal so your point is invalid and irrelevant
not according to concord which is why im an unhappy panda
skimmed through and missed it but since u asked nice and u asked twice sureahem low sec is a deserted wasteland it is common knowledge and so many ppl have stated it as well in addition to proposals to revitalize low sec it has pretty much all of the disadvantages of 00 and none of its advantages the prey have left low sec for high sec or 00 because having to docksafespot means ure not making isk and even if they do hire an escort the profit split will not be worth the trouble compared to high sec or 00 the only ppl remaining r the pirates and they eventually desert low sec to make isk under a high sec alt because they know what happens when they become the prey furthermore the pirates also complain they end up fighting each other out of boredom as if they do not want to face the risk of doing so and when killmailwhoring and riskaversion goes unchecked and it gets too onesided this is what happens selfdefeating habits of farming low sec to extinction and hours sometimes days of waiting for nothing for both sidestheres been tons of proposals relating to boosting low sec rewards and nerfing high sec but the truth is no amount of added low sec rewards or nerfing high sec will entice a carebear to come because even if that happens it will just attract more pirates to chase them out again the only ppl who propose this r the pirates themselves because they only want more targets therefore the only true low sec fix is to cut down on how easily the pirates can sustain themselves especially with a high sec altto plug in the loopholes besides player donations1 all sec status drops in this way will come with a warning so newbies wont be tricked into it2 all of these sec status drops will penalize both parties by reducing sec status all the way down to the exact amount of whoevers lower including direct trades3 ejectingjettisoning will also have the same sec status drop as a trade since that is aiding and abetting as well this does not apply in high sec if a 5 or lower attempts to steal from a jetcan npc customs will confiscate everything stolen pirate still keeps his ship however in high sec if it was ejected from someone whos not 5 or below then the ship gets destroyed with no loot4 accepting a contract from an outlaw will have the same penalty5 if an outlaw attempts to accept a contract a mail will be notified to whoever made the contract asking if he is willing to accept the consequences of aiding an outlaw if so same sec status penalty applies to the contract maker6 all market orders can be arranged with the option of sec status factored in and all outlaw orders will be highlighted in red buying or selling to an outlaw will incur the penalty7 if even 1 corp share is owned by an outlaw the corps ceo will be penalized the same way the instant he starts paying dividends8 once again all of these sec status drops come with a warning9 all of the above is void if both parties r above 5is this gonna outright ban pirating hardly pirates will still be able to gank to their fullest extent they just now have to face the consequences of low sec status keep up above 5 pvp in 00 or continuously open new accounts to launder money more revenue for ccp because biomassing low sec status alts is a bannable exploit risk vs reward the consequences of downtime will give piracy actual meaning give sec status actual meaning give the prey breathing room to help repopulate low sec and make pirates think twice before averting risk by farming newbies all day and avoiding each other pirates vs pirates have no penalties after all rather than a deserted low sec farmed to extinction where the predators r too scared to prey on each other and would rather sustain themselves in the safer space that their prey stays in low sec would now truly be a steppingstone between the safety of high sec and the freeforall of 00
according to you i am now in chronological ordera pirateafraid of pvpa highsec pvperan industrialista mineryour excellent deductive skills sound reasoning and general sensemaking is astounding please continue
 that just remove cloaks altogether and replace them with something elsecloaks were stupid from the beginning this isnt star trek
no
poit its give cloucker a time to get target or get out i tink inaf for 23 hours or so i not tinking that afk siting is soem interaction that just anouing evryonecloucks are okey until they to have limitations
agreed require fuel or require cloaks use cap when cloaks are in use allows no cap regen this will make it require cloaky afkers to decide whether to engage or not in a few hours the longer they wait the more chances of them not being able to have cap to kill the enemy ship
lol at the tears in this thread quit whining and grow a pair
id go further  cloaks use fuel skewed by mass and role cloaked titans are you insane they are the size of manhattan the fuel is contraband in empire due to faction police disapproval of rampant criminal abuse ie no hiding haulers from empire wars  and only traded in low sec cloaks give aggro you want to safespot in your ratting raven you need a pos cloaks set cap recharge and shield regen to zero cloak up to regen your logistics rorqal no chance

problem is this wouldnt stop scammers as many that ive seen use the 14 day free trial for this scam as api checks may link you to the account also you only need the skill at level 1 to worki still think the best way to work is that if the order cannot be fulfilled then it should be hidden from the marketor to remove all the extra hassle just remove the skill not advised or wanted but the best solution is normally the simplest
considering it is impossible to know if the buy orders are real or a scam i am for this skill to be looked into not the complete removal but how it works in relation to the person putting up the buy order and their wallet balance
we need a bank or bank systemwhat i would like to see is a bank that you can put your isk in and you get something out of it or you can get a cd or something like it and you can draw isk from it like in real life now on the other side you can fin forgot how to spell it a ship the longer you play the better you would have chance of getting isk like large corp or alliance can bank and have good chance of making isk remember butterfly effect or you may call sandbox
no we dont
this is a simple proposal to make faction guns worth using over their t2 counterparts the way i propose to accomplish this is just to make the specialization skill apply to any weapon meta5 and over instead of just the t2 version additionally they should be able to use t2 ammo
supported i meant to bring that up in the dev question thingy but flat out forgot as i typed the post  along with that id like to see 5x run bpcs for all navy turretslaunchers added to their respective navy lp stores in any case as it stands faction turrets cost 50x what t2 costs and are inferior in both damage and effective range its a shame really
yes i agree we pay top price they should have something special about them plus i think if you match the item to the ship it should give you something
support
i support my own proposal having faction guns would allow players to pimp their pimp pvppve ships a bit more and additionally will great more options to spend lptagsisk on additionally it would make sense to make pirate faction guns a bit better than navy faction guns piratenavyt2 having the spec skill will make faction guns a bit better and t2 guns will still have the advantage of t2 ammo and price as it is now the t2 ammopricespec skill make them worthless
i have always felt the same way
would this allow t2 ammo to be used in faction guns
no the op only says that the spec skill would now apply to meta5 guns
then i wont support this compare barrage m with faction nuclear and tell me why you would ever use the faction over the t2
i might agree to that boost for officer guns but thats itfaction guns are only worth it for certain fittings or newbs lacking the skills for t2 and thats how it should be tbhprice tag of faction guns is of no relevance to their performance only to what ppl are willing to pay for
always wanted this
ok ouch here is the paragraph take the air out of space let us control the movement of our ships make objects in space solid and finally add more to mining and asteroid fields done
no
and you needed 5 threads for that whyalso if you want to discuss your idea this is the wrong place go to featureideas discussion forums and post all in one threadsome titles tldr and punctuation and not such a big wall of text would help you no scratch that would help us a lot in understanding you
agreed please develop the code for this physics engine when its done say by mid 2014 submit it to ccpthe core concept is very good you need make this happen hint start from open source student projectyou may collaborate with these guys eve fan
here is the deal this site is about fixes and proposals not about sarcasm and writing lessons i have obviously offended with my proposals it always amazes me what people will write hiding behind their keyboards in these online games and forums i am only trying to be constructive by the way source code for space games should only be written with real physics engines and the fact that you all buy off on the utter lack of it time and again never ceases to amaze me flavien brebion is writing the source code for a real physics engine game so i dont need to smarty of coarse you are probably right it wont be done til 2014 was hoping i could inspire a change here in the mean time but i guess you cant teach old dogs new tricks
using real physics would involve the removal of ftl which would break the game
require cloaks to use cap which drains over a few hours with no regeneration while cloakthe issue i see is this it requires 0 power to stay cloaked it is a active module that requires no cap to keep itself running nearly everything in game requires cap to keep itself up that is active why not have a ship that slowly drains the cap over a few hours with no cap regeneration while cloaked this will force cloaked ships to decide whether a fit a cap booster on their ship and reduce cargo space for ammo for batteries or b stop cloaking for days at a time and only spend the limited time they have efficiently either way it is bs that i can sit in a rival system for days checking only a few times a day to see if i can get a easy kill in my pilgrimstealth bomber many times people have solely reduced a military 5 system down due to the fact they can just sit there afk
fixedjust ignore the afk cloaker at most just rat in something you dont care about losing
whyits not broking so dont fix it
id much rather see the existing frigate classes made relevant before they at more  to the pileeaf are useless and need lots of loveinterceptors are obsolete thanks to the dramielassault frigates still need a buffi guess bombers are the only ones that seem to be okayalso the promised iteration on t3 cruiser subs and balancing the existing t3 content should come first sure the tengu is okay but what about the proteus loki and the poor legion the non missile tengu variants are worse than an eagle or at best on par and it only cost 8x as muchthey have maybe 1 fit each that isnt crap and im not sure if the legion even has one
bump
as the name implies it would be nice if you could store your ship and your pod in the capital jump with the capital and die with the capital please post constructive replies only
this has been suggested hundreds of times and doesnt work eves code cant handle more than one player per ship if i remember rightly
i know this is ccps stock answer to this proposal but surly there is a way to do it why couldnt they just write it in a different way ie instead of docking in the carrier you attach your ship to it and when the carrier jumps you get dragged through with it you can also put restrictions on it like carrier may only be attached to as many ships as it would normally be able to fit in the ship maintenance baythis would also solve the standard issue of what happens if your docked in the carrier and the pilot logs of as it would just mean you deattached from the carrierive always wanted something like proper docking with carriers but am well aware off ccps coding problems 
i think they do has well since theyre the first concerned but sometimes even in the best cases where code is ultra ubber super nice fun etc a little action means hundreds or thousands of code line is that a real issue important for the game developing or players experience looks more like epeen stuff
not really i think that has more to do with older players helping out newer players and not in the ive got candy in my van way i think there are some downsides to putting this in game though 1 the most obvious being force projection granted this would provide more force projection to newer corpsplayersalliances but can you imagine the implications in null sec2 players are undoubtedly to grief newer players with this adding a constant stream of petitions is generally not a good idea3 my god i can only imagine the possibilities to cause trouble and manipulate the game in high lag situations with this
heres a simpler way for them to do this you must put your ship in the ship maintenance bay and then attach your pod in the carrier it would not be like docking more like viewing another ship also when you log in without the carrier pilot being logged on you would auto detach and auto appear from where the carrier safes upnotice that the carrier is nowhere to be seen you would have no influence on the carrier other then to detach your pod from the carrier when it is logged on
yes i agree their sould be some way
i have a proposal for the csm that will solve quite a lot of problems facing some folks in empire whilst at the same time forcing players to join together its quite simple1 new players spend two to four weeks in the traditional npc corp like they always have but now2 they get booted from the corp after their graduation period and3 become neutral in empire with no affiliation allowing us to  4 blow the absolute bejeusus out of themnow whya botting bastards are most often than not found in npc corps after a month fair gameb point 2 would force legitimate players to find a proper corporation thus improving the social aspect of the game and making it fun for everyonec because its a fun thing to do to teach the hard lessons of eve yeah folks remember those days but mostly fun destroying a bunch of botters or allow us to wardec npc corpsthank you
yes i see your point even make it where pc corps gets better missions i left a corp to get in the scope well it suck the corp channel suck i thought the scope was news but the member didnt  just put it it was just another npc corpjust let you know i like to solo but it is fun and the sandbox thing when you log on you see if you are at war if so what are you going to do that is eve
so you want to have easy kills on players who cant defend themselves under the very poor disguise of shooting botters whats next removal of all npc bounties and asteroids to combat botters and rogue drone loot of course if you would want to hurt botters the first thing you need to ask always is if it hurts botters actually more than legit players nowdoes a botter or a newb know better how to corphop indeed the botter so he doesnt have much of an issueis a botter or a newb faster with logging offcloaking up when a wt enters local exactly the botter so he doesnt have much of an issue in other words try low sec or 00 instead of asking ccp for easy targets who dont shoot back
im not asking for easy targets i can get them any day in lowsec  00 what im proposing is a fix to a really stupid game mechanic ccp claims that one of their goals is to bring people together to work fight play together then why promote solo play by letting people stay in noob corps they dont like it tough thats eve at least it used to bekilling botters is just a nice side effect doesnt take much to formjoin a corp for those who stick in the npc ones
so you want to let people socialise by kicking them out of corporations with thousands of players in them and forcing them into onemen corporations eve is a sandbox stop forcing people how they should play in the sandbox
there are better ways to stop bottersthere is no need to force players to be social although i agree it would be better for them it is up to them to decide how they want to play eve
yes i like them and its like we are making the history and future what did you do hire someone from wow
you mean find another agent nearby to get different kind of missions hmm i guess that will be the way to go after next patch if you want some variation i will remove the division part of the proposal as ccp will never consider changing that back since they would have to mess with skillbooks againi am trying to remember how the mission terminals worked in swg precunge but it has been so long  i believe you could choose between several missions and several types perhaps that could be interesting
i agree they all seem to be the same you hear this csm this is you job to do something
i think we should have it where you dont know what is on the other sidemaybe i missed somethink but we should have where we can share or sell the location of the wh to others
instead of a pool of funds id like the chance to have a personal wallet so i can assign funds towards different things ie planetry stuff building stuff research i think it would be easier to track how much money i spend on any thing
spreadsheetsbestowing the gift of knowing how much iskies are required beforehand at many convenient internets near youfor serious though if youd go to the bother of keeping track of multiple personal wallet divisions to figure your expensesprofits afterwards just faceroll a spreadsheet to figure your expensesprofits beforehand
or if you prefer a more progressive response with a little less snark try supporting this proposal insteadmultiple wallets
i first raised this in 2008 and we had csm support at the time ccp said no from what i recall the three years since im doubting they have changed their mind
in my opinion it would be very handy to access the customs office via a bookmark i made of it so i have just bookmarks of customs offices i actually use and could right klick in space to access them currently i just have the navigation options present in the bookmarks menu
sure it would be unrealisticat least i wanna see a vector where my ships direction is pointing too
very good ideaps the pos system have to rework anyway 
are you playing the same game that the rest of us here areyou wouldnt happen to be a babylon 5 fan would you or applying for nasa
this is mostly related to logistics ships and rr in generalso what is the problem with itkillmailsnulllow sec  repairing on stations or logging offso the first issue is that you want to get on killmails but you cant well this idea is that everything you rep that gets on a killmail transfers you on to it as well maybe under a subheading of supportsecond issue when someone repairs on a station or logs of the aggression of the person they have been assisting does not transferthis means that you can repair someone on a gatestation you can dockjump with no penalty against youthis also means that you can log off so long as no one has caused aggression against you and vanish in 60 secondsboth of these are considered unfair as well it should be risk versus reward
its not about mining per se its about bots that run pi that run courier missions that run kill missions bots that trade etc ppwhat you get is singularitynothing you do as a player has any meaning over there just dock and get a new ship for nothing killed someone he reships killed an alliance they just get a new bunch of scs and come againearned your first freighter so let that macro there run for a week and you can makebuy three of themearned your first sc so let those macros there run for a week and makeget 5 of them
under no circumstances shall a game mechanic be introduced through which cva could claim to be the legitimate government of amarr
im training to use t2 guns on a abaddon at the moment and you need large energy turret l5 then large pulse spec 1 to use the large pulse t2 and the moment i get large energy turret l5 to unlock the capital energy turrets i then only need capital energy turrets l1 to unlock themi think for battleship t2 guns or missiles launchers whatever weapons use on battleship to me it seems a bit excessive to have to get large energy turret l5 i think to get it l4 would be more reasonablet2 heavy and sentry drones may need to be looked at aswell if were to lower the skill requirements for battleship t2 guns and missile launchersall the battleships i think are like this and i only have amarr left to do on my main so isnt going to matter for me but would help others i think
all of the t2 guns need size weapon v why should large be any different
i think the training time for a t2 gun for bs shouldnt be virtually the same as a gun for a dread seems bonkers
move along people nothing to see here
thank you trebor i look forward to more interesting meeting reports when you discuss stuff that we all can hear
hams are pretty good but they could use a slight buff to flight time it would be nice if they could hit out at point range in practice instead of just in theory missile speedup  moving around gives you an effective range of 20km or sooverall though i dont see a problem with the drake its popular with large fleets but so are battleship gangs and hac gangs in small gang pvp it is an okay choice for solo pvp its not so good because of its speed and sluggish agility even nanofit it is easymode for missions up to l3 but once you skill up other ships will complete the missions more quickly yeah it can do l4s but only very slowly you can do some l4s with assault frigates too should all those be nerfed drake is good no doubt about it but far from being super uber no matter how you look at it
im annoyed with the prevalence of neuts as well if you have any spare high slots you fill it with a neut no questions asked with the occasional exception of a tackling frigate which might use a nosi would like to see energy neuts destroy less energy than is used to activate them then buff the neut bonus of the curse pilgrim and sentinel to compensate this makes neuts a little less viable overall usable but not in a one module to rule them all kind of waya buff to nos would also be nice perhaps they could always pull in capacitor but when your target has less capacitor than you do the amount transferred is proportional to the amount left in the target they have 10 cap the nos only transfers 10 of its normal amount something like that anyway right now the nos is too defensive of a module and a bit of offensive capability would be greatas far as the af 4th bonus i really would enjoy an ewar resistance bonus maybe 5 per level 25 resistance to webs ecm damps whatever is affecting them this would greatly reinforce the role of a heavy tackler and give them something truly unique
it would be nice i suppose but ive always thought of hams as being a scrambarely out of it range weapon which happens to have a bit of extra range as a nice bonus ships with a velocity bonus like the cerberus can reach out to about 40km with them
heavy missiles need to be looked intothe drake and tengu are simply to versatile with out the trade offs of other weapons systemsthey have by default an insane range for a cruiser sized weapons they hit farther than the other ranged option and do full damage at there full range getting artillary to hit out 100km is difficult and requires additional modsthey are also just as viable close up and do not suffer from a ranged weapons handicap of not being able to hit close targetsfor a weapon that always hits they simply do to much dmg and are far to versatile without penaltychanges to keep the flavor coiuld involve them traveling slower and making that aspect or an improvment to defender missiles
can we get a comment on defender missilesalso believe they should reduce damage incoming to your fleet and not just yourself i know this is not simple but a comment on the defender system would be nice
mimnitar tracking links are vastly vastly under used when was the last time you saw one do you even know what they are these really really need to be more effective
i like the large friendly letters on the cover1
meh why not

posting in a size enhancement thread to confirm that size does matter
can anyone confirm that ccp are updating the ship graphics soon i suspect i may have seen pictures of the new textures in a thread alongside the proposed ship paintjobs and corp logos if that were the case they could scale the ships in the same patch as the new graphics presumably designed to fit the new size and not have to worry about blurred texture scaling
not only should they be larger but their collision boxes should be increased as welllooks impressive when 40 or however large a sc roam is these days  drop out at a single cyno but dammit they should be bouncing all over the damn place when that many drop in around one point in space would act a nice balancing feature as well
afk cloaking goes against the terms of service 16you may not do anything that interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers to enjoy the game or web site in accordance with its rulesafk cloaking has only one purpose to keep others from enjoying eve
fixed your post please cry more youre only making me want to cloak up somewhere
please do eventually you will  off enough people with your cowardly tactic of not fighting that ccpcsm will actually address the fact that it should not be allowed as part of the game since you dont actually have to be playing the game to do it
there was an afk cloaker in my alliances home system for weeks on end a while back do you know how i countered himi ignored him i did my ratting somewhere else and did everything else i always do in said home system exactly the same way i would if he wasnt there
nc sanctum farmer alt spotted
hi please tell me how somebody being cloaked is interfering with your ability to play eve onlineedit also i think you might be in danger of losing the ability to post here since you are spaming the same topic over and over again
actually the thing stopping you isnt the cloaker its the knowledge that hes there the problem is local local is against the tos
fearthe brain structure which appears to be at the very center of most of the brain events associated with fear is the amygdala greek for almond its shape the amygdala seems to respond to severe traumas with an unerasable fear response posttraumatic stress disorder or ptsd click for a superb site by the madison institute of medicine on ptsd it seems to be genetically different and wired for a higher level of fear in some individuals such as those with panic disorder and it recently has been shown to be larger in some people with bipolar disorder though what that means is still a mystery
wrong its to subvert the use of localbeing afk and cloaked does not stop the use ofstargatesstationsshipsmodulesplaying the game
it actually does stop you from playing the game the only thing you can do while someone is claoked in your system and you know they have a cyno and the ability to kill industrial ships is either leave the system or sit there cloaking in system is an amazing way to stop everyone who lives in the system from making isk in said system thats why it is an extremely unbalance mechanic its extremely effective but takes no risk or effort once you get into the system if you want to disrupt peoples ability to play the game and make isk you should have to actually be at your computer
if you truly believe that petition everyone that you see afk cloaking and see how long it takes for a banwarningcaution though the hammer may not fall where you want it to
no actually an afk cloaker in your system does not force you to do or to not do anything at all if there are lots of you how about a standing fleetalso how about you post with your main
no that is you stopping yourself at least be factual in your replies
glykeni dodanikahow would a standing fleet make a difference for the person cloaking if we had a thousand people in the system it wouldnt make it any more likely for the person who is afk to have any risk of losing their ship and all they would have 
ive often enjoyed the travel times in eve it lends a sense of scale often unseen in alternative mmos not supported if you want to warp faster there are rigs that can do that for you
not supported without better justification of why besides i get boredyou must demonstrate how to mitigate the adverse affects on aggro timers bubble tactics dropping cans to stop cloaked ships may become infeasible given jettison timers and possible adverse affects of the increased load on the servers grid mechanics are implicitly throttled by warp travel times basically though meaning well you have thrown up a suggestion that may have many negative or unexpected affects on the game besides making your travel faster you are going to need more justification for it
this started as a way to get more low level haulers into the economy but it has become a benefit to the economy and game depth in its own right please read and familiarize yourself with the thread below for the background and evolution of this proposal income stream for haulers the background supporting itguristas and kidnappingclear skiesi decided to rename the proposal to reflect more closely the spirit of the change and also to avoid turning off those on the forum who dont care for industrials  but i didnt want to rename the original thread which would mess up search lookups 
we need the commodity cake
ah but the cake is a lie
only if the logs show nothing
mmm cake
do we have towels yet we need towels and cake
meh i can pop my alt over and over again easier than catching podsbut supported on general idea
why make it available in an lp store when you could make bpcs for qz available insteadit could require quafe ultra perhaps a touch of booster gas whatever i think the qz limited edition should remain a gift but perhaps the qz bpcs could produce one with 3 bonuses instead of 5combat boosters in general could use some lookinginto and this would be a nice touch
only if its optional as i personally would have it flagged as spam otherwise of course i dont get much mail anymore so it might not be so bad
first of all i want to stress that this proposal intended to limit afk and not cloaky gameplaythe idea is to introduce a pos module that will generate a system wide wave of particles that will stop all cloaking devices momentarily now any player will be able to recloak after reactivation timer of their cloaking deviceafk players will be vulnurable to a combat probe scanthe pos module will require some kind of fuelit should have reactivation delay of some length 1560 minutesit also may require sov level or even ihub upgradesomething is needed to stop 23hour afk cloakers especially after latest updates in 00 as of now there is nothing one can do except always be ready for a hotdrop from a titan or blackops
there are a dozen threads about this active right now did you really have to add another one
yes i have a guy in arazu with 2 cyno generators covert and regular titian and covert hotdrops were made he sits 23 hours online and we have guys like him almost in every system with ss lower 06 sometimes more then onethe problem is they only risk their ships for a few seconds when they ready to make their move and we are vulnurable 23 hours when we undock
remove local then you dont see them any morewhile ever local remains in its current form afk cloaking is a viable counter to subvert its use
good to know youre trying to keep things as arbitrary as possible theft is allowed unless youre a criminal of coursethis actually makes alot of sense especially for nullsec where customs doesnt existand dont exist in lowsec either for that mattermurdering anyone you see in nullsec no penaltyexchanging iskies with 10s in nullsec massive sec hithow bad this idea is pricelessfor everything else theres mastercardah now its okay to steal from criminals but nobody else oh thats right criminals arent allowed to steal that makes sense errr wait noin a game based on freemarket and sandbox gameplay let us endevour to make it less so good plan let us bring law to lawless space and spread highsec to all the landim glad you typed that out again i was worried itd be gone by the time i read it againim glad you typed that out again i was worried itd be gone by the time i read it againyoure aware thats free rightexcept for the part where it doesnt happen you might as well throw out your propsal and ask people nicely to treat them as guidelines and to pretty please follow them itd have to same level of enforcement behind it and would save alot of botherthis would be a whole lot easier if you just added concord oh wait we already have that let us make lowsec better by trying to make it more like highsec with the most roundabout and easily bypassable means evercoming from a suicide griefer lolfreeforall of 00  do you not remember all the restrictions you just barely proposedwhich would have to be extended into null to be even slightly effective even without being easily bypassed not a freeforall when youre done with iti know its a shocking idea to even consider addressing a problem directly but just imagine how lowsec could be made more worthwhilse by making it more worthwhile crazy i know id suggest we should attempt to do it in the most indirect and ineffective way possible but you got that coveredive not bothered to do even more miniquotes so i feel i should tell you bold goes to bold italics to italics and underlined to underlined personally i feel this is obvious but youve shown yourself to be master of missing such
i respect your replies most of the time rented but i have to step in here i dont usually engage in personal arguments and several people on the thread have already made more than a threads fair share of petty personal and non relevant jibes but i feel i need to step in here anna may have been guilty of the same petty bickering in the past but she finally put the time in to explain her point logically rented your response is uncalled for and seems solely based on personal bias against her just because we may not like each other personally does not mean that we should not treat rational proposals and posts rationally i have not read your complete post but at a glance you seem to discount annas suggestions without suggesting a suitable solution as a replacement what exactly do you mean by make it more lucrative do you mean make more high value ore in low sec im sure we would consider your alternatives if you have any im not sure you know what term term free market means it means that the market is free to set its own prices it has nothing to do with the sandbox nature of the game even then the sandbox does have rules unless you are arguing for anarchy at least you seem to acknowledge the problem of low sec being gimped so how can we fix it im not saying that my or annas suggestion is the only way but if you want you contribute constructively to the thread why dont you suggest an alternative
this isnt a very good situation for those who would like to pay ransom to a pirate
touche well like everything there is a simple solution that adds complexity to the game just dont secstatus tax those transfers remember the tax only is applied to player donation transfers and presumably ransom will be its own category easily detectable by the system as you would be in the kidnapped state but there would be situations that it wouldnt cover friends paying your ransom so seeing as how i see the other proposal as adding more interesting depth to the game i backed off this current one a while back happy to shelve it for further thought and as others mentioned this is more lowpri
i agree with eperor turn it into a strategic action on both sides
is that afk guy stopping your bots
hey look at that same hand full of people saying they dont want it changed because they like it the way it is let me guess the reason you spend so much time on the forums is because you have all 6 of your accounts afk cloaking in random systemsglad so many people are standing up and saying they are sick of a few getting a huge advantage over others while they arent even actively playingedit spelling
hey look at that same hand full of people saying they dont want a change because they cant bot any more and want to keep their all seeing eye let me guess you have 6 botting accounts in certain systemsglad so many are against and standing up saying they are sick of the botters getting a hugh isk advantage while they arent actively playingedit i can post daft things too traq
this alt supports the idea of paying for some extra training time
why not just make the skill not trainable by trial accounts problem solved surely that is the easiest solution im not entirely against your hide the order idea in theory but in practice i suspect it would put too much load on the server think about the race conditions that may occur and database deadlock problem of checking each order on everyones market screen to see if the other side has enough isk much simpler to just put a demerit marker on people who commit overdraft and penalize their margin skill for successive overdrafts as this is data stored on the character skill db itself and the check is done at the time of posting an order just once
keep the map layout the same in terms of connected solar systems connected nodes for jump avenues but equip every ship with a jump drive the distance you could travel would depend on the size of the ship frigates can jump up to 3 systems small fast maneuverable as they are cruisersbattle cruisers up to 2 bs and larger can jump 1 jumping requires a certain amount of capacitor efficiency can be increased through skills jumping also places you at a random point in space in the destination systemadditionally give warp disruption bubbles the ability to pull people out of warp anywhere in their warp line possibly add skills for dictorshics that increase the radius of capturethe idea of this proposal is to make travel more dynamic and also allow for true ambushinterdiction style of game play this is also intended to make large fleet maneuvers a bit more dynamic and give an opportunity for both attackers and defenders of systems the opportunity to suffer the fog of war
i like the spirit of the idea because stargates are annoying but no this would totally break evethere are bigger ships that can do similar to what you are asking
i know there are bigger ships that can perform this role what im proposing is to make fleet movements and travel in general more dynamic and allow for more interesting types of fleetgang engagements rather than point engagements at entryexit points also allow for true ambush tactics and interdiction maneuversit also allows for smaller forces to take on larger fleets through use of guerilla tacticsi appreciate the reply but if you could be more specific than a blanket this will break eve i could adjust the proposal im fine with the gates as they are now although they are a little boring just looking for a way to make space and systems actually feel large and spacey
why part of eve is corps and the other part is isk and both needs banks
this already exists in eve
the point of a bank irl is to hold your money safely rather than have you walk around in the streets with a suitcase full of banknotes or stuffed into a pillowcase under your bed in eve my wallet is completely secure nobody can access it without my consent i cant get mugged in a dark alley and have it all stolen burglars cannot break into my hangar and take it while im out in a fleet it seems that what youre really asking for is an official ccp bank to make you riskfree interest no in a sandbox economy you put your money on the line and make investments in the hope of profit you dont ask big daddy ccp for easy handouts
not realy true that evem oney its safe its meny times when accou8nts get hacked and you lost your items and money afocrs money ccp giving back but not times you losing them complitly
pirate 100 mil or your pod is dustvictim ok but youll have to wait until i can get to the next highsec cash dispenser you can accompany me if you want to make sure i go therep
im not supporting this yet as it doesnt seem fully formed as a proposal but you broght up an interesting point the problem though is if you have a bank you will need bankers unless by bank you just mean i want interest on my isk that im not using if your proposal is the latter recall that unless you want uncontrolled inflation in the game  bad idea to get interest someone must pay interest banks are savings and loans businesses you cant have savings with interest without the loans charging interest on the other side which means you will need people willing to borrow money but then you will need people to collect when you dont repay loans and a functioning credit system in order to rate peoples credit worthiness for loans etc etcas you can see its not a simple change banks are an essential part of an economy and right now eve runs without one as it is only a virtual economy which is not entirely complete there are npc corps which have infinite cashso thats the long answer of why your proposal wont likely work without a lot more thought or a big big change on ccp side
well there i disagree with you maz3r i assumed in your original post that they would be allowed to use t2 ammo as well without the ability to use t2 ammo they would remain inferior in general to t2 weapons even if they did 10 more raw damage with faction ammo they wouldnt be as inferior but inferior none the less my view on the matter is faction should always without exception be superior to t2 in all respects cost effective is another matter but they should be outright superior in terms of performanceas for those about to say cost isnt a balancing factor yes and no its a balancing factor when it offers a small boost its when you get a huge boost that renders you effectively invincible that it falls apart yes im looking at you mr dramielcynabalmachariel a case of cost properly balancing out with performance is the bhaalgorn its better than any t1 bs but they are rarely used since they arent 800m isk better
i think it is a good solution to boosting faction weapons which imo would be a good thingthis suggestion still lets you benefit from training specialization skills but doesnt obsolete t2 guns which you need to use t2 ammoso can the suggestion be boiled down to make all guns meta5 and above require specialization skillsthe damage boost would then follow from the skills descriptioni like
i didnt say they shouldnt get t2 ammo i was just saying all my proposal is is just make the spec skill apply if there is enough support ill add in the t2 ammo to the proposal
without t2 ammo theyre still worse than t2 guns whatever you do
sorry i misread then i guess then i support this conditionally because i want to keep the t2 ammo to t2 gunsno it wouldnt make the faction weapons useless as they would have more dps and smaller fitting requirements i assume it forces you to make a tradeoff if you want to use barrage then use t2 guns if you can live without it you can fit faction
i dont see any reason why high meta lvl guns shouldnt be able to use higher meta ammo updated op
actually once specialization is factored in faction guns will do more dps with faction ammo but not with t1 normal ammo than t2 guns with t2 short range ammo t2 ammo has drawbacks that faction ammo dont but is cheaper
but will they have the range to match t2 long range ammo somehow i doubt it
those have drawback in dps
support
simple solution make all faction and officer weapons t2 skills required for t2 weapons will also be required for factionofficer then theyre all worth buying fitting and usingto be honest thought the whole storylinefactiondeadspaceofficer modules need a rebalance especially the faction stuff why should one module completely outperform all other modules in all aspects eg warp disruptors some warp faction warp disruptors are simply just easier to fit where the top of the line is not only the very easiest to fit but also has the max range these attributes need to be rejuggled so that one module offers one thing while another offers something else but not everything in the same module however i digress
so wow congrats you just gave an idea without reason or justification  would you please explain further
maybe to make them worth using
i have always seen factiondeadspaceetc mods as modules that are as good as t2 or better but without the skill requirements in many cases easier fitting and not the additional benefits of using t2 skillsi would not like the t2 damage bonuses to be applied to them i would rather that they be buffed in such a way that with max skills they do more damage than a t2 weapon of the same type while keeping their reduced fittingsthis lets you make a choice  you can use the faction weapons for easier fitting less skill requirements and more damage overall or use t2 which requires more skills more fitting does a bit less damage but has the flexibility of t2 ammoi support the topic in general except for faction guns using t2 ammo
any more support for this ideaseems everyone soo far is up for the idealittle changes
i am sick of gratuity gifts of tritanium
i support this as long as ccp thinks its a good idea i personally dont mind getting newbie ships when i dock its not a big deal but it is one more thing for the server to do1 check to see if a pod has docked2 check to see if the pilot has ships in station3 if not create a new ship with modules and a unit of tritanium4 send the pilot mailwe could do away with this automatic process with a station button not sure how much of an impact this would make on the servers and database but every little bit counts right
how about a long cycle time for cloaking devices but have it shut off after every cycle that would allow anyone at the computer to stay cloaked almost constantly but stop afk cloakers because they would have to reactivate the cloaking device in order to stay cloaked
noplease explain what detriment afk cloaking imposes on this game
okit allows players to directly affect the game play of others without actually having to be playing the game they can walk away from the computer with no fear of losing their ship while they disrupt the game play of others if they want to disrupt others by cloaking in a system fine but they should have to be at the computer while they do so
technically speaking market orders and contracts allow you to affect the gameplay of others without being at the computer so does autopiloting across highsec would you like to see those removed
it does not directly effect anyone or anything in order to directly effect someones game you have to be actively doing soit indirectly effects you because you allow it to mess with your head so the issue is with you and the boogie man
the difference is that these can be combated by other players buysell orders can be outbid and you can still be shot while autopiloting though i do think its crap that you get paid full insurance when you shoot someone in highsec further autopilot does not actually directly affect other players afk cloaking on the other hand allows a player to directly affect others while being completely safe himherself going afk while docked at a station is the only other time you can walk away from your computer and be sure of your safety while in 00 space and that ability comes at a substantial cost while afk cloaking cost only about 1m isk
afking in a freighter while hauling stuff for courier contracts market ery etc etc affects people afk cloaking doesnt need combating if someone is afk by definition they are no threat to you would you also like to see sanctions placed against people who log off in hostile space who knows when theyll log back in and cyno in 500000 caps
if their existence in your system alone disrupts you perhaps you should seek another game seriously i can understand if they are attacking you how that might disrupt you but they are afk they are doing nothing
even in a freighter you can be shot as far as what you are hauling again that is not directly affecting anyone perhaps i need to explain what that is for you to directly affect someone the effect of the action must directly affect other effecting the market is not directly connected to hauling something it is from selling or buying something what your hauling directly affects the decision of the gankers since they decide whether it is worth shooting you based on what your hauling but the fact that your afk makes little difference since if you werent they could still kill you they would just have to work a little harder at itif you arent playing the game you should not be in the game and if you are in the game you should always be able to die especially in 00 like i said i have no problem with someone cloaking in my system all day long and waiting for the perfect time to attack someone i have a problem with them being able to walk away from the computer without having to worry about losing their ship there is no other time in eve even in high sec that you can be in space and have no fear of losing you shipthats why i think giving cloaking devices a one cycle limit before they have to be reactivated is a logical solution if you are at the computer and actively participating in the game it will not change this tactic at all but it will stop people from walking away from the computer and being completely safe without the use of a macroedit spelling
you knowthe 80s band prefab sprout had a song called the king of wishful thinkingbut im going to go ahead and crown you the king of awful poasting
please explain how your game play is affected if someone is simply cloaked and away from keyboardits confusing the rest of usi see youve never heard of a pos then
because they arent always away from the keyboard they can come and go as they please without any possible repercussions for walking away for 20 hours but the benefit of having complete control over when or if they fightthere is a way to force players out of a pos its called shooting it there is absolutely no way to catch someone who cloaks and walks away from the computer they can do it every day for an infinite amount of day with no chance of losing their ship the only requirement is that they continue to log on and press the cloak button which can easily be done with a macro and since it requires so little interaction with the client ccp has little chance of being able to prove it was a macro
thread locked as you already have a thread on cloaking here
we should have a pos mod capable of decloaking everyone in a system it can have a long warm up and cool down timer it can get rid of localeven though this has nothing to do with the topic for a certain amount of time it can do what ever you want i only propose that it give the capability to combat someone how has cloaked and is no longer actually paying attention to the gameif you want to get rid of local everywhere then make your own proposal i think it is a legitimate idea but has nothing to do with this one

you seem to be spamming topics today good sir are you upset about something perhaps you could shed some light on what that is

i believe that changing a ship requirement to fly would make more sense if the requirement is the certificate instead of the skill to fly the shipi mean you can drive a car but if youre driving without a license you are risking a fine or a criminal offenceso sure you can drive in a car without a license in the real world but usually is the country side or some other less developed part of the country i suppose you can make it so you can fly a ship without a certificate in low sec or null if you wantpoint is i keep reading that players do not follow a certificate cause it is useless and just a guide developers i am sure are irritated hearing this and i am sure they have other more pressing problem to take care and i am sure there will be more players complaining that it will be more time spent training for a particular shiphowever please note that t1 ships are easy to fly already and their certificate are only at basic level while t2 ships already have lvl v skill or skills as a requirement depending upon the ship classso whats the benefit to player well quickly considering i would have to say very little but it would make a feature of the game from useless to useful and would give incentive to newer player to move out to low sec to at least fly the ship with minimal requirement so if theres any value it would be to developers and to pirates who would see an increase in new player in low sec finally it is a shame if the purpose of a certificate is only as a bragging rights among the older and more experienced playerthis is my first post and on impulse i post this topic interested to see what flames trolls or likeminded supporters i would get from my post please make it amusing cause it would really make my day
we have our pod pilot licenses already those whos license has run out cant log on in to the game every active player you see is flying with a license already also bringing up a gamedesign change because of rl is the dumbest thing a person can do this is a game and the design will always be based on the gameplay and rl considerations are entirely secondaryyou would be wrong about the devs opinionas the devblog shows the system was specifically designed just to be a guide to new players who dont know better and its working exactly as intended you are correct in thinking players would be angry since it would be more training for a ship that is totally unncessary for actually flying the ship and you havent provided any good reasons why the current systems should be changed a vague rl analogue and not knowing the design intention behind certificates doesnt really cut itthe rest of you post is pretty much rubbish it is all based on the mistaken concept that certificates where meant to be something more than just rough guides to new players to ease them into and teach them the skill systemnot supported
a certificate isnt completely synonymous with a license or permit i may have a certificate for swimming 12 mile but i dont get banned from to pool if i swim 34 mile now and then

lol well saidbrok sorry but you must have misunderstood this game if you think that it needs real world physics im not trying to be sarcastic here but where did you get the impression that eve was a space simulator its a space opera sandbox game think starwars star trek wing commander not star control or babylon 5even if all that physics can be added to the client without completely bogging down the servers just think about what lag would do to a simulator engine like that it would really take away from the game why even creating a simple orbit around a target would be a chorewhen it boils down to it we are humans who live in a thick atmosphere and the physics of aerodynamics is much more intuitive to us if you really have such a bone to pick with the existing physics engine then im surprised you didnt point out the numerous other glaring holes like weapon occlusion sound in a vacuum or the fact that half of the ship designs are not symmetrical how can these maneuver evenly with a center of mass not in the center of the plane of traveleve is space opera not a space sim
cloaks are fine the reason people sit in systems cloaked up is more often to prevent botters than anything else one person is not a big threat in pvp anyway given how many counters there are that make solo pvp pointless if not impossible the fact that you live in 00 and find one cloaked ship a threat is laughable and insane at the same timeforget it i cant possibly support this and can hardly believe that you blobbing superfarmers are that serious a group of sissies maybe youre not 00 alliance at all but whatever i still wouldnt support it cloaks are finebot one nice name do you really not know that a cloaked vessel cant run any modules or do anything except assuming covert ops warp and fly around or move and cycle previously launched probes if its not a covert ops then it cant even warp and doesnt have the ability to even fly around at anything approaching normal speed if its black ops it fits the just mentioned category except that if its sitting on top of you it can decloak and lock you slightly faster than your average bsin short if its cloaked its not much of a threat until it decloaks and if its alone its probably still not much of a threat in fact youre probably qualing at a bantam of course those can light cynos but i still dont think you have much to worry about
if you make it a moduleweapon available anywhere then you instantly obsolete cloaks for defensive and offensive work both as well as their use in highlowsec regardless of how hard you make it  bad ideacloaking is mostly a problem for defensive operations as they not only provide intel platforms but also the ability to bridgejump in attacks that are completely unscoutablei have previously suggested a sov module that could send out a ping every so often thus offering a small window in which even cloaked ships can be probed  idea is to have it be a group effort that requires organization think sub hunts during wwiiaah the younguns such naivety we had cloakers sitting in systems the day cloaks were introduced long before bots were even considered ie back when eve was a gnat of a mmoinvulnerable intel gathering in the heart of enemy territory  is it any wonder it is abused to hell and back
suport this
i approve of this its an elegant solution that fits nicely within the game mechanics and sounds like a believable mechanical issue from a background fluff perspective although i would suggest that ships that can fit cov ops should have bonuses that would enable them to sustain the stealth for a much longer duration if not indefinately enable cap recharge it would allow them to maintain their ship role and other players to identify an afk cloaker as a non threat
i have a lot of experience using hybrid weaponswas playing around in eft the other day to see if i can get decent performance out of a pvp railgun ferox other than making me vary angry after a few hours i decided that these guns will be worth using if medium rails got a 20 dps boost and 10 to powergrid usageotherwise acs and arties work just as well for most casesfound this suggestion which seems incredible close
not supportedthe only thing that the op will do is turn ninja looting into a carebear activity removing all risk from it and lots of the reward as wellthis game is about player competition and conflict which should end in ships exploding the suggestion will just generate a bunch of smack in local which is lame tbhthere are far better suggestions a few posts belowmaking wrecks tractable but with flaggingmaking wrecks blue after an hourbut these are not in the opso not supported
as mentioned before in this thread the game already has a ridiculous number of ships i understand the desire for more shiny stuff but the game would be better balancing the existing ships than making new onesto properly pvp you need to have at least a cursory knowledge of a ship that you encounter new players coming to the game are already overwhelmed by the number of ships they need to learn only to learn later that many of them are useless

just wondering if we will ever be able to moon mine in 04 space seems such a waste of cpu to have all those moons already showing their mining information and not to be able to mine them most 03 and lower moons that have anything valuable to mine have been taken and many new corporations who are just starting out will not get a chance to try moon mining outnow that it is not required to have rep to set up a pos in 04 space seems that it would open up more areas for new corps to be able to move into and moon mine
increasing cost noincreasing cooldown between changes maybe
hey nice idea supported
love this idea would make a great contribution to the tactical overlay and manual flying
makes 2 classes with a damage variant and a logistic type would be perfect
my point was just that your statement was based on a false premise and even then i only piped up because you made it a point to 20pt font and bold your false premise i make no statements about the conjectural nature of whether or not you see more titans or not surely that will depend on what kind of player you are null sec high sec etc but i would naively expect to see black ops less i mean they do operate cloaked most of the time right
i dont get itwidow gets ecm bonusredeemer should get neuting bonussin should get the point range and damp bonusand the panther should get the stasis web  target painting bonustheyre essentially covert ops  recon ships just of a different size
as someone who has owned two bobs pretty much since launch the two useful ones widow and redeemer acquired in that order i can honestly say that they should have been built on a bc platformposted this many times before but i think the bobs should get a maintenance bay with 120kmUFFFD of space in which you can only put jump harmonics 2 ships like the rorq to barges thats enough to carry one force recon or a couple of covopsbombers but mainly this allows you to let your people refit like i said the bobs should be a subcapital mothership high tank refit baysedit and to avoid trolls trying to discredit me by stating bobs were only created recently i was speaking of the bobs launch
whatofail matar whine is fail btwgo cry in your scrapyard more just dont let us hear it thx
tracking disruptors could use a buff i have never seen them take precedence over other forms of ewar this is due to the limited ship types they effectand is fine and the reduction in incoming dps is nto comparable to damps or jammingoften even bonused ships do not fit many of these modulesi would like to see tracking disruption improved and be a viable contender to other forms of ewar mid slots such that they are actually used in fleet fightseven fast hac gangs would would pontentially benifit from these mods do not fit them over jamsedit its a ship balance threadwant me to whine about the lack of matar sunglass optionsor are you saying tracking links are used and are great and im misinformed and you fit them all the timewith a link to kill mail where these are fitill waitor is yout beef that i fly a lot of matar ships or that i dont point out rails are under used as already been pointed out or would that be a boo hoo caldari whine
be nice to see how often items are usedhow many more ships have been killed with jams fit than damps disruptors painters enhancershow many more ships use heavy missiles than blastershow many of a given ship hullalready contained in the quarterly reportare torps ever seen on pvp kills or 99 pvedoes ccp have these numbers would they provide them to the csm to us
i put one of my tds on a target cutting his range by half and reducing the dps hes doing on me to 0 that sounds pretty good to mehey look someone whos never seen a decently fit pilgrimcursearbitratorsentinel and notice that all those ships are capable of things besides tracking disrupting  a typical ecm ship isnttds work all the time on anything in range and dont even need a bonus to be incredibly effective i suggest you learn to use them because ive found the td on my curse extremely powerful are you being serious or did you mean cruise missiles
well you have the incentives in place already with the free trial and the free download of the client some more incentive to play the game would be good as gamers tend to know that an mmo is a commitmenttrying to obtain gamers who do not want to play an mmo is not going to give you roi what you need to do is obtain gamers who do want to play an mmo from a trailer perspective i think the butterfly effect was a very positive step in the right direction and as you are using youtube and google analytics or you frickin should be i guess you can see what the conversions are like and what your traffic breakdown is like to the allimportant download client buttonso find what mmo gamers want and apply your marketing along those lines a few kneejerk thoughts would be1 give the wouldbe mmo gamer confidence the game will not die out so stable independent company measurable growth in game content lively and committed playerbase etc this will mean their investment of time will not turn into a barren wilderness full of poorly managed content2 adversity challenges rewards variety this is not covered enough in trailers  too much kaboom eve has extensive pve  make them feel if they download the trial and try it out there will be enough for them to do with people to make friends and enemies with3 no grind i have yet to see this advertised anywhere why it is one of the key differentiators of eve to every other mmo4 youve got the woahfactor down pat with the presentation but are you focusing too much on the endgame00 aspects when marketing as much as it makes for exciting trailers i would be surprised if it would not alienate wouldbe mmo players who at this moment in time you just want to play the game not create an alliance and take over the universe  you must be scaring some people off with that type of marketing its hard to know how to answer that without knowing what the statistics are1 average subscription length2 average time to high end content biggest ship3 reason for leavingin general id say you could1 look at their friends list and see if the people they associated with are still playing the game so use the social aspectangle i will play again if i knew that my friends are still playingactive this could hypothetically have a double bonus to it as the person who is still active could be thinking it aint the same since xyz leftmaybe ill quit the game and boom you just gave them their friend back2 youve got the cost thing down just fine so use another aspectsomething tangible only for veterans like 5 years plus sub time that is in gamewaiting for them i dont know what it could be maybe a shuttle  hell even a veteran tag in their info window or pink writing for chat channels or even a veteransonly club when you do wisjust some sort of tangible game content which only veterans can havemake them feel special singularthat you value their custom in some way other than just a free hall pass for a few days they might have been demigods in control of a 1000 starships at one point make them feel that way again make them question their decision to leave other than using cheap psychology3 see what is in their hangers give them an appraisalmarket value in jita pricing  make them remember what they left behind get them thinking a pretty picture may paint a thousand words but nothing you can think of will be anywhere near as awesome as the mind of a veteran with 1000 hours of gametime under their belt they know what they left behind you just have to remind them about it  in a positive wayregardsak
tell storiesthe butterfly effect was a good example it was about how one person can make a difference but a lot of games do that one player makes all the difference in the world but then have no real examples of this happening its pretty common and players expect that those kinds of stories are more fantasy than anything else yeah yeah im the one dude that can make the difference ha ha whateverbut eve is different  one player really can make their mark i think it would be interesting to drive that point home using real examples from the games historyeve is full of cases where a single person or a small group of dedicated people has accomplished something big a series of advertising campaigns centered around real events may help generate interestit is what interests people when i talk to my friends about eve they know that its that space ship game where you shoot people but not a whole lot more talking about how nice the ships look or how the market is player driven or how sandboxy the game is garners some interest but nothing entrances them more than mentioning examples of how real players affect the gamethe eve bank scandal is one that really seems to get people interested and say wow you can do that thats awesome perhaps not the most positive example but a very interesting one that showcases how eve isnt like other gamespick some people that have done something notable or run a well known organization help them tell their stories in as engaging a way as possible the faces of eve a market mogul akita t a mercenary pitboss alekseyev whoever runs pandemic legion a pirate overlord helicity boson larkonis mynxee etc leaders from the nc and sc and why they hate each other so much the csm guys whatever and you cant forget chribba the man with veldspar inked onto his arm for all eternityokay that last bit might be a bit creepy to most people but you get the idea it doesnt really matter who is chosen as long as its interestingone might also want to consider using the alliance tournament as a marketing tool more aggressively its free to watch entertaining and showcases some of the depth of eves pvp system

there are two highlevel things that  me off to no end ever since i started playing eveone reuse the same components for similar functions the text editing window in a channel motd acts a teeny bit different than the window to send a mail and that acts a bit different than writing notes my personal asset window looks a bit different than corp assets and that does different things than the list of items in a contractsame applies to context menus roughly half of the places where an item is mentioned only allow show info on rightclick some also allow view market details or find in contracts i dont see why these options shouldnt be available everywherethe second major issue is some windows not behaving modal windows  get rid of them why cant i edit a channel motd and copynpaste stuff from it from my notes or just drag links to items or characters into it why do i get interrupted by a popup window for something which leaves me unable to do anything even chat until i click it and also iirc at least one of the industry windows has the same problema very related issue is some things not being in a ui window at all i happen to like to have my local and other chat channels stacked on the left edge of the screen this unfortunately means that the current system information is hidden behind them and i need to move everything away when i want to run pi these windows should be made into a proper window which then could be draggedand related to that make the target list a window too yes i know you can move it around and even arrange it vertically but there is no way to stop it from getting behind your other windows when you have too many things locked it should be in a separate window which you could move and resize however you want and the target icons would only fill that window with scrollbars if necessary  just not appear behind other stuff
i would like to see the target boxes show the actual ship orientation relative to your current shipthus one could see are they traveling away or towards or orbiting at a glance
first i do not want a customizable uino add ons no mods take inspiration from these on other games and add them into the base ui but no no no no it completely changes how you play the game and can automate far to many featuresthe method of entering star base passwords sucks being able to enter 4 or so pass words and never touching it again until the gates change would be nicea green highlight to the targeting for friendly effectslike the red when getting shot or yellow when targeteda test fitting window to allow you to create fittings you do not have items for or can not fitbut can saveright now you have to be able to fit the ship to save itmore options for ship spinning
seems good
well my 2cents coint seems have twoo sides i have seen you only mentioned onehere it comes1st side of the coinyour gang failed to nail some supercaps on grid  or meaby enemy was too clever take out all your hicsdics to get it out and it did warped to ss and clock it gained cap it needs to jump out and gtfo so this scenario seems also frustrating to me so if i was you meaby i could also post on forum thats why here you will get 1 from mebut if i turn the coint on the other side is seeyou left ncyour corp and trying to find some other place to be or just simply want to restock your shipsgear from loses in hostile space if you have to do with your logistic guys it will just take too long you want action and you want now so you grab your thanatos open jumpplaner tool and find out that you have to make 2 jumps to get to the place where your gear is parked but you also find out that the midpoint when you have to jump first wil be simply suiside without staing cloked for 2 minets because of the high trafic in it yes you could afford to lose an cyno alt in there but defenetly not your carrier swiss army knife but then it hits you damn if i clock i will be never recharge my cap fast enough to get out before they find meso you liad back look outside the window of your captain quarter at your shiny thanatos wich did serve you very well past years to bring your stuff around and feel you self powerless you contact your logitic guys and just desite to wait couple of days till they get your crap to you sitting there in station doing nothing only for that i give you here 1so to the summary 110 thats basicly so much support you get from meand yes i know my english is terreble but it wont change the fact you did not think that there is always 2 sides of the coincyb
i thought the whole point of covert ops cloaks is that they can warp while cloaked that makes them special i dont see how regular cloaks should have the same ability without diluting the play balance advantage of cover ops cloaksnot supported unless you can explain why this is required for play balance and not just a request for a handout
he did not mention covert ops cloaks
get an escort orbuy some ships in the area orhave patience for your logistical guys orusing black ops covert bridge and blockade runners with covert cloak get much needed supplies and up to cruiser sized ships fast orhave better planning instead of waiting till the last minuteyou actually display beautifully the current mentality i would like to see go away in null sec no offence because the game mechanics right now allow for the rapid capital deployment and instant gratification you can getthe main target of this change is capital ships especially super capitals
im against the ops proposal as it is a nerf to all capitals nut just supercapitalsi take it the op has never used a rorqual before to move compressed ore or a carrier to move ships
just to be clear op do you mean 100 to cap recharge time whenever a noncovertcloak is fit to a noncovertshipor 100 only when noncovertship activates noncovertcloak
bump
up
needed  supporting
little change helps a bit
at least they cant say it will take too much time to do as its only a word to change on the localization sheet 
easy change fixes an oversight win
the logic being that if they jump on someone in the standing fleet everyone else in the fleet warps to them besides if they dont do anythign when the system is busy just put all your bots in the one system and watch the afk cloaker never bother you again 
are you seriously asking us to consider taking out a legitimate part of the game mechanic just because it makes you psychologically unable to play afk cloaking sounds like a perfectly sound tactic to me one that you should counter by ignoring them  take risk  or hunting them down  deal with the risk  im sorry it just sounds like you are complaining that german uboats are making your merchant shipping business difficult and that god should make it illegal for germans to use uboats
i would love to be able to hunt them down that is exactly what i am suggesting having the ability to hunt them down even if it is an excruciatingly long and hard job that is easily countered by the player that is cloaked making it all but impossible to catch a cloaked ship if the player is active all i want is the ability to hunt them down
maybe im being nitpicky but then why did you not write that as your proposal instead of the afk cloaking shouldnt be allowed as it violates the terms of service of the game sentiment that everyone else is reading
hold on a minutelet me get this straightyou have a problem with afk cloakers but you are now saying that its all but impossible to catch them if they are not afk ie not in the scope of this discussion
so im confusedthe meaning of afk is away from keyboardif another player is away from his keyboard how is he bothering you
hes arguing that the psychological stress caused by a afk cloaker is enough to keep him from mining or ratting or going about his business the argument goes that an afk cloaker doesnt have to do anything active and be away from the keyboard in order to achieve this effect the statement was then made that he should just hunt down the afk cloaker and kill it then the reponse is that they are actually hard to kill if the person is at the keyboard and evading probingdetection qed
it sounds more like hes arguing that he cant comfortably set up his bot to do his ratting andor mining for him so he can comfortably go afk while they do his work for himand to the ops against the tos bs argument thousands of players in eve wont enter nullsec or lowsec because they know for damn sure that some groupo of griefers is going to destroy their ship or ships just for the fn hell of it it happens all the time and not only prevents people from enjoying the game but es them off if thats not a problem then im sure that this isntenjoy your day and try not to get to upset about that little afk cloaker as a nullsec player im sure you are aware that an active player can just cycle dscan and look for the cyno on his overview should it actually pop upeveryone is always perfectly happy when the rules dont get in their way as long as they can use them against someone elsekindly shove it and stop posting this trash here
nope not supportingthere is no way to prove if someone is behind keyboard or not while cloaked2ndly a cloaked ship will in no way keep you from enjoying eve unless it well decloaks and shoots the  out of you but thats just how eve should be
you must not understand how this part of the game currently works if you have a ship fitted with a cloaking device and can get into a system and off the gate you can cloak up in that system and never be found there is currently no possible way to find or decloak a ship unless you already know where they are the idea of the many proposals i have brought to this part of the forum is having the ability to locate or decloak a ship in a way that would allow any active player to avoid detection but would prevent a player from cloaking their ship in a system and then walking away afk cloaking is used to lull players in that system into a false sense of security by remaining online and cloaked for days or weeks on end with no activitybecause they are afk and then all of the sudden hot dropping a capital fleet if you want to achieve this advantage you should have to be actively at the computer playing the gamealso ah yes the your a botter argument keep bumping me back to the top
no cloaking should remain as it is now
its not factual it emotional you are suffering from fear a response that you alone allow to occurif they do attack your carrier then they are not in fact afkyour problem is you can see them in local this plays on your weak kind creating fear if your all seeing eye wasnt as powerful you would have this issue
the cloaking is finewhat are you afraid of that the cloaker uncloaks and attacks your miningratting ship or that he cynoes something nasty to your systemfor uncloaking and attacking the system is working as intended you get to choose the place and time you attack in exchange the cloak module gimps the scan resolution on nonbonused ships giving you time to warp off you do keep aligned while ratting in a system with hostiles do you vs stealth bombers and recons keep a corpmate in system rat different belts and move to next system after the belts deplete and you should be able to react in time to counter itfor cynoes the problem is not the cloaks but the cyno ability to drop multiple supercaps on a moments notice again the cloak just gives you the opportunity to choose the best time to attack nothing more which is working as intended this means you should be complaning about cynos and not cloaks maybe you could add a cyno opening delay after you decloak but thats a subject for a different topic and not necessarily a feasible one
well actually by a roleplay point of view afk cloaking is totally legitimateimagine being a pirate placing your ship and cloaking it waiting for the right preyyou know you have to wait hours well you are in a 300mt long ship you get up from the bridge and you go to eat   do whatever you wantevery now and then you go back to the bridge and check the scanner any prey no still waitingby your point of view it seems to me that even being killed interferes with the ability for everyone to enjoy the gamei like being afraid of cloaked pirates i dont want to know if they will attack me or not afk being able to know if there is an actual danger by looking at the local channel is a spoil
so do the gms agree with you or not
i think i and others pointed out why your complaints point more to a concern about being able to bot in peace than whether someone is going to cyno a supercap fleet on you most self proclaimed afk miners btw are also botters despite their abusing it less and making an effort to seem otherwise this is what happens to a generation that grows up on cheat codes supplied by developers i would guess immortality godmode unlimited bullets etc they just cant play without such benefitshacking botting and all the rest is extremely prolific to the point of even admins on gaming servers using them and having the benefit of not being subject to scans themselves most people that get away with it are the ones who claim otherwise and moderate their use to something resulting in more or less normal stats just a little better than averageso if we think youre really just a whining botter dont be too surprised botters tend to be insecure individuals that need their egos stroked which is part of the reason they bot in the first place so they can be more successful which makes them seem cooler to their peers which leads to competition between botters which leaves honest people looking like fools which leads to botters stroking their own egos calling honest people losersthis is where the terms 1337 and fail come from or at least from whence they originated think about that the next time you use themright youre really concerned about hotdropping fleets well no worries they have to decloak to light a cyno and when they do they are completely vulnerable you can get them then
how much seconds its to get them after he declouks it that not even second so no they not vurneble yo ustil need target him and if cyno its up you have no chous as only die easy kill so cloucers ned to have limited time to get targets not only sit in clouck for days loking for targets mostly off time afk siting afcors if you look for thargets sit by pc and look on your char if no leave system
your carebear mind didnt got the idea the covert operations class has a reason  like having eyes on sth every alliance has dozens of covops sitting around for hours to have eyes on hostiles systems and stuff pretty much they are afk most of time because they are all dual boxers and most of the time nothing happens seriously just to protect your whiny solo ratting such a mechanic will just hit those who make something useful in this game just to add a reason why you cant stop it even if it would be possible i wont support it because its just tears
i think being able to sit in waiting is great and i dont think there should be a change in peoples ability to sit and wait for an unsuspecting victim i just dont think they should ba able to walk away from the game knowing that they can come back later and if your role playing you cant just walk away from your ship or go to sleep and not worry that you might be discovered
i suppose submarines should be nerfed irl
yes because a submarine are very similar to cloaking devices what with the being completely invulnerable and undetectable and alloh wait they can be detected by sonar and destroyed by depth charges and torpedoes on second thought submarines are nothing like cloaked ships seeing as they actually have a weakness
care to stop whining yet
no actually i think theyre pretty similar you try finding a submarine sitting at the bottom of the pacific when all you know is that its in the pacific oceannow you try finding a spaceship that is running cloaked when all you know is that its in a solar system both are like finding an invisible needle in a haystack before said needle s you up
just give them a big fat boost on ewar drones per skill point no one uses ewar drones edit apart from ecm cause they suck but if webwarrior do some real nasty webbing a blaster boat could get in range easily edith 3 see how bad ewar drones are just noticed there are only webbing berzerkers fix that to to fix gallente
i support
hiin the last patch remove information on a pilots standings towards npc corporations i want that standings were visible if at pilots have mutual excelent standings
join the request
why
danika princip if i for example take the player in corporation i should know his standingsit is the most simple example
why would you want to
o
bring back the intel tool
would this help many of the issues with 00dont plant many isk moons spread the wealth a little instead with a decent spread of usable moons that dont make super massive bankrolls this may discourage the massive allainces and coalitions from moving init may encourage smaller entities to move in if they can hide out in a far flung reach of space there are other ways fo making 00 more interesting but many have been thrown out but just making the galaxy bigger in general may help surelythis has no doubt been suggested before but i dont feel like trawlign through swathes of forum
honestly they should plant more high end moons to drag the prices down otherwise this seems like a logical way to change the current null sec dynamic
that does make sense yeah i hadnt thought about just making tech etc more abundant i was thinking along the lines of making lots of new space that isnt attractive to fat wallet coalitions but will be attractive to smaller entitiespossibly even making some areas of 00 that arnt connected to the rest of 00 and arnt in easy or possibly at all capital jumping reach or cut off areas that are only reachable via a few well placed static wormholes just thoughts to add new areas for people
or you could just make the ships travel slower so the galaxy effectively becomes bigger againblame ccp ps
id like to see more stars added to the edge of the eve map with increasing value the further you got out1 it would give more space for smaller alliances to move into and not be bothered by massive empires already suffering from over crowding2 combined with the truesec anom changes that just came out it would turn nullsec into an islands in space model with people clustering around the stars that had great truesec which would make fighting over territory more important3 it would make blobs slightly less likely because people would be less inclined to get batphoned in to curb stom a tiny alliance that is very far away6 people would have to fully live out in nullsec making their own assets out there because making jita runs would be a little tougher right now people just grind isk and fight over their isk grinding space out there
actually i like travel speed as it is now the first time i played i was quite surprised that it took less than 8 minutes to travel 1 aui was expecting to see ships moving at sublight speed inside solar systemsmaybe i would change the autopilot to get nearer the star gates it should warp to 0mt as the ship is actually able to do it another weird thing
the 15km limit is there to ensure that if you go afk you can be ganked its fair
hell yes why would the quafe corp give us free samples if we cant buy themwait a secare we guinnea pigs
supported because of hannah viktors awesome post
1more drugs in eve please
unlike the other nonactionable fix afk cloaks because i dont like it threads this proposal actually has some merit and gives a possible way to address the problemi would suggest though that a complete uncloaking until they recloak of the adversary is a little too powerful the purpose of a black ops cloaker is to hot drop a fleet after allperhaps make it such that each pulse allows the cloaked ship to be combat probed for a small window in time say 15min subject to tweaking you want the chance to be low enough such that unless you have a lot of people probing for him you will need more than one pulse to pinpoint the cloaker once found you can warp to him but he is still cloaked so you still have to find the ship in a 15km radius spherebasically the mechanic should fulfill the following points up for discussion1 it should cost the pos fuel to do the pulse plus the module upgrade2 it should make someone who is afk for more than 6 hours findable but with difficulty2 it should make someone who is afk for more than 12 hours findable with reasonable effort3 it should make someone who is afk for more than 23 hours findable with relative ease4 it should maintain that someone who is cloaked but not afk almost impossible to find5 not decloak the cloaker too powerful would gimp bo ships not to mention tough to implement technicallydifficulty can be overcome by adding more people probing and scanning
let me try to sum up all of the arguments against the concept of your idea which is to nerf afk cloakingits not an actual problem if they are afk just ignore themafk cloaking is how we counter localonly if you nerf dockingyou must be a botterand all these arguments will come from the same 6 or so players over and over and over again without making any actual pointslets see how close i am
it is a counter to local you just dont want to lose localtell me this putting aside the differences just how many afk cloak threads to you see from wh dwellers sure its not the same space and entrance is not the same but id love for you to point me to one
that is a problem in eve you cant jsut ingnor them they atack to not only sit cloucked but between atacks can go serveral days or weeks so everyone duing that time is strest i nthat systme point to get rid off them its that not interaction sit in system afk they need to have soem time to gettatrget but not all the eve time
if you ignore themfly in groups they prepare a titan hotdrop for example4tengu2hugin2 sabre3scimitars 4 ceptors  an option for more so ignoring them is not a real optionlocal should not be countered there is a lot of other tactics besides if you want to do a hotdrop look at the screen and nothing will harm you just recloak and continue watching the system nerf docking i cant see the point here you can fly to a possafespotsim not a bot im against boting but with 1 bastard afking in my systemminers went to empire and carebears running missions and i personally think that afk cloakers are botters i just want an option to kill the guy when he is afkthe actual point is afk cloakers disrupt a gameplay of many real people without taking almost any risk the only option to counter them right now is to have a hotdrop ready titan on standby with large enough gang which is unrealistic for renters the actual point is that afk cloakers given imho unfair advantage not in the cloaking part but in afk partthey disrupt a gameplay for 24 hoursday without investing 24 hours a dayusually there is no retribution possible since overwhelming force hotdroppedi only want an option to fight them and not the whole alliance standing behind them
the advantages of this method are 1 it doesnt limit the current bocovert tactics you can hotdrop just look at the screen2 no new game mechanics like scanable invisibility3 with ballanced costs and timeouts it wont be worthpossible for using as a tactical tool for example 3090 min warmup timeoutbefore pulse  510kk cost of fuel per pulse will probably make it not so powerfulland again i want to stress the fact that now we have no real option to defend ourselves all the cards are given to attacking sidechoosing the time the place and the victim of an attack is good enough advantage harrasing a players 24hday is just an unfair bonus
another advantage came to mind its an isk sink 
okay youve convinced me jack oatill give you the thumbs your proposal is acceptable with perhaps some tweaking to not affect campers of less than 23h i think its reasonable for afk cloakers to stay in your system for a whole day maybe they just dropped offline or somethingso if this pulse can be done only once a day then i think that would be acceptable
wh is a bit different you cant open cyno thereyou cant jump whole bunch of people to a point of your choosing instantly and send a capital reinforcement if neededbtw removing local goes both ways and choosing a weak target in almost empty systems becomes more of a challenge
i must not have mentioned they were different oh waitcyno is a whole other matter and i have in fact suggested a change before in regards to this but if they are using a cyno they are not afki guess you couldnt find an afk cloaky wh thread oh well
bind mwd to f2 bind cloak to f1as you reach a safe spot start moving in random directionput rock on f1 and f2 keysprofit
local is removed in wh but the attackers cant bring capitalsballance is the problem with afk cloakers ballance went to hellim looking on the problem from a standpoint of a small space renting corpall the cards are given to the attackersthey know the enemy cloaky recons when they arent afk all over the placethey know themselves they choose the time and the place of the battle usually when they overpower the enemy by numbers or quality or boththe only thing they dont have is i win now button when being afk is not safe at least local population could mobilize or hide
isnt putting a rock on keys called botting 
its not botting so far i know rock is an pure natureohh and not supported
its good really great
magsif ccp gets rid of local i will be fine with it but it wouldnt change the fact that having a ship in your system with no one behind the wheel that you have absolutely no means of hunting down and killing is a flaw
but without local you and your bots wont be able to tell theres a ship in your system not that youve ever been outside of highsec without local the cloaky uboat crowd can pop you before you know they are there
really good idea should do the deal of that bot cloackers just sitting in afk paralizing all action in the system
its really good idea
i dont see a problem here1 online a cynojammer 2 make common fleet for hunters to quickly react if someone is tackled3 keep your pvp ships readythat solves problems with afk cloakers
good idia
without local afk cloaking would be pointless so your argument is flawed not cloaking
well sounds good these measures will make carebare life in nullnull sec a bit better and all this situation with afk cloakers more  i dont know honest towards real players 
fly to system in red space with highest number of npc kills according to dotlanlog outlog in at peak activity dotlan againlight cynobang hotdrops without the warning that having a cloaky in system provides
now attackers have a superiority over carebears and other ones its pointless to farm in 00 because u lose more than you earn there its impossible to wait them always and makes pvp boring for defenders there is a little difference in this situation theres enough time to dock
i mentioned the fact there are differences but lack of local still means no afk cloakingit matters not what position you look at it from local is the reason for afk cloaking it is the counter to local to try and subvert its 100 risk free instant intelyou initially hold all the cards you know they are there you have the all seeing eye called local you can see when they enter local and when they leave but your reliance upon local to give you instant intel is being somewhat subverted through the use of afk cloaking thats why they have to resort to afking to try and put you off guardif that ever happens youll have way too much power on to of your already powerful intel tool called locali can see you hate the idea of losing your all seeing eye
so its really just the hotdrop capability of enemies right on your frontdoor that is the problem here not the lone afkcloaker in your systemso in essence spool updown timers for cynosjumpbridges so that you have a slight chance to get awaymake a new proposal and aim it at the root of the problem cynomechanics
have you ever lit a cynoyou sit there for quite a while you cant warp move or dock if its a regular cyno anyone in system can warp to you if its a black ops cyno you have to light it in a moderately expensive ship that you have to let sit there for a whileways to counter a hot drop1 go mining  ratting in groups never alone2 get in a standing fleet3 get on voice comms with your alliance4 when someone hot drops you yell help help warp to me into comms if your alliance is paying attention youll be able to fight back5 bait them do steps 1 2 and 3 but have your own fleet standing by go ratting in something juicy but with a good tank carrier marauder when the hot dorp starts get your tank up warp in your fleet drop some bubbles and start killing6 dont be a botter
ok mani get it you dont like locali dont like ppl looking for easy prey so whatif local will be removed well adapt or just move on the important question is what you prefer to dolooking for easy prey is the only thing people should do in this game if not they should have a chance to do it
yes i haveyou have to sit there 5 min in a recon while logistics patch you up an they are there in a matter of seconds1 done that titan dropped a gang with logistics an t3 two faction and two regular bs were down in matter of seconds cyno jammer could solve the problem for 20kkday2 our local fleet is smaller and less organized than what falls on us the attackers are really brave guys  also they have a supercap reinforcements probably3 are you renting space have you heard of cta in short not really possible 4 same as 1 2 and 3 if they hang around then probably they baiting you into bringing some reinforcements to kill them with what they have or with another hotdrop5 same as all of the above the guy who was afk cloaker in our system left it and cought a mothership next day he had 8 supercaps on standby  support so something with good tank would be dead in less than a minute6 not a botter but with afk cloakers it doesnt matterin other words what you are saying is obvious has been done or impossible in given situationthe basic problem is that attacker chooses to attack it means from his point of view he has 100 chances to achieve his goals and have a backup plan just in case
yes loads of cloaking threads already hopefully this will be a compromise for the afk cloaker haters and cloaky pilots this post has some ideas taken from other threads to kudos to where it is duenoncovert ops cloaks for anything other than a black ops battleship impose more penalties to the ship equipped with them decrease scan resolution increase sig radius and reduce targeting range by a factor of 4 when not activated and prevent capacitor regeneration while cloaked remove scan res penalty on the module and no capacitor penalty to black ops bs semininja blops buff no cycle timercovertops cloaks introduce a cycle timer on the cloak and introduce no capacitor regeneration penalty while cloaked cycle timer may be 520 minutes and cloak drains 10 of cap per cycle if cap runs dry ship decloaksfor covertops cloaks the changes are there to ensure that the pilot is not inactive at the same time penalties are not severe as to gimp the use of covertops ships in pvp leaving your ship in space for a short break is fine but leaving it too long will get you blown up the reasoning for this is that the advantage of having the element of surprise 2357 is much too overpowered is someone is not at the computer however even if you are semiafk doing something else youll still be there to hear the capacitor is empty warning in time to reactivate the cloak the entire point of this is that cloaks are used more tactically and the presence of a cloaky ship will mean impending pvp activity rather than a permaneut cloaked up in local if you want to have the advantage youll have to be at the computer perhaps this will make cloakers even more feared because now you know there is someone at the keyboard watching youtldrchanges will not impact people who are running cloaky tackle gathering intel in a cloaky stealth bomber pilots flying black ops battleships they dont need nerfschanges will impact people who are at work while cloaky alt sits in localchange aims to encourage actual pvp hotdrops scanpointboom rather than cloaking up and doing nothing more use of the black ops hulls since these are the only ones that are able to do the afk cloaker thing
only truly affects the active cloaker and promotes the use of macrosnothing new suggested and not supported while ever local is the all seeing 100 risk free instant intel tool it is now
so your solution is to remove local unless you know how to program a macro to check dscan warp around evading angry locals while the capacitor charges up i dont foresee macros being an issue
odd  you mention compromise in your op then propose to make covops cloaks unusable which positions exactly are you compromising between
there is no compromise required between the two campscloaking works just fine the way it is its local that causes the issue so remove that
hekirathe six people who troll the threads in this forum are not interested in compromise they want nothing to change except what they think needs changed even when you say you agree that what they want to change should be done along side your idea they will still disagree they want things to go their way and only their way
dont listen to this guy hes either a botter or an idiot who has never left highsec personally i suspect the latteranyway yeah cloaking is working as intended
challenging  poor ideas is considered tolling cd
if this is a compromise i highly recommend a future in politics in the united states i believe either the democrat or republic party has need of your viewpoints on compromise
weve all been there  sitting around probing down a system thinking that youre all cloaked up and safe when all of a sudden you look down wtf ive been a sitting duck all this time somehow youve been decloakedthe current indication that you no longer have a cloak active is that the faint pulsing green circle just stops pulsating thats it extremely easy to missi propose some sort of instant notification that alerts you upon accidental decloaking whats accidental anytime you decloak without explicitly deactivating the mod yourself this notification should be a sound accompanied by a text popup like what happens for combat  kinda like what happens with the audio shieldarmorstructure alertsor make some sort of effect on your ship right now when you decloak your ship slowly fades back to opacity maybe if there was some sort of flash or something emitted from your ship chaulk it up to cloak malfunction due to closeby objectsit would be nice to know as youre sneaking up to a kill when youve strayed a little to close to space debris that way you can make a quick decision on what to do rather than continue thinking that youre cloakedthoughts
id be in support of some kind of sound or even an interface flickerbut you wont get much support for this because apparently cloaking makes you evil
yay supportabout the ebil cloakers this has nothing to do with the current afk cloaker whining i agree something needs to be done about those but this is obviously for people who are actively doing something thus more in danger of being decloakedlet me just state this here this enhances the current cloaking mechanics to better do what they are meant to do  being sneaky it has nothing to do with afk cloaking 
oh not another im noob pls fix the game so it does everything and autofix my mistakes  thx but not
been playing this game for a while now and i love my cloaky ships im fairly skilled with them as in experience and not sp but i still make mistakes which cost me to uncloak without my knowing it when im hunting someone in an anomaly and trying to dodge the space junk or simply sitting there scanning unless i want to look down every second to see if my cloak is still active theres no way to really know if youve been decloaked obviously your ship being opaque would give it away but it takes a few crucial seconds for it to applyi dont think what im proposing is dumbing eve down its a simple enhancement it will not automatically recloak you or anythign just let you know when youve been uncloaked simple as thati guess under your argument you shouldnt know the health of your ship knowing the health of your ship will allow you to make better judgement calls well knowing when youve been decloaked will allow you to do the same thingjust sayin
theres a fairly distinctive sound that plays when you decloak
im aware but that require the camera to be riding up the ass of your ship kinda like how you can only hear combat if youre zoomed in when youre zoomed out cant hear anything

thats the thinghe doesnt have a solution because he doesnt want one and since he has nothing else once again hes back once again to rant about the same exact things which ive already addressed in bold italics and underlines which when used that much is really no different than shouting in caps apparently he thinks that still being able to be shot at without concord intervention automatically makes it high sec somehow oh well more bumps i guess

may appear like idiot but each time i have to undock i realize its one of the little things i would really likeeve loading are soooo long and i fear cq wont go on the good direction at all for thatim the only one really hoping for shoter loading 
you want to stop botters go for it go to their system and cloak up your ship it will have the exact same effect i just dont think that while you are doing that you should be able to walk away from your computer and leave your ship cloaked in system if you want to stop their cash flow then sit in there and when you need to go find someone else to replace yousad that the only real argument you can come up with so far for nerfing afk cloaking is to through accusations of botting which by the way is not an argument at all
youre throwing accusations around im just mocking your reply hence why i stated it was daft you really should stick to one thread chap your having great difficulty keeping up and comprehending
so for now i see myultiple ideas in forum how to stop afk clouckers1 fuel requements for cloucks2 capregenration but that tings not eat much cap eny ways they will recap about in 30 sec to atack soem one so i dont tink so that wil stop eny afk cloucker3 pos module with pulse do decklouck ships for soem time if he is afk than hee wil net reclouck if not hee wil cloucki wil say one more tin afk cloucker its the same as botter hee generates kill mails esay way by not paying a game actualy i tink personaly need to be cionsidered as bots to
this idea is a win  win for everyonemore revenue for ccp and the possibility of adding another sink for plex this would in turn drive demand and plex price up adding incentive to buy isk the legal way and reduce rmt appealalso people wouldnt need 3 accounts for temporary goals to then transfer the characters off
would be awesome
why would it put more load on the serverif anything it would reduce it as a there would be less market orders b most people would not have enoughalso were talking about easy calculations here not like the ones done in pvpis player wallet  buy order minimum amount sound easy to mein effect its just an expanded search function
well i dont have the time to go deep into concurrent software design here in this forum but in short sure the caluculation is simple but think about how many times it needs to be done basically everytime anyones wallet total changes the system needs to check pretty fast can be done on the client all your open orders and update the slow part all the ones that need to have their colour changedthere is already a throttle for too many order changes in a short period of time traders will know that you can only change an order once every 4 minutes this delay is to give ample time for the views on everyone elses market display to reflect the change everyone online thats 33000 clients otherwise you will have race conditions that still happens sometimes and somebody may try to fill orders that are no longer thereso imagine if everyones wallet updates caused a slew of order updates with maxxed out trade and retail skills you can have over 66 orders open that would mean that we would have to throttle wallet transaction updates to less than 1 per 4 min as well otherwise the resultant order changes would not be able to keep up
i think your over analysing this the load would be minimal at bestyou can argue your point all you want but i dont think your right
ccp wants pvp and their ideas of how to bring it is beyond silly the easiest way to increase pvp is to break down the power blockshowmax number of members per alliance 1000max number of better then 00 standing an alliances can have toward other alliances 3corps can not join if the membership of that corp puts it over the capmembers can not join a corp if it brings the alliance above its capccp removes all 100 to 00 alliance to alliance standings and all corps follow alliance standings toward other alliances this way alliances are either blue or they are notccp removes all standing based docking and jump bridge network usage to only allow blue use onlythis limits the max size of a power block to 4 alliances for a max of 4000 pilots with 4 alliances with their own leadership goals and interests then you can start to have real competition and real pvp in 00 sure a single 4000 pilot alliance can break in to 4 and still be a single alliance under 4 banners but they would now become a power block unto their own and not be capable of setting others bluepower blocks could work together but without true blue standing then they are not gonna be able to live in close proximity and work with each other sharing bridge and station access this makes for at best temporary alliances between power blocks anything long term would not be possiblesure maybe the details or numbers can be tweaked and the idea can be finessed but the idea itself is the only reasonable way to break up the power blocks and bring pvp back to 00
red is now blue change defeatedyou cant stop people from having friends and adding in artificial limits like this is just begging for people to metagame around themwhat would you do about the corps that are bigger than you would allow alliances to become how would you stop current alliances just merging everyone into one corp why is this needed when there is plenty of warfare going on already drfplfriends vs ncdcfriends drf vs aaa whatever the hell is going on in the southeast etc etc
how about just disallow alliance standings across the board
as long as many players want to be in a bloc no limit hammer will work its the way those players like to play the game make medium scale stuff more attractive and some players may leave the blob
i think a better way to encourage pvp is to fix the bounty system its less disruptive to the existing structure of the game and adds depth and new career paths to the game
ccp does not seem to think so the last 2 patches have been geared to generate more of itccp can limit bridge and docking to better then 00 standing to prevent alliances from outside power blocks from sharing resources only one 00 outpost in eve allows docking to all atm as far as i knowccp removes all alliance to alliance standing short of blue so your alliance is either blue or neut thats how 95 of 00 operates anywayhow is it handled now if the executor corp ceo has more in his alliance then he has skills for what happens
no redorange lists are used to count pilots of different alliances in local something you need in medium scale stuff quite a lot
a very minor loss of easyquick intel to bring the overall amount of pvp up id say
if alliance dont want to be in a block they dont blue other alliances
exactly so make it more attractive to stay independent just limit the bluelists wont work as long as players want to blob
its only more attractive to stay independent if you do not want to hold space otherwise your a 1000 man alliance max that needs to thwart the attacks of a 4000 member power block or a temporary coalition of power blocks interested in cutting up your spaceoutside of sov warfare as a power block your pool of available pvp pilots is smaller less space is owned so less space between you and hostile alliances and the number of blues is greatly reduced to support you this all brings the pvp you can expect to go way upin sov warfare how exactly do you blob if the fleet size is limited to 255 and other fleets on the field that are comprised of temporary allied but nonblock alliances will show neut to you on the battlefield what would be the motivation of block alliances assisting others in taking space if they cant fly through it use bridges or dock in its outposts without appearing neutral and being shot at after the space is taken
you still have tickers on overview yes it will suck but not nc nor drf or whatever will start to become the next generation of uber medscale pilots its not the way those pilots want to play eve no idea whats the motivation to be just a number out of thousands and wasting tons of time for someone that hardly knows you at all but many players seem to like it this way
if standing changes were in forced then power blocks of 24 alliances over 5 regions could not exist one alliances owning all outposts in 4 regions could not exist the logistics and bs to maintain full time coalition of power blocks under a changed system would be too much for people to deal with realisticallyfor instance picking a random region out of dotlan branch is soved by 6 alliances for a total of 13800 characters under the change it would need to be a minimum of 14 alliances and 4 power blocks sure razor does not live in branch so they would need to pass some ownership of their stations to other alliances or try and maintain them with 3 other power blocks of as many as 10 alliances in region not having docking rights 3 other power blocks would need independent bridge networks their would need to be a cross block intel channel but no one could be sure if names linked were truly neut or not unless they showed info everyone in the region would have to show info on every new neut in local to see if it is truly hostile or one of the 10 alliances that are in the other 3 blue power blocks sov pvp would be insane because you would have 14 different alliances in a group of fleets all trying to filter the overview by alliance you could not filter by distance by ship or by any other overview optionwhy would you go through the trouble of maintaining something like that what would be the benefit the power blocks would break up and stay broken up except for temporary coalition to take space to break it up amongst the coalition their would be no way to maintain them full time only 4 alliances in the game would be effected by the cap and would have too many to form a block of their own all of witch have a single 2000 member corp or could drop the sub 50 member corps and easily make it under the wire
yeah because we dont already use more out of game tools than in game tools to organize blocs removing the few things we use in game is going to do next to nothing there may be more pressure to merge up a few of the smaller alliances but overall nothing will change
how could you maintain coalitions as they are today of your limited to having 4000 member blocks you can not set blue to other blocks and no other blocks or alliances can can share resources like bridges and outposts
well now that you have killed any alliance wanting to live in the deeper areas of null ruined the fun for a large number of people and destroyed the several thousand pilot battles eve is famous for what are you going to do
sov 00 is for mighty player empires complaining about alliances controlling 00 is like complaining about losec being full of pirates
they squash pvp 98 of the time when they do clash it is 5000 people hitting a node until it dies
deeper alliances will have to be more self sufficient and less reliant on the 20 jump bridge jumps it takes to get to high sec to buy a drake from jita but thats a challenge and hardly a drawback as most of the best null sec space is deeper into null sec
either post with your main or admit you have never set foot in 00
nullsec as it is is incapable of being self sufficient there are not enough manufacturing slots research slots etc breaking up the coalitions will leave alliances with even less manufacturing ability than they currently posses making them even more reliant on jita of course if you had ever been to nullsec youd know that
i have been in null since june 07 i am currently in one of those alliances where i have to take 12 bridges to get to empire if you need to know my in game name so you can try and tear down my reasoning then your flawed my last large engagement we attempted to abort a super in production the lag was so bad that even tho we had more then enough people to kill the tower the mod lag was so bad the pos managed to shield tank the fleet i think i managed 12 volleys in an hour
people will find ways around these artificial restrictionsa better way to go is dynamic truesec do away with system upgrades and respawning anoms overfarmed systems degrade in quality while untouched systems become cookie jars make it so that you can make a hundred times more what you can make otherwise in a bad system sure itll make life harder for 00 carebears and screw up renting arrangements but thats what ccp wants right
was that the attack on a csaa somewhere deep in delve while it still existed doomsdays cycling faster than artillery i remember that onei also remember a huge number of smaller and much much more entertaining fights ive been involved with as a member of the dc none of those involved squashing pvp or cramming 5000 into a system your suggestion would kill the game for me and i doubt im the only one why do you hate fun
while i firmly believe we need more incentive to get into 00 and more diversity in 00 too i think that once you start to dictate how people play you lose the elements that make eve what it isif people want to blob then you must let them blob the trick is to allow more play styles in more areas so the blobers can go ahead and lag each other out an dth erest of eve have plenty of options to go about how they want to playpvppveim against forcing things like how many friends or members you can have the nc and so on are like they are because that is how they want to play eve the smaller coalitions and alliances are like they are becasue that is how they want to play neither should be forced to play any other way
i think ccps idea of what 00 should be is alliances in a perpetual shift across the map a universe where pvp is more common where its a struggle to maintain space and have a lasting presence in 00 today we have almost no shift and we have power blocks that cover hole quarters of the eve map with alliances that have been in the same place for 24 years for the time being we have fights when we want them if the holidays or the summer is coming up some power block will invade some pet to make things interesting for a few weeks outside of that they play games pitting their pets against each other in hopes of drawing the other out to fightoutside of sov warfare being a part of a power block now a days means hostiles are 2 regions away the only time you see them is when you camp a null sec entrance make an epic multihour roam out of blue regions or when the hostiles come to you when they do come to you they are not looking for fights but to gank or grief so they never engage if it looks remotely like an even fighti like this idea ccp wants more pvp but is going about it by playing with sec sov bridges and actually effecting the profitability of 00 to create conflict and reducing the risk vers reward
you have no idea what youre talking about
blob is such a relative term how many people do you really need to take down a pos sbu or tcu if the block sizes are capped and somewhat balanced then the need to bring in friends and blob up local over 1k people will be lower your still talking about blocks as big as 4000 members each battling it out even if you only get 10 of your membership on a cta youre still talking about 400 vrs 400 people in local easy lots of fun and its not gonna crash nodes or cause heavy mod lag at all
stop trolling p v p is in 00 fix empire p v p allow bombs and caps
i think a simple change that would be greatly appreciated by me at the very least for ceodirectors to have the ability to check corp standing history currently it displays the date at which a corp standing was changed and by how much but doesnt show by who surely it would be a simple thing to add a column showing which director changed the set standing as corps grow bigger more members get more rolls and become trusted but a recent spout of blue alliances and corps being set red to my corp has made me want this ability

i will always support any idea that removes stargates i like the idea of universal jump drives using stars in lieu of cynos
while i admit i am intrigued a very significant amount of eves pvp occurs on stargates where do you ancipate the focal points for combat would occur after such a change stations belts anomalies anchored sovereignty unitswhat mechanism would you implement to allow defenders to restrict access to their sovereign space if anyim not opposed to the idea i just feel like it needs more fleshing out gatecamps are boring edit perhaps defenders could anchor an interdiction gravity well which would intercept hostile jump signatures from a given solar system such structures would become the new focal points for pvp just a thought
looks very star trek and star wars like warphyperspacei support it you can do that for safety reasons you can jump to the outer margin of the solar system it would make defense harder but it is space there should be not bottlenecks
interesting but very disruptive to the way the game is played currentlyyou mentioned that bubbles will drop people out of warp anywhere in the line of travel but how will people get to that location in the first place to drop the bubble will you allow arbitrary travel between stars when will we get a supercomputer cluster powerful enough to represent a grid the size of the eve galaxy the computational power necessary would be forgive the pun astronomical we would need a god simulator
i like these kinds of ideas in spite and partly because theyd turn the entire game on its asssadly changes this drastic wont actually happen ever
very interesting idea and would love it in another game but i like eve more as it is now
supported in principle but the idea needs to be refined
ill support this in principle because i do like the idea but to echo others this will never happen in this game not the least of many reasons being that the warp speeds in the game would have to change unless you want to spend 8 days game time traveling 100 light years between stars in a 9aus ship
the same places as before but with the addition of the sun and removal of the gate in each system it just wont be like camping a gate they will actually have to take risks as the camper and not just rr cluster as done nowi personally like the idea of being able to anchor a pos at the sun of a given system if you have sov in it and that pos can cover the entire jump in zone of the staramen my alt friendthat is one thought changing probing to be more about pursuit is another allow a probe to basically be a destructible drone that homes in on a target you specify you simply have to warp to the drone at the right time to catch the preyanother thought is that when a jump drive spools up it sends out a cyno style signal to everyone in the system each ship class could have their own spool up time with titans taking up to 180 seconds frigates maybe 20 seconds this would allow interceptors to intercept most ships and the larger ones would take long enough for a dictor or hic to reach them anywayanother thing is that i only usually support the removal of interregional and interconstellational gates inside a given constellation the gate system is still intact which allows certain systems to be off limits for jump travel such as jita while not disallowing access entirely
if you let me do an extreme comparison imagine eve ships as soldiers sc are tanks tanks do need 35 soldiers inside but are very powerful as scsc should need 3 capsuleers to be usedone pilot one weapons and one systems
that would be so boring
did you actualy seen what the galente supercarrier did try to dock at caldari station just was there 3 weeks ago the hole in the left side of the station is still not repaired and let me not mention the war wich has been broken out since then
can you not store a super in a capital ship maintenance arrayif not why they are hardly as protected as a station or outpost
yes  yes yes yes yes how do you thumb up moreaha right alts
100 members of ema support this ideait needs to happensick of trying to remeber what im saving for its a simple code change ns hould be implemented
good idea i tried send a bit to corp wallet but its a pain to mangage would be way easier having it sill on char wallet but on different tabs
the number of corp wallets needs to be looked at as well ideally the number of both personal and corp wallets should be customizable with a sensible cap say 16 in order to reduce database load which is why im guessing we dont have personal wallets just make it default to one wallet the vast majority of players and oneman corps will never use more than one which leaves more db space for the industrialminded entities

i think there is something in your proposal but it should be much better developedthis is all very vague and indefinite maybe if we get the chance to borrow isk npc corp where we have a good standing for some kind of an interest rate of 2 to 3 that we would pay out weekly or monthlyinterest would of course varied depending on the npc corp standing the amount of isk and the length of time in which we will borrow isk and of course the monthly or weekly paymentsof course borrowing would only isk that you do not need or do not use and you could always pull it back if you take it before the expected interest paymentyou would not have got the interest for that period of time
at least you came out and openly said you wanted big daddy ccp to give you zerorisk profits
i see here the problem that noobs wil much loan isk and niot give it back so to say that risky for npc corps to give out anormus amounts off isk witout eny garantys there need to be garranty system that you give that money back to
how will you combat inflation hyper inflation takes down economies in rl zimbabwe comes to mind if you want to do this then as this is a virtual world you can increase the amount of ore in the universe to keep in step with the increase in isk in the system but your going to hit a point where there are not enough miners to pull the ore out of the rocks to keep up those who have enough extra cash to put into the bank are going to get a lot richer than those who do not have enough isk to bankyou cannot put new isk into the economy without an associated isk sink ie these banks are going to have to give out loans which as i said in my earlier post is not that easy as it is prone to scamsi do agree there should be some sort of trusted credit system which was one of my points in my other thread about new money laundering laws but its all too complex to implement without a proper crime and punishment systemrisk free interest rate not supported

news flash coming from an indy guy that started in 2005bots did exist back then just like they do today many empire systems that had ice belts have been taken out of the game because of them trying to force macros to rat field belts only for some one to reprogram the macro to release drones than the orca came and guess what macros went from shoving out cans to having a orca sit with them the only way to hit them is hulkageddon which they try and get me aswell and that happens twice a year i just find stop mining or dont mine in a barge or do like one guy said with random spawns but than again i cant afk mine either ive already got the chance of sansha attack force coming in on me and i like my all night mining with 15min naps in between loads lol

day 1 summary  let them eat cake
hey we want to know time for you to make them drink and accept to pubish it
personally i think they should put accelgates for sov warfare to control which shiptypes or how many ships can enter battlefield as in the tournaments would control lag and make more fun pvp great sov holders would be the most skilled pilots or those who throw most isk in the fights
what makes you think we wont drive you off the moons in 4 as welleditreally i mean seriously what makes you think granting access to more moons will cause a change in the balance of who holds them what differentiates us from you is not wealth its numbers will and coordination nullsec alliances dont have one tower or two towers we have hundreds we dont mine a couple moons in system x we mine every moon with resource y in region z when we move into a region we send people out to scan everything literally everything to assess what is worth taking and then we lay out a plan to take it all reinforce five towers a night build our own etc etc etcweve taken what you want to do as a single or small tower count operation and multiplied it dozens of times over if ccp increases the number of moons available for mining it will not translate into tiny generic corp x getting a moon and finally striking it rich it will result in big alliance y sending all of its scouts to all the new systems and then later that same week theyll have built towers there and youre back to where youre at now staring at a bunch of towered moons you cant have because you have not the will numbers and coordination to take themdeal wiz it
i think you need to learn to use commasi also think that the skill requirements for t2 weapons are pretty reasonable as is yes it does take some time but that is a good thing

hopefully you guys arent too much into the talks but here goesi agree that there should be multiple stations in player owned sov as a possiblility and that they should be buffed there also needs to be the possibility of building an industrial empire from a smaller starting point i suggest mini poss these poss have no protective shield these use a small control center versus a tower this is essentially a small modular pos with less cpu and powergrid either it could use the regular pos mods or it could use a new set of mods the mini pos will overall have less defensive capabilities and will operate independently from one anothermultiple mini poss can be setup under the control of a single pod pilot manufacturing and research can be done with such mini poss at a significantly higher rate than normal poss due to not having to maintain a shield the mini poss fuel requirements are significantly reduced compared to a small pos moon miningthese mini poss should also be able to do moon mining albeit a bit differently instead of the regular select mineral type and start mining it will be more like planetary interaction in that the yields and positions of various minerals change overtime each moon has a maximum mineral output that can deplete if used too much although the moon recovers overtime therefore the mini poss moon harvesters will need to be repositioned every few hours or sooner depending upon depletion rates such moon mineral changes only effect the mini poss regular pos moon mining is unaffected by this change since mini poss are so exposed they are always open to being attacked and looted by small marauding parties mini poss can only be placed so close to each other to prevent overcrowding and to allow the possiblity for a small marauding group to eventually grind through an entire defensive complex mini poss will have a much more rapid onlining times as compared to regular poss for more active use and readjustments this will allow for small installations to be rapidly deployed and undeployed to avoid hostile gangs overall this should allow for nearly infinite production in nullsec and lowsec with a low startup cost this should allow nullsec to be the industrial juggernaut of new eden

bring it back the new one is so boring i mean the code for the old one is already writtenoh and if people are concerned about lag frankly the 50 caps jumping in should not cause more lag with the old system realistically it was only a recorded sound and a bunch of white lines whereas now it is a small vortex of your ships image quickly spiraling then disappearing with a sound like a plopjust bring it back for caps keep the current effect for subcapsps never before have i seen such a thread that everyone almost everyone 1 or 2 people disagree but they disagree because of lag seemed to agree on

id like general responsivenes first you know when you do any action and then doubt if you have really done it because the system is so slow freaks me out wow responsiveness is far better ps and what ive put in another thread search function for lp store there are way to much items and when you are searching for similar ones like all the megathron items or a series of hardwiring implants you have to scroll way too much
idea is nice on paper but silly in eve big ships are horribly bad to manouver around anything since due some game mechanic range from ship is calculated differently from the bumbing mechanic you can be like 4kilometers from object but cannot approach it anymore since some imaginary boundary is already touching it even though gfx is notfor example big ships like ragnarok cannot directly approach ship maintenance array on a pos because the ship gets bumbed by the ship maintenance before its in rangealso you can fit like one titan gfx wise between two titans but still the two titans are 0m from each otherif game would handle bumbs and ship boundaries correctly bigger size would be nice with the current mechanics no
great idea
can submarines be located with sonarill answer that for you since you dont seem to know anything about submarines yes i lived on one for 2 years and i can tell you no mater how perfectly still you sit on the bottom of the pacific you can be found it may take a long time and huge amount of effort but it can be done further the ability of a submarine to all but disappear takes a large amount of effort from the crew and commander and is nothing remotely similar to the lack of even presence necessary to remain invisible and invulnerable with a cloaka cloaked ship in absolutely no way can ever be found there is no amount of time and energy that would let you find a cloaked ship and destroy itthank you for further ilistrating that a cloaked ship being able to stay cloaked for an infinite amount of time with no interaction from the player is a flawed mechanic
dear traq mardoni have repeatedly asked you questions like1 if hes away from keyboard as you suggest how can he be a threat2 how do you know if hes there or not3 how does someone not at his keyboard impinging on your ability to play eveyour continued tactic of avoiding my questions is what leads people in your threads to believe you are an angry bot user who cant get his program to run properly due to a cloaked person in your system or that you are too incompetent to even plant a trap for your visitor to test him and then decide for yourself if you want to go about your businessits odd to people like you its ok that you should be able to rat and mine freely and you cry for the ability to uncloak your adversary and yet if i were to come to your space and demand you fight you would meekly hide in a tower or station avoiding the fight at all costs
1 because him being in game should imply that he is active and is a threat as it is now it simply implies that he could be active and looking for a fight which i would be glad to partake in or more likely he is inactive and simply floating out in space with no possible consequence to him2 the entire point is that you dont because he doesnt have to remain active to continue to faint the threat posed by an active player3 because he can come back to his keyboard when ever he chooses and become active he must there for be treated as if he is active 237 an effect no actual player can have on a system you must act as if there is an active red in your system who has the intent to either hot drop you or otherwise attack anyone he sees as an easy target this slowes industrial workindustrial ships are weak and therefor must have a small gang for protection and discourages anomaly running any ship or group of ships capable of running sanctums easily would make for a juicy target for a hot drop this slows isk income for the entire corp considerably and all this can be done by a single player who isnt even actually playing most of the time in a ship fitted with a 1m isk mod my issue isnt even that a single player is capable of doing all of this its that there is no possible way to find and destroy said player not even a mechanic that even the most incompetent player could easily evade as long as they were still presentin every other situation in eve you must be at the computer risking your own money in order to either make money or cost others money the invulnerability of cloaking means that you are capable of costing others money with the threat of attack with absolutely no risk of your own and without having to even actually be at the keyboard
i for one agree with traq mardons proposal because hes such a beacon of truthiness i hereby move we deal with the afk cloaking problem by completely removing the usefulness of doing so how should we go about doing it simple remove localtraq mardon friend im with you in this fight against local

i have no problem with free for all space  kos  nbsi  no concord rulesi have a problem with there being a way to become completely invulnerable and have full control of an engagement by simply fitting a cloaking device there is a counter to every other ship and mod in the game its time cloaking devices have a way to be countered as well
im going to help you this one time traq but this one time onlythere is in fact a possible way to find and destroy said playeryou must devise a trap a cunning trap set with the sole intent of getting caught ratting in a ship that is capable of holding said player should he pounce get some friends to lay in wait for the naive to come knocking on your hull then by the time he realized whats going on its too late the game is upif he doesnt pounce well then youve spent the day ratting or mining and no harm no foulim concerned that a submariner like yourself has such a hard time understanding how to catch a hidden foe but perhaps you were in the french navy
this has to be a troll nobody can be that stupid
well as someone else proposed have alternate systems for your everyday stuff you do if one system is not clear for your everyday business simply go to another
hey im going to petition you also your actions dont allow me to play the game the way i want it towhat i want to do i want to shoot you till you blow upyour action you wont undock and youre afk youre totally safe how unfair is thatresult i cant do what i want whaa whaasame logic isnt it
afk cloaking does nothing to stop you it is your own paranoia and inability to plan ahead you are ruining your enjoymenttherefore there is no reason for this thread please nuke it
all the glory to 
i grind standings for clients for isk now i cant check client standings this just killed my profession great going
so have them give you a screenshot
because we are lazy and desire efficiencyi suggest making them available through the api
please god yes ive posted all this elsewhere but this fraks up fw as well as other general empirebased roleplay stuff without being socially accessible standings are meaningless i could roleplay an amarr hero with 10 empire standingswhod know
now how can i see what the standing say amarr has how can i know what a corps standings are until i joinwhy is creepy stalker even being nerfedcompromise factions and corps only
i use standings to figure out which systems pve corps tend to be in for highsec wardecs higher standings with certain npc groups  they run those missionsreturn my intel
def
put it in a seperate tab in the standings tab that is not selected by default because lets face it npc standings lagged the  out of everything when you accidently checked them or truncate the listbut yeah i also want it back it was a very useful intel tool to quickly check if someone is an alt or not which is handy especially for those who operate nrds
here is the good solution
i use the npc corp standings to give out medals to my pilots cant do it anymore killing rp as we speak
just give people the option as to whether theyd like to display the information or notgj though removing a harmless tool from eve
i find it very strange that nobody has asked the obvious question why did they remove the standings in the first place was it for a good reason if so then the op should have to address why the reason for removal was illfoundedperhaps this was the reason it was removed
locator agents
i need to know how a potential member will effect my corps gallente standings
it is already not selected by default default is whatever tab you left it when you looked up someones info last time some people depend on this mechanic to quickly look up the information they want on numerous people it should stay and you need to get smarter
they tried just making 00 bigger it didnt work
it would indeed solve most issues  in the short termwouldnt last more than a year though before the cancer that is the vast blue sea would consume all the new areas and wed be back where we started only more obeseadding  to a pile of  does not make  any more palpable burn it and start afresh
why not just make 00 much smallerwhy not just make lowsec much biggerwhy not make highsec just 4 systems
not supported fountain is already goon suburbs it doesnt need to turn into goon detroitsupported more thunderdomesupported jita dodixie and maybe 2 noob raining systems thats all we need
i think we should leave the cloaking device and all the ships that use it alone instead i propose creating a new module that can be fit into a high slot which i would call the cloak disruption generator this would just be an iteration on the current cloaking system as scientists continue their hard work and research into new tools for us pod pilots to kill each other withthe cloak disruption generator would work much like a cyno gen activating it would cripple the activating ship the same way no movement cloaking jumping etc but would cost strontium to run each cycle it would show up on the overview like a cyno beacon as a cloak disruption field which could be warped to by anyone in systemthe cloak disruption generator would have a 10 minute cycle time but it would not have any effect on cloaked ships until the very end of its cycle at which point all cloaked ships in the system would have their cloaking devices simply deactivated they could then be reactivated normally the one exception to this would be any ship in warp when the cdg cycle ends would not be affected minor buff for covert ops cloaks
the only thing i would add to your suggestion is a mechanic that doesnt disrupt active cloakers active cloakers shouldnt be penalized other than that i agreeedit i like your idea but just to add make it so an active cloaker can counter in some way the disruption either by warping or some other mechanic if the cloaker is not at the keyboard to counter the cloak disruption then he suffers the consequences
how exactly do you know the cloaker is active or not
if a disruption signal goes up systemwide and lets say it takes 30 minutes before it activates the cloaker has 30 minutes to see and react to this signal if he doesnt i think its safe to assume hes either afk or not paying attention in either case hes game to die as it should be in 00
i have been very irritated lately with the sheer amount of crooks in places like jitadodixie and have come up with a proposal to reduce the amount of these scammers1 do not allow any trial accounts to talk in local2 limit the amount of text players that are under 2 months old can send in local in hubsany other suggestions or support along these lines please feel free to post below
upvote for not going frothingatthemouth rageinduced overboard but probally not a good idea i doubt ccp wishes to risk alienating real new players and a text limit would probally only serve to bring in even more scam accounts to make up the difference hard to say
im all for limiting scamspam perhaps instead of limits ccp could enforce temporary blocks on complaints perhaps even team up with 3rd party peeps that are already trying to spearhead this movement ie
ccp needs to stop dancing around the issue and embrace trade hubs put a fee to talk in local or loiter outside a station
do that and the hubs will movenot supported dont punish newbies
hi guysi had to refresh my memory on what a trial cancant do before posting here and here is a link for anyone else that wishes to do the same
scams are as much a part of eve as ratting and pvp
im sure there is a thread discussing that too somewhere
not supported
haahaha danika you really are the definition of the status quo arent you but i love you for it i support any ideas for limiting scammers as they clog up local but i really cannot support a proposal to ban trial accounts from it for all the reasons that others have already mentioned
ive seen articles about eve scams in the bbc news money cannot buy that kind of publicity literally you cant buy an advert on the bbc hell the reason i started playing was because of one of those articles why ditch a great form of advertising
far be it for me to argue the merits of free publicity i am a student of free capitalism after all but if you want to go down that path of reasoning i would put forth the notion that even if removed the notoriety of evescams will live on forever people will find new ways to scam that dont involve spamming local to the point of making it useless for actual chats and finally im going to hazard a guess that not that many people join eve because they want to take part in scams ps i really didnt mean anything personal by the remark please dont take it that way its just that you always seem to argue that things are fine the way they are
scamming and backstabbing is part of the gamelearn to play eveor learn to readeither works
disable linking in local period make people work to be scammed
cyno jammer can solve most of your problem now cyno spoolup will solve more of your your problem later all thats left is those pesky black ops ships but watching local will work around that problemthe folks suggesting that cyno lighters are vulnerable dont get the point that the cyno is available immediately losing the cyno lighting ship fourty seconds into the operation doesnt actually hurt when the target is properly chosen the ship lighting the cyno can be tanked and repped as already mentionedthere does not need to be any special mechanism introduced into the game to make cloaked ships vulnerable learn to face your fear form fleets own your space my opinion is that existing mechanisms do need to be tweaked though
but it doesnt solve the problem of the cloaked ship being completely invulnerable with absolutely no input from the player no matter how big the fleet that is formed is the cloaked ship is only vulnerable if he chooses to be thats the same as me being able to sit in my carrier ratting with reds in system and them not being able to shoot me because of a special invincibility button they want to kill me but cant because there is no way for them to
no actually i like the status quo i like the fact that afk cloaking injects uncertainty into the mix but it still relies upon you for it to work hence why its called psychological warfarebut i see the reason afk cloaking happens but you dont want too not only that you want even more power on top of the already powerful intel tool called local i dont think thats a good idea
there is no uncertaity here everyone is certain that a neut is in the system and noone will bet his expensive ratting ship on the slight chance that guy might be afkits harrasmentgriefing pure and simple but my problem is not with the harrasmentgriefing the problem is that while doing so afk cloacker doesnt risk anythingmoreover one man can do it over many systems without playing at all if you want to disrupt gameplay of many people at least have a decency to invest your gametime to do soas for reason for afk cloaking it is the same as the answer to a question why do catsdogs leak their ballsbecause they canbeing more specific why to risk ships waste time on looking for targets when you can spread afk recons in a constellation or two and when you ready strike wherever you want its just easier way to have fun with minimal investment of gametime and with current game mechanics you dont risk anythingas a recon pilotso the riskreward is very high too high id say
obviously this means that docking up hiding in poses and logging out all need to be nerfed when a gang of twenty reds rolls into system and everyone else docks up hides in their poses or logs off there is no way to kill any of them please dont try to claim otherwise how long do you think it would take to kill even an unstronted large pos with twenty cruisers i know youve never been to nullsec and all but try and use your brain for once
danika and jack out both make valid and good points but they are not mutually exclusive i say give them the pos decloak pulse sure if you want to all dock up to avoid it fine but as it costs them isk to use it it will be a game of cat and mouse of when to use use it and is an isk sink so its good for the economyplus it will give the cloakers something to worry about it should make them think more about strategy instead of being indefinitely invulnerable
i do not agreeas already said this is our counter to localthe solution is remove local but i am not hardcore enough to support that either it would actually slow down a lot of the usual gameplay we engage in ie roaming and push give more of the advantage to the big blob gang though conversely it would be a nerf on their cyno removing on of its most distinct advantagesjust like a lot of people shouting out ideas they fail to realise actually a lot more experienced players have thought about this a lot and this is not something that can just be changed in fact it may have to stay that way whether you like it or not
not to mention how horrific that would be to have your manticore fleet decloacked by some decloaking super weapon lol actually this is such a stupid suggestion i am not sure why i have posted here
if you want to kill someone inside a pos why dont you bring dreads the whole point of the pos was to allow those who own the pos to force their aggressors to work harder to kill them it was literally created to make it so that those living in a system would have a way to survive small roaming fleets while still giving aggressors the ability to get them by laying siege to the pos the point of cloaking on the other hand was never to allow players to passively harass other players harassment is encouraged in eve afkness is not
way to try to make it look like an extreme measure that would completely iliminate the use of cloaks the suggestion would not limit the ability of a manticore fleet at all the players would simply have to turn their cloaks back on and would be vulnerable for 15 seconds further they would have to be in a bomber gang set up in someone elses space meaning they should have something to worry about other than whether they are aligned to the target well enough
a because its a 20 man roam and if you try and do anything at all with 20 dreads someone will drop supers on youb because even if you do hit the pos you have to come back tomorrow to actually kill it though i suppose having never been in nullsec you dont know what reinforcement timers arec hiding in a properly set up pos makes you 100 invulnerable from any roaming gang much like a cloak does i thought you were against anyone ever being 100 invulnerablecloaking devices were designed to allow a ship to hide yes well what are they doing that is against their design an afk player is not doing anything to you your own fear is harassing you
in my experience people who summarily state a suggestion is stupid usually are guilty of not think through the all the factors themselves why would it be so horrible is your entire manticore fleet afkanyways thats a moot point because if you read my earlier post i was agreeing in so far as the pulse would just make the cloakers detectable via probing for a time period do you think that would be too nerfing i suppose you would if you like flying into an enemy held system and cloak logoff a lot
so it is possible to destroy a pos then it may be inconvenient to do it with roaming shipsyou can take a large death star down with cruiser you just need a lot of them and a lot of time but using the correct ships a pos can be relatively easy to destroy righthow about a cloaked ship is there any way to destroy it once its in the system any special type of ship that can be used to find it any possible way to counter it
can the op agree to amend this original proposal from decloaking the cloakers in the system to my suggestion of just making them probeable with scaling difficulty level for a limited time as to dissuade this discussion from going down any further dead ends and moot arguments
if by relatively easy you mean spend eight hours shooting the pos hope the guns arent loaded hope the locals dont form up then come back and do the same tomorrow then yeah sure easyyou can bait it ignore it shoot it once it goes active ignore it pay no attention to it pretend it isnt there assume the guy is afk until you get something on dscan not be an idiot grow a spine andor stop pretending you ever once set foot in nullsec
though not exactly very clear in stating his points i think traq means that it may be hard to counter a pos but at least you can get tangible feedback while countering a pos its a chore yes but something you can make progress on no matter how you try to bait or goad an afk cloaker you really never know its working especially if the cloaker just on vacation so where it would cost a lot of isk for you to build a pos to deny strategic space to enemy ratters you can achieve the same by putting a cloaker 237 an a fraction of the cost anyway i think that is his arguement
im glad you can admit you were wrong about a pos being 100 invulnerable as for what you can do to a cloaked ship there is nothing that you can do except try to get the player to decloak his ship while the ship is cloaked it is 100 invulnerablei think thats an awesome thought would avoid actually decloaking any active players by only making them scannable it should require maxed skills to have any real chance of scanning them down there would need to be some limiting factor on the pos mod though to stop it from being run constantly like you said not sure if this would be something easily programmed thoughalso the people who continue to disagree with the idea of nerfing afk cloakers do so because they are afk cloakers and dont want to have to stop trolling these threads and actually pay attention to the game no amount of sound logic will ever stop them from flaming you they are simply lazy and dont want to have to earn their kills
well i dont want to take too much credit for it it was jack oats proposal after all i just added a bit to it in the 20110519 025000 post as i thought his original proposal would really irritate nonafk cloakers who happen to be in the system and looking at the starmap or something in general im in the camp that cloakers should feel 99 safe while cloaked but when cloaked in enemy sovereign territory then they should feel about 75 safe i wouldnt go that far to make that assumption some people in the thread are just skeptical of random new ideas especially ones that are not articulated properly there are just too many impractical and illconcieved proposals that really the onus is on the op to make a convincing case so the sentiment is generally guilty until proven innocent unfortunatelyoh and be easy on danika she actually is pretty knowledgeable in the game mechanics at least in my limited experience more than a few times she has pointed out flaws in my proposals that i didnt consider
bawwwwwwwwcyno jam your system keep a defense fleet upyour the one that wanted to move out to dangerous 00 space remember suck it up
as long as it affects afk cloaking only and leaves cloaking itself legitimate im on board
there are renters in alliance 00 who may not have the funds to defend properly though regardless of that a 30mil tactic that requires a 30mil defense cyno jam is clearly a play imbalance many wars are won by ensuring that your enemies are burning more isk than they are earning with the victor being the one who has enough isk to keep the fight going in such a war a 30mil tactic that makes the enemy waste  isk to defend is a strategic win even if the cloaker never hot drops anyone into the system im not sure how much it is in terms of time and isk to set one of these up but im guessing its significantly more than the cost of a cover ops ship
well it seems that their attempt to subvert local as an instant intel tool is working rather well on youthey are just not how you like itand people afk cloak because of localwhich would be pointless without localyea local intel power is very high and at least people can use afk cloaking to reduce its power somewhat
just fyi im taking the time to create as many cov ops alts as possible across my 6 accounts just to further prove how ed you areim going to watch you do nothing and theres nothing you can do about ithave a nice dayoh and stop posting the same topic over and over again on new alts youre just making yourself look silly
pathetic
as the game increases in complexity and the abilities of the csm to affect change increase the needs of the people making andor influencing decisions become more advanced currently the method used in assembly hall or any of the other areas are to put forward an idea describe what it would cause and why it would cause that and what the advantages are my belief is that eve has hit a size and level of complexity now that what is needed more than ideas for fixing things are white papers describing the nature of the problem or the nature of a part of a system as thoroughly and objectively as possible the objectivity is of course one of the most difficult goals but the search for the fundamental nature of a problemsystem instead of a search for a justification for a solution helps in that potential solutions could be included but the goal of a white paper is not giving the solutions as much as facilitating someone elses decision making one significant advantage of a white paper is that it cuts through the noise when you have a thread about a rather controversial change in game likei dunnojump bridge changes you get a 60 page megathread that has a blend of rather good commentary about potential effects or the current nature of the system that predicated the need for said change blended with a massive amount of trolling whining and generally worthless usage of timeeffortlife a white paper can be used as a way to remove the kugu and leave the good stuff and beyond that it can come before the change as opposed to after it another reason i think we need to start formally adopting this methodology is based in my own bias as a scientistengineer when i need to solve a problem i minimilize isolate dissect and model i may toss out ideas here and there but in my business anyone who puts money behind a solution without thoroughly modelling the problem first will be out of a job quickly thoroughly modeling a system can actually make the solution trivial hence my desire for something equivalent here aka a white papernow of course a call for white papers is easy how do you manage that thats hard it takes nothing for someone to scrub together 15 minutes of crap typing it up throwing in some verbose verbiage and calling it a white paper i mean look at this crap i just wrote the need for objectivity and thoroughness is such that we couldnt allow people to just slap something together and say its research frankly you need an approving body the same way you have with any academic literatureso here are a couple of offthecuff thoughts1 the csm could explicitly ask for certain topics to be covered2 with those topics people could submit white papers to a csm selected commission or simply from the csm for them to review for acceptance they could be published directly here for discussion but full approval would need to come from the deciding group to achieve a white paper status if you will3 the csm could commission a white paper from a committee selected by them which then could be approveddisapproved by some group csm or csm selected commission4 a financial incentive could be added for a thorough and high quality white paper 5 maybe someone at ccp could be involved in acceptdenying themobviously there are concerns about conflicts of interest here a dominant csm viewpoint could work to createapprove distorted white papers to support their platform i honestly believe that for stuff like this if it is well done will be appreciated for what it is regardless of the viewpoints of the csm i honestly think that if the mitanni was presented w a white paper completely challenging his current viewpoint that he would be willing to read it before dismissing it this is probably not enough for most peoplemaybe i am way off on all of this though i just think that we have reached a point where we need models not solutions
title says it allif you can come up with a completely legitamate reason as to why covert op cloaks should be nerfed id love to hear itdo not want to see your repeated crap about tearstears my bot wont function properly moretearsheremkaaaay
1 shooting at nullsec botters
not supportedi enjoy seeing the cloak threads and drinking in the tears that fill them
damn i didnt think about that wheres the remove thumb button
dunno where you play at but near us bots go spot when neut enters local  why cloak would help at all catching them
these changes make the use of covert ops cloaks for sitting afk in local useless for everything else there is no change unless you are saying that covert ops cloaks are for sitting afk 2357 then there is no issue with themthe compromise is to hopefully satisfy those who complain about afk cloaking and those who use cloaks in pvp
local isnt going to disappear from kspace any time soon part of the reason why not everyone lives in whs is the added security local brings cloaking is really fine as it is all this will do is make it harder for people to use afk cloaking and actually participate in hostile action instead rather than be afkthis can mean im going to be a badass politician or this is really a terrible idea im guessing the latter how so
how do i gather intel in a cloaky ship when i am forced to decloak every 50 minutes to 3 hoursgathering intel means im sitting near some structure of importance gate station pos etc watching just watching not moving not constantly frobbing my cloak just sitting there with the cloak on watching ships come and go for hours on endalso how do i reactivate the cloak when the capacitor is empty
the op wants you to warp around system with what capacitor until it recharges by wasting capacitor warpingall i have to say is no
it is you that wants change so it is you that has to justify why that change is neededyou have spammed these forums with 7 or 8 threads about afk cloaking oh i think its you that wants change your way but youve yet to prove your pointthe fact that you call us trolls indicates you have no argument the fact that you cannot see a way of circumventing this idea with a macro means youve failed to understand the wider implications of such a change
i believe i have proven my point over and over again thats why there are now several other players starting to make proposals of their own
cloaking works fineif u want to get rid of those oh so scary afk cloakers just have ccp remove local or make it so that cloaked ships dont show up on local anymore once the device has been activatedreal security comes from scouts combat probes and your directional scannerlocal is just easymode for kspace sissies
the point isnt that i want the cloaker to go away its that he should have to be sitting at his computer actually playing the gameand how do scouts combat probes and dscan help with a cloaked ship they dont nothing does
no you havent and now your just spamming topics under a new name
what are you smoking why a cloak should have heavier penalties then 2 warpstabsalso cycle timer on covert cloak means you cant decloak at any time
eve as it is is allready giving me too little time to sleepplease do not introduce a change where i have to wake up every 20 minutes just to get some capacitor on the covert going
dont worry there are modules known as cap boosters which are apparently unknown to the op
this is why your idea destroys cov ops cloaking for any purpose other than running away and especially for intel gathering longer than 4 hours which i have done on occasion at the computer btwcloak till cap runs out ship decloaks cant recloak until you have 10 cap definitely enough time for someone to determine your ship type which could ruin whatever you were planning then you get to cloak for 1 cycle and repeat this for as long as you are willing to waste time because they already know what ship you have and can easily guess what you are up tothis is a bad idea as with all nerf afk cloaking threads
belief isnt factalts posting proposals you must be new to eveo forums welcome
not with the cloaked ship itself no but you will be able to see the real threat coming in buzzards and anathemas by themselves are nothing to be worried about u know
why not just have the capacitor very slowly run down when cloaked
works as intended perfect defense perfect detectiondont change what isnt broken
give a good reason to eject your ship in dire situation when the defeat is crushing and you succumbed to a greater foe you want to retreat and keep as many pilots as possibleallow ships that got stuck in interdiction bubbles or large bubbles to eject the pod shooting the pod out at subwarp speed 45 km away from the ship you can escape and save your clone enemy can recapture your ship after battle as a war trophyright now there is no incentive to ever abandon your ship in combat with proposed changes piracy ship capture and trophies may become an new feature for the gameplay abandon your ship and you may spare your life while we keep the rest
not supported its hard enough to get the pod without a bubble why make it harder
sure but once the abandon ship command is given there should be a delay say ten seconds or so and the whole ship should shut down until pod ejectsprevents people from squeezing the lemon by staying until the last sliver of hull while still getting pod out to safetyyes that would mean fairly early ejects would be necessary if pod is to live as no ship with inactive tank mods lives very long  actual value to possible new ship acquisitions
and its impossible to not get podded in a bubbleif there was a way to avoid being podded in 00 it would make possible to use other implants than just cheap  and that would result into it would make podding worth somethingi like the idea maybe you could only emergency eject if youre above 50 structure to give opponents chance to get your shipin return you get to keep implants  win win
an interesting idea sure you may not get the pod but you get a free ship if you can fly it and you dont blow it upif the guy is abandoning the ship then i think if you can stop shooting it fast enough you should be able to take the abandon ship which would be kind of cool to be able to capture ships and not just blow them up
supported i dont want to shoot some pod would rather have a free ship eve mechanics should be about maturity and gainloss rather than some kind of emo teenager mentality where podding a clean clone is its own reward
and how about when the guy ejects and without his skills the ship explodes from the damage its already taken no ship no killmail no nothing
i think you csrs are worthless free loaders but get them to revert this quickly and maybe im wrongonly the faction standings matterif they want to remove agent corp and alliance standings thats finebut right now there are 2 problems1 we cant see what the npc corps standings are to one anotherthis is game breaking in many aspects2 role players wear there standings like a badge of honor and roleplaying corps need to see the standing when they invite people
no agent standings display  actually good no real drawbacksno corp standings display  meh some good some slightly more bad somewhat tolerable overall thoughno factions standings display  what the hell ccp are you insane proposal  agent standings good riddance bring back faction standings let them always be displayed let the player select whether he wants the npc corp standings be displayed for himself or not default should be not displayed when any standings are displayed they should be in a default collapsed expandable folder like the one listing agents in a division and only loaded when expanded
also it like the ship fading to opaque is not instant once you decloak it takes its sweet time to play the sound and even then the sound is soft and can easily be missedim looking for a more jerking sound such as the audio alerts for ship health something that actually gets your attention 
would a notification similar to a combat log be feasible a simple short lived a couple seconds like combat logs are pop up saying you were decloaked because you ran into a corpse or whatever something along those lines
as long as its instant and adequately gets your attentioni would prioritize is like such visual effect from ship  audio alert  text notification  what currently happens
supported
interesting i get the audio alert but why do you prioritize a visual effect so high dont you usually have the solar system map up for scanning while in a cloaked ship and if you were close enough to see the visual effect isnt there already one the ship disappearing wouldnt you be able to hear the audible effect that is already in place change when you decloak
if you think that was my suggestion then please start your own thread my proposal is to tax cross sec status transfers which hardly would split the market as alarmists would say the economy is analog not digital you will have grey areas inbetween none of the other changes you listed are part of the proposal someone else may have suggested them but i never approved them as part of this bill it was an interesting discussion of views and from that standpoint i am grateful for all of you for participating my proposal stands as is but i recognize that its not high pri it just gimps any chance of adding more features to the economy im sure this will be revisited once incarna features come out like black market smuggling of boosters etc believe me those of you who have a kneejerk negative reaction against any new addition of structure will eventually see that although many blind suggestions for regulation in this forum are best solved in other ways sometimes the odd few which address an actual low level game mechanic flaw are needed in order for the game to grow but as there are not many immediate gains that can be realized from this proposal  except for severly limiting hulkageddeon turnout  and this thread has become a battle between the hard line conservatives vs the progressives im going to take a wait and see approach to this  and have low hopes  the bounty system fix was proposed 2008 and it still hasnt made it in its kinda depressing 
the bounty system is actually brokenim uncertain how you believe penalizing cross sec isk transfers would have virtually any affect on hulkageddon or anything really for that matter the most it could amount to would be a fairly easily bypassable annoyance and intentionally designing a game to annoy its playerslowsec is intended for piracy what is the core difference between lowsec and highsec concord killing each other there is intended so what is the reasoning behind creating a section of spacelowsec for the express purpose of letting people victimize each otherpiracy then attempting to penalize them for doing what you intended in the first placei do find it a bit silly how cost effective suiciding miners can be but when you go about addressing an issue its usually best to do so in the most direct as specific way possible so what you do really think is an issue that piracy can be funded with clean isk seeing as how the piracy in question is an intended game mechanic and something ccp wants to be there nerfing it would be a bit counter productive id suggest you try and think of a more suitable source of income for piracy instead then because piracy was meant to be a part of the gamepersonally i dont care where pirates get their supply from ill probally stick to industry and general carebeary income regardless or if pirates had a preferrable source of income id probally go use it to fund my carebeary activities oh the irony but as it is theres no decent way to make isk in lowsec that isnt almost completely reliant on highsec so i dont know why you blame themas for the notion that nerfing piracy could possibly help lowsec theres almost no other reason to be there its the purpose of its existence
rented thank you for a reasonable response just so that we are on the same page as it seems from your reply you may be misunderstanding some of my points i have always argued that piracy is legitamate dont mistake my stance on this with some others on the threadyes the bounty system is broken which was my point in stating so the proposed fix was documented in 2008 and ccp has never gotten around to implementing said fixwe both agree that piracy or criminal professions are currently gimped and needs to be its own selfsustaining career where we disagree is how to fix the problem the simplistic approach that you seem to be a proponent of is to give direct incentive to the pirates to move to low sec we see these kind of direct incentive attempts at fixing economic problems all the time directed taxes tax benefits universal health care the problem is that this wont work or if it does it will have unexpected side effects how do you incentivize piracy in low sec you need to entice indies to go there to farm so that they can be hunted by pirates legitimately but how do you do that when they make a good enough living in high sec indies only move to where markets exist which means you need buyers in the market for products which means you need missioners in low sec which means you need to make mission bounties more lucrative perhaps all fine and dandy but ask yourself this if all the above was done would you move to lowsec if you were a ratter if you knew that everyone has a criminal alt ready to jump you and given the lack of concord and smaller sec penalties its gonna happen a lot more its one thing for legitimate pirates scanning down your deadspace but its totally another to have a fellow missioner pay someone to jump you and split your loot what can alleviate this trust gap using sec status as a badge of trustworthiness a proxy for a good reputation and dealing with pirates should reflect on your reputation right now sec status is a joke because you can be the biggest mass murderer and have a 10 sec status if you pay your alts to do your handy work if you have that proxy for good reputation established then people trust each other more and people will venture out more any solution which can address this lack of trust of players  currently because they metagame  will fix the problem at its root it doesnt have to be my solution so feel free to suggest others
first of all hello to everybody i found a thread on google regarding supersss and the desire of some pilots to get ccp to change or better nerf reduce destroy penalize super capitals as in the opinion of those pilots super carriers are just too powerful well the thread was locked so i decided to pick it up here to see what the turn out of opinions would be the desire to add something of mine was strong enough to lay my thoughts down supercarriers as ccp panel put it at fanfest 2011 are simply supertherefor superiorin every way even in costshugely and have the ability of a ship that is far far superior to the vast majority of ships in the game please i repeatdo remember that super caps are very very expensive and the modules combinedfactionofficer modules in addition to hull may cost even more than the ship itself as someone mentioned in other threads on motherships when you are flying a spaceship that is worth billions and billions of isks you want to make sure you have some serious fire power in your hands and super ehps of tank to make it out also consider the skills and time required to train and fly a super cap in a proper maxed out way is extremely time consuming forcing an entire fleet to work together to take down a super cap is a positive aspect of ingame mechanics that allows for huge fleets of pilots to work together and enjoy the game  team work  at the same time it offers the super cap pilot a challange to see how far he can push it in facing an armada and make it out alive  his skills combined to his ability to pilot the ship fittings implants and more  pure strategyeve at its best in my opinion the balance of the super caps and other ships is perfect just the way it is the pure awsome power of the super caps is matched by the costs and risks the pilot who flies the ship has if things go wrong or if he doesnt plan his strategy with all the available variants nerf the supers and you will be removing a beautiful super ship that is a pleasure to see on the field and an incredible experience to use on the battlefield and a goal that many many pilots in eve aim forbecoming a super carrier pilot a great sadisfaction trust me and please remembermany many pilots attack supers and titans with words and ideas to get them nerfed by ccp simply because they cannot afford them or have no intention to put in the months of hard work required to either build them or to mine and obtain the resources to construct those ships or get the iskies neccessary via long hours of mining to pay for one merit to those who do or can  even to those who use plex moneyits their choice and good for ccp who cashes in a lot more real moneyallowing them to invest it in further development on eve  please remembermeritocracy is essential even in the eve universe thank you to allps thank you ccp for giving us such an awsome beautiful and incredibly pleasant category of ships to fly i am sure i speak for all super cap pilots
youre right they should remove fighter bombers and reverse the buffs that made them unbalancing restore them to their original state
ouch that wot hurts to look at please format to include spaces and paragraphs and stuff then we can read it
currently internet spaceship pilots are all over my screen and a girls eye is always on a banner i am suggesting having a option to have a plain text only fourm that players can use at work and on smaller devices easier than the current standard format thanks
youre having to load the system environment as you undock as well as the grid that youre undocking into the only way to shorten it would be to have a faster computer unless the server is being lagged out in which the undock will take forever anyway due to waiting on the grid to load
not if things are optimized server side  on the clientand anyway currently when you load space from nothing its way quicker than loading space from a station meaning theres really something strange on the code
if this is boiling down to the game is too slow fix it thread then i think they are already on it i dont think lag is something that requires a csm proposal for the devs to know about probably more fit as a discussion topic in the general discussion forum as it doesnt really classify as a feature request for the game
this is kind of like going up to a race track and saying to one of the mechanics hey have you guys tried making your car go faster i think youd win a lot more races if your car was faster
it would be nice to be able to add an item to an existing sell order without having to have a completely separate sell order if it is in the same station
is it just because it would be convenient or do you see an actual game imbalance with the current way that orders worki think that would only serve to dilute the potency of the retail and the trade skills not to mention you essentially jump the order queue by doing this completely breaking the fifo system of the order booknot supportedfor those unfamiliar with how exchanges work your orders are filled first by price priority highest bids go before lower bids then by order entry time if 2 orders are at the same price the one that was entered first gets filled first
well the way it is now most people cancel the first order and make a new one more unnecessary database traffic to take down and put up an order than modify an old one or they put up a second order and penny game themselves order clutter from what is basically the same personif someone can spend enough effort to modify the quantity of a sell or buy order then they will probably also put in enough effort to penny game whoever is outbidding themyeah this is a convenience thing imagine you have a steady income of some material mining pi a pos sometimes you just have a hauler full of something and you just want to take it to a market hub and throw it in with a sell order you already havealso if you want to have a load of sell or buy orders open at once all you need to do is make 2 more alts on the same account as your main spend a week or so training up trade skills for sell orders contract stuff to your alts and have them put it on the market then just let the alts sit you dont need to pay for another account because your alts are sitting there on your account and youll never have to log into more than one of them at a time so with no added cost you can get 3 times the sell orders open than you normally would and honestly who needs that many sell orders anyway
ops of said threads should be given a 30 day ban from gamethat is all

not supported i personally find it useful to afk cloak in systems surprised but im doing so in low sechigh sec where there is no sovereignty i think cloaking should not cost you anything or be on any timer however as you may have read in other threads on this topic i do recognize the unbalance in gameplay when this is used to squat in someone elses doorstep so the natural solution when this happens to you is to pay somebody to remove them where they are not wanted but it should cost you isk to do so so the only viable solution was jack oats one where a pos thereby only works on sovereign systems has an upgrade that will make cloakers findable for a short time thereby giving the owners of the house an opportunity to evict the vagrant if they stay too long
can we have a search field in the lp store with the current filters the options are way too limited

if ccp plans to boost 00 industry andor nerf high sec industry so we dont depend on jita for everything in 00 then this change makes perfect senseif you just keep nefring 00 people will simply go to empire run missions there or other isk making activites and clone jump back to 00 to have some fun to some people this makes perfect sense it just eludes me
my bad i will add more when i post

day 2  dreaming of quality assurance
thanks for posting these up good stuff even though i do wish they could be more detailedbut i understand ndas
this is a really good point more npc null  more small nullsec alliances
have you guys seen the new eve quarterly economic report
right off the bat the biggest faucet is pirate bounties they will have to go but killing pirates still needs a reward otherwise people will just straight up leave nullsecone solution might be the rouge drone solution just have them drop minerals or better yet t2 building materials this might create a kind of material inflation where the market is flooded with materialsthis might not be so bad as more materials would encourage more ship construction and more ship construction would encourage people taking more advanced ships which are now cheaper along on roams and ctas more ships in space means more of them getting blown up which makes its own material sinkyou could also go the incursion route and hand out lp loyalty points are basically inflation proof since they cant be given to other players and can only be turned in at certain npc stores for items lp is basically a module or ammo or something waiting to happen
there is so much wrong with what both of you said that im just going to focus on the obvious points1 if you eliminate bounty prizes the remaining isk faucets do not equal the existing sinks2 the depicted sinks do not include the largest one which is the difference between insurance and actual fitted ship cost pvp combat losses are an isk sink but one which is harder to depict in a graph not all the mods survive and insurance doesnt cover the full cost3 prices on tech 1 items are generally stable or declining over the last year despite ccp eliminating the tritanium floor several years ago if you look at the mineral price index on page 23 you can see that mineral prices are declining in more months then they are climbing tech 2 prices are climbing because pi drives up pos operation costs the past year trends suggest that the game did go from a period of gradual deflation to stabilization to gradual inflation but nothing which suggests that anything is seriously out of whackdeal wiz it
uh no ship destruction is an isk faucet and mod destruction is iskneutral when you buy a ship and mods from the market money is transferred from you to the sellers less transaction taxes when your ship then explodes you get an insurance payout the net result is that the amount of isk in the game has increased  the guys you bought the ship from still have the isk you gave them but now you have the insurance payout in your wallet as well you individually are worse off but the amount of isk in the game as a whole has gone up
oy will we get a preliminary report before release of the official minutes forums need something to  and moan about and we are running dangerously low  damn cloaking threads have started up again  bff is everyone null included cs is everyone with a null bias omg lag to the petition mobile ship balance is everyone with a null bias especially if they start work on capitals and ways to limit blobs ui improvements is everyone null included eve marketing is very much null the epic struggle against lag has been a selling point for many years  no one wants to try a game that promises hours of boredom in a highsec belt  npe is npe
yep
quoted for maximum trollage i spent over 2 years flying nothing but caldari ships and using missiles i didnt do a lot of pvp ill grant but when i did i was using hmls i never used hams and nobody in any alliance or corp i flew with would ever consider using them in fact they made a point of telling people not to use them any pvp i did do was strictly limited to roams and small gang pvp and did not benefit from maximum blobbage which completely removes any need for skill or sensible fitting in fact with the leadership bonuses stacked right and the number of ships youre pretty much guaranteed to have ever possible threat countered no need to worry about velocity sig or any other factor just click your modules and wait for all the pretty explosionsi wasnt aware that cruise missiles could reach 8kms pretty sure ive never seen anything top 5 and a bit kms in any fitting i never trained cruise to max though and never used them muchi never said anything about dps or game breaking i was talking about balance and using a comparative tool its been days since i posted that honestly and ive actually forgotten what point i was trying to make or why it mattered obviously you have too much time on your hands and too little else to do with it personally i work for a living and cant be bothered to fill my head up with all this kind of unrealistic nonsense about a fictional game the math may be easy but the details only serve one purpose and that is limited to this little world memorizing them is kind of like remembering all the spells in dd it has no real use or purpose
and yet here you are complaining that theyre broken right youre totally credible therefyi a ham drake can push out about 600 consistant dps and has a perfectly workable pvp nichUFFFDcaldari bs iv and missile projection iv is enough to have a raven spewing them out at 73kms without rigs or implantsyeah it showsheres an idea  if you dont know what youre talking about and have basically just admitted it shut up and stay out of game balance threadsalso theres a big difference between knowing every tiny detail of a game and knowing the fundamental basics of missiles you clearly have neither
as a former nullsec builder here are my two centsthe worst thing about industry anywhere is the ui i didnt stop building because it was cheapereasier to jump stuff in from jita i stopped because my fingers bleed when individually queueing up 10 identical invent jobs ad infinitum and ing with the pos interfaceslots are an issue if using outposts and were probably the largest obstacle to building after carpal tunnelboredommisery with the ui more outposts per system andor more slots per outpostmore levels of upgrades would be good i think if there are more outposts the ability to destroy them becomes more important i think that feature should be implemented regardless or you could just fix poses and the corp managementsecurity interface so that for example someone could install a job without being a factory manager having the ability to destroy everyone in the corporations jobs without leaving a record of having done so also modularity is key because dragging and dropping stuff and having to be within 5k of the pos module is a real pain when you have like 8 labs and 3 chars running jobs  make them add up to one giant lab module with all the slots and one giant hangarbucket for all your stuffi think dynamic pricing for empire slots is a nobrainer if you want to queue up a build job in jita 44 where wait times are 30 days that should cost more than an empty station in solitude it might not push people to nullsec but it will definitely spread people around more you could even provide a bonus to build time based on sec status to further encourage frontier industry i think the base price of highsec manufacturing could increase by a factor of 100 and it wouldnt make much of a difference  something like 100 isk an hour for a build slot is a rounding error provide discounts for standing i dont think there is one atm right it only affects refine tax and you provide further incentive for people to explore pve content sigh such as it issomeone suggested mineral size adjustment sounds good to me make trit much smaller and megacyte much bigger mineral compression is kind of stupid and symptomatic of poorlydesigned features imo make ore compression better perhaps andor make 25 of minerals inherently unrecoverable upon reprocessing ammomodulesships i think a tweak to the relative abundance and bonus level of the bonus ores is probably also in order  instead of just 5 and 10 which doesnt make much of a difference make them 25 and 50 and greatly reduce their abundance in empirecorrelate it to truesec also maybe make mining not so boringlame golf and fishing require skill and attention  dont use the fact that people chat while theyre bored as an excuse for boring contentgameplaybut really first fix the ui
no 00 is about empire building not camping and then going back to jita to buy more potato chipsbuild a fracking empire and get rid of the hi sec addiction
supported as long as it doesnt change the game mechanics the effect seems not only cool but consistent with most eve cutscenes
in addition to my above suggestion i thought the people at ccp may wish to hear about what dark shikari said when i asked him this question via email recentlyme are you not even tempted to pay new eden a visitdark shikari nah better more fun things to do things that dont involve betatesting ccp software and sitting in capital ship fleets for 8 hours without shooting anythingak
its been how long since this screwup and still no response from the devsfix this crap asap 50 fittings is no where near enough
i would resubscribe with my other account and log in for reasons other than changing skills if they fixed the si uirunning an invent job is about 10 clicks thru 3 dialog windows running 10 identical invent jobs is 100 clicks thru 30 dialog windows ditto building etc why cant i highlight 10 bpcs and run 10 identical jobs that autoqueue in the first available slotsits miserable and sadistic
what does this mean true sizesif this is a make it bigger because it will look cooler not supported the ship sizes were designed that way for reasons  i dont know what they are but unless the art direction team at ccp was drunk when they decided the sizes there must be reasons why a reason of  because it looks cooler  is not going to cut it as justification alone
good idea would bring some symmetry to the financial options available to traders
pot hole
actually no in stations you can camp the station and wait for them to come out cloakers cannot be camped so they can drop their cynos with more surprise than a station camper anyway thats not your point though which was that the op has poor justification for his proposal
sounds like someone belongs in highsec where you can be safe
granted return corp and faction standing to player infoalso for the new capsuleers return the faction standings for factions for roleplaying purposes
obviosuly  ccp tried to make life easier for carebears and ended up screwing the game againit is happening to the entire game

supporting this petition
how do i give this a thumbs up
except the hi sec population wont actually decrease it will just chain crash the server and cause an exodus from the game
yes he would this is actually a pretty good idea and would make mining more intuitive
i know this has been brogth before by difrent players but i want to share my idea how i think it could be done most of you probably know all those discussions with all positive and negative responces and the questions why want and dont remap those skills so i get strigth to the pointidea is1 the skillpoint remap will be only avalible once for character lifetime2 maximum to 10 ten skills can be remaped so you have to choise carefully wich skill you do or do not remapps the number i have post is seems resonable since there is much more skills some would be glad to remap though this is just an number i think is fair and ofc it will be to csm and ccp to make desigion what exact numbers will be taken if the idea will be pushed troughdiscuss
i support the general idea of a skillpoint remap
my suggestion1 no skillpoint remap avalible2 maximum to 381 skills can be trained so you have to choose wisely which skill you do or do not train
i think it would be better to not give the option to have any skill remaps reasons being it is totally unnecessary since we dont have a skill cap it promotes fotm chasing and diminishes the value of high specialisation and variation within the gameall of that applies to your particular variant but some to a lesser degree the problem is that your idea creates new issues first being that you provide no reasoning for limiting it to once in a lifetime you just want to get your foot in the door and do anything to get the mechanic implemented in some form at all costs that isnt a good way to design game mechanics you have to specify what it is that youre trying to fix or improve with your change then we discuss the issue and finally the devs get to decide if its a good fix or if the issue even needs fixingyour solution also creates new problems since people will  things up with remaps and it will cause a constant whine of request asking for additional remaps that is a problem especially for you since if you ignore their whines we can ignore your proposal because it basicly amounts to the same thing so the only way to do this is to either not allow it at all since it isnt necessary and is damaging in the eve skill system or just say  it to all the objections and implement a system that allows periodic remapspersonally im firmly in the no remaps ever camp since it really isnt necessary with the eve skill system and has strong negatives attached to it so i wont support skill remaps in any form
good point but sadly enough not everyone so wise as you are1st i want to point you out that some players did not have back in 20032004 all those shiny guides evemons and any other career tutorials what you have now they has to lern hard way2nd the things have been difrent before eve has evolved to difrent angle some professions become uterly useless so some of the skills simply wont be used by players never again thats why i think it will be fair to give them just a small trade off
some of the point i have posted just above on the reply for another fellow pilot
but wait the people wont receive a guide which skills and where i should remap to win the game with this remap and they will make mistakes so whats next another once per life remapand the things will become different again six years from now and some stuff like t1 ships lol will be useless so whats next another once per life remap
i cant agree choices made should be choices worn
if youre going to suggest something like this make it functional on grid only there is no way any device could affect ships system wide and there is also no way you could scan down a cloaked vessel system wide its completely rediculous and overpowered handicapping a vessel for 30 minutes is also rediculous and just goes to show how little you are concerned about the cloaked vessels combat threat potentialany device that interacts with a cloaked vessel by disrupting the cloak or by allowing the ship to be detected by some means should only function on grid or in a similar limited fashion at any rate any such device should be limited by the size of the vessel that activates it as well as by the size of the cloaked vessel meaning noncovert ops ships especially caps and larger have a greater chance to be detecteddisrupted and that chance is made higher when a cap or supercap even titan is cycling the module intended to defeat themany device intended to provide system wide disruption of cloaked vessels is completely unrealistic but it is possible that multiple vessels could scan down a cloaked ship in a system and that an additional module could help them do it the idea here would be that this additional module sets up a disruptive energy wave that affects any cloaked vessel within a certain distance of it i would say 12 au at most combined with combat scanner probes operated with precision nearly any cloaked vessel could be scanned down provided it was in that 12 au area while the combat scanners ran a high intensity scan there basically the module would up nearby cloaked vessels signature radius from zero without decloaking themanother iteration on this idea is to make that module the same one that will disrupt cloaks on grid operating the module would restrict movement or other action similar to a cyno or cloak and may require fuel depending on how its implemented cycle times would be short allowing the vessel to change position and actively search for cloaked vessels along with its fleetill support anything well thought out and well balanced no matter what your cycle time nothing short of a supernova is going to disrupt any cloaking device within 100 au
honestly this simplest solution to the afk cloak problem if it really is one is to build probes that can find cloaked ships have it take 15 minutes for them to perform a scan or some similarly ludicrous valueany active covops pilot can clearly see them on directional and simply has to warp to a different location safespot every now and again my god the cloaker has to watch directional now the horrorwhether or not this is necessary or even desired is up for debate however
i think the problem with this solution is it makes it so any noncov ops vessel including black ops is now 100 detectable and all you have to do is sit and wait for the cycle to end
afk cloakers dont harm anyone apart from botters who cant get their program to function as theyd likeonly time an afk cloaker will ever harm you is when that same afk cloaker isnt afk
because uncloaking for 10 seconds to warp from one safespot to another is just too dangerous right moving on
that would make it impossible to detect afk cloakers which is the whole point why not scan probes can scan the whole system and creating a new type of probe would be fine this idea just makes finding cloakers bore expensive and dangerousi proposed 10 minutes just like a cyno not 30 minutes what does how much im concerned with their combat potential have to do with eliminating afk cloaking it doesnt matter what ship their in if they are afk for 23 hours in a red system they should be killable why is there something unbalanced about announcing in system that youre looking for cloaked ships and if the cloaked ship doesnt warp between safes or recloak they will then be detectable is there a situation where this will actually impede normal behaviour of active cloakersagain why this strange restriction i honestly dont understand what your definition of realism is that scanning probes jump bridges ihub detection arrays and the new ship scanner that detects anomolies system wide can pass as realistic but this idea fails
i actually like this idea better than many of the others suggested
pathetic would be the so called hardcore players of null running and hiding when a neut enters system
there are countless mentions of the solution to this is to remove localalthough this is a valid solution to this i do not believe it is the samethats the equivalent of fixing the problem that you have a enemy nuclear submarine lurking in your waters by ripping out your sonar system you still have the submarine there but it doesnt bother you anymore until he decides to launch his missiles at you there still exists the play balance issue that nobody in the game is able to find the sub everso it basically boils down to a simple question to the devs did they intend to make cloaking a perfect 100 safe way of lurking into enemy territory or did they mean it for them to be possibly detectable but maybe through difficult means before you jump to the conclusion that if it is the former then we should all just support the removal of cloakers from local ask yourself the follow on questions that it raises if you just remove the cloakers from localwhat happens if the cloaker just posts on local in order to achieve the same effectif you remove local chat altogethereasier said than done im sure local chat is used far more for beginners to find others playing in the same system to chat its too big a part of the community glue in eve to be removed just because in this one small circumstance it is being abusedi dont think removal of local is a viable alternative
did they ban your traq mardon account i mean you keep throwing these submarine things up with all your alts and its giving you away
funny but no hey and i was the one to use the submarine reference first edit to preemp any unnecessary back and forth it was hereuboats
being a carebare i can confirm that it became harder to make money in null after latest patches especially when you cant undock because of afk cloakers when you have to run havens on a drake when you dont have enough time to warp out in case of a hotdrop and so on the idea is that to be a cloaker in a null system is too easy you know you can kill an afk cloaker only if you know exectly where he is it s that carebears can do nothing to protect theirselves from spies and potential hotdropers and cloakers can open cynofield anytime they need thats not fare  such measures wont change life of cloakers in general but will give carebares an opportunity to do something to protect theirselves
while they are docked uphiding they make no isk
hey thats a thought afk cloaking can be used to battle bottersput one afk cloaker in every system used by bots no more bottingmight not even need to involve using a bot to run the cloak just many clients and accounts
actually ejecting does work to save yourself bodyimplants if you wait for ship to blow up it makes a lag or othr delay for enemy to lock and scram you and pods can normally instawarpeject and in less then a second latter can insta warp outbut having a eject do a catapult would save you from bubbles currently bubbles are the big bane of pods
sometimes its almost as if people dont realize that ccp wants them to get popped and podded
this change was short sighted in removing a valuable information tool that was rarely if ever abused to stalk players and claims of db calls could have been more elegantly addressed a simple expandable tab could have been implemented to only show standings when opened and thus the db call only happens when specifically selected this could have further been streamlined to have various corps given their own tab to expand so that youd see only the agents standings with specific corporations instead of them all at the top then all the agents at the bottom without standings we lose one of the few reputation aspects pilots have in their claims of who they are and what theyve doneone thing that comes to mind is to know whether alleged new pilots begging for isk or asking for help have done the tutorials barring the ability to check their record and see if theyve done the tutorial missions or any mission for anyone they are all cast in doubt further new players asking for help as to where their home system is now go from being able to check their initial tutorial agents location to the much longer explanation of how they can find that barring having assets at that place the short answer of todaki now becomes check your assets open your character sheet check standings find your agents etc and so on simply put ccp didnt think this through and once again removed information and reduced eve because they were trying to optimize things noble effort ham fisted implementation if attempts were made for elegance without sacrificing information this would not be an issue
corp standings are necessary for standing grinders who must monitor their clients standings that they are grinding unlike faction standings for rpfw purposes lack of corp standings for standing grinders is professionkilling not just taking away a bit of fun or convenience
supported
thats a good point but im also talking about getting decloaked while trying to dodge stuff in space when youre actively trying to get a warp in on someonei was thinking more like a flash of light that isnt only noticeable at close range something abrupt and attention grabbing you know how you can see a torp hitting something even when zoomed out something like that though obviously different this would also have the tactical benefit of the guy you are hunting becoming aware of your screwup although he also has the overviewand on the point of the current effectsaudio they just arent good enough at notifying you your ship slowly fade in as does the audio and both after a short delayupon further reflection i would rank audio and visual about equal im just wanting something that tells you that you have been decloaked and nothing subtle or unnoticeable like the current effects
hell no pay attention if you are afk cloakingnot supported
this set of changes has several negative effects especially for people who enter large numbers of rd jobs1 more clicks are now needed to enter each job the accept quote window was previously modal when it didnt strictly need to be modal but now it doesnt even gain focus when it pops up previouslywindow openspress enternowwindow opensclick somewhere on the window to gain focustabenteror ctrl  tabn  ctrl  shift  tabn which isnt much better23 if you click on the accept quote window ie not on any of the buttons to gain focus and then hit enter the window closes and the installing job message pops up the installing job screen then hangs indefinitely and has to be closed manually via esc also its modal so you cant do anything else until youve closed it the job still installs ok when this happens but its very buggy behavioursuggested fixesmake the accept quote window gain focus when it pops uphave the accept quote button selected by defaultrevert the behaviour of the cancel quote button to how it previously worked ie returning the user to the previous windowdare to dream  perhaps those 2 windows should be combined into one
supporting my own proposal
its almost like this entire interface is sadistic and terrible and has been that way for years
the industry interface was already bad this patch managed to make it worsesupporting kazuos proposal for our collective sanityand what about a real industry ui revamp in a future patch
we cant even change numbers before going back to the begining now 
please fix this thing that was not tested by ccp because they dont play the game or apparently test it properly

thanks guysthese issues have been fixed internally and will be deployed in a later patch
thank you for clarifying is this something that can be done as an optional client patch or will it have to wait for a larger one
i cant promise when exactly this will go out but soon not tm 
i wasnt suggesting piracy itself should be somehow made to be more profitable rather more along the lines that lowsec should actually be given a viable source of income of its own as it is the only viable income sources in lowsec are l4 and l5 missions and the lp which is the main benefit of these missions essentially requires direct trade to and from highsec lowsec has little income of its own in this respect rather then trying to discourage pirates from doing what is essentially the only way they can obtain income provide a different way personally i dont think its an issue in the first place but really an average pirate has no option but to make their income somewhere else which is probally highsec
name one such loopholeu already named lvl 4s and 5s as a viable source of low sec income yet u say pirates have no option but to go to high sec why because as it is now ure too lazy to trade the lp items to an alt
i think we are coming close to agreement here now we both want both pirates and civilians to move to low sec as low sec is better for pirates because no concord and less sec penalty etc etc so that doing piraty things is easierbut you say low sec has lower income so does that mean you think that all we need to do is to increase the income of l4 and l5 missions sure but once again i illustrate to you the problem of taking this approach im a missioner or a miner what do a care if the missions give me more isk if i have to worry that everyone showing up in local is a potential threat basically everyone notblue needs to be treated as a red and we all know reading the other afk cloaking threads that one red is enough to scare off the herds back to highsecthe only way that i see this can ever change is you need a better trust system in the game starting by making people trust sec status as a reflection of your play style good guy or bad guyyou argue that adding these laws will i dont think it has been shown anywhere that without charitable donations pirates will starve of isk perhaps they should just do more piraty stuff like shoot up people in 05 systems or have them hold people for ransom shameless plug for my ferrying of passengers proposal or fix the bounty and mercenary system like the csms proposed back in 2008 here funny enough after reading this i was suprised how much my hauling idea was similaranyway just throwing more isk into low sec missionsrats is going to just have the effect of making it more like null sec without all the game mechanic defenses you can put in nullsec it will go something like thismake missions pay moreput better ore ignoring for now the negative economic effects that has on the value of 00 spacemissioners go therepirates follow them using good alts tag along in there miningrattingpirates jump into bad alt gategank them send money to good altrepeatlowsec will be empty again in a week unless you ratmine with defense fleet in which case why arent you in 00 sec insteadlow sec needs to be the home of pirates where they can make a fairly decent living doing piraty things for that to happen ratters and indies need to go there first because they also need to be able to make a steady better living than in highsec though with a little more risk both need to happen for the ratters the problem in trust current sec status system is insufficient fix it and they will come
this game is more or less a game of goodies vs baddies the baddies have to have bad things to do so that the game can be played as intended
i think i speak for both sides of every argument thats ever been had or will be had when i say  stop helping
i personaly dont like that capital ships exist in game at all though they are sometimes good things to have  like carriers for example when it comes down to move on an campain in hostile territorybut back to the topic i personaly think that it is not so bad that this ships so powerfull the problem is the amount of the ships is manufactured and piloted also the bigest problem accure when that amount of ships is fieldet in one system vs the enemyif there anything must be done towards the supers then not the chage ship it self but restrict for example1 amount of scs titans can be ownedpiloted by alliance at same time2 amount of scs  titans fieldet by alliance at the same time in particular systemchanging this  with carefuly matter will result that lots of whines will desapere
super caps lol
my eyes its like a massive spaceship just hit them
china called they want their wall back
thiscapital ships are a damned blight get rid of them all and bring fleets back down to bs and below we dont need massive ships sitting around spamming dd and drone ships make eve all about the ship to ship combat again
i was thinking we could have some minor improvements to the contract format which will make it easier for both parties in the contracting processfirstly i was hoping that ccp could allow us to put names on our contracts so when im putting up a contract up for t2 ratting drake or fleet maelstrom or just random firesale stuff instead of the default multiple items this should make it easier for people to find contracts theyre looking for at a glance instead of having to open up each contract manually and checking the contentsfurthermore when contracting a fully fitted ship could we have the contracts display the mods by highmedlow slow instead of the jumbled mess it is nowthese shouldnt be hard to implement and wont change the gameplay much just make it easier for the players to get things done
youve seen that road off i15 too eh
yup its the only real road in the middle of the desert so its pretty memorable
i guess u didnt see the new big time graphical forums yet that failed in a few days and are being optimized
suck it up and cry bears
right now its only possible to cloak in a single system i propose a new module that when activated in a system keeps you showing up in local for 23 hours this could have say a 10 delay before it can be activated again so you cant appear in too many localsthis way rattingsanctum botters will give up more tears

thank you for my daily smile
only if by adding to the order it would go to the back of the queue then fine
hey i suggested that
day 3  girls play eve
i assume youre the only one posting these since the others are getting faced drunk at every opportunity
im curious as to why eve is like golfid suggest that its because golf is a boring expensive waste of time but that would just be impolite
youll have to wait until the minutes to get the context of that statement it was just a teaseras for the alcohol situation while it was true that some alcohol was consumed and a significant amount on friday night after the summit closed it did not seem to have a noticeable effect  all the drinking csms are twofisted internet hardmen who would not let a little thing like a hangover prevent them from important task of destroying eve
publication date on minutes or best guess
so they interrupted a discussion about feature abandonment to show off another feature theyll soon abandon
its nice to hear something and your effort is appreciated trebor but those blog posts sure dont have much meat on the bones it will be interesting to see whether the minutes are more robust both in content and passion from the csm6 on topics that have been so high profile lately i hope were not simply given more of the same stuff we did descriptions with a big red nda stamp on any details that would be worth having a useful dialog about in the community
i realize that this is serious nda business and you cant give any details but ill go ahead andask anyway im one of like five people who is genuinely excited about dust 514 all i want to know without going into any detail is thiswill the link between eve and dust as discussed at the summit be in your opinion stupid or awesome
well thats encouraging i suppose
my concern as well as an old fps junkie both computer and console my interest in dust is centered on the link between it and the rest of new eden if its cool interesting and meaningful then dust will be likewise to me if not a cash grab and waste of potential resources ive learned to be cynical of the promises hinted at in ccps highlypolished videos such as future vision so to me theyve told us practically nothing concrete since its announcement in 09i dont know if any of the csm have experience with modern fpses i dont recall you ever mentioning you were trebor any insight would be appreciated regardless
when you typed not  talked about as much i assume you meant part of almost every economics related topic discussed the past few yearsthe keys are like almost right next to each other so its an easy typo to make
black ops needmore hp or better resists i prefere better resists cos it t2 and not t1 shipsneed more fuel bay around 34000m3 usually if you jump or portal 23 ships you dont have fuel on jump back all black ops need 3 rig slotsall black ops need 6 ly jump rangeall black ops need more cpu on 150 minimum and widow more powergrid to fit torpedos and energy neuts or smartbombs sin need new bonuses cos now its useless ship sin is not logistic not neutro ship not dps ship  something useles and expensive gallente trashpanther  need one more turret slot t3 covert ships need to be able to use covert cyno all black ops shouls have some or ship maintaince bay for recon ships so you can put few bombers or 2 recons or t3 ship in it or you can add abillity to use fitting service for black ops
no they dont agreedlol wtf are you on about no t2 ship gets 3 rigscba to do the math right now but yes bops do need a range buff i would say 20 on what they currently have no they dont current fittings are fine you just need to be smartsins bonuss are fine the issue is a more generic hybrid fix however ive run in several fleets where sin is used as the utility bops portal neuts rr etclol nohavent made up my mind on this yet sooo maybe no no no nohave you actually flown bopsblack ops are not meant to have huge dps or huge ehp they are not brawlers if you want a brawler go by a tier 12 bsissue with bops is that their range and fuel bay limits their primary function of moving and supporting recon fleets they need a slight range buff and a massive fuel bay buff that is all
oh sarinasome people might want to use them for more than portaling around other people not everyone has multiple accounts i am not saying make them a better than t2 bs i am saying give them a cov op cloak and a buff to either gank or tank and some need fitting help the bonuses you speak of are helpful and needed but not all that is neededok tell us all about how your the only one that knows what bops need again
bops are slightly underpowered but this is a classic case of people demanding far too much there are lots of things you can do to make them better but that doesnt mean you need to implement all of themplaying around with simple fits i am getting figures like 1050 dps and 92k ehp from redeemer 875dps and 93k ehp from the sin still suffers from hybrids 1222 dps  78k ehp from the widow and 1046dps  65k ehp from the panther bearing in mind that these are not brawling ships i would say they are doing ok actuallythe main limiting factor in bops fleets is fuel the first issue weve hit in every bops fleet ive been in is running out of fuel to portal a recon fleet to any decent rangesecond main limiting factor is jump range the tiny jump range drastically restricts tactical game play when it comes to hiding your fleet and making use of all the nooks and crannies in eves real star mapthe ships themselves are fine they just need a buff in their primary function and jesus covops cloak would seriously break bops in terms of lowsec balence
well all we need to do is paint you green and give you a few warts here and there youd be perfective used hams just not in pvp i wasnt impressed sig bloom a ship and youll get consistent dps else theyre basically just a 400 dps at best short range missile good against bc and higher for improved dps i found hmls more consistent better ranged and effective at all levels which is why i use them hams were nerfed some time ago and theyve been broken ever since whether you admit it or notusing max or near max skill to determine that something is effective and working properly is just stupid skills take time to train and not everybody has them that high try using something besides missiles and maybe youll discover their weaknessshove your 1337 bs and take a step back from the podium this thread isnt even valid anymore
its actually the only way to compare things
fon youre partially correct the other way is experience if something doesnt perform well compared to something else then it is obviously in need of improvement thats my opinion anywayjust for reference i dps graphed hmls and hams with equival
dunno what we are actually arguing with but hams are pretty pointless in most common pvp anyway since weve got those very convenient heavies does losing like 80 of the range to gain 10 dps sound appealing in any way in this case id say no though it might be a bit different for cruise missiles huge range of which is just useless while the dps is pathetic and no torps are not hams hams still feel like heavies while torps and cruise missiles are something entirely differentwhat im saying is that judging by experience based on subpar skills is pretty pointless too i wouldnt say that hams are broken thats just hml drake being that good rather than anything else really well maybe a little tweaks here and there are indeed needed but those are not as crucial as fixing the damned drake is
time for me to get flamed in herei fly mostly caldari and up to hacs for gallente i have great missilegunnery skills i am one of the few people that really like my blaster boats and this may have something to do with the ones i fly i fly the harpy and moa and tend to get ignored over other ships in my fleet as people dont seem to find me a threatthe issue with blasters is range and tracking right if hybrid platforms receives a bonus to webber range then much of this would be negated it seems with a bonus to webber range you would be able to close in quicker before you take too much damage on the burn inthis wouldnt result in hybrid platforms being used as interceptors as webbing an opponent allows them to align faster meaning less time to point and if you were in point range in the first place then you would have pointed them then webbed them anywayt2 webber is 60 speed a scrambler which blaster boats would use as they work inside this range will shut off mwd this should bring some balance yes
i wanted to add that for tracking you can attempt to minimize radial by not just clicking orbit and a missclick wont necc result in unwebbed opponents due to the bonus
while admirable in intent your effort to strip out the effects of painters etc does not reflect reality the fact is that hams are a closerange weapon system designed to be used inside tackle range and you need a web to keep your target tackled so hams are almost always used with web support the web makes hams apply full damage  more than hms  to virtually all nonabing cruisersthis is an example of the dangers of take eft numbers at face value without understanding their application ingametheres basically nothing wrong with hams or the ham drake it compares very favourably with its closerange counterparts of armourcane armourharb and armourmyrm its just that people dont really fly those armoured bcs any more
im aware of their application in game and i believe i already pointed out that a single ship cannot fit everything web point and painter on a drake doesnt leave much for shields even just web and point doesnt if you werent crowd tanking youd recognize the flaw in that not that a fully tanked drake can survive solo anywaythats for a drake which has a decent number of mids and doesnt cover all the ships that have to sacrifice shields almost entirely just to fit a single pointit reflects reality just not taking into account random variables that increase exponentially as you add more ships to the equation rightyou must take some time to learn scientific principle one of these days
fly a brutix and youll find the threat they percieve is much greater you may even get primaried the reasons you dont youre flying caldari and you have to sacrifice shields to fit point scram and web this means youre either an easy take down or easy to get away from
if you fly some brutix and you are primary its not because youre a threat but an easy kill mail every one want to add to his collection let me fix it 4u youre flying caldari and you dont have to sacrifice shields to fit point scram and web this means youre shooting everything on your overview without many drawbacks like distance transversal or for your target easy to get away from you
then you have no say here hams are a pvp weapon and i actually have used them as suchwrong wrong and wrong again with faction ammo i deal full damage to a properly tackled cruiser and with rage full damage to a battlecruiser working as intendednope its standard but hey its not my fault your missile skill suckits perfectly valid youre just wrong and have no clue what youre talking aboutthis would be horribly overpowered seriously can you imagine every t1 blasterboat running round with web bonuses thered be no point flying anything elsei have scram and web on my drake this is all i need to hit for full dps and oh look i still have 80k ehpso lets add the drake to the number of things you dont have a clue about judging by your utter ignorance of everything missilerelated scientific principle isnt doing you much good right now i can examine figures just as well as you but the difference is i can apply them to realityumm no you get primaried because the brutix is a glass cannon wheras the drake is significantly tougher their applied dps will often turn out to be pretty similarnow just for fun things mars theran likes to make points on but actually knows nothing about  the drake missiles the basics  hams  cruises skill comparisons brutixes primary calling basically anything outside his cute little carebear bubble 
youve stated that you have no experience with hams in pvp so no you are not aware of their application in game you do not fit a painter on a ham drake mwd web and point leaves three medslots free enough for 83k ehp have you fallen through a wormhole from 2007im a scientist im always learning
why it worked just fine for 5 yearslooking forward to seeing how this bigger picture on balance works out assuming csm can nudge ccp to make it happen
when exactly did blasterboats have web range bonuses that was what he was suggesting and i stand by my point that thoraxes running round with 20km webs is not a good thing
ah i misread that as web strength nvm
you homos still ing about the drake and heavy misslessimple fixreduce heavy misslecruise flight time and intoroduce a mod like tracking comps and te but for missles lets call it accelerated launcher system or als it increases the velocity of missles and explosion velocity have scripts for the mid slot version and you have now fixed the drakethanks you 
flying a ship with all gank and no tank is asking to get primaried thats just how it works you can tank a brutix and take a 300 dps hit ull still be hitting 600s
wow calm down anyway your idea is ridiculous if there was actually a need to nerf hml drakes doubtful really its accomplished much easier by slashing max lock range there same result without pointless missile nerfs
i think part of the discussion on this thread that has been missing is price i think that is a key factor to add to the equation when talking about ship balancing the whole call to arms to nerf the dram seems overblown that ship has not ruined the game and made all other frigs obsolete its still a frig and with proper tactics in a fleet we regularly get one shot alphas on them much to their surprise and its 100m isk when you lose one i dont fly one but if a player wants to spend that kind of isk on a frig then power to him it comes with great performance well earned for the price if you nerf it then you better nerf the price too i say leave it alone and fight smarter and watch them cry to a well coordinated attack to me this game is about fleet and cooperative play and can overcome any solo ship even the very scary drami think that if players want to spend the isk on a shiny then great it should come with a corresponding increase in performance because it cost a bunch and that risk should be rewardedthis leads me to my second point to reinforce the gallente ship dilemma if the overall concept of the gallente ship is a close in fighter then that comes with a host of issues that have been discussed 1it must get close and that requires a means to do so however it is an armor tanked platform normally so difficult to accomplish this more armor means lower speed rigs and less agility i love the idea of up close and personal face melting but you cant get there fast ships just kite even a good coordinated fleet action where a scout gets you a close warp in the targets move out of range before lock all too often or even if locked can burn away even with webscram on them worst of all for gallente is that you must commit in the fight since your a close in fighter this means high risk of being primary tackled and getting popped this makes the costrisk ratio on these ships poor much more cost effective to fly a hurricane or a drake and stay at some range and you have the speed to gtfo when its time so yes gallente aka spanish armada needs a hard look and their corresponding weapons but also price reduce the mineral requirements or something to make gallente ships much less expensive and i think youll see use go way up if you want a whole race dedicated to close in killing that risk has to be balanced with a lower cost relative to other platforms due to the much higher risk of being killed
if you understood the suggestion you would know that its not a ham nerf but a hamtorp boosthaving a low slot mod that increases the expolsion velosity and velosity of missles is a good thingreducing the range of heavy misslescruise whilist giving them a mid or low slot to increase thier rangeexplosion velosity is a good thingi would much rather have an overall missle boost while still having a heavy drake nerf if you just reduce targeting range on the drake then you still need to boost other missle shipsimagine a torp raven that has a mid slot to increase explosion velocity now that 1200 dps can actaully do some damagemaking the cerb bonus mean something is a good thing
maybe we could call this strange new medslot item a target painter
owned
really there is a target painter for low slotsthe tp increases missle velosity nowcrazy
if 00 space is about empire building why not give the people who have sov on a system the ability to deploy some form of field defenses like being able to set up defensive structures near fields gates and outposts im not talking gate guns like the high sec ones but lets give these people the ability to actually try to secure a systemalso on a side note i think that hacking should get some love in null sec like being able to hack a pos module and force it to go offline or being able to hack other ships and potentially cause a random module on the target ship to go offlinemake a covert hacking module so black ops ships can sneak up and do things like disable jump bridges and cut off supply lines in terms of farms and fields how about thisa structure that allows some form of automated mining from a pos i know that sounds like a bad idea but let me give an exampleyou create a new structure remote mining drone array you also create a new type of mining drone think the mining drone equivalent of a fighterbomber and a new type of probe that can be fired from the probe launcher mining beacon probeso you anchor and online the remote array and fill it with these drones you then send one of your ships out to tag an asteroid with one of the mining beacon probes at that point your remote array can detect the beacons belonging to the same corp or alliance and someone with access can give the pos the command to send the mining drones to harvest that asteroid small gangs looking to interfere could begin targeting these drones while they are in the field harvesting rock
here here to develop the market you need more haulers more traders and an exchange there are so many things we need to improve in this interconnected weave of institutions for the economy to work 1 a trustworthy credit rating agency 2 a functioning banking system 3 a functioning bounty system which would create more mercs and escorts as professions and allow haulers to contract escorts for guard duty 4 a futures exchange market all commodity markets depend on it for connecting producers and suppliers and most of all 5 a system for tracking reputation that isnt as flawed as the current sec status one so that people can know who they can trust of course this does not preclude deceit
part of this is an issue of peoplethey say its not profitable to do production in 00 because there is not enough minerals out there to feed the demandin reality its that there are not enough miners out in low sec think about it this wayif you counted up all of the ore available for mining in every system in eve i am willing to bet that only 50 or less is actually in high sec empire space but 90 or more of the miners are in high secso if you really want to get things going these alliances need to recruit and protect large dedicated mining teams to work their fieldsit would be nice if they could be able to place some defensive structures out in the fields to help protect the miners if you actually had people defending the miners there would be no issue of not enough minerals available locally
you missed the part about mining being the single most boring facet of eve so boring in fact that even legitimate miners have dabbled with botting and hugely inefficient afk mining using haulersit is like saying that people in siberia need not freeze during winter because there are loads of trees all over the place
not good enoughpls fix
i did have a question about this in the devs answer any questions thread i will post a link to the answer if and when we get onemeantime keep supporting 
why are we still talking about this should have all been implemented already
gallente the battleship tiers is non sense the price tagbill of materials has nothing reasonable imhoyou have the noob bs that becomes nasty stuff in the hands of some troglodyte full lvl5 skills yes a few centurys of game for thosethe two gun bss lack of pgcpucap rechargeslots with price tags difference of 100 skill intensive for both but only one is worthy and gives you for your isk in most situations until you fly with minie counterpart and decide to cross train asap but its another thread storyhonestly whats the purpose of tiers system if the only stuff different is the build cost shouldnt the tiers system define specific roles related to lvl skills
save the t1 cruiser line upthings like the t1 logisewar ships like the bellicose and celestisthe omen and stabberthe thorax moa mallerpoor fitting slot layout bonuses have plauged these ships teir 2 battlecruisers are a similar price and can handle almost any role better like the t1 logis there role isnt even managed well do to poor fittingcapbonusesships like the punisher maller and prophecy have a laser bonus so bad most people cram capless autocannons on at least they gave the abaddon a dmg bonus along with the armor resist the moa and ferox that both have less range and dmg then a good drakesome serious role redefine and balance changes would be niceno more useless ships
this is important as now we cant even see what factions other factions like this screws n00bs up that dont already have this info memorized

bring back npc corp and faction standings display for everyone
first time i find it usefull to post something
more grav sites and smaller existing belts are the best solution ive heard in a long timenow if only we can put an end to the endless ice fieldsor just let the macros congregate there and let hulkageddon take care of them
well this sure got dug up do any of the csm care to say anything about this being a viable discussion with ccp
i think its a good idea even if only to have another commodity to fill up your cargo hold and haul from point a to point byears ago on my mac i played an evelike space game where you could make money as a hauler one of the things offered in every station was passengers that wanted to get from point a to point b as a way of filling out your cargo hold it made hauling a lot more interesting profitable and fun often you would plan and arrange your routes and waypoints based on where the passengers wanted to go the advantage that hauling passengers had over hauling cargo was that passengers was a guaranteed steady income whereas you could lose money hauling commodities in eve these would be interbus cargo missions your passengers would be the livestock in the market in eve tourists homeless etc generally the npc passengers would want to go from trade hub to trade hub but a few of them might want to stop off at some mission hubs too there is lots of opportunity here for ccp to add some storyline missions and background such as tourists come to yalebap v to listen to the warbling of the air whales that float in the hydrogen clouds of this gaseous planet a great way for new players haulers to travel around eve learn about the background story of eve make more money and have fun of course you can also run passenger missions for the factions as well such as ferrying slaves for carthum conglomerate freed slaves for boundless creations etc in that case there should be a standings loss so a neutral amarr hauler in an npc corp that hauls slaves in amarr space will eventually find she cant get passenger missions in the other three empires you might lose standings with interbus too in the game i played jettisoning a cargo hold full of passengers was the fastest way to get a negative security standing this was desirable in some ways since only pirates could access pirate stations in lowsec space as for hauling actual players im not as sure about the usefulness of this since everyone can fly at least a shuttle i suppose it might be useful to contract out one of your jump clones to a hauler and have them take it to another station along with all your goods this might be convenient if someone has to move themselves and all their goods from a to b when they are offline it might also be a way to get yourself and your goods into nullsec this seems like it might be eliminating the danger risk of flying there yourself but freighters and haulers can still be scanned and ganked etc so on the one hand you can transport all your corps resources and players to a new system station at once this saves an awful lot of game time for some on the other hand your corp could lose all of their players jump clones and ships mods etc if that hauler gets ganked pirates can now ransom each and every jump clone for as much as they would a podthe pirates might even be able to scan what implants those jump clones have
thanks for the supporti like this feature because not only does it benefit haulers it benefits pirates as well as they seem to have a hard time making a living without resorting to their goodguy alts and it seems in line with the proposed bounty system fixes which will buff out the mercenary professions and as you mention has many cool storytelling possibilities as well especially with integration with dust514 i hope the csms give this more than the cursory once over
you must have tea and cake with the vicar or you die eddie izzard dressed to kill
1 this is has nothing to do with making mistakes but getting rid off completely useless skillpoints one of the best examples wich was contineusly discussed at forum is mining and all related skills to it2once your chare gets older it is true that t1 hull ships become useless to you though skill requrment like frigatcruiser for t2t3 hulls will be not useless at all so good sp investment3 afraid that your shiny shipguns will be nerfedchaged next patch do what i did and cross train weaponsships skills im not limited now to any gun or ship4 there is still skills that uterly useless now and never will be used anymore lot of chages by playerbase botsmacro and ccp easy acseseble stuuf for new players made those skills waste of time
i dont get it yes it was wasted time but why do you think you are entitled to get it back people do all sorts of mistakes in this game its part of living and learningonce per lifetime is completely arbitrary and silly it will cause more problems than it aims to solveand i dont see any problem with people getting stuck with their own poor choices in skills to invest in would we want to give refunds to people who accidentally buy skillbooks of skills they already have trained im sure that happens a lot too
no sp remaps yep i have skills ill never use and no i dont agree with remaps why because everyone makes mistakes that is life and lifes challenges if you dont have to live with your mistakes then what is the point of trying harder but anyway its a no from me
haha i like the idea of trading in isk  corpses for the very legal and popular drink would add a need to pvp or make a trial account and pod it 
not sure how much i like this one since it would really only screw over those using cloaks to break gate camps and they already have a weakness being seen on overview for enough time to try and decloak them with a nice bump
i like the probe idea nothing should uncloak a cloaked ship it should be just that they become scannable with sufficient combat probe skills
if a cloaker enters a system and appears in local systemwide and lets say it takes 4 hours before he comes back to his computer the carebear has 4 hours to see and react to this signal if he doesnt i think its safe to assume hes either botting or not paying attention in either case hes game to die as it should be in 00
yes because your enemies should have to react and remain reacting for 4 hours 24 hours weeks and months while the cloaker shouldnt have to react to any threat at all god forbid an ounce of a threat should be presented to you  that would just be too harsh and cruel for you in 00
i support the cloak disruption generator with the 10minute timer as originally proposedim not so sure about probes being able to find cloaked ships granted any competent cloaker should be in motion anyway but with the recent probe interface changes its become really fast to find targets using probes even a cloaker who is at the keyboard most of the time might need to go afk for a few minutes to go to the bathroom for example
the probe idea is bad if you want a new game mechanic to gank people why dont you just say soall youre doing is suggesting ways that make it so you can solo or small gang gank cloakers cov ops or otherwise now youve got a suggested mechanic that means that no cloaked vessel will be able to travel through null or low security space except through gatetogate means and continuously warping around a system which increases their chance of getting caughtthey will no longer have time to pause assess system choke points figure out how to get past a camp safely or anything else for noncov ops ships this means that they are effectively sitting ducks just like any noncloaked ships youve removed any functionality on black ops entirely and made noncov ops cloaks completely uselessif you really dont see it then take a noncov ops cloaker through a dozen occupied systems in null or go smack talk some pirates in lowsec and see how long you can avoid them418491116101718882050375000000 km3 the approximate volume of our solar system if ive got that rightnow imagine finding a small asteroid that just happens to be invisible somewhere out there or try to imagine how much power it would require to flood that area with disruptive energyradiation using the dispersion principleanomalies are collections of various objects some quite large that are potentially emitting varying degrees of energy and radiation or simply have large masses wiuthin them like gravimetric sites this is why they can be scanned down scanner probes that could lock on to a cov ops vessel would have to be much better than combat probes how hard is it to scan down a frigate mask any sensor and heat signatures disrupt light around it and effectively nullify any electromagnetic signatures on it then move it slightly out of phase with normal matter and youve got a cloaked vesselif you cant detect it with ship sensors or the naked eye from 3 km how do you expect to detect it out there on grid is the only thing that makes sense or the cooperative use of modules and specialized scan probes to detect them too much work tough its balanced and doesnt completely wipe out the usefulness of covert ops
i like the idea howeverhow can you define an active cloacker impossible to know whos behind his computer and whos afk yousomeones idea about fuel requirements for cloaking devices was a pretty good idea coupled with some fuel bay
the only people afk cloakers hurt is bottersno way i will ever support anything that helps botters out and this proposal does nothing but help botters
false statementcoming from someone of nc you should know since long time cloaked stuff maybe hot drop maybe intell maybe a lot of stuff and at the bottom of all them botsunless you have too many in your systems but then you dont need new stuff you need to better choose your corpalliance members
well if the cloaker is gathering intel on you or getting ready to hot drop you they are not afk are they
supporting the idea not the implementation
they should just disable local in jita we dont need a chat channel there
with the agent changes one of the intent of ccp clearly stated in their dev b was to allow people to live where they wantwell dear ccp you just kicked me from where i wanted to live and you are forcing me where i do not want to goyes im talking about the agent inesmir jimud from sisters of eve she was a security agent and she was changed to distribution with no reasonthe nearest security agent from soe is 20 jumps away not a big deal but its 6 jumps from jita oooh surpriseso explain why you are moving this kind of agent near caldari space where there are the majority of agents already where there is the majority of traffic already you want to spread people out you say well it looks exactly the opposite you are forcing people to move closer and closer to jita and already crowded places i want to stay far away from jita but you removed from the game the only agent i likedtell me whypsno this is not cross posting i want to bring attention to both ccp and csm and id like to read an answer an explanation
cry morewhy not try one of the low or null sec soe agents 
first of all im not crying usually when i cry im more like boohooo  sigh sigh  sob sob  omg how can i live anymorepbut i never cry anyway pim just a bit upset becouse ccp wrote that they want people to live where they want well i wanted to live in gicodel and they are kicking me outif the dev blog was like hey we are kicking you out from your bases becouse this is what please us that would have been more fair
seems odd to the point of maybe someone made a mistake to take an agent in the security division and place them in the distribution division
divisions like public relations that give 23 combat missions should be placed in security branch because its majority combat not sure why this isnt the case in any case im going to go ahead and set up a courier bot in gicodel to farm soe lp afk it should be profitable now that its all courier missions just adapt to the changes
bump i want an official answer
no i was busy having a life but the there do seem to be a few people who were adamantly attacking me for making suggestions that they didnt like that dont seem to be posting anymore if they were banned or warned then im glad ccp is actively trying to combat players stopping other players from expressing their thoughts the point of this forum is for the players to be able to tell ccp what they think is wrong with the game and discuss possible solution sadly it has turned into a forum for a hand full of sad and lonely people to attack others whos opinions dont match their own hence the near complete lack of player participation and constructive criticism
to be fair i think that you may have rubbed a lot of people the wrong way initially myself included because you posted 7 threads when you could have posted 1 and had an argument based on the terms of service of the game which unfortunately set the lawyer hounds of hell onto you
ive never once attacked you but i have pointed out the reasons why your ideas are badive had neither a ban or a warning because i have been constructive the trouble is you have to be factual with your ideas and responses you also have to have an understanding of game mechanics and the consequences of any changes you may suggest so far youve done neitherthen may i suggest you stop doing itthe trouble is being constructive means understanding what the issue is and you dont do either if you had a solid argument you would be able to back it upedit the fact that youve sidesteppedavoided answering the question ive asked repeatedly in one of the many other threads youve made speaks volumes
move all profitable mining into lowsecwh then it wont be boring pirates will take care of bots if you care about that frankly i dont care i just want to pvp so im glad they flood the market with cheap stuff in fact i dont know why anyone cares what other people do in this game isnt that the point of a sandbox but if you want to mine and be excited then mine where every second someone might decend upon you and pop you but please dont get rid of roid belts i enjoy pvp and so many fights seem to happen at the belts plus there are times when a trip to null sec ratting is key to get sec status up without too much effort
by now neither ccp greyscale nor anybody else from ccp did give any feedback how that 00nerf did work outi can tell you for sure it has lead to a vast devastation of 00 dozens if not hundreds of renter corporations have just left 00 hundreds of systems are just outright empty nowthe reason is clear postdominioncosts for most with predominionincome so most 00systems will be even more devastated than ever beforeccp clearly violated the sandbox here as they didnt buffer the investments of the small corporations who fell victim to this changeit is my opinion that ccp greyscale willingly publicly gave false reasons why the implemented that nerf so he and thus ccp was willingly and outright lying at their customersplayerbase the only alternative explanation i see would be that ccp greyscale is outright extremely stupid and does have no plan how eve worksso i do support ccp finally gives a public statement why they implemented the 00nerf this time the real reason without any stupid lies lied to their playerbase did not reimburse corporations and alliances who shortly before the nerf have heavily invested in 00 infrastructure and just got betrayed by ccp as they never had any chance to even amortize those investitions think they could get those players they ed off the game by this nerf back with a buddy program thought they would not  off 00playerscustomers en masse when they outright rpe them off their investitions 00 as it is now no place for small alliances anymore except for prominers no decent income anymore for players as good truesec systems are occupied by afkcloakcynos and thus unusable the others are generally unusable pool only for a few powerblocks as their income are the techmoons those powerblocks are now in a league of its own absolutely unreachable for any entity not in their leaguein shortccp greatly fcked up 00 and they drove quite a number of playerscustomers off the game 
now theres a though would it be possible to have a ghost neutral sit in all systems just a little behind the scenes thing that isnt really there but tricks the bot into thinking theres a cloaked neut in system
maybe there should be a forum completely dedicated to discussion all thinks cloak related
supported
i propose that cloaking devices be changed to use a sort of ammo i think this ammunition should be very small 01m3 to allow covops frigs and other small ships to carry a decent quantity of it and it should be made mostly of stont to help stimulate nonhighsec ice mining the cloaking devices should probably hold different amounts of ammo in order to give a benefit to better cloaks and the cloaking skill should be changed to increase the cloaking device cycle time to allow for longer cloaking times before reloading a rough idea for numbers might be a base cycle time of 2 min with covops cloak being able to hold 6m3 giving them a 2 hour run time between reloads and each cloaking level giving an increase of 12 seconds so with maxed skills there is a 3 min cycle giving 3 hours of uninterrupted cloaking with a covops cloakthe t2 cloak could have 4m3 giving a cloaking time range between 80 min and 2 hours and the t1 could hold 2m3 giving a range between 40 min and 1 hourthe ammo being so small would allow a bomber loaded with bombs to carry enough ammo for around 10 days of continuous cloaking much more for other ships and bombers without a full hold of bombs
there isnt enough room in my blockade runner as it is leave my cargohold alone
a little too drastic a change for the problem its trying to solve which is just to give defenders some type of method to combat stealth cloakers this gimps all cloakers and will change how cloaking is used not supported
supportedpeople should remember that a t1 cloak would be able to hold 1 hour worth of cloak time without eating into the cargo hold at allit is this kind of solution which isnt particularly intrusive and doesnt require much work on ccps part
unless you planned on staying cloaked for days on end there would be almost no noticeable increase to cargo hold usage a t2 cloak would allow you to stay cloaked for 21 hours using 6m3 of cargo hold your argument of not having enough cargo hold is a weak one further if ccp felt that the issue of cargo space was a real one they could give all ships designed to have covops cloaks a small boost in cargo hold capacity in order to compensate for what they feel is a reasonable amount of time to remain cloaked without resupplyingthe problem its trying to solve is the invulnerability of cloaks and the lack of input needed by the player to use them this mechanic would make cloaking a dynamic and frankly more fun it is certainly far from drastic in any way and frankly would have no noticeable affect for those using cloaks to break gate camps or other average uses the only players that would even notice this change would be the ones who use cloaks for an extended amount of time
meaning those that travel deep into enemy territory to scout activities or anyone wanting to use a covert ops ship for exactly what it was intended forin other words every active cloaking pilot would be nerfedyet another bad idea not supported
hi traqnobody likes this idea either and nobody but you and like 5 other dudes and your herd of alts seems to feel this is a problemhave you considered the possibility that 00 space just isnt your cup of teai mean cloaks have been here for about forever and people have been laying traps for them forever you just dont seem to care to put out the effort to catch the cloaked ships yes they can actually be caught if you simply try and instead spam the forums with topics about something that is literally not on the radar for ccp because nobody cares weve been catching these dudes for yearsyoull ignore this response like you do in every thread you spam but have faith in every spammed thread you make i will be there reminding you how silly you lookhave a nice day
what is this  about cloaking monththis must be the 50th bloody threadwhen are you people going to realize that the mechanic is not broke the only thing broken is your headtry it yourself for crying out loud maybe youll understand well maybe
it shouldnt restrict cargo bay make a fuel bay if anything and leave cargoholds alone using fuel to cloak might be an alright idea as it would bring something else to the production i use covops often and personally wouldnt like needing a fuel cost to be added to my isk sinks but eh whatever
simple change that can make life easier and practically freeallow dragging and dropping of items into the quickbar list from orders lists or the icons in the markets details or the market group panels also from the contextual menu from the item details if applicableright now the only way to add to the quickbar seems to be from the search results the contextual window of the item itself which isnt that useful unless you already have an item
for recruitment purposes its nice to see corp and faction standings please bring them back

there will be significant information on this topic in the upcoming csm summit minutes andor devblog
i like it the added sounds indicating low shield and low armor were welcome additions this would be more of the samewindjammer
i like the audio warning for accidental decloaking especially since ccp decided that you have to basicly play without normal ship sounds if your camera isnt positioned firmly in your ships tailpipe
remove invention result dialog box while you are at it completely useless button clickingalso batch install
100 agree with you though the discussion has evolved a bit since then elenasa the basic premise is the same but i have since agreed that its not a high pri and is part of a much larger issue which is that baddies need to cheat metagame because they cannot survive otherwise and in order to fix this we need to establish a more robust way of determining trust between players sec status was designed to address this but the system has holes in many places money transfers plus all the others that anna brought up like can stealing etc its a tough problem not one that we can solve in 1 uber fix but i think having fiscal accountability is a start now we just need to minimize the loophole in my system contracting goods for purposes of moving isk etc most of which i have not enough experience in the game to think of

here is a really really cool idea ability to hold a lock while cloaked thats true black ops right there ship scanner or cargo scanner works while cloaked for black ops recon power stuff like that
this is why we cant have nice thingsnever mind that the sandbox aspect of eve is a complete illusion because youre forced into only a handful of optimal hulls for clearly defined roles lets wave our s at each other instead
nerf the dramiel really some of the other faction frigs need considering as welleass well unfortunately with the current state of ew jamming id like to say fix em but its a waste of breath until allornothing ew is moved away from see my posts about 5 years ago
as ignored as this will be merlin needs the following change 2 launcher slots 2 turret slots 9 pg 70 capacitormake it a friggin hybrid boat it would be a decent step down from the harpy
we dont need a tp for low slots and a velocity boost to long range missiles should be built into the game not something that requires using up even more slotsagain if nerfing long range hml fire is your agenda which it sounds like it is just cut the drakes targeting range by 20km there it now requires a mod to shoot further problem solved without the need for your worthless idea
i would love a tp for low slots it would let me put on a webber plus one point on the mids and not have to reduce the tank of the drake by too muchyes reduce the max target range aswell no point in making a ship target further then it can hityes a slight hml nerf reduction in flight time with an all around missle boost will make things better by adding aslswhat i am looking to do is first and formost reduce the affectivness of hml drakes and secondly introduce the ability for other non used missle ships for pvp its all about variety and just reducing targeting range without changing flight time is only a half fix not a total fixand no i dont think a velocity boost should just be built into the gamein guns you have tracking comps and te tp affects all weapon types including drones missles and turretsdrones have a tracking boost mod just like guns missles dont and they shouldplus tp has range restrictions the asl does notits not a worthless mod just because you dont understand its usesfor me i would put the scrip that increases the velocity on the mid slot variation for my sac now i can get some decent range out of my hamms by reducing a drakes targeting range and using a tp does not allow me to do this at alli know its hard for you to think outside of your zombie responces but please use your brain before responding next time
oh youd like to nerf every other weapons max range then because there are an absurd number of ships that can shoot further than they can lockalso its not about how far they can shoot missiles are not turrets and by nerfing flight time youd also be nerfing their ability to follow a moving target reduce targeting range by 20km again same effect as the idiotic missile nerf idea without the need to add new modulesyes it should because flight time is utterly absurd try using cruise missiles or even heavies at long range sometimethe problem with this beinghint missile range rigs exist idiot yawn another moron that thinks just because their idea is different its better stop trying to fix what isnt broken missiles are not turrets stop trying to change them based on the premise that they are if you want the drake nerfed make your post based on that  dont try and patronize people by hiding it under a ridiculous blanket change to missiles in general
this is also duchass starbuckingtons view of her own idea its pointless debating an idea with her as she just says meh meh meh my idea is bestjust state what you think the problem with some certain balance issues there are and move on its not our decision and shooting down someone else in a row over who is right makes you look very childish im looking at you duchass
ill shoot down any idea thats as poorly justified and thought out as that rubbish thanks
i know her name should be doucheperhaps she should read the op but they are looking for all sorts of ideads even crazy ones like mine reducing targeting range would not be going far enough but at this point it think douche starmarkonherbum will just try to troll everything as it stands the arguments points are there to be read if you support sound arguments then its clear who one if you support i am right and its final and if you suggest i am wrong i will just call you a moron and idiot then its clear you are an alt thanks
1 no i want the range nerfed and target nerfed so if you want to snipe like most other ships in game you need a range incraese mode and a sensor booster or sig amp this would force the drake to fit both 2 no just reducing targeting range will not be enough to bring the drake inline with toher tier two bcs3 no it should not be built in i would rather see obsurd low flight time with obsurd fast velocity this could help offest the lag effect of lots of missles on field at once4 yes missle range is flight time times velicity why are you mentioning this5 the problem being is that missles dont have a mod that works like a tetc just for missles all other weapon platforms do having the als would fix this6 even though you admit you are bored with the argument and that you claim only your half assed fixes will work how about you stop constantly reading the forums and go out and play the game or better yet enjoy real life like getting laid or something because its clear you have way to much on your time to waiste by trolling important internet space ship games
i see the thread has dissolved into a dumb flamewar and im not reading all of that crap to find out what its about and who is rightwrongcan we get a csm in here to tell us whether the thread was useful to get the point across to ccp
ok so if you want to make missiles equal to turrets let them hit for full damage on a low transversal targets and let them reach their targets instantlyif you want them to have all the drawbacks of turrets they should get the benefits as wellsee why your point is stupid yetyou wanted a missile range nerf i can see some sense in that in this particular case  reducing lock range is a very elegant solutionyep this is a great thing but it shouldnt need mods to do so remember this affects more than just the drakeno what i meant was  missiles have to deal with taking time to reach their targets at long distances this can make them unusably badstop treating missiles like turretsseriouslyget this through your head they dont have such a module because they dont need one and shouldnt need oneyawn more ad hominem rubbish from someone with nothing else to say
1 again you dont understand and i feel sorry for you about it2 cool there is some common ground 3 yeah thats the point more then just the drake for pvp would be nice you want it made into missle before a mod i want it made after a mod tomato potato type of thing i guess4 yeah i hear that ever used cruise missles at 200 km its kinda a joke but having a mod to increase thier velocity would make them travel alot faster and inasmuch get to thier destination much faster as you said you want this built in i would prefer a mod for this5 i do think they need a mod you dont i know missles are different and i like that about them this is a different way of achiving increase to tracking and optimal range you have ex velocity for the tracking and velocity for the range i like the idea of mid range hamms and torps and not just on caldari ships i mean6 i will leave it at just that lets move on shall we to another topic you have to admit the drakemissle talk is overdone at this point right my water for private parts buddy
mining being boring is a given but lets be honest its not that there isnt enough ore out in null sec space i mean i have been out there and see the huge fields just filled with resourcesthe difference is that there is no real incentive for the real hardcore mining corps to come out there and work iti have seen huge mining operations devour the rocks through several systems three orca and dozens of hulks mining as a group can move hundreds of millions of cubic meters of rock per hour but if an alliance isnt going to make it worth their while whats the point of taking the risk
most players did not sign up to play ice road truckers in space hauling is not fun escort duty is not fun the more hauling the more escort the less fighting anything that messes with the amount of dead ships per hour is going to be a big jolt to the market this would do thatwhy is it the job of an alliance to make mining worth the risk what incentive is there for the alliance if ccp wants people in null sec then there needs to be carrots in the game for being in null if they want people to mine low end ores in null then they either need to get rid of the high ends that we mine because you make a lot more per hour doing that or dramatically increase the loadhour you get from low ends in null
im not sure it its possible to encourage industry in nullsec without nerfing hisec industry ccp approach obviously is to nerf freighters and jump gates but i dont think it will work did people manufacture stuff in nullsec before jbs seriously i didnt play back thenso reduce slots in hisec add taxes in hisec if you want to buff nullsec not sure if its good for game tho
so you want to do two thinigs it seems 1increase industrialization of nullsec and make the resources for that industrialization burnable or breakablethese two goals appear to work against each other making the resources for industry breakable is a deterrent for doing the industry in essence if you create some industry with local resources you are providing a target the target gets hit and your benefits go down if the benefits are perceived as less than the cost the industry will go back to high secthe other question that seems to be missed is the one about the small groups the reason for making the resources breakable is so that small groups have a means to attack large alliances other than direct sov assaults why would a small group want to disrupt resources by burning the fields what does a small group gain from this isnt the only reason sov is challenged is in order to gain access to the resources in that area so instead of burning the fields which only serves to deny access to the larger alliances temporatrily make it so that the resource can be temporarily taken over you dont want to burn the field you want to steal the field this is the benefit that would encourage small groups to organize raids into sov space but it still appears that this feature would have an inverse relationship on the creation of industry in nullsec
most people dont sign up to do it in real life eitherin evein evethe opposite actuallypart of building an empire is providing protection and infrastructure for its denizenseconomic independence the ability to just about ignore the existence of hi sec 99 of the timethere are plenty of carrots but eve is a game about spreadsheets and people who metagame first and play secondhonestly this makes little sense low end ore in null is far nicer to mine than anything in hi sec for many reasons you have big fat veld moons you can chew on for hours the need for this material is immediate and mining in null isnt as dangerous as most think if even half of the null sec empires declared economic independence from hi sec the hi sec market would go up in price 3560 across the board which could be taken advantage of with strategic exportingprices in null would balance out with prices in empire in a matter of weeks
people have almost always hauled low end minerals ships modules from high sec to low sectry selling that game penn and teller made a game like that once upon a time it was extremely boring hard to convince people to spend money to be a truck driver in a video game because not sure if you noticed this but this is a video game that people pay to playin real life tooand in real lifethe occasional small gank that you in your uber leetness enjoy does not compare to the sheer destruction of the current null sec wars if everyone is hauling and thats assuming most people dont say screw this and leave there wont be many large fights thats bad for the economy in evewould you haul stuff on a regular basis through low sec and null sec for a couple million isk when you can make it doing something else null sec is specialized currently as an isk faucet a moon mineral faucet and a high end mineral faucet further beloweconomic independence is a stupid idea it is terrible in real life and the economy in eve is big enough where it would be a terrible idea there toothen why do so many null sec players spend a chunk of their time running missions and other things in high secsilly to compare to empire if you have something that will give you 20m iskhr and something that will give you 5m iskhr sitting right beside it which would you mine
being in npc corp and seeing a metric ton of 00 alts the usual responses are1 because of cta2 because of blobcloakiescamppeoples desire not to create a lossmail which they will most likely be mocked for is imo a driving factor of why people go to highsec the relative safety means that they can afk when they want or at least dont have to pay attention the whole time not everyone wants to be on 100 of thier game time increasing rewards of nulldecreasing rewards of empire wont change any of thisas an aside the its not fun argument is a little dubious in my eyes few people pay to train skills or think that waiting 50 days for some long skill to finish is fun yet so far few people would be willing to completely doaway with skills although i wouldnt be surprised to see this whine crop up more and more plain and simple we endure skill training because we want the result of that training same thing could be said of haulingmining either way i dont care if these things get nerfedbuffedwhatever i have no horse in this racethiseven if it was made possible it wouldnt work long term if the nullsec community isolated themselves from highsec economically the mineral markets would take a severe beating just based on the shear volume of minerals and soontobe minerals modules purchased below mineral cost created in highsec once mineral prices got low enough it would once again be significantly cheaper to purchase minsmodules in highsec and ship it meaning there would be no real change from the current scenarionot that any of this thread matters now since the summit is already in progress
sad to see this thread only have 6 pages of discussion on it thus farnullsec will never fundamentally change until you make the distance traveled much longer in real time it was this way in 2003 and you really felt like you were out in the wilds but with the addition of the super highways smugglers gates and capital jumpingdistance shrunk local markets will never really flourish if it is fairly easy to just jump your stuff near a major hisec trade hub and vice versa
hmm you have regular galexy then you have worm hole space how about have worm hoel space lead to a hole new galaxymake it a sub orbital galaxy like there are two of them orbiting the milkky way have it be 5000 new solar systems without stargates the systems are only linked at first with worm holes ccp introduces a new ship called motherships which can setup new star gates basically the mother ship is a mobile station with a jump bridge that can go from system to systemthis will be the real wild west vast and hard to find and would force people to setup industrial zones to stay alive

1no one asked to remove the standings in the first place
gm zerathithis was a design decision to prevent players from tracking down pilots by monitoring their standings towards npc corporations im afraid we cannot discuss the merits of game design decisions through petitions the appropriate place to discuss that are the forumsok so forums it is tracking down pilots  you do have the locator agents if you want to track somebody that bad the bottom line is if somebody wants to track you they will and it has nothing to do with standings most of the time on the other hand as mentioned above a lot of people lost very important tool in they eve life a social orientation beacon if you willbring it back before its to late  such changes make eve single player game it supposed to be about player cooperation not about isolation  also a suggestion here if quite a lot of people think they need standings gone just make it optional  like medals or certificatesanother thing which i am personaly not happy about and which adds to standing window lag is that it shows all the agents that is the usless bit which is quite large  if you would get wrid of that bit nobody would be to upset i think
i prefer it like it is now either that or make it so that whenever youd press show info it never opens in the standings bar i dont care about standings but sometimes want to check out someones bio so whenever id show info and it opened the standings tab itd lag my client for 310 seconds especially if it was a corp andor had many standings to show actually it would be optimal if it opened both corporations and characters in the biotab please
not really locator agents cost isk to use they cost time to use and effort its like hiring a pi to find out if your husband is cheating on you youll get your info but you sort of have to know whatwho you are looking for standings are free information which anyone can browse as they watch people pass by jita its like browsing the airport to see if you can find a mark it has no cost besides opportunity cost and allows gankers to find carebears from the sea of anonymous playersyeah optional is fine i think
aijle mijleroff is absolutely right
aijle mijleroff you are right fella return it back
bring them back if needed for some stupid idea that players have free intel and this is a lame isk sink to make locator agents more useful then so be it standings should be shown by default for new players until they are either off their trials or older than 14 days the rest of the players should have npc corp standings shown by default with agents hidden all tutorial agents should always be shown if they have been used if not they are invisible like it was save the very first tutorial agent if the reason was db calls let standings be on a tab that is by default not shown ie even if you always look at standings when you show info on a pilot you then have to click over to the standings tab further each corporation should have an expandable tab that opens to show agent standings for that corp only faction standings would be the default standings shown under the standings tab and always be shown for all pilots

fof missiles are without doubt broken if they target inanimate objects over aggressing ships so yes full support to making them only strike ships and nothing else i dont think its fair to say you could pick targets though thats making them ophowever hows this for an idea target painter modules also considered pretty second rate in many circles could be used to mark targets for fof missilesin normal circumstances the missiles should attack the closest aggressive ship and ignore structures and drones but if target painters are used they will attack the nearest painted target in range therefore making two of eves less favoured items much more viable while hopefully still being balanced
the problem number of ships invulnerable to scan has been steadily increasing lately i find ship being able to do anything useful with efficiency close to the scannable setups while staying invulnerable to scan bad practice unscannable ships are commonly used for safe pve or gang boosting although there may be other usages theyre neglectableproposed solution is described in this thread
supporting own proposal
agree 
not entirely sold on your solution but on it being a problem absolutely
i support this i have no problem with afkcloakers or whatever because they are cloaked and therefore shouldnt be seenscanned however i often see unprobablet3s used to boost pvp gangs not only making fleet command ships fairly redundant but i dont see why anything should be able to stay uncloaked but still invulnerable to scanner probest3s has made command ships quite redundant in many situations as they generally do the same things a bit better at much less of the training time but at a slightly higher cost i think cs should at least be superior in well boosting the gang
just supportin fact im using unscannable configurations too but i think there must be some real competition between scannerman and unscannable man op proposition isnt ideal but fine as first step in right directionmaybe some active decoys or stuff
not supportedfor unscannable fleetboosters just apply a penalty to the warfare processor subsystems that reduces the sensor strength of a strategic cruiser for each gang link module thats fit alternately you can make a very strong flat penalty to the sensor strength just for having a warfare processor subsystem in either case a sufficiently strong penalty will make the strategic cruiser probableregarding unprobable pve ships im under the impression that pve fits are generally useless in pvp are there any effective pvp fits that can also effectively solo missions and in what levels of missions the reason i ask is because if pvp fits cant run missions solo then missions should be changed so that pvp fits can run missions solo before we go breaking or weakening unprobable pve ships
only cloaked ships should be unscannable if you actively affect the universe you should be able to be probed out im fine with such ships being much harder than regular vessels to scan down but it shouldnt be impossiblesupport for the general idea
youre just wrong any mission which is doable in nonstopcap pve setup is doable in pvp setup cap booster yeah in fact some of the lowsec mission runners i know use pvp setups to run lvl 4s recent changes to missions introduced ability to use such pvp module as mwd on all missions  for ships like accapbooster mach its almost finalized pvpsetup

supporting a nerf to riskless pve in null and low sec
the way it is done is enter system look around and try to catch someone not paying attention then drop them then go afk for a few hours so people will be meh afk and go back to ratting and then drop them with a decent sized covert fleet or maby even a standard fleet by titan bridge depending on ship and if system is cyno jammed or not the local spike will make people all like wtf and a standing fleet might not engage for they dont know what they are up against and by the time they figure out what it is the ratters are dead and the gang is 10 jumps out then go afk again and repeat
bolded the problemmaybe dont rat by yourself have some gang members on standby to sos you falcon alt set a trap rat in a pvp ship bottom line is there is several ways to deal with cloakers your just be lazystop being such a  and fightand the reason they are all dead is because they have cowards for protection maybe try high sec ratting seems more of the game style you are looking forall in all working as intended
 see this guy gets it
then you agree that someone not paying attention should be able to die because thats exactly what an afk cloaker does when he walks away from the keyboard in the middle of 00 hes not paying attention
but you see he doesnt get it he doesnt even know what an afk cloaker is hes using the literal definition to defend his position its like saying a guard dog doesnt bite because according to the literal definition it only guards or its like saying you cant take cough medicine on a teaspoon because a teaspoon only holds tea
then stop relying on local as an instant intel tool afk cloakers are simply subverting locals intel power
ccp got rid of local for wh systems and then they felt that since there was no local they should also kill cynos in those systems and make their entrances limited and cause them to move constatly making it much harder for a group of players to organize an attack on those systems ccp has never however created a situation where cloakers are anything but completely safe once in a system they have clearly thought about your ideagetting rid of local and felt that it was a poor one for the general population a way to counter cloaking however has not yet been formally discussed by ccp
they are still thinking about it they have yet to arrive at a suitable replacement

i would support this or the cloaking device fuel idea the concept that someone can have an effect on my gameplay when they arent playing ie in bed sleeping or at the bar drinking without an appropriate counter measure boggles my mind being able to log on cloak go afk for whatever times frame you want when no one can counteract you is not balance those who say its balanced are the ones who abuse this system
i want to reduce afk cloaking or at least add a possible downside the fact that it allows for more ganking is a nice fringe benefitthis would not help solo ganking since announcing to the system and crippling your ship would be a very large risk i dont see how this impedes travel if you cant make it through a system cloaked within 10 minutes and really want to get through the system just log off and wait instead of walking away from the computer or windowing to wot or whatever while cloaked or stay active and warp whenever they light a detection field and laugh as they throw away isk its hardly an i win button it just gives the hunting party some way to have a chance of finding their preyi have traveled through 00 and i very rarely stay in a system for 10 minutes today i either see i can get through quickly take the risk of running a camp that could catch me with enough bubbles and skilled ceptor pilots or i wait a few hours or days to get through which is just as easy and safe to do logged offblack ops ships can use covert cloaks so can warp around safely and black ops gangs can warp between safes or just reactivate their cloaks with not much more danger than today noncovert ships can just recloak if theyre at a safe or better yet warp to a new safe before cloaking again so there is a bit more danger but they are hardly just as vulnerable as a ship with no cloakfirst this is internet spaceships so please tell be how the current tiny probes carry enough energy to warp across the solar system and scan half the solar system for over an hour at a timesecond who says you have to fill the solar system with energy or even if you do that you have to produce it the obvious weak spot of cloaking devices is that they turn off when the ship gets too close to an object so why not just fool all ships into thinking theres an object next to the ship for a split second even if you do want to fill the system with energy theres already this big star doing just that so perhaps a few tweaks to the solar radiation or magnetic field could disrupt cloakson grid only decloaking doesnt help stop afk cloakers
i changed my mind i really like this idea the first time i read it i was thinking it was a mod that would only decloak cloaked ships on your grid for some reasonas far as stopping cloaking ships from traveling through systems easily thats complete garbage its just another excuse by afk cloakers to avoid having to start working for their kills they are clearly running out of even half viable arguments for leaving cloaks alone the way they are but to completely end this weak argument the cycle time for the mod could easily be increased to allow even more time for a cloaked ship to get out of a system even though 10 min is more than enough though im sure if you said it should have a 2 hour timer they would still make the same complaint even if a cloaked ship were completely trapped in a system they could warp around the system easily avoiding scan probes if hey cant manage to survive by cloaking and warping and cloaking and warping long enough to sneak out of the system then they deserve to lose their ship
youve yet to come up with a good reason for any changebut its starting to look more and more like you want a cloak nerf irrespective of the afk aspect
as part of an attempt to insert some constructive comments and suggestions in here i would like to ask that ccp at some point much sooner rather than later review the npc corps and there agents and more evenly distributed there agents a bit more evenly accross there factions space and some additional agents for those lacking in either agents all together or ones of certain levels like amarr navy security agents where over half the lvl 4 security are in low sec and the rest are at oposite ends of amarr space and it looks like the single 5 agent is going to get a bit crowded so much for letting folks live where they want
i agreestill waiting for an explanation btw
ya my goal was to make noise think the moderator thought it was funny to lock all the reasonable thread and leave that one openthere are other people in this forum not everything i say is directed at you you should really stop taking every comment so personali have answered you question several time you ignore the answer because you have no reply
i didnt actually say you directed anything at me i merely pointed out i hadnt attacked you at least read my replies before commentingyou seemed to be taking the rejection of your ideas personally with that few people commentyouve not actually answered the question asked directly but simply side stepped itso in the interest of fair play ill ask againif like you suggested people that are cloaked get removed from local why after that change do you still think a mechanic to stop them going afk is still needed
and i will answer yet again whether they are visible in local or not the facts that cloaking makes a ship invulnerable and leaves no way for other players to affect the cloaked ship and also requires no input from the player who wishes to remain cloaked means that cloaking a ship in space makes it completely invulnerable in every way is the only situation in eve in which a player can walk away from their computer for days on end and have no fear of losing their ship while it is in space it is a flawed mechanic and should be fixed so that even when cloaked there is a possible way for a player in a cloaked ship to be in danger no mater how minute that danger is or how much effort those trying to find the cloaked player have to put out
so your saying that even when people are removed from local and are not seen they will continue to afk even though the whole point is being seen hoping to develop psychological warfare effects upon those in localthat reply of yours makes it look like you are simply after cloaks full stop rather like whole afk stuff is a smoke screendo you really know and understand the subject at hand or are you making it up as you go
guys please stay on topic local changes is not part of this proposalif you want to discuss local and other issues please do it in yourappropriate topic
good idea
please get rid of bs npcs while youre at itand remove whs pleaseand could you snag lvl 4 missions as wellim a miner so why should i care how pvpers earn iskon topicdid any csm ever actually talk about mining with ccp serious discussionhavent been able to find anything s
nothing will ever change mining it seems those macro mining bots give ccp 15 bucks a month regardless of purchasing plexs which someone spent 35 bucks getting or not
i dont mine either like you said its boring but i like these ideas
i have moved to a different profession just before the nerf and i have trained a few high sec alts i barely rat anymore i only pew pew with my 2x pvp toons in 00 why bother with roaming gangs cloakers hot dropers whatever while you rat in your expensive pve ship when you can make the same isk in high secccp has this all backwards high sec should have been a training ground and you should move to low sec00 where the end game is or at least should be 90 people in high sec and only 10 in low00 is the problem it should be the other way around i know many of you wouldnt like so many people in 00 but ccp can make the universe just biggerseverly nerfing high sec or for all i care put it on a different server can only give low sec00 life any meaningmove level 4 mission to low sec deplete the asteroid fields in high sec this would be the low sec00 buff people would be willing to make risk to go to richer grounds now they just dont have the incentivebut i know ccp wouldnt do this they just dont have the balls to do it and no matter how much you advertise eve as being a cold and harsh univers it just isnt you can grind in high sec in complete safety
cloaks are not the problem the free warning you get from local is remove local from 00
yeah and why not remove all rats from eve against botters that makes as much sense as this topicanyway cloaks means being risk free in space that is wrong and carebearish
no it means working as intended the issue is that you can see them and your reliance on local is being subverted
to everyone who complains about afk cloakers can i have your stuff
covops can warp cloaked and can lock you down before lighting a cyno a frig is also takes a good bit of time to lock in any larger ship so even if there are several of you ratting together you can be locked down long enough for an enemy gang to jump into system and warp to you no problem cloaked ship do pose a real threat as they should they can also walk away from the computer for days on end without worrying about losing their ship which they shouldnt be able to do
i would like to know how you manage to login after downtime and still stay away from your computer for days you also know about the locking penealty on cloaked ships after decloaking excluding bombers right
these changes also prevent bomber gate camps you sit cloaked for quite a while there too and only uncloak on tasty targets im still baffled why anyone who isnt botting would have a problem with someone sitting cloaked 247 in their system they arent doing anything why worry about it
please define the term afk in this context
seriously your arguing that they arent afk because they log on and click the cloak button that takes about 3 min and can easily be done with a macroalso you do know bombers can fit cynos right
you know that you can fit a cyno jammer to a pos when you hold sov right
there are several unintended consequences with the new agent changes for missions in some of the more isolated regions the number of security agents has decreased perhaps these regions need to be addressed on an as needed basis and increase their number of combat agents a region that had several agents like public relations and other types that had a higher than 50 chance of combat mission had many choices to get those combat missions declining a mission was not too bad because there was another agent in the same corp you could go to now the number of agents available for combat missions has decreased some of those combat missions now give out many more lowsec and faction missions because of the lack of available combat agents and the increase of less desirable missions this is cutting into mission time dramatically i dont want to do faction missions so i decline i get a good mission and complete it then i get a lowsec mission where the lowsec system may be busy so i want to decline that mission too but i cant because of the 4 hour timer i can only run 1 out of 3 or 4 of every mission offered from my desired agent where as before the change i did not have this issue one way to fix this unintended consequence is to get rid of the mission decline timer this way if i can only choose between 4 different level 4 agents each from a different corp i can still choose the agent working for the corp that i want either that or increase the number of security agents per corp in the more isolated regions proposal get rid of the mission decline timeroh and add a number of jumps column to the agent list for corps

siege module penalties make it difficult for dreads to do their jobs a siege dread has trouble hitting a moving carrier or super carrier without prop modules that is absurdly stupid i suggest a a lower reduction in tracking like 2530 dread guns still cant hit small  out of siege mode anyways so why gimp it so much that it has trouble hitting huge ass shipsscan res penalty does little in terms of balance and only hurts dreads even more its important to be able to quickly lock and get a shot titans and super carriers dont have to deal with this issue a nyxs base scan res is nearly triple the base scan res of a dread in siege mode siege timer in capital fights are much too long it should be reduced to 5 minutes these penalties are medieval and archaic they need to be reduced or need to go
i suspect ccp are attempting to nerf dreads to oblivion only to bring them back a bit op in the future when we least expect itthat said i agree with the changes also think they should do a bit more damage and have bonuses to buffer tank rather than active tank but thats just me
i find it rather amusing the largest and slowest ships in the game can speed tank a sieged dread
i know this will be flammed but how about a capital webber goes like 70km 80 reduction in speed has heavy pg cost would be cool though reducing the tracking would be nice too

you are forgetting the markets you will need refineries and reactions to make this new ammo people to haul it around sell it etc etc maybe youll get stuck in 00 with no supply of it or have it at inflated prices stront at 200400 per unit at 3m3 volume with your proposed 001m3 of this new stuff that would mean a super isk density per m3 making haulers capable of moving buckets of this stuff around in freighters making insane profits reprocessing it unless you only put a little stront in it not saying that any of these things arent possible just wanted to mention that it affects more than you think and all just to address the problem of afk cloakers put another way i dont think you need to nerf any cloakers in empire space haulers have enough problems already trying to avoid gankers to have to worry about buying fuel for their cloaks you really just care about 00 sec so i say stick with the pos module idea you want safer space build a pos and outfit it to make the cloakers combat probeable cloakers dont like that blow up their pos module starve their strontice supplies play balanced done in time for dinner
i have not and will not post on these forums with any character other than this one heres a thought not everyone wants this game to turn into a stagnant cesspool of flawed game play maybe just maybe there are other players out there that dont actually agree with you that cloaking isnt broken my guess is that you and most of the people who do agree with you actually know that cloaking is broken you are just the ones taking advantage of it and are terrified of seeing a day when its fixed and you actually have to work for your killsi know cloakers can be caught the issue is that they can only be caught and killed if they screw up there is no way for those trying to kill them to actively persu them you must set a trap hope the cloaker is currently at the computer and hope he takes the bait before the player who have set the trap with you decided they are tired of sitting and waiting every aspect of the engagement is in the favor of the cloaker and there is no possible way for those trying to catch a cloaker to take control of any part of the situationand i believe the reason that cloaking isnt on ccps radar is because every time someone comes on these forums and says they think cloaking is broken they get flamed by the six players who troll these threads while they have their toon cloaked in a 00 system and eve minimized i think its pretty awesome that after one day of persistantly bumping my thread to the top of the list there are now half a dozen other thread that have been started talking about the same thing hopefully after a few weeks ccp will actually start to think about thinking about talking about having a discussion about the subject frankly if a dev came out and said that ccp liked afk cloaking felt that it was exactly what they were looking for when they introduced cloaks which have not been around about forever by a long shot and was fully indorced by ccp i would never bring the subject up again as it stands right now they have said that they know its an issue but they havent really gotten around to talking about it yet i and i assume the other players posting these threads are simply trying to show ccp that its a big issue for us and we think its time they sit down and decide where they stand
stront is not isk dense trit is around 3 times as isk dense as stront is so im really not sure what your talking about there as far as inflated costs in my experience ammo is pretty easy to make yourself and if 1 run made a larger batch it could worked to be pretty cheap say 10 units of stront and a hand full of some minerals creating 1000 units would probably give you 510 isk per unit which is far less isk dense than most minerals and in the same ball park as most actual ammo lets assume on the high end of 15isk per unit for production and a 100 markup would give you 3000isk per m3 most other ammo is in the range of 5005000 isk per m3 t1 ammo that is if we look at minerals isogen is generally in the range of 23k per m3 as one of the cheaper minerals megacyte is around 100 times that further the only reason i suggested stront may be a good material is because it is obtained in limited quantities in high sec ice belts which i believe is where all the macro miners are it could just as easily use lo or heavy water or any other material that the devs see fit admittedly i had not thought about most of this but that took me a whole 10 min to work out the devs are probably a bit more capable than i am so im sure they can handle this also they get paid to make ideas implementable im just trying to help with the brain storming
traq i think you are missing my point mental math gymnastics aside my point was why go through all the trouble to introduce a new product to the market which will destabilize the current demand of whatever materials it ends up being created from when they problem you are trying to be solved can be solved much more elegantly by the pos solution and without the side effects of harming high sec cloakers
cloaks were introduced in 2004 people have been whining about them since
there are several possible solutions i am just writing them down as i think of them
prior to ejection ships computer shuts down all modules and diverts the surplus energy to reactors core ship enters reinforced mode hull gets 98 resistance to make sure that pilot leaves ship safely then the core shuts down a full ship restart will be neededie those in pods can claim ships after combat the person who ejected the ship can not step right back into the ship and neither can his allies further more you cannot destroy the ship while it is being overloaded so if you rapidly leave combat one alpha strike wont ruin the trophiesyou also get a kill mail stating that pilot abandoned the ship due to cowardice making it a trophy for the involved parties
not supportedgame needs scrambled eggs
not supportedpods need to die and killboards need to show implant losses
since they were now implemented can we please have the bpc icons the same color as the bpos but have a black top right or bottom right corner dark with a white c in it to as opposed to the ones we have now they are very very much an eyesore makes my eyes hurt when im looking at a hangar full of them either that or a yellow c similar to the t2 bpcs please ps i dont want to seem like an ungrateful prick but those new bpc icons are very annoying
tldr buff the yield nerf the range remove from mission and add it to the lp store make a meta 8 useful after all short range and doing a lot of stuff is the way gallente roll right original threadits easy make range 2km increase mining yield to 85m3

transparency 0  ccp 1what is the point of the minutes if everything important that is discussed is all under an nda just like real world politics the politicians that are elected cant tell their voters what they want and need to hear
nice blogwell except for the nda partswasnt the point of the csm that the players could have more insight into what the gravy ccp was doingif so i would consider it a failure d previous csm meetings arent exactly mindboggling
players should not receive an insurance payout for a ship they have lost in 00 the current insurance mechanic makes no sense to me this has probably been discussed before but i have yet to see it remove insurance payments for ships lost out in 00 and pvp will become a much larger isk sink it would also make the destruction from battles have more actual impact to me it just seems like a good change overall does anyone disagree i would like to hear your arguments

i agree with gypsios post earlier that all t2 bcs could use some nerfing and i actually think the lock range nerf would go a long way towards satisfying both issues the other issue is that rigs already exist for doing basically what your mod does and they actually do the job fine edit actually it has to be said that a range nerf of some sort would go a long way towards making the dedicated long range missile spewers eg caracal cerberus fit into their role betterah i shouldve gone into better detail here  what i meant was there are ships that use heavy missiles that are far more pressed for mid slots than the drake is drakes can mount a decent tank with 3 slots but something like a caracal cerberus or raven would run into real problems if they were forced to fit more midslot mods on top of everything else agreed and i would like to extend apologies for getting so heated on this issue
titan proliferation and later jfs killed nullsec difficulty in this regarddoes anyone else here even remember when there were freighter convoys that would be escorted by 50 ships 40 jumps past torrinos
yes the inability to do that at a high enough volume to keep up with demand in null is why we have all these things that make it easier to move stuff and even then you used to have to pod kill yourself to go buy another ship and make the trek back out to null because there werent markets in null i dont remember those events with fondness so to those who think getting rid of bridges jumping and jump bridges will localize the markets in null they clearly dont remember back to the days before those existed and the markets pretty much didnt exist
as a whole there are good solutions to the majority of problems posed in this threadwe need more slots  let us build more stationsthere arent enough low end mins in 00  rebalance the high end ores so that they drop more low end mineralshowever the issue of farms and fields to burn seems to be a problem i see the farms and fields at issue as asteroid belts and moon mining but how to burn them my first idea for asteroid belts was to allow you to destroy the asteroids themselves each shot destroys some of the ore until all of it is gone however this only hurts the miners and not the ratters which is when i came up with the second idea which i think will be more fun get rid of all static belts in conquerable 00instead of static belts there should be something capable of anchoring grav belts in space this would also require the addition of ice grav sites once anchored the the belts would become scanable with the system scanner and begin to slowly decline in quality in addition the local rats would start stopping by to check out the belt however the anchor needs to be destroyable by a small gang and once destroyed the sov holders would then have 2448 hrswould need balancing to come back and reanchor the belt otherwise it despawns and they would have to wait for another grav site to spawn also the rats should have a small probability of attacking the anchors so that if left unattended the space would gradually return to the default of having no beltsihub upgrades would increase the probability of grav sites spawning and each anchor would decrease the probability causing the system to reach an equilibrium over time this equilibrium should take weeks or even months to reach so that eliminating the belts causes long term pain to the inhabitants this would give a small gang the ability to at least be highly annoying to the inhabitants of the system and possibly destroy the mining quality of a system as for moon mining the ability of a gang to mess with a moon mining pos should depend on how much the miner is willing to put towards defending the tower a deathstar moon miner should take a fleet large enough that they might as well just destroy the pos however an undefended pos should be able to be messed with by a single player the closest thing i can think of to match these requirements would be a structure that you anchor next to a pos which would stop the moon miner from operating until it is destroyed however the act of anchoring this structure would be taken as an act of aggression by the pos which would immediately start trying to destroy it and the fleet doing the anchoring thus if you dont incapacitate the guns then they would destroy the structure soon after your fleet warps off so depending on the defenses of the moon mining pos the act of interfering with its operation depends on the relative strengths of your gang and the pos in question oh and let us build stargates
i remember bestower flotillas supplying the original fountain alliance
you are right back then it really did suck the outcry was intense and things were changed these days i think the manufacturing and trade base is much more robust and could survive the changes back to the old system major alliances already have their own market set upor they should
dividing some roles in separate tiers like senior and junior posguyproductioncontractguy where the lower tiers can not access the higher tiers work should do the trick also being able to divide the corp in several branches dividing stations pos assets access where roles on the same tier cant access the work of those in other branches would also help big corporations a thiefsaboteur would then only be able to affect a single branch of the corporation
just so that people realise what theyre asking for herethis isnt going to happen until ccp reworks an enormous amount of stuff and completely replaces the existing system i dont think it would be an exaggeration to suggest that this proposal would require an entire expansions worth of technical work possibly moreat present all corp roles gm roles and dev roles for each character are stored as individual bits in a single 64bit variable or some other fairly limited length there is not a lot of room to manoeuver and this affects nearly every part of eve in some way including many areas of code that havent been touched for several years such as the pos code it all just about works for the time being although many people are unhappy with various aspects of it and theres every chance that lots of things will break if any attempt is made to change it just like the uiconsider the last time sovreignty was overhauled ccp did not create any additional roles relating to tcus or sbus even though using them is a crucial part of the new system which should really be separate from everything else instead they reused the existing role of station manager which also allows corp members to fiddle around with refinery taxes and docking fees at corp outposts to me this indicates just how much they wanted to avoid having to mess around with these systemsthat said theyre going to find it hard to add more features at some point without adding more roles to control them so i suppose this will eventually become a priority supported
up to the top support if you would like to see a thriving contracts market
like most that have chimed in i can see removing agent standings from the public record but corp and faction standingsim sorry but this is a game breaker for me if this isnt fixed i dont see much point of continuing to try to do anything but grind like its a single player game in an npc corp it breaks corp security breaks rp and breaks one of the biggest aspects of this game that i felt made it more worthy of playing than any of the other mmos i have to pick fromccp already drove me off once and if i leave this time i wont be giving them a third chance to break the game on me really this is the sort of major change that should be discussed with the players and not just slapped on them out of the blue this is the type of change that many of us players take as a big fu to customer loyalty
some more thought should go into tweaking display of standings factions are not many so they should be visible always maybe there could be button to query corp and agent standings
perhaps the reason it was imposed so suddenly is because it was an emergency decree by team lag or whatever the team at ccp that combats lag is i can see that many lookups for those hardcore veteran carebears who have hundreds of agents killing the servers with lookup reqs to fix the load they take it completely out for now with the intention of either paralellizing the standings db or adding them back minus agent standings later and are watching now and laughing at us foam and fret and get our panties in a bunch then once the fix for the load on the server is ready they will put it back in with much pomp and circumstance all in the name of listening to our player basewatch and see
yes because you look like bruce
i really think it was a mistake making a weapon system for both caldari and gallente who have completely different ship tactics and philosophies as a result you have a weapon system that works on two extremes high damage but really short range weak damage and very long range there is no middle ground alternate its either one or the other for both races i propose we do away with this whole hybrid system erase the skills and reimburse the skillpointsamarr and minmatar have their own weapon systems why dont gallente and caldari they have lower end shared weapon systems like missiles and drones not to mention they both have to share weapon systems that fit poorly for them hybrids should become split into two groups1 particle accelerators  gallente2 rail gun  caldarifor gallente particle accelerators would have a long and short range type1 long range  linear particle accelerator  new type of weapon2 short range  cyclic particle accelerator  similar to current blastersparticle accelerators uses ammunition that generates a very high amount of thermal damage and a minor amount of kinetici have more to come
troll or just moron
does it matter unless she pulls some amazing idea out of her ass and has done a lot of work to get all the little details to fit together perfectly her idea isnt going to go anywhere
i dont understand why the op was called a troll maybe thats just me maybe i have a weird thing for tolerancethe idea presented by the op doesnt have to be the one that ccp adopts it just has to fit into the current discussion of hybrid weapon systems which it does as i understand it ccp wants to hear what you think and if this is the way the op expresses what heshe thinks how can we argue with thatas i read the op it says hybrid weapons are broken from the perspective of both narrative and performance and should be rethought from the ground up i support thathere are a few quotes from other posters on the subject of hybrid weapons and such from the thread
interesting idea but needs more work
as mags said many times cloaking in system is a counter to all encompassing local chat lets see local removed from 00 no more afk cloakerslets have a pos module that gives the ability of local to 00 now that would be fun
decent idea
anyone not paying attention should die in 00 my problem is cloakers can not pay attention and be pretty much as safe as if they were docked and never experiance unexpected pvpi was just saying a tactic used
cloaking is not required to subvert local since you can simply get in an unscannable ship and fly to a safethe question of whether local should be changed may be related to this proposal but i think thats a question that can be discussed in its own threads
i know it may be hard for you to keep up what with all the threads and using of alts but ill explainthis thread is called afk cloaking solutions and as such thats what i am talking aboutcould someone afk unprobeable sure does this still require local to work yesis the point the same why yes yes it isnow that youve proven local is the root cause ill eagerly wait an alt reply
stop being so scared of something that is harmless to you you are an embarrassment to this game
if you want to subvert local then be at the keyboard to do it i dont give a  that someone wants to be in 00 scaring the locals and killing off easy prey but be at the keyboard paying attention or die just like an inattentive miner or ratter would die for not paying attentionafk cloakers should not be exempt from one of eves primary rules pay attention or diei dont really care that you think that this would be unfair to your poor afk cloaker inattentive and afk cloakers should become easy prey for the rest of 00 just like defenseless and inattentive miners and ratters are easy preyhey i know you dont want to lose this tremendous perk of being able to stay logged in subverting local while you can go to school or to work hell youre going to cry and scream when ccp fixes this youll probably even quit the game squealing like a pig but the fact that you can do this is simply wrong and you know it
yeap and the only time a nuclear reactor harms you is when they meltdown in your city by that reasoning we are going to build all nuclear plants on your backyard no harm they are safe feeling uneasy why
i support this
i support any fair solution to any afksomething cloaker or not included
all they do is sit all day long risking absolutely nothing deciding on when the cards are stacked in their favor then striking not only is this unfair but uncalled forthey are impossible to counter you cant give me a ship setup that can fight one of these losers where i can still do an anomaly at a decent speedmy idea would be that even at best skills they cant target anyone for 30 seconds after decloaking also they drop to zero speed this would be more balanced also the cloak cycles for 60 seconds like the damage control then if you dont hit the cloak button again within 5 seconds you decloak time to be able to recloak should be about 23 minutesbut in the end i fully support this broken mechanic getting fixed
i can see youre upset but swearing and shouting isnt going to help try to stay calm and understand the issue being afk is direct response to local but they are paying for their account so whatever they do at their own keyboard is not your concern they are not breaking any rules even ones that are made upive never afk cloaked although i use my scout to sit for hours watching a gate some have accuse me of doing so even though i dont actually leave the keyboardso where do you draw the lineso far every solution looking to nerf cloaking always hits active cloaking and many ideas promote the use of macros this is bad and simply points to the fact they are not addressing the real issue which is locali know you dont like the thought of losing your all seeing eye but you know you are wrong and you dont want to admit it while ever local remains as a 100 risk free instant intel tool people will try and subvert its use youll just have to realise that the instant intel its giving you cant be taken at face value now your take on eve rules many of eves functions work whilst you are afk but thanks for your humorous insight into the rule book
not only do you want a free warning from local there is a hostile thereyou also want an overpowered system wide uncloaking device go back to highsec so concord can hold your hand and make you feel safer not supported in any form remove local
they arent at the keyboard thats the point your special arent youand the only effect most of these suggestions would have on an active cloaker would be to cause them to have to warp to a safe spot very occasionally to recloak nearly every player that posts a new topic about this subject in fact clearly states that they want to avoid as much effect on active players as possible further if ccp were to avoid creating any mechanic that could possibly be done by a macro there would not be a game because nearly ever aspect of this game could be run by a macro that is just a sad excuse for an argument against something that you are terrified to see change also i think its really amusing that you cant comprehend that i am not the only one who takes issue with this flawed mechanic and keep saying that i am posting with a bunch of alts
you cannot say for sure if they are or not either way its up to them what they do as for being special its youre not your i see youve moved on to personal attacks thats always a good move and suggests a winning argumentexactly meaning it affects active cloaking and not in a good way thanks for agreeingbut fail as youve agreednot a sad excuse at all simply a fact much like the fact you hate the thought of losing your all seeing eyeim amused that youre not the only one failing to understand why people afk cloak you and the others cant seem to comprehend that local is at the root of all thisalso please quote the posts where i keep saying that you are posting with alts
since you insist on being insulting for no particular reason your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries now that the requisite return insult has been levied ill say again that changing local is not what this proposal is about if you want it removed then create a proposal to that effect i understand that you think the current game is too safe for noncloakers and others like myself think its too safe for cloakersit sounds like you are neither willing to be convinced nor do you have any arguments meant to change peoples minds you just want to insult people who disagree with you in other circumstances i might try to stop you but since that seems to be the primary activity on these forums ill simply bid you happy trolling
great film thatno i think the balance is about right atm but this proposal is in regards to afk cloaking that cannot have its desired effect without local you could afk without a cloak to get the same results simply because local is at the root of the issuenah but faceless alts tend to illicit certain responses if youre not a faceless alt then i apologise for my horrendous hard to keep up taunt
yet another thread smelling of afk cloaking whine
i sense a hunt for afk cloakers is more of the subject here than actually changing the module concept prove to me that people are afk cloakers and ill give you a reward or something but i doubt you can prove thats the caseif you cant handle the dangers in 00 move to safe empire space
havent you moved to high sec yet all your whine will produce nothing to deny people of hunting other people in space where there is no rules of engagement 00 is not safe empire space
please prove that people are afk on your little carebear system accusing people of being afk is just a silly excuse of you not being able to handle the fact that there is someone in your system with the intentions to blow your ship up and their presence is as justified as yours one universe one server  mmorpgmaybe you should try out singularity instead
if you cannot manage to counter you have failed at everything 00 is all about and you would probably be better off in safe empire space atleast it would save you some buckets of tearsthe only broke thing is people that have no clue of how to operate themselves due to the fact that 00 is a hostile and dangerous playground
the sphour rate would be based on your lowest two attributes i think its a good idea
or you could just implement a way to change skills through eve gate access to internet is so common these days that if you cant get access to it for a long period of time you arent really trying
this tho replace grouped with focus fire
the whole damage notification thing needs to be improved it is very difficult to tell who is hurting you for what when a lot of things are hitting youit would be nice if it showed like 3 at a time and scrolled
im saying that cloaking has no counter the all seeing eye and afk cloaking make this apparent there should be enough risk involved in cloaking in someone elses system to make it too dangerous to walk away from the computer for hours on end
server should autologoff a cloaked ship after 1 or 2 hour afkmacro activities chat spam every x seconds for example to stay online should be punished
no what is apparent is that local is at the root of all this you can afk in an unprobable ship that kind of messes with your take on things now doesnt itlocal has no counter thats why people have taken to using afking to try and subvert its use
just because you do not now how to kill them does not mean it can not be done btw botters go against the eula someone hunting you does not go to highsec if your scared
1 post for good thread posting oh and btw why is there never any whine about regular ships being flown by people in the crying carebears systems isnt that a threat too going on the assualt of a covert class of ships is nothing but pathetic attempts t
yes i would argue that someone who is sitting at their keyboard is not afk also i was saying bombers are the only ship that can instapoint after decloaking
here is more problems then soplutions cap its drain can be manget firth macro to clouck them again and stil sti in system
how about an interedictor do you think they could keep you from warping right after decloaking could probably lock down an entire gang thats mining and would be able to hold them long enough for a gang to jump into system probably even make it 23 jumps while the bargesindustrials try to slow boat out and then align even if there is security that popped the interdictor he wouldnt have dropped a bubble unless his friends could take the security
i would like to know how you manage to login after downtime and still stay away from your computer for days you also know about the locking penealty on cloaked ships after decloaking excluding bombers rightseriously your arguing that they arent afk because they log on and click the cloak button that takes about 3 min and can easily be done with a macroalso you do know bombers can fit cynos rightyes i would argue that someone who is sitting at their keyboard is not afk also i was saying bombers are the only ship that can instapoint after decloakinghow about an interedictor do you think they could keep you from warping right after decloaking could probably lock down an entire gang thats mining and would be able to hold them long enough for a gang to jump into system probably even make it 23 jumps while the bargesindustrials try to slow boat out and then align even if there is security that popped the interdictor he wouldnt have dropped a bubble unless his friends could take the securityhow does the interdictor get into system and warp to the belt without being detected
because people are mining afk but really in the years that ive been part of null sec mining ops ive never seen a mining op go down in this way almost always it is a logoff cyno person jumps into system everyone hides person finds the belt everyone was mining in logs off wait 30 minutes for people to go back to mining log in light cyno bridge in fleet everything dies in almost every case where the mining op fails thats how it went down
i strongly support this the nerf to scan resolution is lame a dreads role is not only antistructure but anticapital as well being limited to locking only 2 targets and taking forever to lock them makes it useless for target switching and fcing a group of carriers simply repair their targets long before the dread finishes locking on it i really see no point in making locking time so long especially since dreads can only lock 2 targets in the first place the tracking nerf from siege modules was made horrible in dominion people were whining and crying about how titans can easily own battleships and cruisers with their guns so ccp nerfed the tracking to xl guns so that titans became useless again they forgot change the penalties on siege in responses to the nerf made to tracking in dominion as a result a nyx can make me miss by simply moving or i miss a pos because my velocity is greater than zero when i activated siege mode i agree that the 10 minute timer of a siege module is too long people say that dreads must commit to a fight what about supercarrier it doesnt have to commit to a fight while packing superior dps ehp and usage the only thing that dreads are useful nowadays is in wormholes even then their use is still limited they pose virtually no threat to sub caps unlike a carrier this is the step in the right direction
yes a supercap can speedtank a dread if it orbits the dread at 500m which is kinda impossible in any kind of realistic situationalso i am pretty sure titans still do huge damage to battleships except lol leviathan you meanwhile want a 2530 reduction in tracking now a reduction in tracking to 2025 i could support but not a reduction of 2530 then you simply get dreads owning battleships which are both owned by supercaps really tracking there isnt the issue why they get slaughtered by supers tbh the issue is supercaps not dreads
this is a serious problem
wrong a supercap can be 15km away moving and the dread will still have issues hitting it a dread will miss a pos if it goes into siege mode moving at 10 ms at 30km a battleships moving 100ms at 40 km can speedtank a dreads short range guns with 2 tracking computers with tracking scripts i doubt decreasing the penalties from 50 to 2025 will make dreads antibs ships maybe from a long range but realistically bss can simple orbit the dread at 30km without prop mods to make it miss besides if one is staying still in a bs while engaging a dread its their fault that they get popped with it finishes locking and shots you
sorry to dissapoint you but ive actually had a 18k volley shot at a bs with a turret dread in siege the poor bs basically died horribly and i loved itof course i would endorse less penalties thou
they copied the starcraft siegetank idea mediocre normal operation but omfgpain when deployed  just went a tad overboard with penalties if the thing about scan res is correct then hell yes it has to change  dreads should be faster lockers than scs any day of the week being smaller and allsiege should be cut to five minutes ten is a lifetimeewar immunity is redundant and works against the dreads as they cannot receive rr while immobile depends on what happens to scs fighter bombers currently shred sieging dreads long before they have any chance of getting rr perhaps siege time reduction is enough but i doubt it
i shouldnt try coming up with ideas that late at night after thinking about it a little bit during school i have realized that it is impractical to consider that idea and that it would be a bad idea to bring in another series to eve however my proposal is that some new playable races are added with all new ships and that they would be more alian than human they would be completely ccp designed any suggestions on what these races could be is welcome
not sure if serious but im sure the uss lawsuit should be added to your fleet of ships coming to eve if this brain fart would ever see the light of dayfrom a practical standpoint this would never happen even if ccp could buy the rights to do it there really isnt any benefit in doing it you personally might like it but other players would hate it it would cost ccp money and give outsiders influence on what ccp can or cannot do with content in their own game its a much better option to make up your own things since it allows you to retain total control over it and you dont have to pay anyone for the right to use it
very bad troll detected points for creativity though210
while id love an eve like game that is set in the stargate universe there is no way that well get anything stargate related in eve aside maybe from some vague reference and insidejoke ala the black monolith eve is a completely different universe with completely different storyline yes its sad the tv series have ended but if youre looking to ressurect stargate youll need to do it a different way
well this is different
different does not equal good though
different is bad fly minmatar today

with our saved ship fits we can auto fit our ships with the click of a button i would like to see a feature where we can pull up a saved fit and click purchase and automaticly buys from the market the ship and all the mods required to make that fit from the current station at the lowest price i know its not a game fixingbreaking idea but it would save soo much time shopping in jita 
this is not about the removal of standings as a wholethis is a request to reenable the ability to show info about which factions have standings with each other i personally do not need this i have my cheat sheet saved i do not know if this core information is available in game anymore this does seem like an needless removal of information that is key to new playersthat is all
umm you do realize that it is going to take us a few weeks to get the minutes edited and released its a big job rightand also that traditionally ccp has been very light on the nda sauce i have several times expected them to nda some things only to hear not a peep for example on discussions of existing fis features it is unlikely that the nda will be invoked on anythingedit another reason that i was very highlevel in the blog postings was that i dont want to steal the thunder of those devs that will be writing devblogs in the near future they did a lot of hard work and deserve their moment of glory
kudos to you treboryou keep speaking in the weform while it is just you of csm6 that is doing the public jobat least thats what wethe public  witness
these blogs were a delightful read my sense of anticipation for the full minutes is higher than ever but id much rather a robust read than a rushed release
looking forward to reading the more indepth versions thanks for the short and sweet though trebor

00 should be about building a empire being self sufficient you need industrials to mine to produce and missionanomaly runners for meta stuffit doesnt work because you have low end minerals in abundance in high sec in complete safety which is probably mostly mined by bots or afk miners also high sec has better rafineries no taxes in 1 man corp and an abundance of manufacturing slots a 00 miner cant compete with that so he only mines abc ores anything else is pointless mierals coming from drone regions in loot form also destroy mining as a profession mining should be a necessity not a lol professionthe jita dependance of 00 is stupid in so many ways there shouldnt be convoys between 00 and jita but only between the places of mining manufacturing and trade in 00people earning from pve pew pew stuff should be able to make their living in 00 without going to high sec to farm lvl4s in my opinion industrymining should pay more than farming anomaliesmissions this is also one of the problems that destroyed the industry and why convoys dont happen i cant pay the pvp people to escort me cos they earn so much more just running the anomalies so why should they bother also why bother mining when my tengu earns 50milhourlow secnpc 00 space piratesmercs should suffer from the lack of their industry and our industry is the fields they can burnccp recepie seems to make 00 into a wild west which is reserved for low secnpc 00 and just leave the high sec bears fat and happydestroy high sec high sec must be a training ground not a lvl4 farming field industry and trade haven there is no incentive to do any of this in 00 when you make the incentive to live in 00 then for all i care you can burn all the jump bridges jump freighters or anything with a jump drive because we wont need it now this would be a sandbox not a lol 90 of game is high sec
by destroying high sec i meant to remove lvl4 even lvl3 missions from it and deplete the asteroid fields completly and no matter how much safer high sec would be lvl2 missions wouldnt be appealing anymoreit would remove high sec mining bots and afk mining it would make mining fun in 00 cos your tritanium wouldnt get you 5milh but 50milhproblem is this would be a realy big change and after cattering for the cearbear hearth for too long they might not adapt to this change and would simply leavethis is why i know ccp will never change and mature this game and its always gonna be a joke
there are a lot of grand proposals here and as a game design major i find it great that the community would go through all the trouble of taking a role in trying to help fix them that being said im not sure the repercussions of these ideas are often times thought out to through the entire scope of this universe this game has an advertisement about the butterfly effect and what some of these suggestions would accomplish would be negated by the problems they would cause that being said what are the problems null sec is barren of industry on a large scale when compared to high secyet when you talk to most industrialist they get all dreamy eyed over the thought of one day managing their own outpost or grazing in fields of abc so why is it that even though most industrialist want a slice of this variable heaven that they stay holed up in highsec which contrary to popular thought is not profitable unless you already have a sizable investment perfect skills and usually multiple accountsthe answer to that question is many fold but it has everything to do with what a friend of mine and i call the african complex null sec is currently this vast area of the richest space in eve waiting to be harnessed by anyone who knows how unfortunately like africa its run by warlords and their goons in order to become a part of the null sec team you have to enslave yourself to a larger pvp alliance that will most likely not even protect you if a single neut comes in system looking for an easy kill my null sec experience with indy amounted to a bunch of us indy guys tied up in station with one or two neuts outside and the entire protective fleet 2 jumps away unwilling to tackle such a small fry along with the african complex comes something that normally doesnt get brought up behind most pvp corps there is an alt industry corp that gets fed through the pvp while this isnt a revelation among players already living in 00 i can state with some confidence that if most industrialist were told before entering in the game that their spot and their hard work was mimicked by an alt that never left station and was only played a minute fraction of what they put in that those players would have never chosen that routewhile that is why youre never going to see a miner in system there are other problems too that should be addressed my entire friends list stopped using pi when they made it variable the mini game moves resources outside of reach for entire months and is no longer fun for an indy choas is fun for pvp but when it comes to creation enough problems arise without the game taking its toll with rng another factor of pi hell is the the amount required to build anything in a null sec system is near impossible between running pos and not being able to get new command centers on demandlogistics was brought up multiple times in this thread and i was wondering how many of those people have ever tried to run a system characters not logging on or unwilling to mine ice some weeks can cripple an entire system without the jump freighter lines while the problem of ore compression is a massive one another nerf to jumping would harm rather then encourage growth not to mention setting up a new outpost in deep null would become unimaginablebefore i will post a review on the changes i would make in vague terms i would like to bring up one last thing if you really wanted to tip the scales for an indy character making up his mind on whether or not null is right for him there is one massive incentive you can give to players bring back the chance to obtain a t2 bpo by doing a industry in 00 even if it takes 2 years to obtain a frig bpo i can assure you it will peak interest
tldr pvpers has a greater capacity compared to industrialist in terms of mineral and wealth gain a pvper can mimic anything an industrialist does with his stationed alt planetary interaction is not player driven and is too unstable to support infrastructure growth when isolated from the jita market jump freighters are required for any sustainability due to players having time conflicts incentives other then you get to build for pvpers must be put into null

the new and long awaited feature of incarna is finally about to drip drip its way onto tq and into a pr disasterunder the current plan cq the first stage of incarna will not be optionalevery time you dock you will nolonger be in your hanger looking at your shipyou will instead load your captains quarters as a fully dressed and pressed avatarthere are posts and threads abounding with people detailing why this is badhere i simply want to get a head count for those who for whatever reason believe that cq should be optional upon dockingthis is not a referendum on if it should exist at all or if it will be any good ectsimply a show of hands for those who want to chose when if at all they use ithopefully if there is enough support it can be made optional before it hits tq not tacked on 618 month latergiven that those who want to use cq will under this proposal still be able to do so without any penalties it seems to be a nobrainer that those who dont want to use it all the time also have that choicesoden rahedit ok so ccp have added on the sisi test build an option to not load the cq environmentthis is good but not what i was asking for this helps those who have performance issues with the in station environment not those who had rpimmersion issues please keep supporting for having a regular hanger view on docking ship spinning and all with a neocom button to enable us to disembark to enter cq when we want
check out the new dev blog all the station buttons will still be available if you dont hit your arrow keys u wont even have to deal with it im logging into my fb now to pull the dev blog for you
incarna dev blogas you will notice with the imbedded video all station buttons are still available to use and make for quick itemship swapping etcif the duality server says anything which i doubt it does having all ur settings on low and unchecked the textures for cq dont even load i wouldnt count on this howeverare you worried about cpu reqs my laptop cant even handle incarna in its current state so i doubt i will be using it either either way its circumventable
this
read the blogs been on duality chatted to the devs on duality read the forum posts posted some of the forum posts and still for a whole host of reasons think this should be optional know a lot of others feel the same so created this threadnow please stop assuming you know more about whats going on than me and that i have reached my opinion based on incomplete or inaccurate informationi like the idea of cq i just want it to be optionalif it is optional then it hurts those who likewant it not at allif it isnt optional then it es off those that dont want it or dont want it all the timewhy not make it optional
but im asking why bother making an option if it doesnt matter im not inferring i know more then you im simply pointing out a reason of who careschill out guy maybe you can start listing your and the millions of other peoples reasons for why its such a big deal to make it optional when the idea of incarna is to make the eve universe more realistici just dont see why a step towards an immersive environment is so bad when you can still function like beforesorry for not seeing your superior wisdomhows that for for an ignorant post better
i got stuck within five minutes of testing on duality last week and still am sure i dared to hit the leave station button after my cq view went dark and nonresponsive but still if you add another layer to something already very complex dont expect either to run as smooth as it would by itself there will be problemsit is a fact that many players are unhappy and skeptical of incarna and even more about the apparent removal of a choice to leave your pod or not hell im pretty awed by incarna myself and will probably not stay outside of stations any longer than i need to yet i am totally flabberghasted by this appartent inconsiderationthere are a lot of good reasons to keep incarna optionalthere is not a single good one not toalternatively make us see the light ccp and respond to this with stunning wisdomedit in answer to abovebecause it is not more realistic to just stand there in your clothes seconds after your ship started to dockbecause it is not more immersive to be forced to get out of your shippod just to convo with an agentdrop off some small cargorefithide in the station ready to undock at the first chance to get elsewhere safely
well there is plenty things in this game changed what lots of us do like and others notthe game evolve and will continue to evolve in the future so you have only 2 optionsa accept itb or leave itthere is also plenty of those guys who whine about they poor laptops cant run thiscant run thatwell did those who complain even ever read what syster requirment eve need to runstop crying this game is already hold it back witt grafics and such to try everyone be happy but ccp simply cant to not move forward with rest of the world or they simply will ruin they own businessif you want to play this game for long period of time you have to accept the changes and you have to upgrade your systems at some period of time thats atleast what you do when you buy other games dont you
no i just deal with using low graphic settings do i win
cyberif thats your opinion wtf are you doing in the assembly hall if you believe that everything is out of our hands and rightly so this makes no sense at all
i am not claiming superior wisdom i was objecting to you dissing my post on the assumption i hadnt read the dev blog or tested out the feature on dualityand i am all for a more immersive environment this wont helpnot because the feature itself is bad but because it makes no sense that when you dock you instantly appear fully clothed and without any pod goo in your hair in your captains quartersif you dock up for a quick ammo reload or to switch out hardeners you wouldnt get out your pod shower put some clean clothes on then switch your hardeners out by push button now your nolonger in your pod then undress get back in your pod get back in your ship and gothere are many reasons for wanting an option to enter cq rather than it being mandatory but i didnt create this thread to discuss them there are a host of threads on the forums already doing that this thread was created simply for a show of hands for those who want it to be optional and wish the csm and ccp to take that into consideration if you want to debate the reasons why i can point you in the direction of several threads where it is being actively argued but i can end with one there are a number i never said millions of people who vocally dont want incarna at all andor want it to be optionalgiven making it optional doesnt hurt those that do want it or dont care why give yourself as ccp the agro of annoying those who want the optionthis issue has been raised in every thread on the new cq feature
this is the future people are warping instantly all over the place whos to say there isnt a transportation beam that takes you out of the pod and this beam also cleans you the clothing is threaded over you or transported on you all in the matter of a momentand im not dissing your thread you made a public thread and i responded in it my initial post had no disses in it yo i aint dissin yo  brahowever since your a  now i am ing with youif you are so ed about incarna making your day so much more difficult by doing the same thing that happened before but with a different look then you got more problems then just incarna coming outthey are pandering to you guys who are mad that you have a spaceman doll by keeping all the functional buttons and windows intact just ignore the ing guy in the middle of the screen and theres no issuesyour making it an issue by saying i am upset that the dock screen looks different now thats just ridiculous
come into my thread by clicking here and diss my  yo if itll make you feel better its obvious that you need a commotion
well i think that this topic which the devs have looked at even posted in a dev b showed a good way to goi like the idea of having both the cq and hangarmakes sense more in an rp way it you look at it as the followingevery time you go to you cq you have to drain your pod wash and get dressed now would you really want to do that if you were only picking up one itemi mean in rl when im picking someone up in the car i dont always pullover and park turn off the engine get out greet the person then get back in so why would i in a space shipmaybe having the hangar as a quick stop where items can be movedships changed and refitting and cq for everything else which would take more timeeditalso want cool little cut scenes like suggested on video to add more immersion better than a loading bar
my pc runs the beta version of cq dual screen at full res max settings aa the works at over 30 fps i am not complaining because i wont be able to run eve on the new settings ccp are actively asking for opinions of the players as to what they think of eve and the new features under development in particularmy feedback includes the opinion that cq should be optional for a variety of reasons i therefore totally reject the premise of your postthose are not the only options and those are not the reasons i am complaining about this issuei am not about to emorage quit you cant have my stuff and i will keep expressing my opinion that ccp has asked for on the game i enjoyyou are right on one thing there are plenty of features liked by some and not by others this will be one of them so in the interests of keeping the customer satisfied why force people to use this one
cant really say supported if all the same features are there and everything takes the same amount of time why have them complicate matters by having 2 sets of code just for docking just seems like we are asking for things to be way more complicated for ccp than they need to beedit to the op i guess it would help if you gave a couple reasons why a change like this would be needed at all it just sounds like extra work and more time in development for basically nothing
i really dont
im just wondering if ship spinning is this important to you
meaby because it will become part of the game they make as you have stated above some do like something in game while the others do completely dislike though the others do like what the first one do not so they both have to deal with itthis case will not any difrent while i will remain netral on this new feauture of they game there will be still lots of ppl who likes it and who notim sure that there is enough some things in game that you totaly would like to be removed so i do my things but the true is it wont happence and we  youme and others have to deal with
and you beleave that you can dictate how ccp make they own game get real yes they listning to desires of the customers  atleast if they smart enough to do so but at the end its them who make the final desigion and final content how they think it should be not the player base
assuming it was me you were askingnope although it does apparently have quite a large followingthey are planning allegedly to add a ship spinning feature to cq at a later datebut that doesnt bother me one way or another
it is optional just tell windows not to allow the file that contains the cq textures to load no cq
well i usually get accused of creating walls of text of reasoned argument that noone replies to as there already seemed to be quite a large number of people already complaining about this issue i tried to make a thread simply for everyone who cared to put their had up and say yes i agree this may have been a bit too optimistic on my parthowever the everything takes the same time is not necessarily a given hereand i am not asking for two different kinds of docking i am suggesting that you dock as normal and then enter cq after that if you want by clicking a neocom button this thread might give you a taste of the arguments and this is my first post in it
yeah but i want to be able to use it just not be forced to use it all the timeplus its possible your suggestion i have seen your thread breaks the eula
you dont have to use it each time tho dude  im not sure what ur not getting here just because u can walk around you dont have toits like changing ur desktop background does that fundamentally change how u use your computer

so have you decided i am not a whatever the asterisked word was you called me and can now be talked toit wont make any difference to how i play as it stands the first iteration the new 3d ui will basically be embedded buttons in the cq environment that open the old ui windows which then completely cover and hide that environmentuntil that changes i wont ever see cq under all my windowsi will though waste cpu time loading ithowever from an aesthetic and rp standpoint the fact that i no longer in my pod looking at my ship with camera drones jars plus i like the hanger view in your analogy of a wallpaper this would be where im being forced to have a new wallpaper i dont like instead of one i dobasically ccp is adding on a huge new area of the game with lots of new coding which can go wrong and break if it as originality advertised is kept separate and one breaks it doesnt effect the other if cq breaks on launch or after we can no longer dockthere is an issue for those on baseline hardware who currently use the dont load station environment option who will now be forced to load a big new environmentbasically there are lots of reasons to make cq optionalthe only reason not to is its challenging for ccp to dowhich is manifestly not true plus i asked the reason atm is aestheticas the only reason is aesthetic and aesthetics are personal i say make it optional so we can chose which we wantand on your earlier rant your immediate response was to assume i hadnt read the devblog and was posting not knowing what was going on that is dissing my post or however you want to put it your starting point was to assume i didnt know what i was talking about that irritated me but not to the point of shouting swearing and calling you names i just wanted this thread to be a head count no drama at all if you want to continue discussing this then fine but call me asterisks again and ill simply ignore you i dont need the agro
his orignal post was supporting how its not an issue due to the fact that you can still function the docking like normal its not his fault that your an idiotif ur worried about your cpu then thats a diff issue keep graphic settings low maybe you should log back into duality and check out all the click boxes pertaining to graphic settings u can turn most everything to low and noyour just ing for the sake of ing typical eve user
i understand that not having any choice is a religious conviction with some people however for the rest of us an option to stay in the ship when docked would make things rightheres my post from the dev blog threadjust pointing out that this is a big mistake you guys have been pretty insistent about the immersioninducing nature of this eve addon and this kind of space  avatar transition is anything but immersive there is absolutely no reason for the capsuleer to always leave the pod when docked when all the current tasks can be performed remotely from the podit is especially sad to see this because all of the graphical assets required for the shipspinning view are still in the cq client and the developer resources to keep this view in the game would be minimal this feature does not even require any changes in the incarna designso why not keep it making it optional will make a lot of your customers happy those who complain about performance immersion gameplay focus can opt out of autodisembarking while those that cant wait to walk can select to forgo the shipspin view a complete win for everyoneand when you do actually add some content to incarna players will be compelled to exit their ships to experience it even if that involves upgrading their computers 
in 2008s fanfest torfi showed us a playable demo of incarna it had the normal station view and a button that had you leave your shiptheres no reason we cant have that with cq
ideai would propose that ccp allow ml and pl levels to influence their respective lvls on the bpc if invention is successfuli couldnt give an exact formula of how much influence they should have perhaps given a max result it would still be less than a fully researched t2 bpoas for decryptors it could be made that only by using a decryptor can you approach or match a bpo thereby maintaining their current value so as not to nerf explorersreasoning this would still give those with t2 bpos an advantage since invention would still never be able to match a bpo also someone wo a t2 bpo would still need to go through the time and expense of researching a t1 as well as the repeated time and expense of the invention process it also would not flood the market since you cannot just buy a t1 bpo and repeatedly copy it to get these results since research would be required it would become more difficult to simply switch items on a whim this method would maintain the value of owning a bpo but would also allow everyone the opportunity to compete reasonably and fairly in the marketim not a fan of permanent unfair advantages in a video game we are all paying the same 1499 per month so we should all be playing under the same gameplay mechanics or at least close to the same give this proposal
if you increase the marketable value of invention results you would be decreasing the value of a t2 bpo excluding its value as a collectible item
true as long as it was less efficient than you can make with a t2 bpo then the changes to the t2 bpo prices wont crash and theyll still be very profitable at the same time i think providing a platform for competition in game is much better than maintaining the value of legacy bloatedprice moneyprinters that are unavailable personally i like the idea of improving invention especially if it boosts the exploration profession and increases marketplace competition
the problem eve is currently in the age of supercapitals if you have more you win if you have less you lose a fleet subcapitals and normal capitals are unable to counter a fleet of supercapitals on the other hand many people say i workedcheatedscammed hard to get the isk for it so they shouldnt be nerfed i agree in combat they should be monsters as they are now the things i want to change are the cost and logistic background to operate them efficientlythe million dollar question how to do itcurrently a nyx aeon etc has a jumprange of 10ly with good jump skills it takes 6000 isotopes 900m3 to make this jump that costs around 3m isk what is a joke if you consider the 1520b isk real price of these ships lets change this balance a little bit say a 100 times a jump of 10ly should cost about 600000 isotopes 90000m3 thats about 300m isk the fuel bay for supers should be around 100000m3 so after jumping in the supercapital fleet is stranded unless you organize proper logistical background with jumpfreighters in standby for example the corp hangar should have the same size as now 50000m3 so its not making any big differenceeffects  pros supercapital blobs would not be able to get to the other side of the universe in less then 2 hours like nowadays less griefing  killing lonely ratting carriers etc with a dozens of supercapitals would cost a lot more isk than the actual isk damage inflicted in bigger conflicts they could still be used in large numbers to break sovs etc since their combat abilities would be the same as now and usually big alliances have good logistical background but at least they would only use a single nyx to kill a lonely rifter camping a gate not 20 fcs should consider costeffect if someone choose to deploy a fleet of supers after jumping in there is no way to get far until refueled so there could be gfs without retreating from the pewpew at the first sign of trouble would encourage of using supers in smaller scale warfare too since you dont have to be afraid of deploying your few own scs for being ganked almost instantly by a supersuper blob from the other side of the universe titans could bridge more subcaps because of the greater fuel bay happy hour for iceminerscons this proposal wouldnt change the combat abilities of scs but still a lot owner would cry how expensive 300m10ly it became to travel in a 1520b isk ship but i say if you have the isk to buy one you should have the isk to pay maintenance fee too

supported in theorybut how do you propose that logistical support would work unless you allow freighters to directly refill the fuel bay maybe a special jump freighter that can compress the fuel into a more manageable size and can move it into a fuel baywhat would change for titans and rorqualsa normal freighter would be worthless for the logistical role without a titan and a titan might need all of the freighters just to move itself so jump freighters or a new support capital would be needed or hell just buff the rorqualorca for the job give capindies a combat role
1 support but need more nerf like a longer building time because almost every months build 300 sc in the game and reach their numbers over 4000the game went sc online at 00 sec
100x is way over the top 10x is conceivable scarriers arent purchased by people who make more iskhr than other people scarrier pilots simply saved up isk for a longer period of time what this would do is further stratify alliances between the alliances that can throw isk around and those who cant this will have the opposite effect in that big alliances will use them and it will be even more out of reach for the little guys it would decrease the amount of hot drops using supers on ratters but honestly titan bridge in a couple subcaps with webspainters add a few dreads and the ratting carrier will die just the same the only reason people use scarriers to kill ratting carriers is cause thats nearly the only way to get the killmail without the carrier self destructing first
interesting proposal but it still would not address how useless dreads are atm i bring that up because that is part of the supers are too op gripe i also see your idea creating a bigger gap between the top tier power blocks and those that are not this might even cause less conflict in 00 and more power blocks to turtle up because of the cost to attack i can imagine another north power block that blues everyone and does not travel why should they when they are the holders of the only tech moons in the game it would be too expensive for any other power block to cross the map to attack with a big enough force to break the turtle i cant support it anything that causes less conflict is not good to me
maybe 100x is a little too high but i think the op made a point supercarriers are purchased by people who have either more iskhr or more hours and they can save up for fuel costs too i dont think it will change balance between small and big alliances in a wrong direction its already way out of control in fact by reducing the action radius of supers fuel and logistical needs it should encourage smaller factions to deploy the few scs of their owndropping 10 subcaps or regular capitals on a ratter carriers instead of 2 scs is a step forward
its affecting the cost of attacking and defending with supers for low priority targets subcaps and normal caps could be used again as a viable alternative great powerblocks have the financial background to move the scs to the frontline once they have arrived they can be fielded cheaper in the close vincinity 1015lys after this change the distance between solar systems in light years would matter if you already brought your fleet to the target region to break the turtles armor its a real pain in the ass to bring them back home so it will lead to more deadlier conflicts retreat wont be a good option
defending costs a lot less because your not traveling as far this promotes everyone not to travel regular caps even in much larger numbers are not a viable alternative vs super caps which is another advantage to the turtle no on will want to travel when you could be buying more supers with he cost of moving your fleet to the other side of the map just my opinion for what it is worth id much rather see dreads get buffed to bridge the gap than your kind of change
i loled hard thats exactly the reason why this gotry is to be nefred somehow you guys are turning eve into grindfest worst then ever before not only for youselves but effectively for the rest of eve since they have somehow to compete with these sc blobs  and the only way to deal with sc blob is a bigger sc blob 100x looks decent a bit modest for my taste but still it will do
that isnt a grindfest thats just having the patience to wait for something nice rather than run around in drake blobs if we want to talk about overpowered ships for the isk drakes drams cynas and machs need a solid beating with the nerf bat scarriers cost a lot if they cost a lot to move they will turn into the wtfpwn of defensive units then there really wouldnt be a counter to themup side to this is that pl and drf would be eating a huge nerf bat with this change
yeah go tell me youre saving your pennies to get just a nice ship

interestingly increasing the logistics costs of moving supers will significantly alter force projection so i support this however i dont think this will solve the sc problem there are two fundamental problems with scs 1 tackling  you need a bubbler to hold a sc down however the sc has the ability to kill all tacklers quickly and efficiently its not vulnerable to any ship class 2 scalability  scs daisychain into groups of unbreakable turtle hives that spew drone waves that wipe out all subsuper fleet types they break the roshambo of fleet engagements
i could agree with upping the amount of fuel needed to jump im not informed well enough to make a judgement on the numbers however
just take them all their drones except fighter bombers problem solvedif that is too much to do do this insteadpsyes that would include fighters as well as wtfsentryswarmspps 150mUFFFD normal dronebay might be ok maybe but not much more
would making fighterbomber bandwidth separate from drone bandwidth help ie they can launch loads of fightersbombers but only 5 regular dronesthus with bombersfighters theoretically balanced to not wtfpwn all the smaller ships they become more balanced
i totally agree scale is completely wrong ingame when my nyx shows up i often have to zoom into it in large fleets of non supers because as others have pointed out there are bs and carriers which are  almost  the same size when large ships are gathered in close rangeallow me also to point out that tiny ships are allowed to bump what is meant to be a humangous ship
currently the rifters design is too small to accommodate the pod there looks like a bridge where a human pilot would be but compared side by side the pod would breach the hull of the rifterall ships need a scale fix

do you know what noobs ask for the first time when they see schow the  my moa will fit in it shipmaintain bay it it way too smallso i completely agree on this one1
at least it should be viewable for corp hr people who tend to applications makes no sense not to allow to check whether a so called noob has 90 standing with a navy corp
fixedexactly why its a good thing its gone
heres an ideathing to considerfofs have always been designed to seek out an object depending on its standing towards you neutral standings are as good as red on it yes this is agrivating when u have a ton of static structures yes and weve heard a few good ways to change that including my own formflavouri have found in pve once youre aggressd and launch drones they will orbit until youre hit by any sort of ewar be it painters webbers dampeners or ecms they auto aggro the 1st ship doing sofofs could work in this fashion yes some will complain wahh i want it to auto target the falcon seriously not gonna happen ccp can port the auto ewar aggro from drones to fofs and would help a lot in pvp without overpowering it i believeheres another idea fofs are ment to work independently from the ship hence no locking required the fof system it was modelled over has only been designed as a 1 missile against 1 ship scenario how about building from that 1 missile against 1 ship thing to multiple missile against 1 shiphave a system that auto focus fires all blue fofs on the grid to target 1 ship via auto communication between the missiles technically using randomising non blue targetting selectionsso not only using fof for identifying the multiple foes but also the multiple friendly fof missiles and using that as an advantage
these ships can easily be located in much less than 15 min in a familiar system if you care to put in the effortnot supported

for about 13rd the income you get when you run lvl 4 missions in high sec yes useful unprobable mission setups also need a way to run gatecamps get a t3 and look how much dps it does when unprobable covert ops cloak and interdiction nullifier it is pretty close to zeroyou can kill an unprobable mission runner with some luck at a gate you cannot kill him when he moves to high sec because otherwise he has to press a scan button every 10 seconds

yes i very much support this idea i started the day eve was released without any clue as to what i should train made several stupid mistakes which i have done my best to make up for later on 510 skills or so would be great to remap
ah the foot in the door approachno remaps this has been discussed to death and remarkably few players are in favourwhy would you need to remap you can always learn the skill you want to now there is no skill point cap skills do not become harder to train as you get more sp in fact  with expensive implants they get slightly easierthis isnt even a matter of choice since you can easily train multiple skill trees and you can choose more skills at any time its simply a matter of getting the skills you want right nowthere are few wrong choices in skill training as almost every skill has a purpose of some kind and adds to your options or your effectiveness so work with what youve chosen and work towards what you wantcyberus  what skill is it you have that you have decided you wont ever need or use what skill is so important that you must have it immediately
there is no important skills to me atm since im prety good trained for almost all ships and all guns in game 101 m sp atm on subcapital shipsif you realy want to know wich skills i willcould trade of for some sp well ther is actualy no so much at all some mining and related ships to itit is even not so big amount at all but as you know by you self mining profession since the 2003 become utely useless and to players even with 6 months or 1 year training is simply not usefull skill anymore simply because any other activity in the game can and will generate you better income then sucking rocks in beltsi have even some production skills as well but it is not my main activity with this acount but i wont trade for sp this skills because i use from time to time those so that makes then usefull even if i realy use it once at 36 months but it is simply nothing to be compared with mining skills and anything related to itblame ccp or blame those botmacro alliances who made those skills complete waste of sp invested in to itwhile lots says mistakeble skills training they are wrong there is few to none mistakable skills  like core skills or frigatcruiser hulls  those are needet skills for advanced versions hulls so those are not mistake thats why i cross trained all hulls and weapons in game and can switch to any subcap ship or weapon and always glad i have trained those but some of the other skills its just useless nothing more  atleast they become useless 
this idea got messed up at the point someone thought caldari should be long rangecurrent system is just fine ammunition and ship bonuses need reworking most of ammo types are useless crap and caldari ships are still useless even with slight boost coz their damage just sucks instead of thinking that caldari  long range gallente  short range we should have shield tank hybrid ships and armor tank hybrid shipsalso artillery needs nerfbat back to 2007 like logistics
current system is not fine artillery is finepersonally i love the ops idea and i go one further by suggesting that they kill off all drones to eliminate 50 of all lag and reduce the use of missiles on caldari ships to eliminate 30 of the lag that remains
just give caldari projectiles thatll make me happy 
this just in covert bombers have no tank and are easily vollied by most ratting ships
perhaps concord is the solution im sure there exists a game mechanic wherein concord can come into a system and prevent or at least punish unwanted pvp the speed and degree of punishment would vary on some sort of security scale each system would be ranked on this scale from 10 to 10 if for example youre pveing in a 10 system and an afk cloaker decloaks and touches you in a bad place concord would swoop in to punish the transgressor if on the other hand you live in say 04 security space concord wouldnt respond but the stations and gates could be fitted with protective gunsof course anyone in 00 to 10 space is obviously skilled enough to either rat in a pvp ship or know how to organize a corp for mutual defence if such a system is ever implemented you would just need to go to one of the higher security systems and pve to your hearts content
we put forth a ton of effort to claim and build our systems it should not have to be a nonstop effort to actually enjoy it moron
then you should make sure to have proper defence fleets assembled to protect the interest of your precious systems while you profit from them i dont see how that makes me a moron if you cant manage thatso no one is allowed to enter your systems please petition me if i happen to do so i doubt anyone will listen to you
like i said you demand that the 00 locals be vigilant 247 you demand that they have fleets on standby 247 you demand that unconsensual pvp be brought to them you demand that their ratters and miners be exposed to risk the same rules should apply to afk cloakers at the moment they dont if you want to subvert local 237 months on end feel free to do it but do it at the keyboard just as you would expect a miner or a ratter to be at the keyboard to do their jobs i really dont have a problem with you cloaking in a system for hours and days i have a problem with you being able to do it while sleeping or at the pizza parlor and yes right now youre allowed to do it just as im allowed to raise my concerns about this issueafk cloakers seem to be the most riskadverse out of this whole situation they simply do not want any type of risk presented to them not in any form and not in any degree suggestions like this one have been proposed that specifically target afk and inattentive cloakers allowing even the most crappy of cloaker to continue to do his job and you still squeal like pigs at the suggestion that ccp add a little risk to youyou accuse us of being botters or you play on the literal definition of afk cloaking to some how save you or you resot to calling those that agree to adding risk to afk cloakers cowards when in fact you are the cowards i am not advocating the removal of risk i am asking that risk is brought to you but you see you dont want risk its funny that you tell others to go back to hi sec for not wanting to be exposed to risk when you yourself tremble at the thought of risk being added to youmany of you support the removal of local because it works in wormhole space but as is typical with your arguments you fail to mention that wormhole space has difficult entry points that counter the removal of local and in favor of the residents you fail to mention this in your arguments because as always you just want the game mechanics to benefit you and screw your enemies you dont seem to be capable of playing fair and be able to win like i said you are the most riskadverse players in the game the ones that resort to calling others carebears for the same exact reasons you yourself are guilty of
simple question yet again can you prove people to be afk its a serious accusation to make claiming people to be afk esspecially if you cant prove it please stop this ranting or go live in high sec space if you cant handle it that space is for guys like you that dont want riscs involved in your gameplay off you go
heres the thing murkelostnormally humans require sleep to function properly when a character that is supposed to be controlled by a human is logged in for 237 week after week month after month even i think it is safe to assume that this human may not be at the keyboard at least part of the time ive read your previous responses and quite frankly it seems this will be difficult for you to understand so i wont waste our times any further im afraid youll first need to understand some basic concepts on how the human body functions to understand why a player cannot be logged in 237 so i wont be able to help you much 
its ok i dont need your help thanx though
i havent demanded anything i simply state the fact that local is at the root of this that remains the truth no matter what you say your reliance upon locals instant intel is being messed withwhich is an emotional feeling youre allowed to convey doesnt alter the fact that local is at the root of it and people pay for their account so can do whatever they want within the rulesagain youre allowed to convey any emotional response the facts remainothers may have accused you of those things i simply dont want your all seeing eye given more power than it already hasbut there are certain areas of null sec renowned for botting you cant deny that whining increases when those areas are focused on its only human nature that some will make the link and post their thoughtsive stated many times the differences and have only noted that afk cloaking is pointless there due to the lack of local i also have said numerous times i prefer the status quoi have also always said that local cannot be replaced unless a suitable replacement package is found so far ccp have not been able to find that packagei cannot remember the last time i called someone a carebeari can see your emotions are taking over but at least be honest in your replies
you should really stop thinking every post is directed at youalso local is not broken it is a huge part of what makes the game playable for the average player they took local out of wh space and in order to make it appealing to the general public they made several other changes that allowed residents the upper hand and limit the possibility of posing any real threat to themin 00 in order to gain intel from local you must also present intel to other its a balanced system the only thing that local does is stop people from actually sneaking into a system without the knowledge of the others in system if thats what you want to do sneak around without others knowing your there then find a worm hole
bump becouse im being ignored
cry less
be less idiot im not crying but you are spamming
i think a fine tweak will come as they said like advisory division with 50 killing missions suddenly became distribution this means corps like starter npcs dont have any security agent missions anymoresoe are some kind of special i think it would made sense to establish a lvl 4 agent in each faction area for high sec and low sec hub areas would tend to negate the effect of creating less traffic therefore a remote area would be sensible
i read that devblog twice looking for the part where the intent was allowing people to live where they want i coulnt find it i dont think ccp cares where you want to live theres still a lv 4 agent in gicodel if you want to live there break out your hauler if you want to shoot stuff move to caldari space i too would like a lv 4 combat agent right next to a quiet trade hub where i can overcharge for crap loot and drops oh wait
support this thread if you are amarramarr or caldariachura or something else and you were robbed of your 2 useful attribute points by ccp who then put those 2 points into charisma turning your 3 charisma into 5 ccp you now have 24 hours to give us our 3 charisma back and put 2 attribute points back where they were before the nerf if our demands are not met 50 hamsters will be fed to pythons every hour after the deadline
everybody is free to keep charisma at 3 points just dont use neural remap and thats it
thank god someone is willing to diminish the hamster spawn thanks for doing the dirty work
i am all for afking in an unprobable ship it may take me a few hours but i will find you eventually unprobable ships are a perfect example of what i think cloaking should resemble you can warp to a safe in an unprobable ship and be safe for a good bit of time but plain and simple you still can be found given enough time and effort if you could be found while cloaked in the way that you can be found in an unprobable ship i would not have any issue with cloaking
let me get this clear you spend hours looking for someone that could be unprobable off dscan and at a deep safe no one actually knows they arent cloaked up but in the chance that theyre simply hanging about in an unprobable ship means you would take that time outno wonder your upset with afking you must spend all your day looking for them whenever someone enters your system for any length of timelaughter aside it still relies upon local to have an effect but at least you acknowledge that now
i agreeor the module shoud be monocicle
seconding that the solution to afk cloaking is to remove local and as i pointed out in that thread
a few dscans would be able to tell you that they were in an unprobable ship and the point is that an unprobable ship is a serious pain to find but it can be found eventually if the player has walked away a cloaked ship on the other hand can not ever ever ever ever ever be foundit doesnt matter if removing local would make it less common for people to afk cloak its that fact that you can afk cloak that is the issue cloaking should have some limiting factor to its invulnerability besides downtime preferable one controlled by other players
but without local a cloaked ship afk is totally powerles they cant gather intel and because you cant see them they cant stop you from ratting without actually uncloaking to stop you from ratting in fact its functionally no different to logging off which btw i can do in a noncloaky ship without local and have the same effect should i not be able to do thatyouve already said that you dont want to penalise people who cloak but arent afk so youd be happy for a chap to sit 10km off you with no local cloaked whilst you ran your anomaly waiting for the right moment to pounce on you  even if it took 3040 mins for arguments sake but not for him to be chilling somewhere in system theyre functionally the same thing unless of course you actually do want to penalise people who cloak
well i was talking with my mates and we were thinking why not put a rider on the insurance that covers the modals like pay this much extra isk to insure for more if you take a modal off your ship the rider is voidnot to mention the current standard insurance doesnt pay for the ship with full coverage anyway just the ship the insurance needs to be overhauled and i understand a flat insurance is easy on the servers but it would be nice if it changed based on market costs so people dont abuse the system againi bring this to you because it is not worth insuring ships at all in eve
in the not too distant past platinum insurance paid out 100 of the value of the hull and the cost of buying the insurance it was nerfed because it made suicide ganking absurdly easy and everyone was getting a little too rich thus they made it so it only pays around 50 of the hull value after including the cost of itnot supported
insurance isnt meant to cover the cost of your ship let alone the cost of the modules you have fitted if it covered everything losing ships wouldnt mean anything the system is already dynamic and is changed based on market cost of the materials used to build the ship and it is done exactly to make sure it will never cover the cost of your ship mainly in order to prevent insurance fraudits also always worth it to insure your ships in eve if you are certain that you will lose it during the insurance period its just that the insurance system isnt designed to fully cover ship losses and the varying pay levels allow players to better manage their risks in the game by providing them a way to cover varying levels of the loss based mainly on ship tech levelnot supported
insurance wasnt nerfed because of suicide ganking which is supported and inteded but because some industrialists were building tens of thousands of tier 3 bs purely to selfdestruct them for the insurance
thatto avoid suicide ganking you would need the aggressor to pay for your loss  best in time effort though the time effort is vastly in favour of suicide ganking the game mechanic itself is part of the game and wont be removed but it could do with a balancing tweak that your standing repair is heavier and need more timeabout the insurances as they are now its useless and you can get rid of it straight away to be worth something the insuring period must be 6 month or more for the low pay out in the case of destruction
let me explain it in simple terms  if its a pve ship and youre not an idiot  dont insure it it shouldnt get blown up often enough to be worth itif its a pvp ship  insure it if it lasts for longer than 12 weeks then you are pvping wrong
dump insurance entirely no insurance company would insure a starship
insurance should at least account for the prices of faction vessels which it currently does not
simple idea easy to implement we already have secure containers with logs but so missed featurecorporation hangars logs all corporation hangars include station offices and ship maintenance arrays should have simple logs like secure containers viewable by directors and auditors we all know that ccp encourage thievery and scammers but please give ceo at least one simple instrument to monitor corporation activity

wait you can find cloaked ships hiding in a random spot in space make trolls less obvious broand why should i go to high sec i am not the one advocating that you need an option to be risk free in 00 space still also i dont see how this has any relation to botting well at least it doesnt have more than a proposal to remove all npc rats and asteroids to combat botters
1 u can find cloaked ships when they jump in they dont magically appear out of thin air2 see 1 and its still more risk than any nullbear who runs and docks the instant a neutral appears nothing more carebearish and riskfree than someone being protected still running and hiding just because his protection will never be concordlevel so yes feel free to go back to high sec cause ure the one who brought up removing rats and asteroids in the first place
good luck catching anything with cov ops cloak in low sec or hi sec not overpowered not even dragging cov ops cloak  nullifier combo here wait i just didno one should give a poopoo about cloaking bombers and macros theyre much less issue
i find it funny how the same people that hide in empire also complain about what protects them when it is used against them
if they engage you are able to kill them no well it might be harder for you it seemsyou should always be ready to fight there are many tactics you can use to catch cov op type ships but i am not here to teach you that you wanna talk about trolling when you are off topic talking about removing npcs and asteroids really oh yeah remove local from 00

have you ever flown ecmshipyou already have to wisely pick fiting so i do not understand what you are trying to do here
the likelihood of getting an offrace ecm jam on someone is extremely low this proposal really wouldnt change anything in the game
ill probably be using this as a copypaste to other ecm whinesif youre nerfing ecm suggest a buff to ecm ships in general they sacrifice everything to for their ewar capability and what we dont need is another half dozen broken ships
id rather see the other forms of ewar boosted to be honest
agreed
since this is not a nerf to ecm what  boost to racial and multispectral strength are you proposing to counterbalance the reduction of offracial ecm strength to zero 10 25
bump because i just spent 30 minutes arguing with people in fw
we both just didwas this pic posted b4
supported  cuz i just listened to your argueing p

to calm the fears of all those terrorized by seeing an afk cloaker in system lets implement the change ccp said they were going to do so long ago and change nullsec local to delayed mode wh corps have been living with this for a long while now and make money just fine as far as i can see so if nullsec residents are as good as wh corps then it should be no problem for them to do the same
what you cant see you cant fear i approve of thisatleast it would cease the neverending rant on the forums as well
there are many differences when trying to compare the wspace to null to make delayed local viablenull has a defined map and its easy to get around there are no special skills needed to find your way around stargates are on overview asteroid belts are readily visible sanctums and havens are now able to be found in 30 seconds at 64 au making isk in wspace requires scanning skills you have the ability to control access to the system and people cant find you on a map and know the route to find you day and night in null the way to make isk is easy to find on the overview the stargates have no mass limitations lifetime or instant nerfing local in null to match wspace is just not as practical with the ease of finding people at isk making activities and navigating around null
in wspace all of the sleeper anomalies are found just as easily as in nullspace so your argument is invalid on that front in fact its even more invalid because it is not possible to just wander around in a carrier grinding anoms solo whilst semiafk  even before the risk of being jumped by people you cant seein all respects then it sounds as if youre saying i should get special dispensation over and above people who live in a more hostile environment than me
foolish what have you done tdrs in hydra  tsk tsk the bleaks are not the same without the daily foolish blob big difference is the permanent gates in normal space if wspace local rules were applied with no further changes made the roam would become insanely powerful and nigh unstoppablewill need to make the delay a fixed number of seconds ex 15s before appearing or figure out another way of scanning to avoid the urge to scanspam that a blank local tend to induce ex ability to filter scan by standings  think iff beacons
ive supported it before and ill support it again
alas i follow my ceo where he leads mainly because it leads to alcohol fun pew and more alcohol and in any case my rl commitments had basically banished the daily foolish roam to a fond memory ot  were ratters to not change their behaviour at all then id be inclined to agree with your assertion but consider this  if one was in a gatecamp would one simply have the whole fleet on one side of the gate with no eyes on the other side to see what was about to come through also lets say youre ratting in a system with 45 other people all in space why arent you all chatting drinking and generally interacting with each other why arent you in a fleet with the same number of ships but those ships being fit for pvp with logistic support why wouldnt you invite new alliance members to do the looting and salvaging once youve cleared each site happy in the knowledge that theyre protected and that therell be meta mods and salvage for rigs for you to buy on your local markets without having to do the hauling from jita and supporting your newer players at the same time why in an alliance of thousands would you ever be alonethis change will basicallycurtail bottingstop afk cloakers from stopping you ratting because theyd have to not be afk to actually stop you rattingencourage people to work together for fun and profitboost viability of roaming gangs whilst making them work to ensure that theyre not walking into a massive trap
ebay does a great job of weeding out scammers by allowing buyers to rate the sellers after the purchase and gives them a rating for it buyers can then choose to only buy from the top rated sellerswe should have the same in eve contracts
you could just move to a system further from lowsec which would also reduce your decline rate
well you have several claims first the pos one railguns on a moros for example have 00012 tracking while 1000 sig radius so against a pos 6000 sig radius they have 00072 tracking multiply that against 30km shield radius and you got 0216 so 0216kms216ms you can move in order for it to have 50 hit chance speedtracking speed with 10ms you are so enormously below that it isnt any problem the supercap at 15km you not gonna like it but i am just going to use eft since it does the calculations correctly rail moros vs nyx rail moros has 4431 eft dps at 15km against a nyx moving at full transversal which is impossible against a larger dread fleet your dps is lowered to 3911 so you still do 89 of your max dps i dont call that speed tankingnow a bs can indeed speed tank a dread also when it has lower tracking penalty if it is close enough to the dread however if you want to lower the penalty from something like 90 to 2025 they will virtually have the tracking of titans titans are used against bs so then a dread can also hit that bs granted it has some other downsides also a bs can be webbed down and painted making it easier to track
i ran those numbers too and got the same results you have to go under 10 km before theres an appreciable problem cruise phoenix had no problem at any range or speed although i doubt that youll be impressed by advice to use capital missiles torp phoenix 83 damagedreads are so well balanced because theyre so ineffective against subcapitals if there is a problem with them tracking supercaps the answer surely lies in changes to supercap speed and sig rather than dread tracking
cant believe i missed initial post 
in low sec or null sec if you engage you cannot dock for a period of time this is so people can gather a fleet and  you in returnwhy the hell can war targets engage and when they feel they cant win dock up again so take the orphanage for example theyre supposed to big and bad war deccing every null sec alliance but if they had the same rules as we did and they couldnt dock after engaging would it be the same story no they would be totally d what i want to understand is why is the game mechanics different in high sec from lownull ccp want more fighting well have the same mechanics all round then that way us null sec alliances can come and  them in return like we would in null
i always found it very stupid to see combat in front of a station its like a fight in front of a police station anyway make it harder for the chickens sure why not
the aggression mechanic is the same in high sec as well are you referring to neutral remote repair and other remote devices
you are not really supporting a change the op doesnt want to stop station mechanics just change them to work the same in hi sec as they do in lo or nullthe catch is that the aggro mechanics that allow and disallow docking are the same in all three sec lvls so really this doesnt actually change anything
no it isnt because the eve online source code keeps being leaked so bots are likely being built to interface directly with the code
is there a chance the csm could ask how the source code keeps being leaked tends to make it difficult to hunt down botters and exploiters if they have access to your source code is ccp doing something to try to prevent leaks like this this isnt the first time it has been known to have been leaked
i believe it is actually a secret plan to harness the power of open source development without the nasty sideeffect of infecting other peoples code with the gpl virus
bangs head against wall losing a ship is not an economic isk sink it is a material sink how hard is that to understandeven if all isk payout would be removed losing a ship would still be iskneutral
even if the guns can hit bs rats the locking time still makes almost any other ship more effectivegive dreads some extra utility highslots that way they can nosneutsmartbombalong with this give them the ability to fit ganglinks as all of the other combat capitals are able to fit themmaybe give them a small corp hanger
sigh so sad to see ccp turning into the type of large corp that i coach back into sanity in my work i see this all the time large projects programs or what have you dont know how to scale up the interleaving of smaller things like what is asked for in this thread and the large shiny things is one of those things that companies just dont getfirst problem is that they start doing resource management theres project a b c d and the maintenance queue and then they get resourced so all the people in teams get assigned all over the place their time is literally shattered in a million pieces and teams productivity and quality is shattered as well the answer is that the teams should be stable and all those projects should be chopped up into their respective pieces and fed to stable teams in stable queues this works magici know ccp uses the scrum process i trained some of their people but ive only seen them put up a job opening for a scrum master which is not the tough job thats failing here
1 more and varied pos roles2 better pos gunning interface and allow alliance members to pos gun3 some add ons  to poses to make them more varied in role  for example siege  active mod that uses fuel and increases pos defence and offence by 50   miner  adds 10 to moon yield  lowers defences by 30    reactor  50 to cpu  4 faster anchoring
there is this skill called anchoring which is a complete waste of time to train bc it does basically next to nothingthere is an outcry from the eve population and myself included that poses need to be quicker to set up and taken downhold on to your pants theyre about to drop change the anchoring skill to allow the anchoring of an additional module per lvl of the skill up to 3 number of max mods can be changed from 52 and introduce a new skill that decreases the anchoringunanchoring time by 5 per lvl ability to set pos specific rolesability to name pos modulesability to name individual corp hangar tabsintroduction of ship main tabssimplified moon goo setup combine harvester with silos and coupling arrays etcintroduce the fuel pellet as a seeded bpo nonresearchable makes it optional usechange fuel bays to last 1 month instead of 20days
one issue i see driving a lot of new players off is summed up in this videothere is nothing stopping experienced established players beating up on new players and little incentive for those experienced players to help the new playersthis is a pvp focused game and new players need to be able to fly alongside experienced players to be able to pick up the skills player skills not character skills to be able to cope in the harsh world that is evesome people can repeatedly take a beating and get up again having learned from the experience and will be a better player for it those people are rare though and many people getting that experience will move on to somewhere else ie another gameernest adams told me that he doesnt play eve for the same reason he doesnt holiday in somalia and that has stuck with me if youre a hardened warrior then a holiday in somalia might be quite enjoyable but for the rest most of the population the thought isnt so pleasant
this really needs to be done
ccp what have you been doing all this time
please add some quality readable fonts as an option to the ui the present font is very hard to read at timesto me this is the single most important feature you can add to the ui at this time
making spaceshipswait making avatars for spaceship pilots
supported i spent alot of time trying to make the most me look i could when i started playing eve so i knew id be happy with it compared to the other options now with the new creator the toon i really want to make is only possible with a different racebloodline eats me up every time i log on
no wayfugly achuras should remain ugly forever accept your disgrace
that i would be in favor of there are a lot of us that have perfectly capable machines that do not have the massive bandwidth that incarna seems to be designed for and many more of us that dont have any interest in this walking around in stations stuff at all there is no reason this stuff should be crammed down our throats
personally i have no problem with incarna and i happen to think all the people ing about it are sad strange little people who seriously need to get out morethat said there is no reason for the cq not to be optional other than to pad the uptake metrics sosupported
please for the love all things internet spaceship related make cq optional
er actually for all games and most mmos system requirements generally dont change with time and at least they dont change for effectively meaningless patches
1simplewe were promised incarna would be optional and that promise needs to be kept for all aspects of it ccp needs to establish some credibility for the good of the game its long overdue
supporting not for computer reasons but because i dont want to use incarna and i hate forced stuff
i like what we have seen on duality and am looking forward to spin my character instead of my ship whenever i spend more than a few minutes docked most of the time i only dock to load some cargo get the next mission or do a quick refit though in those situations the cq will be a major immersion breaker
yes optional please
i support the topicscrew you ccp if you  us up making it nonoptionnalthis was the deal when you first announced all this crap walking stufflots of players dont give a damn about having a sims in eve i play eve for adrenalin for excitation of fights not to see my character in 3dyou were drunk once or get a lead designer completely stupid who convinced you guys to make a simslike feature that would take 3 years of development ok dont worry youll pay it in the end but dont make it nonoptionnal as there are still lots of people who dont wanna have anything to do with that crapso please for this games sakes make it optionnali dont wanna have some more lag some more loading just because you were drunk and made the worst decision ever about game designmake it optionnal as it doesnt bring anything to the game
log into duality on a machine with less than 512mb of graphics ram and note that even on low detail settings it takes minutes to get to the point that you can actually click those omnipresent buttonsover to you
what does that make the people ing about the people ing about cq
signed simply so that the dinosaurs who cant handle progress will shut up about it
i wasnt aware they had removed the option to have it optional no reason it shouldnt be except to force players to use it or make it an immersive experience for new players by placing them in that environment first with no optionso make it optional to not use cq by pushing a button that says no like so q enter cq a nopersonally im not going to use it until it has somethinbg t o back it up and give it purpose try it out sure once in awhile to make sure it still works why not but stand in my cq everytime i dock or whenever im docked not likely
can we also make suicide ganking optional a lot of folk dont want itcan we make pvp optional too i sure hate when i get pvpdalso please make undocking optional ship spinning is great fun and cq seems to be messing that up ive not seen any demos showing that ship spinning is still possible on the hologram or in the hangaroh waitit wouldnt be an equal environment for everyone if those things were optional same goes with incarna not supported
actually its significantly different this is more like being able to disable the intro video at every log in because not everyone wants to watch the pretty cutscene every time they log in
undocking is optional ever heard of station tradingyou have a choice of whether or not you do certain things in eve like missioning or mining atm incarna has no content ifwhen it gains content that people want to use people can choose whether or not to take part in it whether we automatically appear in cq or not ccp cant make people use incarna all they can do is make people load it making it optional hurts noone and does nothing to make eve unequal
supported for sure theres no good reason for this not to be optional those saying it makes more work for ccp seem to be ignoring that this has already been implemented in the earlier version shown then removed for whatever reasonsimple checkbox for preference somewhere in esc settings and button to load from current hangar simple easy and everyones happy
if your system is that poor which mine is come to think of it then simply tell windows not to allow access to the cq texture file which is not an eula breach you are not doing anything to any part of eve windows is simply preventing part of it from graphically loading
for reference purposes these are my specsi get about 5 fps on lowest settings on duality with theseintelUFFFD core i5650 processor2 32ghz 8192mb ddr3 dualchannel 1333mhz memorynvidiaUFFFD geforceUFFFD g310 graphics card 512mb
my tower which i tend not to use has lower settings then that and i get 1824 fps are you running tranq at the same timeof course it seems that most of the textures used to not load an update must have been recent because now it even works on my laptop
nope nothing at all but cq shrug runs 5 clients of tq with no problems too thanks for the info tho maybe my graphics card just doesnt like cq
tbh the only real reason that i can see why ccp have made it so currently we will be forced to leave our ships is because lets be honest after 2 minutes in cq very few are going to bother looking at it again its not like there is really any content
i like spinning my ship
i would like to have the option to load incarna or notwhen the incursion patch came out my pc could not load eve anymore because it does not support sse2 before the patch it could ran 2 accounts easily it still works with other stuff i also read the forums and read how most people were ranting those who could not afford to upgrade their pc which im one of them  ccp stated this sse2 would affect only 003 of the playerbaseso now i was forced to use the laptop although it has issues when i do character creation with eve online in low settings im able to run 1 account only i need to shut one account to acces the other now with this incarna coming up my laptop will not be able to load it so after nearly 7 years playing eve not the 21st of may but 21st of june will be sragirs judgement day and to those who always have their smart opinionsno i have no ing magic tree in my backyard where fallen leaves turn into shiny 10000 banknotes
but ccp hates gallente so itll never get implemented
honestly simply leaving things imbalanced and broken with the hopes that a mechanic change like this would make supercaps too obnoxious to use seems like a bad idea this fix is like smearing crap on a public restroom stall thats out of order it doesnt fix anything just discourages the use of whats brokensupercaps would still be imbalanceduncounterable and even more expensive doesnt really fix that
yeapbut looks like the saturation point in this respect hasnt been achieved yetgiven weve known ccp for ages i doubt they will bother fixing anything untill each one of the playerbase owns at least one supercapthis ization within masses will eventually result in everyone saving up for a supercap which he surely can not afford to lose if anything this breaks the basic eve rule  do not fly something you cant afford to lose so at the end of the day any pvp will cease and 18 months from there ccp might actually say something in this regard
waves handthis is not the super capital nerf you are looking for move along
wow  i really like that analogy
the op has a nice idea but i think you guys are missing out on a massive opportunity here large quantities of normal isotopes are one thing but thats bland and not very interestingsuppose instead that supercapitals required a special highly refined form of fuel  perhaps a mixture of their normal fare and a touch of liquid ozone and heavy water make it a reaction thingnow youve got to protect your pos infrastructure for both constructing and maintaining your supercapital fleet i think thats a nice touch
make fbs either unable to attack anything but other supers and structures or tweak the mechanics so that its useless to use fbs on normal caps and lower id like to dust off my dread one of these years
did i just read a good idea on the assembly hallsigned for awesomeness
pretty much this you arent fixing anything with your proposals youre ignoring the imbalances and just trying to increase the cost of acheiving it or put in limits so the damage they do is somewhat contained they just need to be rebalanced and that is it and that might very well mean nerfing their capabilities in battlethere are many ways to rebalance them though but it needs to be done in some form increasing costs doesnt solve anything though it just limits the use to fewer people and delays the inevitable proliferation a cost based solely on movement is even worse since it still leaves them as overpowered defence assets while nerfing using them aggressively that means less supers destroyed while being forced to rely more on nonsupercap fleets to attack supercap defended systems when your complaint is that you need a supercap fleet to engage a supercap fleet this isnt going to end wellthere are two basic way you can go about the rebalance either seriously bring down the capabilities of supercaps or create realistic and practical vulnerabilities for them even when they operate as a group im hoping ccp goes more the way of creating weaknesses for them but they will have to get nerfed and made more vulnerable to nonsupercap fleets
interesting idea but for alliances that make billions in moon gold this will have no effect on their pockets  why cant ppl realise that
i have always thought that turning jump machanics on its head and only allow jumps to super caps by non caps would work better maybe with a larger range so more people get in on a fight but the total dps on the field does not climb as fast if you included it with your idea then moving a super cap is a stratigic decision but allows the rest of the players to still get good fights
this pretty much i do think the idea has some merit but only as part of a larger package since this does not actually fix that scs are simply overpowered in combat
can a dev comment if this is in the littlethings team or works in general im hoping so since turrets are seeing an update but there hasnt been a peep on how missiles will be updated
plus one for da goons idea
any race really none of the tech 1 ships have any significant differences in technology so the comparative cost and ability imbalances make little sensein theory yes but in actuality all tiers do is arbitrarily gimp stats and entire lines of shipsit almost seems like tech 1 ships were prenerfed for tiering reasons so that tech 2 ships can be that much more powerful in direct comparisonto be fair lasers are the most damaging weapons with no ships bonus appliedprecisely the goal of tiericidesee above
not really between the better fitting of autocannons allowing for more tank dmg selection and being completely capless without a combet bonus they are just better cap use is a terrible bonus for these ships it gets completely ignored for fitting capless weapons there should be an incentive to fit them if people want the better fitting capless ones they can still use them but if they want a weapons bonus that will help them in combat then fit lasers a cap bonus without a weapons bonus is just sadit wouldnt overpower the ship hams have the same range as pulse and heavies longer range then beams so the prophecy wouldnt be any more powerful then the drake the maller would still have no frig defense and the punisher would have to give up tank to fit them i think a dmg bonus along with teiracide would be a good thing to get lasers to be used on these shipsthat wasnt really a question to be answered more of a statementof support
you need to be careful of the balance between ship classes as well as between ships in a class im thinking specifically of the balance between cruisers and battlecruisers here as well as between battlecruisers and the awful closerange hacs that noone flies deimos and sacrilege
sorry i just had to
i actually saw someone flying a deimos a few days ago but when i killed it despite their falcon evekill refused to accept the mail saying that it was malformed maybe i should have edited the ship type to diemost battleclinic being more oldfashioned was happy to accept the mail with this museumpiece on though
i know that
hiding agent standings makes sensecorp and faction standings are necessary for all kinds of things as already mentionedas for the gms reasoning for removing all standings  yes assuming agent standings are hidden you can still find out which npc corps a player does missions for but that will cover a large area even more so now that all agents quality are the same
annoying as hell and you cant even kill themwe do the work by finding the targets and shooting them allow us lets us get the loot rewards as wellat least give them aggression and docking timer so we can shoot them being allowed to insta dock is stupid
dont let the door hit you on the way out
yes this is a pain
a thief is a thief no matter how he dressesif someone steals he should be punishedin real life and in gamei sayno docking for 1 hourno targeting skills for 1 hourno use of stargates for 1 hourallow not only you but also your corp and alliance instant attack for just touching your wreck or can but not to pod him let him sit there for 1 hour lol and timer should only work when in game 
honestly i cant argue with the logic here ninja lotting is a profession in eve sure but so is missioning if you cant disrupt their profession how come they can yours its not like the mission pay out or bounty is worth it the real loot reward has always been the salvage and the guys getting it dont actually have to do anything to earn iti say remove aggression mechanics entirely straight across highsec low and null no concord no station and gate guns and nothing else let us sort it out because concord is seriously incompetenthonestly if eve is going to be 100 pvp focused then they might as well remove all that nonsense that gets in the wayanyone who wants to make a thread on removing aggression mechanics and going all out pvp can just quote me ill add my support later
um yes you can shoot em if they loot you can shootif you dont want to because you think they will come back and kill you in a bigger ship well that is your own problem
no the issue is you cant shoot them when they can insta dock they should get docking timer
wait your talking about kills outside stationstop playing station games you fool then they cant instadockanyway a lot of ninja looters wont dock unless locked so they are quite easy to kill1 have a friend in a mwd bs bump them out of station range generally wont warp away because they think its just someone toying with them though this is optional2 fit a passive targeter3 blow the stuffing out of them
so ill stop killing people at stations just so ninja looters can get my loot  stop posting foolwhich game are you playing all ninja looters who are not stupid insta dockquite simply a docking timer should be in place  tell me whats the point of having aggression if you can instantly dock ehi mean everyone else who gets agression cant insta dock so why can ninja looters it needs to be sorted simpleand the people disagreeing with this must be the ninja looters themselves
sounds reasonablewhile they are at it ccp should do something to ruin station games permanently
lol suicide ganker whines about station humping theif stealing the loot first
dude at least get you facts right if your gonna troll if you must know its empire wars  sorry buts if everyone who gets agression cant dock then neither should ninja looters  its simple  unless you can come up with a good argument against then stop trolling
well since salvage is just thatsalvage and it isnt yours to claim even if you killed the ship i guess there isnt a problem ccp has said on many several occaisions that salvage is not the property of the person who killed the shipend of discussionohand the op is full of failjust like its writer apparently
the game is becoming completely risk free pvp  neut rrs reallypersonally i think allowing any ship to remote rep is stupid and should be left to specialist ships but mehso back to neut rr  either give them gcc or make it that only corpallainces members can rep each otherthis is just stupid  sorry
the intel benefit is not equal for both parties as soon as you see local go up you can be getting yourself to safety in much less time than you could ever be found and locked down its not that i think you should have no means of knowing when someone comes into the system i just think that there should be some risk to every action you take in eve as it is right now someone ratting in a system is at absolutely no risk there should be at least enough risk to discourage not having scouts or joining a fleet whilst ratting right now there are no possible consequences for a player who wants to rat by himself without getting shotratting should have some way of knowing when hostile gangs are coming preferably one controlled by other playerswait this sounds familiarah im so glad to see that you agree with me i can expect your support on my thread then
except the fact that that made no sense what so ever ratting is a relatively safe activity true but it is far from riskless it take what 45 seconds to scan down a carrier another 15 to warp to them a 1 min lapse in attention and you are locked down thats a far cry from the complete invulnerability of a cloaked ship
if the carrier was belt ratting then i might just agree with that timing if its in an anomaly then you have to at least double that but you dont have to rat in a carrierlets say im holding a cookie that i know has poison in it but i dont know how much so it could either do nothing make me ill or kill me if i choose to eat the cookie then i dont get to say that holding the cookie is inherently risky because i have chosen to accept the risk of death in favour of the reward of cookie tastiness in the same way if you choose to run anomalies in one of the slowest and biggest ships in the game then you choose to accept increased risk for increased reward but that doesnt make ratting inherently riskyand lets not forget what you just said hereratting in unsafe spacein a carrieris relatively safein a carrierthe most risky way of ratting in the most unsafe of environments is still basically safeanyone who thinks thats a reasonable statement had better get used to wearing their underpants on their heads sticking pencils up their noses and saying wibble because theyve clearly gone quite madso given that were agreed that ratting in nullsec is inherently 100 safe if one takes reasonable steps to mitigate risk for decreased reward lets see how the two behaviours stack up in comparisonafk cloaking with localdoesnt make moneydoesnt give inteldoesnt give killsscares ratters into hiding so they cant make moneyhas no riskratting with localmakes moneygives intelhas no riskclearly ratting with local gives the most reward for no risknow lets see what happens if we remove localafk cloaking without localdoesnt make moneydoesnt give inteldoesnt give killsdoesnt stop ratters rattingfunctionally identical to logging off100 waste of timeafk cloaking problem solvednonafk cloakingno change to cloaking behaviour for active pilotsgreat successratting without localcant use botsnot risk freeencourages cooperationrisk free ratting problem solvedbotting problem solvedso im happy because you have risk in ratting and youre happy because afk cloakers cant stop you making isk everyone is happy
now you told the truf you not going for pvp but jsut for kiling ratters that not pvp ratter even dont have achence agens pvp ship to difrent setups that caled cheap killing and ganking
and i keep telling you that its fine if you want to subvert local and i keep telling you im ok with you making local inaccurate intel and i keep telling you my problem is with you being able to do these things while you can go to sleep without risk to you if ccp were to change the mechanics so that you could still do those things but now you had to work together as a team with your friends taking turns to disrupt local the rules that you expect should apply to your targets now also apply to you but that isnt what you want and that sir is the truthwhich doesnt alter the fact that afk cloakers are in 00 executing their professions riskfree saying that these are just feelings isnt making them not true i guess this is your new defense im arguing that all professions in 00 should be exposed to risk and your response is that this is an emotional response this actually proves that you know you cant defend your position on this issueokbecause its human nature doesnt make it right and it doesnt make it a valid point afk cloakers are still without risk saying that keeping afk cloaking is good because it gets rid of bots is quite naive and ignorant there is absolutely no consideration made on how it affects everyone else thats because the arguments ive seen from your camp mostly ebenfit from this inbalance and dont want it seen removedand why exactly are you opposed to adding risk to afk cloakers as ive already stated cloakers would still be able to project the fear and threats they already project the only difference is now they would have to work in a team to keep subverting local and they would need to actually be awake but these are things that already are expected from your targets let me guess these are just emotions i think if you keep repeating this it will come true cd
my eyes the goggles they do nothing last i checked ganking was a part of this game i believe ccp soundwave said as much to try and stem the tears over the jb changes
fleets of cloak disruption altsnot supported
the entire point of gaining sovernty over a chunk of space is so that you can rat with relative saftey ccp has designed the game so that it is playable for the average player that means having a level of security while in the space you have worked hard to win even with this security that is supposed to be earned though the hard work of taking space it is still possible for you to lose your ship it is made much harder for the enemy since they are in your space but it is still completely possible a cloaked ship on the other hand can sit in hostile space for as long as they want with absolutely no threat to them what so ever thats akin to me jumping my carrier into your space and being able to rat without being worried about losing my ship its a flawed mechanic and needs to be fixedyour claim that ratting in any ship has no risk is incorrect and there for your entire argument is wrong
no it really isnt look up the posts of any of ccp on the matter especially soundwave in the hilarious jb tears thread and that much is certain security is provided by your alliance not by the space you hold if youre approaching this from that viewpoint then your entire argument rests on a false assumptionit is possible that an out of control driver will hit me as i cross the road but everyone would accept that as long as i took all reasonable precautions i am not in any danger on any given crossing of the road if you take reasonable precautions whilst ratting checking local being aligned to your safe  pos  station etc then by the same measure you are not in any danger whilst ratting thus is your assertion disprovedif you found a quiet system it wouldnt matter who owned it you jump in whilst noones there and have a cyno pilot always at the ready in case of emergency you fit a cloak and you churn through anomalies whilst keeping an eye on local  all the while aligned to your bookmark a trivially easy thing to accomplish at the first sign of people in local you optionally  youre in a carrier pull in your drones and warp to your safe and cloak if they try and camp you into the system you can either wait out your aggression and log or simply jump to safety when your capacitor permits it is utterly unarguable that the default state of ratting in 00 is risk free it is only by consciously taking risks by not aligning or by not paying attention to local that risk is injected noone would say crossing the road is risky because i might do it whilst wearing a blindfold assertion disproved and my point stands
well its normal practise on a forum to quote someone you are replying too i find it strange you dont understand that but if you missed it he was in fact directing that post at me local is broken as can been seen by all the afk threadsi actually like the status quo but i dont want a cloak nerf that doesnt come in a package with a local nerf that is a balanced approach and the truth yes emotional you need to be more balancedoh i can argue my position quite well on this if you remove afk cloaking youll gain even more intel power thats not good balance and makes null sec ratting almost risk freeit leads me to believe its an emotional response because of your aversion to losing local intel chat and only aiming to nerf the effect instead of the causecoolyoure assuming i think human nature is always right its been shown many times to be a bad thing but it is what it is in regards to the forums and botting if any change happens i want it to be balanced for both sides your camp only wants it one waynot balanced and not factual so yes it looks emotional calm down then
repeating this over and over again does not make it true or even invalidate the facts at this point your responses have simply degenerated to irrelevant ad hominem attacks
i think skill management via evegate is already on ccps todo list iirchowever the idea of a blank skill would probably gain more traction if it were an automatic kind of thing how many times have you heard maybe yourself say something to the effect of aaargh my skill queue ran out x hours ago ill never get that time back aargh so lets take a combo of the ideas above and make it so sps accrue at a characters slowest possible rate whenever there arent any other skills on the queue or 
hearing a lot of crap about lets make gallente better mostly about hybrid guns well heres my five minutes of effort and look of disgust that you cant be happy with what you havei fly all races with every tech ii gun so dont even bring up me being an amarr fanboy
you forgot the effect of armor rigs on amarr and gallente ships you also forgot to add an mwd to show its effect on capfact is your amarr ship has 42 more range than the gallente ship hits hard for 15km as opposed to 45km and is only marginally slower than the gallente ships you also fail to show that the hyperion is using 86 of its grid while the abaddon is using only 75gallente ships have  poor optimal horrible fall off and need to be hull to hull to deal the damage that an amarr can do at max web range from your example
i think its pretty fair rail guns should be boosted though
im going to provide a rebuttal in order of what you have saidmy amarr ship uses 100 more capacitor and about 15 less damage and 20 less tracking to make up for the range also if you look at the chart the hyperion can do damage up to overheat web range good damage if you know how falloff works while the abaddon has more power its only to supplement its extra low slot i was comparing guns not ships so this shouldnt be an issuegallente ships do have  poor optimal but amarr ships have  poor fall off hybrid fall off is the second greatest in eve of the three turret weapons hull to hull combat is common and if youre out of point range then the battleship is nothing but support which is what amarr battleships are mainly used for because of their lack of medium slots for tackle
sigh another one of these you realize of course that with those dps numbers unless the hyperion starts out 5km away the abaddon will outdamage it in all situations and the huge range the abaddon has means it has to mwd around if at all a lot less the less tracking is irrelevant when you need a quarter the tracking to hit the same size target at 15km as opposed to 45kmand what happens when the target is 45 km away the abaddon keeps pewpewing at a healthy 730 dps hyperions dealing with huge falloff dealing sub50 dps with null and even if it does manage to mwd all the way to optimal what kind of advantage do using those short range blasters get you i bet it takes at least several minutes before you even match the abaddons damage really except for those fights that start at 5km and the enemy never tries to escape jam you is dualprop etc youre much better off with lasers or autocannons in all situations
yes furthermore the abaddon has more base powergrid this is very important when considering the fitting of non raceexclusive modulesif the abaddon used 75 of its pg it could fit 16x 1600mm rolled tungsten platesif the hyperion used 75 of its pg then it could only fit 10x 1600mm rolled tungsten platesso gallente lose by using a greater  of the pg and by having less pg overall
what the hell kind of ship has 16 low slots for those plates
i too fly ships fitted only with guns and damage mods
i too ignore that the long range ammo of amarr provides a much larger boost to range that that of gallente same for minnie vs gallente
try again510
this
3 cr abaddon and the hyperion is rather lol worthyyou forgot to compare tanks as well the baddon is a monster in closerange fights no other nonfaction nont2 bs comes close
i believe a triple or dual rep hype would kill the abaddon having said that so would a dual rep domi and maybe even a neut phoon that aside op blasters on the large scale only work if you start inside range if you have to mwd anywhere then pretty much every other cr bs weapon pulls ahead
1v1 which rarely happens and the hyperion magically dictates range sure but given the choice in eve id rather be in the baddon because in almost all circumstances ill be on the winning side
blasters are already overpowered thats why im using them now
so where are all the hyperion blobs as its clearly the superior ship
well yeah me too i took you saying close range as within scram range obviously if it starts anywhere but scram the baddon wipes the floor with them
i like something similar that could also reduce a little of the server load and the chat probleminstead of limiting just the trial accounts reduce the text limit for everyone in the local chat of every system and increase the time penalty between posts all other conversation windows would have less strict controlswhen a system starts to lag start blocking trial accounts from entering before paying accounts  in fact id consider blocking trial accounts from entering trade hubs and all heavily loaded systems altogether there would be little point in an alternate trade hub springing up elsewhere then there are roughly 1000 market manipulation alts in jita 2357 and that will be true of wherever becomes market 1perhaps when the time dilation proposed by ccp is getting to ridiculous levels in a particular system stop trial accounts from stressing that node altogether by not allowing them to log into or jump into systems on that nodeim not in favour of restrictions applied to accounts by age limit
the alts are the real problem here people they offer something that eve is not suppose to have true isk for zero risk they use these throw away alts and trials and never leave their port which makes them impossible to get any kind of revenge against
do not support makes local discussion impossible for true new players
scamming by being smart is part of the game should scamming by spamming a load often enough using bots really be part of the game if yes give us what is needed so we can make an ingame spam filter
simplesuspend or ban people that spam chats and perma ban those who use bots to spam chati like scamming stupid people should lose money but if the same 3 people say the same things 20000 times an hour there is an issue
rightclick block honestly its not that hard trade hub locals for me are pretty much silent
ok i know this has been implemented for sometime but i just dont get itmassive whine about nano which yes was justified so ccp do a complete speed rebalance  great no problemthen further feed the whines by adding the mwd feature to scrams  why you already rebalanced the speed of shipsscrams do not have a long range so your making ships that supposed to be fast useless like say inties why would you ever put an ab on a ceptor ceptors also have short range so you have to pretty much get in scram range to hit anything the speed tank is whats key for a ceptorhowever most people now fit a scram rather than a disrupter so your making ceptors be long range and thats not good either im talking about ceptors but this applies to other ships tooyou have a webifier to slow down ships remove the mwd killer and add extra range to the webifier perhaps like a warp disrupter
you cant have much experience in small hull combat if you think mwd killing scrams are a bad thingfrigates are more than fast enough to live long prosperous lives inside scram range without a prop mod interceptors even more sothe threat to smalls comes from drones and neuts more than anything else  scram on the other goes both ways and allows you to stop most ship in their tracksps ab ceptors are stupidly good fun to fly  best damn kick in the adrenal gland eve has to offer
ceptors work perfectly fine inside scram range claw taranis and sader come to mind mwds switching off scrams only effect the tracking on blasters really as they no longer have the sig bloom of mwds to help with their tracking
do you even play this game how many ppl either fit a small neut or have warriors or both any decent player has one or bothand as stated this wasnt just about ceptors
as an inty and af pilot i routinely take on canes vagas rapiers etc solo the ability to shut down their mwd is extremely important to maintaining high transversal as i kill them under their guns before scrams shut down mwds webs applied a 90 speed penalty and while that might sound good to you it would make abs obsolete additionally it would make outracing a guns tracking virtually impossible if the enemy has a single web i dont think you know what your asking currently ab mwd vs scram web pt are well balanced so stop whining that you have to make a choice at the fitting screen
so much fail in one post amayzingyou really dont have a clue about small ships pvp learn to play eve
do you there are frigates that can tank warriors with ease and a small neut wouldnt bother also you cant speed tank with an mwd on anyway a normal frigate with its mwd on has the sig of a cruiser without it
agreed
i still have my 2 attribute pointsi just didnt remapnow im at 2 unassigned attribute points which brings me at a grand total of 121 attribute points instead of the 119 you guys havethis makes me specialand i like being specialfor the same reason i have 3 neural remaps available if i can ever be botherd to use themplease visit your user settings to reenable images
the reason they are afk is not the issue it is their ability to go afk that is the problem there needs to be some mechanic that forces a cloaked ship to continue to need input from the player be that directly relating to the cloak or because of the ability of other players to eventually find said cloaked ship there is no reason that a ship once cloaked no longer needs any input from the player that like having a mining barge that can simply start mining and never have to unload cargo and that is not able to be shot
the power of local can still be subverted with this proposal only that youd have to actually be in front of your computer screen to stay alive
can ccp just make it a bannable offense to start a thread about afk cloaking already
no that would be what ratting in nullsec currently is  100 risk free way of making isk afk cloaking does nothing except stop those pilots unwilling to take any risk from making isk both issues can be solved by removing local
they can gather intel just fine bob by using the scanner the only number they are barred from is total local counts which is moot in station systems due to docked afks anywaysince ccp doesnt like the fact that ships can be made unprobeable why not combine it with a cloak nerffix which both ccp and players are divided on cloaked ships can be scanned down using combat probes just like all other shipscivilian cloaks non covert 10 to 12 faction signature per level of cloakingmilitary cloaks covert 15 signature per level of cloaking all covert using ships should have sensorssigs tweaked to allow for unprobeable status ie with all influencing skills at 45black ops have base signatures cut 5060 ie bs with sigs lower than bcs gives them a reason to go out roaming with their portal clients  subbc size with bs damage and commandship ehp unprobeable setups ccp doesnt like them either nerfed through probe mechanicmodule tweaks includes t3s they should need cloaks to be invulnerablesolves cloaking macro ravens grief cloaking using noncoverts cloaking bbs et al can still semifunction as now if all lows are used for arrays and implants are used but that is gimpage galore so a fair trade much better balanced than the single mid sebo needed to alleviate drawback currentlyedit also acts a nerf to supercapitals using cloaks as get out of jail free cards thus forcing them to actually need support fleets or at the very least buddies intended as alliance level assets remember 
ah now lets not mix the two issues here because theyre very different unprobable  cloaked and shouldnt be treated the same its true that up ships that are point and bubble immune whilst providing good gang links are overpowered for the risk of loss they represent cloaking is not that though there is a clear mandate for stealth within the game and a clear nerf that said stealth provides  namely the inability to do anything whilst cloaked except warp from a to b if you have the right ship for the job i dont know what the solution to unprobable ships is but cloaking ships are supposed to be impossible to find i remember the bad old days when the saying of the day was nothing says stealth like oh look a stealth bomberthe issue really is that ratters take exception to the power of an afk cloaked ship to force them to make the assumption that theyre not afk removing local solves thisthere is another issue whereby ratters by their own admission are 100 safe whilst ratting in nullsec whilst they have local removing local solves this toothere is even a third issue inasmuch as a certain number of pilots use bots to rat that warp off as soon as another entity pings up in local thus preserving their violation of the eula in 100 safety removing local solves this toothe issue i have is that people are trying to fix the first problem whilst trying to maintain the ability to rat in nullsec in complete safety which is what all of these afk cloaking threads perpetuate would it be harder to solo rat in a nullsec with no local  you bet your bottom dollar it would eve is not a solo game you cant have a foolish blob of one
ratting is not 100 risk free your logic is flawed and your argument is not credible ratting is low risk but it is far from risk free local could probably use some tweeking but that is a different topic regardless of how afk cloaking is being used the fact that you can cloak and then go afk is the issue cloaking should have a way to be combated that allows the cloaked ship to be found if they are afk if i were afk mining or ratting without a bot that is i would be an easy target cloaked ships that are afk should be easy targets as well no one is arguing the boting is ok and ccp is working very hard to combat it
not enough ever in that reply a few more would have nailed itim glad you think a few dscans would sort it but it still doesnt escape the fact that local is behind itremoving local wouldnt make afk cloaking less common it would stop it being the psych tool it presently is it would then become a pointless exercise and you know itso now youre not interest in fixing the cause only the effect in other words afk is merely a red herring you simply want to nerf cloaks it seemingly doesnt matter to you that the facts point to your reliance upon locals instant intel as being the problemyou want to nerf cloaks no matter what you want your 100 risk free instant intel tool to be all powerful again im glad you think thats a balanced approach personally i dont
then you need to increase your calorie intake my dear they are not the same but they are related both provide the user with invulnerability which has been a big nono in eve for a long time and prompted speed revamp ecm revamp and just about every other major nerf since eve launchedpersonally dont give a rats arse about afk cloaks what i do think breaks the game is ships not meant for cloaking abusing them to maintain permanent eyes on an area and supercapitals being able to be used for hitnrun attacks think about it it is beyond ridiculousup ships and cynoshotdrops will be nerfed soon if the dev answer thread is accurate which leaves just cloaking as the last unscoutableinvulnerable tactic  how long do you think that last vestige of predawn eve will survivei consider it inevitable and would rather help cook up a system that leaves them a niche to frolic in knowing ccps ability to obsolete entire sectors with poorly thought out changes  hence my previous postas for no local being the answer to everything  human ratters will disappear almost completely and will be replaced with macros that intercepts traffic tofrom server providing near perfect intel on occupants regardless of what client shows or was that patched out after the monkeysphere thingie 1 automationbotting mining in null will never ever be revived which kills any hope of cutting the jita umbilical thus favouring the uberblobs with spare titans for logistics scan button will be molested 237 by everyone scouting becomes obsolete in most areas as long as filtering of results is not more detailed all systems have poss and most are used as parking lotsit breaks far more than it solves if done without serious changes mainly to intel gathering ie scanningprobing it works for worms because access is severely limited so you dont have 34 roams running around every day or more depending on area
what i just dont get is that an aggressor in high sec gets paid out by insurance concord should not only pop him but take isk from his account to pay for his suicide ganking activitiesthat way if you want to make a statement by ganking then you will know that it will cost youthe insurance system leaves a lot to be desired and really needs tweaking
build your own stuff fit it with mission meta 4 stuff just buy some t2 mods and dont insure it its worthless
as a supplier of faction vessels i strongly support this proposal to massively subsidise me
see listen to the man he has a business to run here people
as a person who reads far above an eight grade level this is an excellent approach for reaching the intellectual minority of eve and i support it however being that most of the eve community prefer their issues posted as single sentences tldr or bulleted lists i think few people would actually bother to read a purposefully and intelligently crafted white paper however these apprehensions shouldnt prevent anyone from publishing white papers those of us who care will read themadditionally i do not think that giving oversight of an approvaldisapproval power of white paper publishing to the csm is a good idea especially with someone such as the mittani as the chairman since he would most likely refer to authors as sany such oversight should be granted to a body of intelligent and competent individuals and it be a good idea to only allow participation through peer review for example a board member might recommend a potential future board member and the group reviews hisher competency and either chooses to allow or deny hisher entry
heres my thought on thatits a nice idea in theory but theres a reason why the maxim goes in theory theory should be like practice but in practice this is rarely the case there are too many vested interests the needs of pvpers vs the desire of the carebear for instance to have just one of these and with egos and politics youd either end up with a divided committee or ccp having to take account of the 3rd minutes of the 14th subcommittee meeting on paper x before responding to it as an idea
there is no fair voting mechanism although i do believe the fairest is based on a hybrid bicameral system tailored for eve one group of elected persons based on population and another based on regionwhy do you need both i will briefly explainfirst of all if you based representation purely off population those areas with a higher population would be provided with more representation and therefore have more influence secondly if you base representation purely off region then those areas with less population receive equal representation as those areas that have higher populations and thus the higher populated areas receive less influence than they deservetherefore in order to balance this dichotomic predicament you must have both image the followingthe first group in this system would consist of one seat chosen from each major region highsec lowsec nullsec wormhole space or perhaps geographically such as north south east and west this would provide 4 seatsthe second group is comprised of a number of persons determined by population from each of the previously mentioned major groupslets propose one seat for every 100000 inhabitants and assuming that eve has roughly 690000 eve qen q1 2011 page 10 characters that provides 6 seats each major area would be granted a certain number of seats based on its population given that population rises falls and that players move around seats could and most probably will change hands however each major region would always have at least 1 seatthe hybrid aspect of this is that all of these officials reside in the same body as opposed to an actual bicameral system wherein they would be in separate bodiesso with this system we have a minimum of 8 seats and a maximum of 10 seats roughly the same as the current csm with a smaller portion chosen via region and the remainder chosen via population providing a system that is fairer than the current oneand as for the chairman and vicechairman why not let the elected officials choose them after each election i also think the idea of termlimits should be addressed as wellif you wish to comment on this thats excellent however make your comments or critiques with intelligence and please dont make stupid sarcastic or childish remarks
to be a care bear more often than not requires a special type of person as does a fighter pilotwhat really needs to happen is thisonly a care bear can manufacture and mine above level 1 and his toon only fight to level 1only a pvp toon can fight above level 1 and only manufacture and mine to a level 1this way there will be more respect for both groups and game play more balancedyou want that big assed ship  then befriend a carebear otherwise you aint gonna get itif you look at most online games where you need to manufacture and mine you will find a special charachter in game that does itnot everyoneall carebears should go on strike for a month and lets see what happens lol what would this mean for ccp more active accounts 
low sec becomes 00  failed 00 alliancescorps going to live in low sec with their supercap blobs  now killing off and hotdropping low secnerf supers in low secits becoming ridiculous

make that everywhere
wont make a lick of difference theyll still come and go and kill at will only one shiptype with one module using a script can hold them change that and the playing field is evened out quite nicelyremove ewar immunity when in empire
just by looking at the first 3 posts on this topic alone makes me pukeseriously ccp if this is not biased csm  influence on the very foundations of eve dunno what isall goonsnc influence should be removed asap from csm and from ccp employees this is getting waaay to mutch tbfh
the problem is highsec isk the risk vs reward its just not balanceddrastically reduce the isk potential from highsec problem solved
it would not necessarily need to be this way the reservoirs for the fuel cells could be sufficiently large that refueling would only need to occur every 23 weeks
thank you for your effortsi suspect there will be more released will it be as much as we want probably not but i am confident it will be something worthwhileonly suggestion i could make combine the cake and bacon into some form of bacon cake tastiest way to economize i can think of while it wouldnt win the heart foundation tick im betting its still better than a deep fried marsbar
my policy with summit minutes  which i am encouraging my colleagues to adopt  is to put as much into them as possible then edit them as needed if participants express concerns like ndaso the draft of ccp sreegs presentation aka sreegs team six  the war on bots is 1100 words for a 30 minute sessionps 1 to two step for twostepping up and taking on the minutes prep for a couple of sessions even though he wasnt at the summit
i finally got around to blogging about th summitcsm 6 my summit reflectionwish i U043Euld go into more detail but the meeting minutes should be out in a couple weeks
i like this idea however i feel that players should only be able to choose one region or system of residence in which they would be eligible to cast a vote for their mayor i think governor is more apt than mayor but thats just my opinion or perhaps limit players to a single vote in only one region regardless of other factors it makes no sense to allow for players to vote repeatedly and by allowing a system wherein a players clone location determines their residence would allow that call it vote spamming if you willalthough there is at least one drawback to this block voting by creating this system it would ipso facto allow nullsec uberalliances to also control highsec and nullsec to a certain degree i dont know if that would be desirable to the eve community at large
it wasnt leaked it was decompiled which is possible since eve is based on python besides only 50 or so can be decompiled and its only the client not the server besides this is hardly news how do you think bots have been built earlier before this leaked source code
for those of us that dont have multimegabit internet there is a very serious hit to performance with the new cq  bad enough that the one time i tried to dock i waited 10 minutes and still hadnt made it into the dock incarna needs to be optional we also want to see the return of only download portraits when you click on them option i have never understood why the original incursion patch removed that checkbox as it hammers my limited bandwidth and kills my gate jump times no its not my machine  my machine is severe overkill per eves recommended system listing
grow a beard live in a pos be a manor you can just give it time till the next iteration of hardware makes the current requirements laughable
when i need optimum peformance i have all of my toons in space in other words cq will have 0 effect when it counts i am not sure if everyone plays this way though that being said i am not discounting that it may take longer to dock or undock but for the most we should be good i hope
game is not dead yet nor is it better does this mean that mittens is ineffective
even a chairman as dynamic as mittens will require more than a few months to destroy eve but based on what i saw at the summit hes off to a running start
goonswarm has existed since 2006 and the game isnt dead yet the game is better though can we blame that on goons
lol too trueanyway i finally got around to blogging about th summitcsm 6 my summit reflectionwish i U043Euld go into more detail but the meeting minutes should be out in a couple weeks
dreads are only good at shooting towers and stations and even then they are still second choice to make them first choice by only nerfing scarriers would be a hefty nerf scarriers need a bit of a nerf but dreads need some pretty substantial buffing after all the multiple beatings theyve had with the nerf stick1 they need more buffer2 they need to do more damage3 they need a shorter siege timer4 they need a reduction to the tracking debuff when going into siege so they can actually hit other caps
i think what hes getting at is that for turrets you need to have all threesmallmedium large to 5 before you can use tech 2 large turrets as opposed to t2 launchers where you only need the specific missile size trained to use the t2 siege missile launcher iismissile launcher operation iv torpedo specialization i torpedoes v heavy missiles iii standard missiles iii 1400mm arty iissharpshooter v medium artillery specialization iv small artillery specialization iv small projectile turret v medium projectile turret v large projectile turret v gunnery v thats a real big differenceedit nevermind op is full of whine
maybe but that doesnt mean he does not have a pointi would be against any directly applicable skills being reduced or prereqs being removed entirely the thing is the small and medium turrets are not directly applicable i think level 4 as pre reqs or even 3 to bring them into line with launchers is not only very reasonable its fairthere are a lot of skill requirements in this game that could be adjusted the most prominent example i can think of is the mining barge to exhumer progression you are in the covetor for about a day before you qualify for a hulk it really minimizes the usefullness of the covetor
signmore quality please also review and finish old features first
signed
signedccp im starting for the first time to lose my faith in your ability to make eve still be the great game ive been playing for a few years nowincarna is a great exemple of wrong direction in management
polish first old than set up somtign new
supported needs more polish wouldnt ccp want new players to see a feature and join the eve community to get then then find out then the feature is better then the trailerinstead of the lackluster things that tend to get pumped on occasion incursion wasnt terrible but it was a small feature
a minig station or any other placable installation that is build from p4s produces available on the ingame market producing constant small stream of ore being destructable only available in null not to expensive but survivable enough  would at least present a legal ccp provided ingame alternative to third party botsshrugs
i think my take on poses are a bit diffrent than most and i would assume the most unlikely thing to happen but i will give it a go anywayi would like to see that people can dock at posespos owner can give docking permissions to whoever they like and also assign personal space shipstorage space and permissions to those docked in the pos that means that you can give permissions to anyone you like regardless of corp alliance or otherwiseeveryone have their own hangar just like an outpostpos services like research labs guns and so on are all accessable from inside of the posadding pos modules expand what you can do with the pos for example adding a sma extends the total amount of m3 that can dock adding a cha allows more stuff to be stored adding labsrefineryswhatever allows you to perform that function the only difference is really guns adding guns is also done from inside the pos but can then be placed outside the pos shield accessing the guns will also give an outside view of the posthe poses should still have all the restrictions they do now so you may have to pick and choose which mods are active but it is done from within

this really the process of decanting a capsuleer is too time consuming for quick cargo loadunload plus it is demeaning thats what the crew is for and often unnecessary
optionalif it takes more than 01 second to load then i do not want it unless when i choose itits useless fluff good for when you feel like fluff but shouldnt be in the way otherwise
here was my post from the developers blog
supported please make it optionali am much looking forward to character animation in wodbut please dont abuse our beloved spaceships game as a tech demothere is a reason i am playing eve and not the sims no need for mini games
supported for immersion reasons i cant imagine me getting out of pod washed and clothed just because i forgot to load my mining crystals
i want cqincarna to be optional
no thanks its horrifically slow buggy and no doubt going to only become more of a ccp trainwreck over time ill opt out of loading the assets and prefer to spinblack screenwaste 4 years of dev time you could at least spend 10 min giving me an option to show my dislike for your bad direction consider it feedbackedit support oops
crossposting a collection of good points in favor of making cq optionalpreface i am not afraid of change i have been looking forward to incarna ever since it was first mentioned before it even became known as wis or ambulation what i am afraid of is a loss of immersion which would be tragic as an effect of an expansion meant to increase immersion and the high likelihood at this point that cq will not live up to its potential simply because ccp is being stubborn and blinded by their excitementquoted for justicea capsuleer doesnt eject their pod from their ship and get out of their pod every time they dock some capsuleers probably stay in their pods 99 of the time the following options must be implemented  always show hangar when docking  always show quarters when docking  prompt to choose between hangar and quartersthe purpose of incarna is enhancement of immersion as a roleplayer i foresee it damaging immersion if it is not made optional capsuleers do not get out of their pods every single time they dock there are very few aspects of eves game mechanics that an immersionist has to filter out in order to maintain their immersion ccp should not add another thing like that especially when doing so would be ridiculously contrary to their own stated purposes and the solution is both utterly simple and completely harmless
not sure if this is already in game i couldnt find itever since they added drone dmg to the notifications your own weapon damage is drowned out from five reports for each of your drones can we have an option in the main menu to disable just drone damage notifications i like being able to see my weapon dmg because it gives me an idea of how im doing for optimal tracking etc
it just seems to me this would be a way to end the debate even the playing field a bit and still allow everyone to keep their bpos
bump for great justice
suport this
scs are uberweapons and the check in logistics would really bring them under better control likewise have jump or nonjump freighters capable of directly resupplying themmake them persistant in game too if you cant log them why be able to vanish with them put a key on the lock so only the owner can get in
tiers should die they do a lot of harm to t1 frigs and cruisers but the best example are the tier 1 bcs they werent much good the tier 2 ones became what bcs should have been from the start and the tier 1s became absolute crap except the brutix which is halfcrap by all means make them different but do not impose an absolute disadvantage in grid cap armor shield and  much worse  slotsthey should go the way of multipleq agents but i miss this ammounted a bit to a tax on stupidity or bpcs equal to bposits a system that has outlived any possible usefulnessomen and maller are like harbinger and prophecy everybody would use the omen like they do the rupture if it werent castrated the proph could still be a low dps huge tank ship but become useful by actually having another slot layout this would give a choice as is no choice at all and the ship might not existapply to tier 1 and 2 bs as well mind the tier 3 are heavier less agile more sig versions so they ok
i totally agree ban falcons now
your posting interferes with my enjoyment of the game please cease violating the tos immediately
you could just stop whining and move system or stop using a carrier get a drake run 1 sanctum and youve already paid it off then if its lost youve already broke evenyoure just whining because you cant farm your isk without risk risk is part of eve and especially part of nullsec dont like it go to high sec and do l4s in a navy raven
i believe there should be an afk timer if you did not touch your keyboard or mouse for x  amount of time  lets say 30 minutes  you are automatically logged of but you get a warning first which stays visible for another 5 minutes so you can still click ok to stay in gamethis would also free up server resources
i would support your proposal but you dont actually propose anything perhaps you could incorporate my idea
join the request
bump and yes i do want them back
concord and faction standing should be visible to everyone and all standings should be visible to 10 excellent and corp mates
would be nice to have jump route planner  saving routes in the star map as originally posted herejump route planner for star mapcheers
well to startthe skill queue and vacations whenever i go on vacations i always end up in a situation with my skill queue the first time this happened i wasnt prepared for it and my laptop did not have eve on it because it has problems downloading eve it got to the point where i had to give an extremely trusted friend my username and password and have him update my skill queue that i contacted via eve gate and i thought that as you can view your skill queue through eve gate it would be very helpful if you could update and change your skill queue through eve gate eve gate is already password protected and you can even send messages through it so why not have control of you skill queue through it it would help me a lot and others im sure because you can say just put a long skill in training but as im still a rather young character and i dont have many skills long enough to cover my vacation but at the same time none of them are the ones i want to train at the time using eve gate i think would solve my problemthanks
fail i think comes with own alliance doesnt itand yes salvage is fine ppl dont care about salvage  this is about loot why dont you read properly or are you incapablelook the simple fact is everyone else who gets agression cant dock so why can ninja looters answer the bloody question rather than trolling like an attention seeking idiotthe simple fact is they should get a docking timerfact  unless you can come up with a valid argument against
simple fix move systems or ignore themor bring some corp mates along to your mission and kill them therejust because youre incompetant and didnt think of anything other then shooting them on a station in dock range doesnt mean you cant kill them
because stealing is a lesser offense than shooting someone and people at the station can allow a thief inside but not a murderer  
1 fly disposable mission ships2 suicide gank said ninja looters3 4 profit
bhwaaaaaa ccp please dont let me get aggression cos then i cant be a lazy feck and steal other peoples loot perhaps ill actually have to fight for itor do some work bhwaaaaaaanice alt ninja looter trolls keep cryingthey should not be able to insta dock
oh look its this thread againccp have repeatedly stated wrecks do not belong to anyone and salvage is supposed to be a competitive business loot belongs to the mission runner and youre more than welcome to shoot at anyone who steals from you your work is in shooting the targets but you get gifted the location a ninjas work is in scanning down the location but they get gifted the targets you do just as much work as we do
hang on  thats wrecks not loot you can have the wrecks for all i care  this has nothing to do with wreckswhy quote something that isnt the issue here ill repeat this one more time for ppl who have less than 1 brain cellother people get agression and can not dock so why can ninja looterswhat is the point of giving them agression if they can insta dock and just wait out the timerand sitting on a station just waiting for wrecks then loot and dock is not scanning down doing the work im sorry but ninja looters do some work cmon thats utter bs and you know it isagain they need docking timer imposed  there is no argument here
1 acquire friend2 acquire noctis thread
i said they do as much work as mission runners im not arguing either is particularly taxinggetting agression from shooting at someone is very different from nicking something it makes sense that stations would not want to admit pilots who had recently engaged in acts of agression against others it also makes sense that theyd want to keep an eye on firefights going on in their system and who was involved why would they care about random acts of petty larceny how would they even know most of them had occurred outside of hesaidshesaid type exchangesim not saying internet spaceships should be hyperrealistic or anything just that the rules remain open and logical please stop trying to defecate in my sandbox
they should not be able to insta dock an agression timer is perfectly reasonableeven though the ninja looters will quickly adapt and the issue become moot i meanwhat are they going to do run back to a station so they can sit outside like a duck in a shooting gallery while waiting for a timer to let them dockwindjammer
no skill remaps everthe general argument for a single remap would maybe apply to a new player who needs a quick shift in skills to enjoy the gamebut that undermines the whole foundation of eves gameplay to begin with no skill is useless for starters secondly a single remap would be limited to 60 days from creation of the character  thus only new characters could take advantage of it for its intended reasonas was said earlier youre just trying to get your foot in the door with a simple idea of one remap again eves entire foundation is built on the skillsystem and its permanence by allowing skill remaps you significantly reduce the lifespan of the game  ie people will quit earlier from boredom because they experience too much of the game too quickly while this wouldnt necessarily affect a 2 year character who has already seen most of what the game will offer the rest being the sandbox experience this change could have disastrous consequences on new player recruitmentnew players are fickle  what sells eve is the hardcore gameplay of when you lose it its gone and the skill system that paces the game getting to even a tech i battleship is an achievement for everyone most people have battleships but what makes it an achievement is that you spent the time to get there and the isk if you remove the pacing of the skill system you remove the sense of accomplishment that eve provides and most games dont its a big deal when you get that first capital  partially because of cost lots of effort for most but also the amount of time it took to get there this is the eve experience  an experience tailored to your goals and aspirations not a structured system of point a to point b that can be redone at a whimtldr remapping of skills would destroy eve gameplay and should never be considered all skills are useful so you can only get better with time thus if you messed up your skills tough and start learning the right ones from day 1 youre able to make isk and get things done so you cant say your skills are so wrong youre useless
how about a remap big enough for players to leave the fail gallente behind
pandora boxno
i support the idea of a skillpoint remap as a compromise how about being able to reimburse for half of the sp that you are put into it
supporting my own
stop whiningohlook i fixed the problem for you ccp
1 i dont think i understand the problem youre trying to fix how does neut rr create risk free pvp iirc in high sec if you rr someone with aggression you can be shot by anyone who can shoot the ships you rr2 this fix seems pretty heavy handed do you realize what this would do to faction warfare and coalitions if you can only rr people in your own alliance this would make mixed fleets and large battles almost impossible
id not say risk free but it does create an offbalance 10 man corp a decs 10 man corp b all fair and sexycorp a has another 10 men which remain neutral and provide rr creating a 20m vs 10m situation and corp b can do little to counter except maybe get 10 neutral rr of their own but then we end up in stalemate yawnfest where every mofo has a neutral rr and nobody can kill anybodyi agree rr is a little wrong and needs addressing in some wayand while the argument huurrr deerr but you can shoot them is valid its a bit moot as then the war no longer becomes about shooting your wartargetsi would agree that rr need be in corpalliance ie they have to present a valid target  take risk of engagement but its a very harsh way to solve an issue like thisi would appreciate others input on neutral rr as well
ok so how is this situation different than corp a just having 20 members of which 10 fly rr ships or 10 rr mercenary pilots joining the corp after the war dec starts the only difference i see is that you cant shoot the rr ships until after they start repping instead of any time you see them and im not sure why that would make a big differenceim against this far reaching proposal but there might be a better narrowly tailored solution if it was clear exactly what the problem is

force them to dock or leave grid so you cant fight them till they get involved in the fight deal with itnot supported
lol obvious neut repper is obvious  i guess that applies when you think you have 2 v 2 targets and then suddenly see they are getting repped by 5 others you didnt know about yeah really fair douchehowever supported neut reppers need sorting
neutral rr and blobs the only solo pvp to be had is with your wife welcome to eve
this is the only logical argument you have made against this proposal and i refuted it when i pointed out that even with this new module you can still afk in any unprobable ship thus this proposal would not make local infallible and you can still afk 237 to gather intel or whatever you like doing there
if you can still afk for 237 then what is the point of your change surely it does nothing to stop the whole afk process and just nerfs people using their cloaks for other things
well youve shouted posting words in all capitals lied about what ive said as well as ranted about demands and what you keep telling me is it any wonder i consider you somewhat emotionalits not all that serious tbh and its fine if you feel you cant continue the argument
the point is that afking is a bit more difficult since making ships unprobable is harder than throwing on a cloak if the security of the system is paramount for a short time then someone could probe the general location of the suspected afk and watch for them to warp away so it does improved security by a small amount and i do understand that some people want far less security everywhere which is a valid viewpoint but i think they should just disagree and go on instead of calling everyone whiny carebears who cant read and only alt post why i still hope for any manners from poasters on the intertubes is a good question thoughas it is now cloaking is near invincibility i can cloak 100k off the biggest battle in eve and take a shower go to work have dinner and screw my girlfriend with an infinitesimal chance of being detected i see that as a problem but i dont want uncloaking to be fast riskless or free so this is the best solution i thought up perhaps theres a better one out therethis isnt the biggest problem in all of eve and if the csm and the devs think its better the way it is or its too much work to add i can accept that but i think the game would be improved with this addition
and can not do a god damned thing
by the same token i could go afk in an unprobable cyno stiletto in a safe with my mwd on and never be found doing all the activities you just mentioned outside of game mind you i wouldnt be able to do anything in game same as if i was cloaked
except they can and they do theres a reason afk cloaking is effective while an afk cloaker can rest and sleep even he is able to wear down the system locals keeping them vigilant 247 as it should be might i add but no one or anything is able to bring the same projected threat to the cloaker the only way to catch a cloaker is to set up a trap and pray to god that he is brainless enough to accept and fall into it basically the cloaker has to agree to pvp in order to bring pvp to him all this in the middle of 00 where its supposed to be dangerous
most folk looking at this view this in a mechanical prospective and notices nothing wrong with it and sees it working as intended as i and others dothe ones that can not or refuse to see it that way are too busy hand wringing and posting threads like this because the boogie man is fcking with their head the folks bent about nerfing the afk menace are trying to change a mechanic based out of pure emotional distress in which is self created
speaking of emotional
yep frothing at the very thought
no you couldnt  you would easily be detectable especially with the mwd on whether anyone could ever catch you is a very different matter and ccp has been playing with speed balance issues for years there will always be some ship thats faster than any others and im not sure if thats really a problem or not really perhaps you could post the numbers on this so we can see what most folk really want the vast majority of those i talk to an admittedly small sample compared to the population of eve want a change like this a smaller number dont care either way and a small minority oppose it violently and talk sht at anyone who holds any opposing opinion
well i suppose you can look at the vote count every time this topic comes up for support and then you can make a note of how fast it goes down in flames

i felt like using a nice familiar and constant example with easily comparable numbers however ill share some more realistic exampleswith 25 pg remaining an abaddon can fit 8x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates a heavy cap booster and a 100mn mwd absolute overkillwith 25 pg remaining a hyperion can fit 3x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates a heavy cap booster and a 100mn mwdnow remember that the hyperion actually uses 86 of its power gridwith 25 pg remaining an abaddon can fit 8x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates a heavy cap booster and a 100mn mwdwith 14 pg remaining a hyperion can fit 3x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates and a 100mn mwdor a heavy cap booster and 3x 1600mm rolled tungsten platesit cant fit a mwd and cap boosternow a more direct comparisonwith 25 pg remaining an abaddon can fit 16x 1600mm rolled tungsten plateswith 14 pg remaining a hyperion can fit 5x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates
no you see every corp and alliance theorycrafter responsible for fleet doctrines across eve is wrong and failed to notice what random idiot from perkone has demonstrated before our very eyes
screw hybrids on gallente give drones a warp drive so they can be used in pvp without running out of drones after the first warpout they should work like fighters but only warp with the owner not for others if they are assignedsecondly add an engage target icon button that can be put in a mod position on the ui gallente fixed

you made me lol so hard i spilled coffee all over eft warrior without a clue of real setup demands
i dont use eft but the one thing ive just noticed there is it quotes optimal as 45  13kmahemill let you figure that out for youself you might actually learn something
lol i love it when heroes like you talk trash to mei use eft i also exceed all level vs due to implants
you compare ships with only 2 kind of modules fittet eft warrior indeed did you study hard on how to publish your ignorance and destroy you reputation in 20 seconds before you came up with that brilliant planthere is no way you fly all races as you say you obviously are not an old eve player you might have bought one with plex i dont think you could earn that kind of isk and stay ignorant
troll rejected ive made a personal point of never paying with real money for any gameif you even though about what you were saying before you said it youd see that this thread is about blasters not the ships they are fitted on most amarr laser ships spend a whole bonus on reducing cap usage consider thatedit also it takes a lot of guts to troll with an alt kudos to you
also im gonna abandon this post it seems everyone who comes on assembly hall is all talk and really hasnt left high sec in a yeartwoeditthey seem to believe that battleships one on one and ships dont need to stay close to eachother anyways to rr thinking that the supreme range of lasers is completely op as if they could disrupt from 45km to each ship and gun type their own gallente have wrecking damage but without range lasers have great range control and good damage but heavy capacitor consumption
hey bro you realize your thread is titled gallente boost unnecessary rite youre bad yes clearly if people had left highsec they would know gallente dominate out there wait they dont still bad broyes because being close together to rr each other has alot to do with being in range to shoot peoples oh it doesnt badbut they can hit you from 45km even if this were magical fairy land where only damage within disruptor range counts as you seem to believe gallente still does worse capacitor consumption means alot when you can easily fit a heavy cap booster oh wait it doesnt so badthis doesnt even touch on how akward gallente ships are at fitting how trashy railguns are and as has already been mentioned where are these hyperion blobs you think are just as effective they dont seem to be anywhere you seem incapable of realizing this is because gallente is outclassed congratz professor baddie o7you should also try evaluating ranges by something better then optimalfalloff at which dps is about 30 which is a terrible way to compare range as you would know if you knew what you were talking about if you take a look at optimal12falloff at which dps is about 80 your poorly considered 25 range for pulse and 175 range for blasters which denotes the ranges at which neither weapon is actually effective it appears pulse have 43 more range but that range comparison is useless youre only doing 30 dps durrr a comparison of ranges for 80 dps gives 20 range for pulse and 11 range for blasters which shows a more meaningful difference of 82 greater range for pulse while doing 80 dps that doesnt even count that tes grant greater benefits to lasers simply due to their range already being greater and that laser t2 ammo is far superior youd know all of this if you werent so awful that you apparently never realized optimal is more valuable then falloff is youre either troll or awful take a pick
just tired of managing my real life around the fact that if i dont log friday night ill lose 8 hours of skillpoints and thats if i wake up early the next morningif people quit the game just stop the training time if you pay you train 100 garanteed if you want to push the dev around it make the player select a category and if no skill is next in the list train a random skill you own in selected category that way youll always train something even if you got into a car accident and been in the coma for 5 weeks
so log in thursday night when your current skill dips under 24h and set a long one so youre guaranteed training until you can log in and set the one you wantseriously this is not hard
change your training to another long skill so that your away time is covered until you can log on if youre in a coma i think amarr cruiser v is the least of your concerns
in a game consisting almost entirely of longterm planning and spreadsheets you find it shocking youre expected to consider your skill training times in advance you have 24 hours of leeway which is fine it used to be none which sucked lol
if you dont feel like a slave to this system maybe you should go out more my point is until your subscription runs out you should have 100 training garanteed unless you run out of skills to train that wont break the game its not unfair to anyone and you might even feel a bit of a relief whats not to like about this 
scams will always be a part of the eve universe im pretty sure ccp wants it that way as just another example of the whole eves a hard universe htfu that being said i find it improbable that there is no way to communicate or share scammer information that is a bit more user friendly to the average pilot sort of like a new eden bbb better business bureaurating id recommend a second public rating for user interaction similar to the existing standings indicator it allows one value per user updated maybe daily so that when someone checks the user info it has a reputation value 100 to 100 since each player can only provide one rating on another player id be hard to abuse you can check that before you deal with someone this rating can mean that a particular pilot would honor a pod ransom or not to whether or not to believe any business dealings depending on the pilots profession a pilot screws over a corp it gives them some way of warning others meaning that the potential scammer needs to balance his actionsget some good ratings to balance the badmaybe some ratings fall off after a period of time to represent someone laying low to let the heat die down before their next scam
scams are a part of eveand nobody required you to look at local in jita if youre not scamming or look for a fail scam i have made a pretty isk or too off people that got their contract backwardshehe then just ignore local in jita its not like other games where the chat pane cant be minimizedas for lagthe spam in a text channel doesnt come close to the amount of lag that next freighter warping in so no argument therescams have been removed from new player systems for a reason  jita is a trade hub where all forms of trade take place it isnt as if when you dock your hangar bay fills with hawkers and giant text bubbles of contracts i sure hope incarna will not allow this down the road that would cause lagshort of it is just minimize local it isnt like you were intending to have a conversation in it anyways more importantly unless ccp outlaws scams entirely please dont i find them entertaining to watch when station trading local will never be a truly viable source for the spamming of legitimate contracts  which is why you have a powerful contract search tool at your disposal complete with no text box to deal with spam what a thought genius
seriously im a bitter old vet and even i dont support this scams are a part of eve and always have been its one of the things which add realism to the game its not like local chats are full of intellectual discussions anywayi hate to use the phrase if you dont like it leave but if you find yourself irritated by scams you may have chosen the wrong game to play eve is pvp and that goes well beyond simple pew pew pvp the pvp in market contracts and scams is just as real as the shooting variety of pvp and arguably responsible for more isk movement than destroyed shipsi dont care for scams and i dont hang with people that do but i wont ignore the fact that scams are an important part of eve and the game would be less without themwindjammer
lets get on sisi and try this out shall we so your saying that a neut and warriors do nothing okyeah and other thing lets nerf even more by adding a damn sig nerf wtf  shall we just stop using mwd altogether thenplus im not talking just about ceptors as usual ccp go overboard cos ppl whine the facts are1 ships got a speed rebalance anyway why wasnt that good enough2 mwds are not really viable anymore because almost everyone fits a scram3 soloing isnt really part of eve anymore so your guaranteed gangs that one person as a scram one has a disrupter4 webifiers are there to slow ships down so why have a scram thats inst stops a ship just increase the range of webs5 then they add yet another nerf on mwd sig so even if you have a mwd on a small ship you get a massive sig and get insta locked6 your saying i should fit am ab on ceptor  really its supposed to have a mwd its a ceptor again this inst just about ceptorswtf seriously talk about going overboardunless you can give me a good argument on why this is here  i cant agree on why it should be there
scram 9km small neut 6km  thats a whopping 3km worth of leeway which is huge in the frigate realmdrones can be popped right quick if you know what you are doing and only pose a significant threat if there are ecxxx mixed in which mess up smalls something fierceyou dont say  guess thats why i use the terms smalls and small hull the ab interceptor ps was added because you thumbed your nose at the idea which can only mean you have limited knowledge of the interceptor as a classtremendous power in the ab combat inty against targets that otherwise eat them as snacks like the autothrasherbecause it adds complexity prior to qr everyone and their mother had 24km point and a 90 web scrams were never ever used except by pirate campers targeting wcs haulers the god web obsoleted frigates and most cruisersbcs you simply did not undock in anything but bs or nanohacs  boring is putting it mildlyfitting for combat today requires more than reading up on the latest fotm and allows for lots more variety than before thanks in large part to qrs changes  including the revised scrams
thank you for a refreshing explanation shame most people cant post like thisyou have to remember people do not fight 1v1 anymore those times are past this would be fine for 1v1s on another small hull but ppl fly in gangs with webs with warp disrupters with medium neuts not small onesyou ceptor is smoke mate
i only mentioned ceptors in my original point as it was mentioned in the op however i still stand that warriors arent that big of an issue to a decent frigate pilot and neuts can be overcome without too much troublei never mentioned adding a sig nerf i was making a point that even if scrams didnt stop mwds you still wouldnt be able to use them to speed tank anything really due to the increased signature radius you get from using the mwd in the first place although you didnt specifically mention ceptors in your op they are perfectly viable with abs particularly the combat variants as they work best inside scram range for the most part anyway the tackle ceptors shouldnt be entering scram range if they are being used for their role  ie tackling as hiranda already pointed out having scrams no longer stop webs will make them pointless as a mod except for stopping stabbed ships and having web range will do more to kill frigate chances against larger ships than the scram currently doesfor example you approach a ship with your mwd on making sure to keep your tranversal high enough then the ship webs you from say 18km you slow down but your sig stays up because you wont switch your mwd off straightaway the opposing larger ships guns then have no problems tracking you from that distance and you popthe scramweb changes when they came in really helped a frigates chances against larger opponents as the original 90 web combined with medium guns shredded frigates however it did make blasters a bit lacklustrehaving said all that i would love to have a preweb changes armor cane now dual 90 web would be so ridiculousedit messed up the quoting a little first time round

those mission existed and were removed in 2006
first of all this is the part you failed to find
the only miners in this game now are macro miners anyway so what is the point ccp are trying to remove them from the game but it is simply impossible by far mining is the most unpleasant money making technique in the game and in the recent years it became economically inefficient so following this line of thoughts which is correct we can conclude that the only miners are macrominersi agree with the idea of legal macromining i might even start using the skills ive learned 5 years ago now they are totally useless
i support this idea as long as the presence of a macromining module on a ship causes concord to ignore all agression against it
thank you trebor and seleene for the previews seleene i think did a better job in disguising that not much is allowed to be reported at this time and the discussion in this thread was helpful in raising expectations again about whats to come
last year about this time csm was able to inform players that ccp had decided to hold off on most space ship related stuff and work on incarna for the next 18 months we saw through subsequent dev blog the extensive number of devs that left the spaceship aspect of the game for other things like dust and incarna 18 months is going to be up in december about  six months out any word on whether they will be able to reassign those devs to the space ship game in 6 months
just a bit more of an explanation if anyone on the csm was unaware of what happened last yearback in june 2010 ccp was very upfront with csm that many space ship related matters in eve would be on hold for 18 months due to incarna and dust well that is going to be up in december following those minutes in july 2010 we received this dev blog
omg i have found some sample source codeinclude pwnagehint tearcollectornoob carebear tears bucket tears x  holds the carebear tears x  suicidegankcarebear  bucket  pwn the carebear hard add tears to the bucket printfdie noob  says hello return x return filled tear bucket
is there any reason why the source code for the client could not be made open source at least that would mean if there were bugs they could be found and reported quicker by the people looking through it also i dont think having private servers is a threat to ccp how many people would want to move to an empty server and also look at the power it takes to keep tranquility up anyway the threat of a rival server is virtually nothingplz ccp give us code access so we can all work together for a better game 
incarna cannot be compelling unless it is enforced the day that was said this argument was over when it was repeated during fanfest that really removed any potential of a wide variety of considerations ranging from the psychological to the commerciallook on the bright side players have already found ways to not load incarna and ccp are at this point not forcing you to use only incarna provided ui elements be happy alternatively be quiet get a watch
i see a light at the end of the tunnel
in eve you should always assume this is an oncoming train
bump
why didnt i support this before
ccp you are saddening me aswell i dont care at all about your captains quarters that will bore us for a year until then you maybe figure out walking in stations in 2012 i cant imagine by then ccp will have more than a dozen different station layoutsvery slow progress and i thought incursion was going to finally get changes but very few insignificant impacted for the good where are the new t3 ships just cruisers huh this has been a long wait aswelldoes ccp think incarna is going to seriously interest new subscribers with one room to walk in theyre going to think the game developers really half assed the station part on the getgo they probably wont care enough to wait a year for ccp to release new parts of the station total flop idea for getting new subs in
my love my anger and all of my support
nowhen ccp presented their idea for how motherships were to be turned into supercaps the whole motherships community had a total meltdown lashing out in furious nerdrage in several epic threadnaughts but as always ccp stood firm refusing a knejerk reaktion to the whining and ing therefore we got a well balanced supercap line right from the start
434750
boded the dumb parts everyone was wrong ccp mothership pilots and ccp again supercarriers need to be nerfedsupercaps are not balanced supers are now an i win button just like aoe doomsdays were before 00 warfare has become who is able to field the most supers and all 00 alliances are complaining that it is really not fun anymore it has degenerated to the point where fleets will just disband if the other side has more supers logged on meaning no more epic pew pew space battles this is not to say epic battles dont occur just everyone realizes that if one side can jump in 20 while the other can get 10 it is pretty much guaranteed that the side able to field ten supers might as well just go home even if their support fleet outnumbers the other 51
what i was trying to convey here originates in my perception that ccps method to achieve gamebalance through community feedback has become a very blunt instrument they have built in an incentive to whine and moan and those you typically will here from the most are those with the least grasp on or interest in actual balancecontrary to what the average caod poster will tell you those players with the most time end effort vested into the game are not necessarily those who will give you the most unbiased view on balance issuesim well aware of the current supercarrier farce and my statement therefore we got a well balanced super cap line from the start was meant to be taken as anything but an honest assessment on current super carriers i thought most people would get that
id like it too pos should have one difference from stations limited space for ships and stuff and ceo or director could assign each member some space in the pos which he could use however he wants
bad ideai do not want to wake up one morning to find some of my corp members have backstabbed the corp by setting up a personal pos in my system which i dont have access to so that they can begin to force me and everyone else outsure they can backstab by bringing a different corp into my system so they can set a tower up but please lets not make it easier for them
well if i were to go by just the first and last pages id say its pretty much a unanimous noclearly nobody is looking at other possibilities or where ccp could go with this clearly nobody is taking into account that new players or more recent players could get a leg up benefit from the introduction of microtransactions or they just dont really care personally i think the newbs should benefit from the option to microtransaction there way ahead a bit and its not like old players would suffer from it given they could do the same if they really thought they needed to yeah right alliances that can afford to bid 30 billion for a slot in tounament ix really need a lot of help heck wonder about those guys that got access to original t2 bpos or have researched bpos for caps and more to the point they can produce cheaper and faster than anyone else no thats completely fair to any new player especially those that are completely unavailable unless someone happens to decide to sell and then the only ones that can afford it are the big alliances with all the capitalthis game is already so balanced that a microtransaction for 50 to buy a titan wouldnt damage it thats sarcasm by the way for those arrogant enough to assume everyone else is dimwitted trolls im looking at you mostlyjust to be different and because i dont immediately assume ccp is stupid and microtransactions are going to completely obliterate everything im going to vote yesyesjust not cosmetic ones that would lack integrity as ccp has already stated that such things as character customization would always be free the portrait and tweak part anyway if someone wants to spend 10 on a new shirt or a pair of styling shades then go for itwhat are you afraid of
noccp must listen players sometimes we have unbalance in ships after they fix this i will say cosmetics only but right now i want fixed game not a glamour look or somethingwhere is my ewfrigateswhere is 4th bonus for assault frigswhere is all hybrid boatsrokh can shoot at 200km but warp range 150 make this useless change role to rokh from supersniper to something usefull or make 250km warp rangewhy do we need dreadnought if we have supercapscounter for subcap blob is bombers counter for supercap blob is biger supercap blob where is rockscissorspaper rulewhere is missileturrets models why do you hate caldari so muchwhen i play eve i want actualy fly on my ships not paint and look at it its a bad joke from ccp and i read this like you cant fly but u can make them look better

those who support please dont forget to check the little support this topic box when you post
youre ed you know how hard its going to be to load the station compared to precqnot that it matters to me lol

as the topic name says please csm pass it to ccpif they implement vanity items avaible for plex convertible currency it will no metter what they say about that drastically increase plex pricesjust look at today plex price and 100m rise jita plex cost just few hours after blog disclosing new currency it will go much fartherplease allow players to buy aur for money and trade them like plexes for isk but dont allow plexaur conversionit will still be possible via plexisk tradeaur but will not remove plex from game like plexaur conversion
supporting my own idea 
10
conditionally supportedi have faith that ccp will be able to monitor the plex prices but if anything were to happen it could mess up the market better safe than sorry
yeah actually think this is a bad idea too buying the clothesstuff on market for isk is fine buying plex for isk is fine buying items for aur is fine i will point out that the dev blog doesnt say anything about buying aur for isk though only that you can convert a plex into aur and theyll be monitoring plex prices to balance the plex to aur conversion without that conversion aur will be unobtanium
once everyone has dressed up their space barbies plex will experience the typical post patch crash again this is just typical prepatch speculation driven higher with speculation on space barbie accessories being hot ticket items everybody is forgetting that there will be a secondary market later on when everyone has purchased their space barbie accessories there will be aur left over which will get sold for iskplexauriskplexlooks like a new isk sink to me not supported
not supported either the market will stabilize because it must ccp will not allow the plex cost to rise too much as they have an investment far greater than any player in this thread or elsewhere to keep people using itthere has been too much fear mongering thus far on something that hasnt even happened and may not happen at alland i pay for both my subs with plex so im not immune to plex costs rising whatsoever i just choose not to take an alarmist position before the damned patch is eve released just wait till the patch and see what happens you may end up feeling dumb for losing your mind over nothinghowever you cant separate the damned aur from the plex or it negates the whole purpose of the system which is to make money if plex is not consumed for this process then no money is made for ccp
where do you see sink in here nowhere in this process isk leaves game only changes hands it is plex that leaves game rising plex priceyes there is if aur is made using rl money just like plex is
this makes no sense in a game where intel is so important
wtf are you smoking youre either brand spanking new to eve and dont understand mechanics or youre an idiot scratch that we already know youre an idiot sounds to me like your can baiting outside a station and your ed off cause ppl take ur obvious bait and dock right after they loot it then they wait out the 15 mins and ur sol awe poor baby if youre talking about looting missions last i saw theres no station in missions so wtf r u talking about if ur that peeved about it pvp fit ur mission ship and blast him
ninja looting is a profession just like scamming just like shipping drugs just like suicide ganking i dont do any of these because i find missions more profitable and fun with my buddies then waiting for an expensive target to roll around we all lack patience dont ask how we ended up on eveshort of it is this with the new agent changes ninja looters have their work cut out for them because mission hubs will for now on exist only because thats where everyone used to go over time this will break down and ninjas will simply hang out around constellations with multiple lvl 4 agentssolution to ninjas salvage or lootfly with a buddyor six trust me that one ninja will try to loot just to see if you can kill him dont screw it up keep an inty handy seriously though bring a buddy to help salvage the room as youre in it or fly in right after for those fleettouchy missions flying solo always youre missing out on eve and the point of an mmo so youre beyond help reallyrelocate to a different agent you only have to move two ships your mission boat and your salvage boat if you have one moving gear shouldnt be an issue since the second boat usually has a sizable hold if you dont have the second boat and fly a marauder stop failing at salvaging your own missions while there if you dont have any salvaging boatwhy the hell are you complainingfor the wealthy get a few shuttles and a few mission ships dispersed around various agents and systems got a pesky ninja leave him for one of your other agents theyre all q20 now so just travel time at this point its hard to be a ninja when theres nothing to you know ninjamy favorite gank em most ninjas fly dirt cheap ships since they might get ganked or killed if they loot most fly fast ships to actually accomplish the task of ninja salvaging if your a mission tycoon a lost destroyer or two isnt going to keep ammo out of your battleship go for maximum gank and keep ten or twenty of them handy why so when he comes back you can get him again a ninja will move on if he knows youre going to make it more trouble than the salvage is worthtldr suck it up there are ways to deal with ninjas they are but one challenge the game can offer for crying out loud its an mmo and eve for that matter youll only dumb the game down further by removing the criminal element of the game eve is a lawless universe hisec and lowsec its not perfectsec
what
buy a marauder and shut the  up
yet another trolling idiot  yeah taht helps when they fecking insta dock stupid idiottrolls are trolls boringsimple fact they need docking timer  anyone says otherwise give me a god damn reason
the reason is that you are making no sense and have shouted why can they insta dock so many times that people are ignoring youreasons have already been given thieves can insta dock people who shoot first cant end of storyif you dont like it stop shooting people around the station if you are one of those irritating station baiters then you will find no sympathy
how about no
this stop playing station games and your troubles will go away
seeing your both dumb  prob reason why your get reset  the simple fact is everyone who gets agression they cant dock  why should this be differentalso whats the point of having aggression if they can instantly dock and wait it out  it doesnt make senseand not one person has given a reasonable argument against this and why they should be able to dock  not one  just more ninja looter trolls crying cos they might haev to work for onceand kill keep shouting they should be able to dock  because quite simply they shouldntsorry i aint backing down no maytter how many trolls there are
this is evebut fair is fair we should and everyone in your pc corp should be able to shoot them not pod just a nice pop i know ninja are part of eve like pirates are but the concord should know that they have stolenstill like to hear others players thoughts
resetalso stealing  is not the same as shooting someone why should station owners care who steals something why do bait can gatecamps need a boost fyi im not a just more ninja looter trolls crying cos i might haev to work for once i just happen to think you lick windows in your spare time
yup
yes i give my support
i just boldet and underlined to some of you who cant or probably simply dont want to read whole idea from begin to the end
its not fair you gonna throw a tantrum now seriously all you whiners about neutral rr just  because your to damn lazy to think tactics all you want to have to do is bring gank dps lets imagine for a moment theres a game called rock paper siccors roshambo or whatever rock beats siccors paper beats rock siccors beats paper the idea is u and ur opponent shake ur fists 3 times in unison on the third shake u hand gesture ur attack but heres the catch you dont know what hes gonna do so you study ur opponent get all mental and jedi like to out witt your opponent if you keep bringing the rock dont  cause he keeps bringing the paper helps your odds of winning if you throw in a siccor or twoif by now youre still wondering what the siccors are in relation to eve well you just flat suck and need to learn to evebtw just so you all know rr ships are available on the market to everyonegrow a brain get a clue stop whining and learn to evethis thread definitely not supported
sorry you dont have any friends
oh stop crying  please dont take away my alt repper cos im so lame at pvp i cant fight properly  bhwaaaa
seems to me that you arent mad about nuet rrs as much as other people having them when you dontit is completely fair in the aspect of a 10 man corp decs a 10 man corp well you should consider that fact that your opponent may have that before wardeccing someone aswell as you can utilize nuet rr yourselfas far as your gcc comment they already are red to you as soon as they rep your target and are targets free for you too shoot although i would like to see an aggression timer where you cant dock or jump for a minute be implemented just as if they were shooting you since they are contributing to the battle just as much as anyone
except they dont because it all happens in peoples heads hence why its called psychological warfare for it to work someone has to start being emotional
so when a miner or ratter gets killed by a cloaker that had been afk for days it didnt really happen its all in his head edit and im feeling so generous that ill even anticipate and post your responsethen hes not afkand again ill respond that a teaspoon does not stop being a teaspoon because you fill it with cough syrup and ill ask you to stop playing on the literal definition of the words afk cloaker and again well start another circular reasoning discussion pby the way notice how your defense position will switch from its all psychological and in the ratters mind to well ok afk cloaking can net you kills but its necessary to counter local or its for a good cause it helps against bottingyour arguments are pretty much baitandswitch and lead to circular reasoning and well just spend days going round and round
botters should never be a defence for keeping afk cloaking i look at that as more of a bonus rather than a basis for keeping it do you not consider it to be psychological warfare when they are afkas far as the ratter is concerned there are many that continue to rat with an enemy in local ive done it myself in the past sure you could lose a ship but we all had systems in place and took certain steps it never bothered us and in fact made things a lot more enjoyable especially when they lost what you and others are asking for isnt balance balance would be an approach that linked local and cloaking in a change im all for that
again you are arguing semantics but yes afk cloaking as in the technique not the literal definition is among other things psychological its psychological because the ratterminer does not know when the afk cloaker is at the keyboard or afk but to claim it is only psychological is deceptive and dishonest afk cloaking as in the profession not the literal definition projects a real threat and a miner or ratter that stops viewing it as such will eventually end up losing his ship do you see why afk cloaking is a real threat and not just psychological as you implynow ill just emphasize that i dont have a problem with a minerratter losing his ship in 00 for getting careless its part of the job what i have a problem with is that an afk cloaker as in the profession not the literal definition is able to be careless and not suffer the consequences in situation where he should  this is what id like to see changed in other words add risk to afk cloaking the profession not the literal definition and im not asking for ccp to take away the risk that cloakers and even afk cloakers bring im asking ccp to add risk to them as well this is not an unreasonable request what i find unreasonable is that people want to keep afk cloaking again the profession riskfree with no one having the ability to bring unconsensual pvp to them the same way they are able to bring unconsensual pvp to others this by all means is unfair and not balancedthis simply isnt true for a very long time ive openly stated i would welcome the removal of local as long as it is a fair and balanced change i however do not welcome the removal of local without a suitable replacement that is fair to all parties except botters of coursei dont mind cloakers cloaking in a system and terrorizing local i dont mind cloakers subverting local i dont mind cloakers doing exactly what they do now except that they are able to do it while they sleep or are at school and that is the only thing id like to see changedso i will ask you again since you havent answered the question yet why are you against afk cloakers being exposed to a little risk
solution to afk cloaking is easy make a cloaking device use cap at a rate that increaces cap use over time eventually the coaking device will use cap faster than it recharges cap dies then cloaking device fails
then the cloaker cant recloak due to no cap and dies due to having very weak tanks regardless of whether the cloaker was afk or not to begin with
currently all fights in null sec are decided by dropping super capitals on the field to win a fight they should otherwise be losing everyone can see this from the invasion in the north invaders start losing a fight they drop superstitious on the field for the i win button this is also happening in low sec as wellthere have been other ideas out on how to nerf them but they are all pretty much inspiring that is until nowwhat i propose is that in addition to isotopes for super caps to jump they should also have a daily maintenance fee in the recent dev blog there will be a new currency called aurum in order to be able to do anything with the super capital like jump deploy fighter bombers use the doomsday or even warp one would need to pay the aurum maintenance after logging in this amount should have some meaningful amount like 5001000 aurumthis would also encourage super capital pilots to keep them logged in if they plan on using them no more of this log in hot drop get safe log out to hide number and rinse and repeated garbage obviously you can log in and cloak but if you want to use the super you need to pay for the maintenance first
not even amusing110
i missed you cromo
oh op youre such a maroon
moron you mean
i see that went ten feet over your headas to the op get out
try reading before you end up 6 feet under really helpsps and yes i got the jokeim only stating the obviousbut it seems that was a little over your head
seeing how the maller will soon be redesigned im sure many of the less than pleasant looking ships will follow and im sure the moa will be one of them seeing pretty new ships would be great and all because some of this ships in the game are hideous blackbird and imicus come to mind but thats not really what they have going for them part of why the moa comes up in discussion is that fact that it is as ugly as it is what would happen if our popular resident ugly duckling became a supermodel like everyone else sure they all will look pretty but the reputation the moa will receive as one of the ugliest ships in eve will be dashed away in a polished symmetrical hazetldr updating the textures on the moa is fine but please leave the model the way it is when it comes time for it to be looked at by ccps art team i love my ugly duckling and id hate to have to say goodbye to it
considering the way the scorpion hull was redesigned i imagine all ships will be getting a sleep figurebut one that maintains hallmark looks you can bet the moa will still have a big box on its side for no reason and a crane neckequally for no reason the blackbird will likely continue to be the happy meal box of doom
the moa is hideous and the quicker someone dumps that model in a ditch somewhere the betterid like an onyx that i can look at please
on a scale of 110 how mad are youchanges made to eve wont affect me as i said i can fly any race just dont think its necessary
ah both then k
1 and thats only for the stupidity inherent in your terrible posting
free education on why hybrids are not very useableoptimal range is poorfalloff range is pooralpha is poordamage output is poortracking should be bettercap use needs to be loweredfittings need to be looked atuseless in fleetlagdoing thermkin your actually doing less damage than a weapon that can do emexpthing is hybrids are not very useful in most situations and it would be a boost too two races which are in dire need of itjust because you dont seem to understand this even with your amazing skillpoints and eft skills
wow its a good thing you said that because ccp was going to quit space sims and start buffing gallentegallente obviously does not need a boost just look at all those gallente ships flying around
quite simply they want you to actually have to keep track of you training somewhat and login once in a while as opposed to afksubscription training accounts mindlessly because activity is good for the game and training for 6 months without even playing the game once is not
why on earth would ccp give a  about people who are paying but arent actually logging in its free money
because they want them to keep paying forever and people dont pay for a dead game where people hardly login because they dont feel like they have tomost mmos have some sort of mechanic to encourage players to remain active eves 24 hour limited training queue is one of the most mild methods thegametonotbenamed has dailies honor point limits instance timers and literally endless gear grinding all designed in a manner to encourage players to remain consistently active over extended periods of time in comparison eves method of encouraging activity is downright flexible and user friendly most folks simply dont realize the sutble intentions behind alot of these game mechanics
that logic path doesnt apply for eve a lot of people are still paying that wouldnt be in another playtolevel mmorpg
sniped me before i edited meh it is what these sorts of keepactive kind of mechanics are put in place for whether you think theyre effective or not its the reason they were put into place
they arent effective so they are fail mechanics
i dont see how logging for 25 minutes is seen as a necessary need for ccp mindless what are you talking about  the solution im proposing will ensure that youre training something doesnt mean youll get the optimum route to access the best stuff its a solution for the unfortunate the busy and active people of this game training time is why we pay or id just take a break and cancel the subscription for 23 months
doesnt mean it cant be changed what if i spent all week in front of a computer at work and i dont even want to sit in front of it the weekend cause i have stuff to do and its sunny outside why should i be penalized for that  i want some liberty damn it
then drop a level 5 into trainingthe multibillion dollar mmo gaming industry disagrees to be perfectly honest it probally wouldnt take me long to quit eve if i wasnt in the habit of logging on at least a little bit each day to checkadjustmaintain my skill training and end up doing something else too i just wouldnt bother with keeping my subscription up when i didnt even have to log on kinda a vicious cycle of laziness and im sure theres plenty enough folks as lazy as metens of thousands tbhpeople who feel no need to log on tend to play infrequently and people who play infrequently tend to stop playing this is the entire idea behind games attempting to have meaningful longterm progressionsgrinding for gear training skills that keep you playing regularly because people playing regularly dont quit very muchbe it level progression buying that new ship skill training raids periodic content updates havesting your crops on farmville or genuinely just for fun anything that keeps you regularly logging on an mmo is a good thing from a business perspectivehabit at doing these things is almost the only reason i bother to play games after ive figured most everything out and im content with that
your mistake is confusing the skill change process with the methods of keeping endgame players busyfirst of all the skill changes rarely happen at convenient times or even days the queue is helpful but does not actually dump the problemi appreciate the queue because i often cant be online when a skill finishes but i still have to pay a disproportionate amount of time to maintain my awareness of the skill cycling which rarely happens when i actually do login to playlogging in just to change the skills or add to the queue is a con not a pro it always has been
i actually quit playing farmville because of that mechanic along with every othe facebook game and the only reason i ever played was to be sociable people send invite play to make them happy game turns out to bea high maintenance endless grind so you decide its not really worth itgrinds really bite to be honest and they dont even remotely hold my interest in a game the more grind the more gone
and how do people who only log onto the game for 5 minutes to update a skill add to the gaming experience for everyone else your logic and ccps logic here fail the only thing it may do is help ccp inflate their daily log on numbers by making it look like the game is more active than it ispoint is you pay for it you should be able to set your skills up as far in advance as your sub is paid for if you buy 48 plex and turn them into game time you should be able to set you que up for the next 4 years the loss of those who would log in only to update a que is no loss at all
hey thanks even a better idea here
this has been an integral part of the game since its creationif you have a problem with it the door is on the left and dont let it hit you on the way out
it was already changed once just saying
if it was changed once it can be changed again as it exists now it serves no purpose other than to make you have to log on to keep updating skills and the only reason they would want someone to do that would be to inflate log on numbersdoes anyone have another explanation
if it got you to log on it was a win for business simple as thatthis has less impact for older players who have long training times and are typically more entangled in the game in other ways but consider the new playerwith limited training queueday 1logs on for the first timesorta figures some things outsets skills to trainid better log on tomorrow to set new skillsdoes random stufflogs offday 2logs onsets skills to trainid better log on again tomorrow to set moredoes random stufflogs offday 3same as the previous day repeated for a long timewithout limited training queueday 1logs on for the first timesorta figures some things outoh i can queue up skills forever ill wait until im skilled in battleships cuz bigger is better obviouslysets skills to train to the end of timeid better wait a few months until im traineddoes random stufflogs offday 2nothingday 3same as the previous day repeated for a long timegive or take a few months laterwell i dont really play that game anywaysunsubscribesif you cant see the basic business sense of getting people to regularly log on to your game i really dont know how to explain it to you
you pay to train thats the basic of it after reading most of your comments its as if youre implying towork at cpp and have been part of the development processhave conducted or read extensive research on gamers consuming profilehave read or conducted surveys on eve players and know what they thinkthe change wouldnt impact you obviously but to enlighten your mind just ask a nongamer your parents or uncle or any other friends who dont play games and explain to them the training process that requires you to log every now and then so that you dont lose any benefit from the game you pay for their reaction will be closer to the truth than youll ever beedit also with your stupid example youre implying that the training process hooks people on the game meaning that if i was mentally unbalanced i could play 48 hours in a row forget the baby baby dies go on trial and justify that the system of the game caused this because it works like her0in and win my case  cant believe the name of this drug is censoredpeople wont stop playing they will just have one less burden on their mind and one less chore to fill before going to bed
well that was a wildly inappropriate comment seriously without change progress is not possible quit the ultraconservative mentality before it ruins you
so this comes in and i assume youre removing attributes tooim specced perint can i use my continuous skill training to skill up a pile of social skills easily i wouldnt be logging in and you are trying to remove all of the disadvantages of not logging in right
you seem under the illusion that what players want and what is best for a game are the sameregardless if you cant plan ahead far enough to drop a long skill in training when you cant bother to log on for 30 seconds to update your skill queue the next day spreadsheets online probally isnt for you
siriusly guys how dumb is thati can set up buy contract for lets say not existend in game bpo for daredevil  but has no way to set up buy contract for existend bpc of same shiptumb up if you are agree with that this must be fixed
its not getting scammed or even knowing how to read its the frakin hosers spamming up local that es people off all that you see in jita is an occaisional 1 in 500 legit statementcommentsnippet of conversation a bunch of people warning about scams and 98 of the rest is scams and it rolls by at one message every 02 seconds it is the most annoying aggravating reason not to play eve ive ever seen and then you leave jita or change to some other channel and heave a sigh of reliefof course you might want to take into account that my main is in jita and ive not logged in for more than 2 minutes in the last 4 weeks and that about twice
which is why there is help chat or recruitment or your own private channel or best minimize chat seriously if this is your only legitimate reason for being angry about scams how on earth do you handle spammers in other channels oh waitblockhmm ever thought about using that on these guys believe it or not scammers dont replace their characters like rmt does or not at the same rate anyhow you obviously dislike them and thus will never talk to them just block them and presto you have a clean local
logging into jita and seeing local causing me to lose all interest in playing eve for the day is reason enough obviously you havent spent much time in local in jita the messages role by so fast you have to scroll up to block them and they just keep bumping and you cant block anyhow that and there are so many scammers youd fill your block list in an hour or two at least probably 20 minutes or less in realitylocal is auto on log in btw help chat what for so i can get unrealistic or biased advice kind of like what i find here actually which is why i keep telling you all to  offdislike them hardly i could care less and have no idea who they are thought has occured to me that scamming is a perfect way of laundering rmt isk though or better yet delivering it so yeah some of them could be rmts a lot of them are just inconsiderate jerks who have attained unprecedented levels of nerdom some are obviously on drugs or alcohol or both while others claim to be and arent most are relatively intelligent while lacking any sense or decency like most other players in eve while some are obviously lacking in real intelligence and others are too smart for their own good most think theyre smarter than everyone else while actually being of considerably average intelligencei talk at them sometimes and sometimes they actually respond but usually i consider this a bad ssign as im probably being blocked by everybody in jita local for talking atto them in the first place it becomes talking to when they respond you know following which any response on your part makes you onbe of them in everybody elses eyes did i mention people are stupid it shows when they jump to conclusions or assume you are doingthinking something they somehow stereotype to you in a single two sentence conversationi might not stick around much anyhow being as eve has become something it wasnt when i started playing nothing to do with the devs its actually strictly a playerbase issue see the thing of it is most of you are s and i dont like you much not everybody but the ones that arent are too few and dropping like flies everyday they dont want to play this game with you any more than i do go figure
ministry of mining and industry  is the corp the op is in should explain why he thinks an interceptor is for getting in close and putting our damagenot take advantage of how fast it can be with an ab and the extended warp jammer range cuz thats exactly what i do in my arazuget in really close so my damps and bonus to tackle range is useless so my weak dps and flimsy tank can get the enemy a quick t2 kill
i think its is fair to say that just for continuities sake that covert reconfig t3s should be able to use the covert cyno just due to the fact that all other cov ops boats can so why not make it fair and to what the description originally said about the subsystem although i can also understand that having the interdiction nullifier on it can be considered a little unfair because how much easier it would be to light the cov ops cyno where ever you wanted a fair compromise tho i believe if ccp doesnt want to add it for what ever reason it maybe would be to extend the range of the portal slightly farther than it is now 2 extra lyrs would be phenomenal when it comes to moving around for those who live in low sec to move into the 00 regions your cyno boats still have to take a risk getting to where they need to go but leaves new opportunities to those of us that dont live or want to live in 00 to access the different types of pvp that are available in the game

that qen is not new it is months oldit has been discussed to death by experts on the eve economy in the market discussion forumthe economy is actually suffering from deflation
i think when you dock it should be to the standard original view and you should have to choose to exit your pod to the cq its almost dumb that ccp didnt consider this i like to look close at my ship and spin it around it was simple and preferable at times sure ive tried the cq and i like it but the most recent build on duality saw the removal of the change appearance button from the right station panel now you can only access it from the mirror in the cq that is a big ing no nodespite whether or not we get a choice between hanger views we shouldnt have to use the cq to do anything once docked or else its a deal breaker

with the new adition of player retribution for the smuggling mechanic planned for the near future i have been wondering how this addition could be expanded upon it comes in two parts as one will supliment the other so here goesmy first line of though ran as follows with the bounty mechanic so badly broken i have thought of a way we can revamp it there are two main ways to revamp it that i have come up with now bounties are mostly levied on pirates i suggest that bounties start mounting automatically on a percentage of the isk they detroyloot make it a small percentage like 1 or 2 or 3 percent you can even make the percentage higher for the security level dropthe lower security the higher percentage and that the bounty is collectable on destruction of the pirates ship not his pod this will add two things to the game the profession bounty hunters will become a real profession with people able to actually collect bounties to make it a sustainable profession you could even add a sec status increase like npc pirates the second thing this will add will be a new minigame for pirates who can get the biggest bounty on them before losing it to someone furthermore player added bounties can still be added and can be collected upon destruction of said pirates ship and here comes the new twist the player who issued the bounty will have say if it pays out in other words if the pirate creates an alt and blows up a newbship with the alt then the player can say no to the payout and keep the bounty still on the pirate also another mechanic i would introduce is the standings being tracked by the game to ensure one bluecorpmate cant shoot a pirate that is friendly to him and collect the bounty and share it with the pirate also a tracking of acounts will be a good idea so that no pirate can use his spy alt or other such thing to collect bounties on their heads eg ip logging credit card logging fleet history logging etc the other way to change bounties is not on total isk destroyed but lets say 10 of the value of the ship that the pirate is flying make it low enough that there will be no profit for the pirate to blow up his own ship even if it is insuredthe next part where player retribution is concerned is this allow pirates into highsec upon entering highsec faction police place a tag onto the pirate which then apears in everyones overview as a warpable object now if a pirate enters lowsec he will still suffer from the finger of doom by concord if he does engage a player that doesnt engage him first this way we have a pirate in highsec who has a bounty on him and is a warpable object which will mean players can exact retribution from him and make a few isk i am sure ccp will be a lot better than myself at changing the mechanics to make it more balanced but this is the broad outline of my idea please note that pirates will still be killable by anyone in highsec
making cq optional upon docking and generally not immersion breaking as its a feature supposed to be about making the game more immersive seems to be a pretty hot topic atm and its proliferating threads like mad might want to add this thread to your listi also would have thought that the issue of now only having 50 fittings for the fitting tool would have been a worthy issue
oh god please i would take my redeemer out of the hangar if even just as a temporary compromise we could fit covertops cloaks untill ccp gave blops a proper overhaulthey have such potential 
slightly better jump range nothing too extreme thoughbetter fuel usagebridging anything immediately starts eating up your fuel and having a cov hauler or two is helpful but eats more fuel as wellother than those two things im very happy with my panther i dont feel like they need much more of a boost
ive seen a lot of this kind of posting in a view games they all have some things in commonnothing happens after if something happens it is taking too long and is not what the community want and the most disturbing thing is that i still believe one day the developer will listen to what we say so after finishing the whine lets try to do something productive im a gallente pilot whit passion and this means i love and hate them in a balance auf 5050ships i like and i think they work very well dominix ishtar nemesis ishkur  well thats it this ships all have one thing in common they dont use gunnery ships from the gallente which i dont like are the remaining why is that so well i thing the gunnery isnt effective at all i dont want to repeat all the stuff other already have posted in this forum the second thing is the huge mass the most ships work to inertial third is the  to armor repair amount i really dont fly the ships with this bonus and if would fly them for example in pvp i wont use this bonus so for me this bonus is useless and waste i dont have a solution for the gunnery but a suggestion for the armor repair bonus just remove it and put something else in dont really know what maybe rework the whole gallente race to a hulltank but dont forget to find a solution for the logistic in the pvp logistic and pvp is exact the next point i like to talk about the new and most common alphastrikefleets are a pain in the ass it is boring like hell the lag decide who wins and who loose you cant repair any longer every time a ship is being attacked it blows up in a few seconds the most logistic pilots are frustrated me as well of the inaction even if you cant chance this you have to do something about the abaddon im not saying you have to nerf it in to shrimps but try to lift up the other bss to more effectively of a abaddon the most and very important thing is do something about 23h cloaking in a systemwell that all for now again wasted time of wring for nothing meri
cosmetic onlyi can understand the fact that ccp want or need more money from its subscribers even if most of them are already fueling 2 or more account and buying plexes but even if microtransactions sould become a reality it must not come to break the market balance that rules in new eden
no
i vote cosmeticthere is no harm in cosmetic microtransactions furthermore when one considers that the current proposed microtransaction available items can all be bought with isk assuming players sell them it again proposes no harm we can all make isk while concern about microtransactions having the effect of people with disposable income dumping lots of money over to ccp for almost meaningless items or for items that will be resold for isk this may and most likely will benefit both sides it gives ccp money for a small amount of effort i guess may draw new subscribers and gives us some new scenery which may be more needed then you think also money going to ccp is never a bad thing well almost never and may provide them with what they need to make the game better
noi already am fully against the plex systemfor this simple reason i aint pay for playing roleplay if cosmetics are to be paid with rl currency directly or indirectly i do not pay with rl currency to play with any kind of special battleship i do not see why i should pay in rl currency for special accessories to roleplay i already pay a subscription that should give me access to the whole game developping parts of a nonfreetoplay mmo for only the people that can afford them is bad form

escgeneral settingscheckuncheck enter cq when dockingadd to captains quarters button in normal viewadd to hangar button in cq viewbe able to keep them both when walking in stations comes outdoesnt hurt you doesnt hurt me and i said all that with out getting sand in my vajayjay and acting like a child
agreed everytime you make space barbie instead of spaceship  gods kills a kitten pls ccp dont kill kittens 
yesloading the station environment hurts performance maybe i dont want that maybe i dont like waiting the extra two seconds for the pointless bull interface to load whats that you want to encourage me to use captains quarters then make me want to use captains quarters
make it optional
yes to bring an analogy chocolate is nicebeing forced to eat chocolate every time you want to do some thing thats not nice
optional please since i have zero interest nor does anyone else in our alliance that i have heard in cq maybe a year or three down the road there might be enough cq content or such to actually use it but for now i just want my option to disable cq since i dont want it nor plan to use it
you promised us for over four years the wis stuff would be optional ccp make it so edit buggy forums
optional cq supported reasons why are detailed in this thread and many others
they will never listen on this point but well
i doubt theyre going to listen at this point but ill add my support
reduce market price entry errors by1 make price entry text much bigger text size reduces with higher resolutions to where decimals and numbers are not clearly distinguished especially for older folk when you are reading most other commentary you can infer or deduce the correct or missing letters from context  but deducing prices misses data entry errors2 for confirmation show entered price in new proposed position in orders list among its nearest neighbors the truth is that the ui software can radically change your intended price if you somehow misformat the data the ui will change it to something valid but sometimes 10 or 100 times higher in value than you want and you pay tax  fees on that order regardless of saleremove current market average and its price warnings suggest more user selectable options for price warnings like sell order average lowest sell in region time averaged weekly minimum sell price or buy order average then user selected percentage deviations from those default sell order to completed sell order average and buy orders to completed buy order average1 if you are in trade the current warnings are useless for data entry errorsbecause you are trying to make a profit worth your time  so of course sell price is much greater than your buy price constant false warnings2 averaging price of filled orders results in a confused result 2a sell orders represent available items buy orders are generally for future items not yet available2b buy orders filled represent price for quick liquidation sales  the minimum the most agreeable sellers are will to accept buy orders filled usually represent wholesale prices for marketeers intending to resell and not necessarily in this region buy order do not represent the prices most retail going to install it now buyers are willing to pay2c sell orders filled usually represent end user retail sales and what they are willing to pay2d averaging buy and sell orders along with eve only lowest offer sells rule guarantee prices will fall regardless of scarcity or demand it is almost in impossible for the current market average to rise  except when sales eat deeply into a backlog of old sell orders in best normal circumstances prices may momentarily stabilize when low sell prices meet high buy pricesbut only until either sell or buy orders are exhausted  the fall under pressure of market average suggested sale price continues market average and the multitude that rely on selling at that price  can only rise naturally if someone buys out market and resets price with new sole available sell ordercurrent market average is subject to exploitation if you find a planet out of range of other offers you can buy from yourself at outrageous prices thus changing regional average some people are doing this when market crashes due to current average warning and market terrorist lower prices to less than 10 within a week no ccp the market did not recover on its own  someone manipulated itsuggestion each item sold retains its price until installed  only then does it get included in market average manipulation would at least get very painful and time consuming
my name it speaks for itself it was something i chose arbitrarily to shut up a friend of mine many years ago kinda went like alright already ill try your  mmo and ill be uber enthusiastic about it too anyway i grew to like eve and years later im proud to say im no longer the person i was thenwith the additional restrictions of the character being over a certain age having a reasonable reputaion an aka tab like corp history and never having been character transfered thereby removing any special privelage for those seeking to buy a character just for skills or profitably escape a reputation by selling would that be more or less rational also money  plex  isk i see no reason to charge one or the other particularly however by being a character that satisfies the prior paragraph a price in the singledigit billions of isk 100 or 7 plex whatever that works out to be is more fitting and may still be too affordable
you do not have the time to investigate when a yerrpirate shows up on overviewthe first glance is all that matters in reality unless original name is displayed at a glance not supported
if a pirates killing you does it matter what he was called before
as if the list of names cause they can only be used once needs to be longer now you want everyone to be able to double arbitrary bs no and no not a good idea if you really want to change your name start a new toon your penalty will be that you have to start all over wow youre right i doubt many people will do this
interesting idea as it is there is no tier 3 missile only battleship caldari being the black sheep of eve so if this bumped up or brought down all battleship tiers to the same level ie hit points and such i guess that would satisfy somewhat
you can eliminate the tier system but what is it going to do if you stream line the costs and make them all equal there will be no variationdo we really need to make this game so bland like the character creator hey remember when bloodlines meaned something now every character starts out practically the same with no advantage over another in areas no weaknesses in areas just a cookie cutterremoving the tier system would do that just to ships they would be bland boring and there would be no advantage to flying one ship over anothernow lets break down the 16 on the list1 this is to prevent those little kids who buy buy plex from buying lots of big ships before they are really able to fly them seriously do you want someone in a sniper abbadon with only amarr bs 1 on your fleet op  no this is there to ensure people are ready to fly the ship properly2 so what change nothing the heavier ships already weigh more also dont fix what isnt broken with material costs3 no we dont need cookie cutter ships we already have cookie cutter characters we dont need them in ships there is no reason the dominix should have the same cap as a thron or a hyperion4 they are already like that5 elaborate  tweaks should be done on some ships6 no tech 1 is exactly that tech 1 they are not supposed to have super powers like their tech 2 variants if you start giving tech 1 ships those special role powers like the tech 2 variants then you are going to erase the line that defines the need to shoot for tech 2 shipseve is already getting too easy as it is not make it any easier and bland
why does this not have a support post from me in ittier system needs to go its outdated poorly designed and has no place in this game
i never said there should be no variation only that any variation should be based on roles not tiersyou mean how everyone looks like a drake abaddon nyx or aeon with slightly different hairyeah i remember that then i remember achura and the insanity sauce that followed thatoh i dunno my character looks better than yoursi have no idea why you would think such a ridiculous thing unless you own a bunch of bposyou can try they would only need amarr bs 1 to fit the requisite rack of 1400s anyone is welcome to my fleet ops i dont discriminateso you do own bposi never indicated they should you came up with that on your ownthank you captain obvioushyperion and megathron even without tiericide they are prime examples of tweaking being necessarythe relationship between tech i and ii should be about technology advancements not roles lots of tech i ships have role bonuses

thankfully ccp has provided players with an alternative source of plex the buddy invite program raised the number you can invite to 10 and also made it so you can get plex instead of 30 days of game time thus increasing supplyleaving ccp like every other f2p mmo out there if ya got to go to the cash shop to get the cool stuff you will tick off quite a few people

look at all the idiotic people supporting this driveledit if all the chicken littles out there would stop squawking about the sky falling might i remind everyone about something i said earlierthis is just typical prepatch speculation driven higher with speculation on space barbie accessories being hot ticket itemsstop screaming about the sky falling
why the hostility just because someone is not as optimistic about it as you doesnt make him idiot but thats ok stare at the light in the tunnel i rather make sure the train behind the light dont hit meaur  isk trade like with plexes like suggested in op hello reading with comprehension
bump fot good petitionit starts from cloth and it will end on raven state issue im against this seen this happend in too many games
were debating the conversion of plex to aur not whether it should be used to buy in game items i guess youre just against everything associated with it though well i just bumped into an american site last nite that sells everything from proteus to titan skill books 2499 for the former and 38899 for the latter your argument clearly loses sway when you look at that its not the first site ive seen either but certainly the best composed and with a very comprehensive selection i even checked them out on ebay as they had the link there and found theyve been doing a very good business selling faction ravens t2 interceptors and even the occaisional dvd or two that way they even sell quite a few eve gtcs on ebay which i find rather odd but then im not a criminalno wow warhammer or anything else just eve and old videosso what was your point i seem to have lost how it mattered along the way there
why the hostility just because someone is not as optimistic about it as you doesnt make him idiot but thats ok stare at the light in the tunnel i rather make sure the train behind the light dont hit meok chicken little the sky really is fallingi have little patience for chicken littles screaming that the sky is falling every time a new patch is about to arrive you are just feeding the hysteria that will make plex sellers more iskthere is going to be a secondary market you will see people buying up vanity items with their leftover aur and sell them for isk what is in the op is alarmist hyperbole if you cant comprehend that well
probably not
00 needs more dynamic security you know varying depending on the security status of the people that inhabit the areabut ccp already has stuff in place to add more 00 if needed but as it stands more people are going to empire now
violates eve rule 1under no circumstances shall a game mechanic be introduced through which cva could claim to be the legitimate government of amarr
well i thought bout this because a lot of people were saying that solo combat is dead in eve and its nearly impossible to attack anyone without someone warping to zero on you and helping what i suggest is a module that allows you engage ships without anyone being able to help either you or the target have a module that once activated more or less enforces honor 1 vs 1 combat and has the following properties 1 prevents warp to on you and your target one target maximum one module per ship maximum2 prevents target locking on both you and your target and neither you or your target can lock anyone else except the other3 prevents drones being assigned to you or target4 this module would have a maximum range of 40km which would be the maximum range of most overheated warp disruptors and at which point target can warp away anyway module in itself denies warping only on you not the target target can warp if not scrammed in other words you need to scram him but he doesnt have to scram you puts taget at slight advantage5 your target cannot have any other ships or objects within 10km of it when initially challenged to 1v1 but you can pick off stragglers6 another side effect of this module is that once activated on your target you cannot warp away until you deactivate it or he dies warp denial would be 10 seconds if the module is shut off willingly zero warp denial if either party dies 7 module cycle time would be 15 seconds and would use 3 liquid ozone per cycle8 once activated on a target if the target is ratting rats lose target lock and will not be able to reacquire until the module is deactivated its not honorable to kill someone while they fight someone else they still maintain damage and all module status as it was9 rig fitting10 market sales price about 2025 million11 concord lp store spawn12 losing target lock does not negate the modules effects for another 30 seconds in other words ecm drones will not be used so you can get a warp in window warp to denial on the target and you for another 30 seconds unless the target lock was broken through the death of one of the parties13 if one of the parties dies the lock denial is valid for another 20 seconds this will prevent the winner from being immediately ganked by whoever is watching the fight if anyone is there so you have a limited amount of time to loot and get outwell there could be more polishing but basically thats the gist of it
first in to say away with you filthy troll
1 get in a fight in a blingy shipcapital2 get shot at to near death3 alt challenges you to pvp4 enemies lose locks and cant lock either of you5 alt reps you to full health6 stop the challenge resume fighttldr no
like i said its a final thing there can be limitations imposed to prevent abuse
i agree with this youre an obvious nut case snorting paint chips on the side eve is just far to complex for you you fail to comprehend and are a paranoid psychodic everyones a ninja of course we all are and were all gunning for you
why is that trolling seems like a perfectly reasonable statement the problem being discussed whaa he took my shineysmarauder  all shineys go into hold before a ninja even turns upi also agree with statements made about just get some friends it really is this simple if you have a pal in a noctis salvage while you blow crap up there is no chance of ninja taking anythingi pilot a maruader and other than grief ninja which attempt to get aggro to then come back in a pew pew boat to kill me for kb points i see no ninja ever simple fact is marauders arent worth the time for ninjas to try their luck onthe answer ive proposed and other have proposed stop being a whiny  there are many ways to secure mission loot and salvage if you cant understand these simple things then more fool you
we do all the workits more difficult to scan down a mission site and ninja salvage it than just tanking up a bs and waiting for some rats to pop just sayin
couldnt they just log off for an hour
this will make mission running easier  increased isk faucetthis will make solo pvp for drone boats easier even 5small will have advantage over no drones boat  tengu for examplebut i cant decide if it is ok or not not suported for now need to think more about it
i have to disagree mission fits have a repper anyway even a drone ship you are arent going to speed anything up much because if you carried them and i wouldnt in my mission domi you are giving up either a set of bonused heavies or a set sentriesnot a good trade off when you can slot in a large repperit would definitely make buffer armor not just a pvp fit which is good to me opposed to shield buffers that can just station up for full shield you beat up the plates on a triple plated bs your are talking a few million to fix your tank every time you undock without a logi even with a pvp myrm you usually carry a set of ec600s a flight or warrior iis and either a heavymedlight flight or a second light and medium fightso you either loose your antiinterceptor drones your gtfo ecm drones or using the mixflight with heavies is out and that is most of your dps its certainly no free lunch
one thing that i want to have in my captains quarters a giant maneating acidspitting 5toothed space slugi want to be able to go into my captains quarters and feed my slug hookers exotic dancers homeless slaves janitors whatever oh and not to mention any corpses of pvp victims i honestly dont care about any features in addition to this i just think it would be absolutely awesome queue ccp haz better things to do
omg this is actually well thought out and interesting idea  not
todays once in a lifetime is tomorrows precedent has already been set i am against this in any form as you can see im gallente i didnt have a guide that said train minmatar but id rather live with my wasted training than wowify eve

this heres your answer or are you just ignoring the obvious truth dont be lazy this is pvp and as such you put your strategic skills against other live people not simple npcs its not their fault you dont have that capacity there are plenty of tools in game to solve neutral rr you just cant be bothered to think or plan well thats your problem plus this being the case you have more problems in rl i imagine than just this game adapt or die pure and simple
even thou i think remote repping needs a little agression flagging tweek cant agree more with above statementif you are not prepared to meet remote reppers dont be startled when they show up and squize some tears from your pure dps fleet setups
eves about consequences for the choices you make rightyou decide to rep someone you must assume the consequences point blank
but you do you get agression toward people that atack the ship you are repping
yup the consequences are already in place rr can be attacked by the opposing force now its up to the opposing force to deal with them problem is as per this whine thread yet again most people lack the tactical gumption to perform any such appropriate action to deal with it again not my problem you whine because you fail to think and you publicly post this so now everyone knows how humiliating for you
au contrairebaaldor replied to a specific afk situation posted by gariboldi phiron to suit your argument you chose to include the none afk aspectim all for a change in conjunction with a local changeyes local removal is a hard task thats why its not been done yet it should come as a package as i have said many times before but a change to only cloaking which is what you are agreeing with here isnt balanceill answer again since you didnt read it the first time because you are gaining even more power on top of your already powerful instant intel tool called localalso ill add this so far ive yet to see any idea that doesnt mess up active cloaking many ideas can be bypassed while afk some even promote the use of macros thats not a good thingbut even after all that youre still left with the same powerful local
i too like to hand out death threads whenever i dont get a joke

this topic is now cowardly
seriously are you people that dense10 feet over 6 feet underduhsheeshand you call me dumb
awful idea that does nothingit is true that supercapitals are scaling too well at the moment but there are mechanic fixes that could resolve this like reexamining their complete immunity to ewar nerfing supercarrier rep bonuses implementing time dilation or tweaking the doomsday cooldowneditright now the supercapital types are just too capable dreads ought be the gun capitals and regular carriers the logistic capitals ironically titans today arent that bad yes doomsdays scale incredibly well in high lag situations but if you pay that much for a ship you expect to make something die every time you get to shoot but the supercarriers need to give something up the rrsc blob is just too powerful if they keep the rr abilities then they need to give up ewar immunity and if they keep ewar immunity then they need to give up spidertanking
no one called you dumb but now that you mention itps keep digging that hole it may help with your 6 feet under threat
it seems to be that there is a lacking of ships that use lasers amarr caldari minmitar can use missiles gallente caldari use hybrid turrets but only amarr ships use lasers and not all of the amarr ships use lasers some use missiles ie heretic sacrilege etc and to be honest if we are going to nit pick the variety of lasers we might want to nit pick that projectile turrets are rather limited as well but at least with them you have a choice in your tank with lasers your just stuck with armor tank i think it would be great if there could be some new amarr ships or revamped old ones to allow more choice of tank and more ships that can use them you wouldnt even have to have create new ship graphics you could use the old ones and just give them bonuses to lasers instead of missiles or make it so that instead of it being 5 to hybrid turrets on other factions ships just make it 5 to all turrets that way players could be able to better fit there ships to there liking and play styles and another thing is that from what i have been told people say that minmitar ships use both missiles and projectile turrets because they are supposed to be put together from spare parts and such but wouldnt it make more since that they have ships that use lasers since they were enslaved by the amarr and therefore have a larger availability of lasers in there area not to mention if they fought a war with the amarr they would have to have taken some amarr ships and built there own ships with amarr technology ie lasers
the minmatar dont use lasers because lasers are terrible and projectiles are awesome
watch list being limited to 10 players has always been one of those annoying things for fleet battles adding the ability to have tabs would simplify the watch list and allow customization by each player allowing them to group various players into each tabshouldnt add anymore unwanted lag if it worked as the overview does and just loads when the tab is selected
why are there no level 5 distribution agents in the whole game if they exists please direct me to them its not fair to indy pilots like myself that like to do these missions either come up with level 5 distribution agents or up the rewards they take you to low sec all the time wtf
pls dont pnot supoertedto be honest i like the idea but im all against dumbind down eve even thouh i many times had situation like described in one of responses arghhhh time lost i dont want any changes to that mechanicnow here is example of exploiting this let assume it was implemented so that only 2 lowest atributes are taken into effectyou make a new account you remap to have even atributes you buy set of 3s or 4s 5s maybe so basiclly you have decent skills all over boardnow you just dont train anything and points go up and up and upat some point you have multi million sp starting char for sale those would go for bilions on character bazar
if sepheir sepheron includes one more parameter his theory will be broken could you complete the fits by tank modules yes add dualreppassive tank on hyp ps do not forget about mwd if a battle starts with 3040km hyp will need to get close abaddon does not need it it has good dps till 45km
1it would be really nice to have that drone dmg optional so you could see how well your guns are doing
1it does get really hard to see what everything else is doing when the drone damage notifications is all you can seei support the idea of have the drone damage notifications optional
let me get this straightyou cant be bothered to log into eve online for a measly 2 to 5 minutes to change skillsbut youll spend 30 minutes to an hour to  about itdid i miss somethingoh and before you spout your measly little tears been playing for 2 years and i find this skill system to be the most pleasant to deal withno more grinding away to get anywhere short of isk itself
yeah its raining outside a perfect day for gaming
i think you dont understand what im proposing use that brain and soon youll see a solution to the problem you imagined
since taking office two months ago you have not been very visible as an institution as i would hope for more to the point i was hoping for a public official statement on the last two muchdebated announcementschanges by ccp agents made easy and more pressingly the whole microtransactions in incarna issue the latter of which earning a possible record of currently 34 pages of comments in less than 2 days further im not sure youve even pronounced your stance on the anomaly channges of two months ago that were cause for much chagrinyou have stated in your open letter that you see communication as a defining factor for the usefulness of a csm and you promised to keep us up to date with further proclamations maybe i have missed some individual postings by some of your members in relevant threads maybe i overlooked a csm announcement in general discussions where threads move back several pages per day if so i dont think you are communication as visibly as i think you ought if not talk to us will youthere is much uncertainty among your electorate at the moment about the direction ccp is taking eve ccp themselves are evasive and selective in their answers this could be the defining moment of a strong and dedicated csm such as you promised to be are you up to it
they have been very public listen to eve radio many podcasts live csm dev blogs ect
very funny as if anyone paid attention to audio spread over half the web it seems too that is not how communication is donei expect an official representation to use an official channel silly me
wait whatcommunication is not done by getting a message across directly and though multiple channels
indeed one message one source official channels unofficial ones if you fear the official ones are not enough ie your message is countered by other opposing messages
youre an idiot
i cant be bothered to go to the channels that the csm is using for communication i demand that they use one specific channel of my personal preferenceif they do not comply with this demand then they are a failure
maybe add everymonth 50k sp free to spend  the most ppl quit this game after seening howlong it will take them to fly something usefull
eve online is the best game ever created by manthis is online game with astonishing graphics that leaves speechless everyone this game is a scifi simulator that reflects number aspects of real lifethe game has economic relations military criminal security and counter actions are dependent on the economy and welfareit covers such areas of life as a political industrial military service marketing management leadership and so onthe most incredible thing is that everyone can learn these things without learning them  just playing the game i sincerely believe that intelligent parents should support and encourage their children to play this game unless they i mean parents want their children to be losers slaves or dying dinosaurs in this rapidly evolving worldin any case dear parent  the choice is yours
this because like a certain mmo taht is coming out soon most people got hyped and wanted to play it because of the companies release of 2 short videos about the game big thing is only focus on 00 for the advertisement because that is whats unique whats constantly changing and what most players will get hyped over
just include sex drugs and violence  include this and your goodtogo
cosmetic onlyive seen a few comments in the devblog thread comparing eve microtransactions to valves game team fortress 2 i would like to say that i play tf2 regularly and have been since it was in beta and even though i have not paid any money for it beyond my initial purchase of the game it is still very fun and the best class based multiplayer game out right now imoi dont think that i will be buying any plex to convert to aurum to buy clothing buy i might use my isk if something catches my eye its definitely not essential to my enjoyment of the game thoughhonestly ccp is in the business of making money like every other business out there so the best way to show ccp what you think of this is to not use it you dont have to boycott all of eve just the microtransactions part of it once ccp sees that its not profitable they will most likely stop pushing it so hard

supportedi got ed over by the character creation system due to ccp changing the limits on the way the faces could be sculpted literally between the last version the sisi client and the deployment on tq on january 18th i was highly unamused because now id need the gallente bloodline to get even close to what i had before and actually wantedive never been able to get a satisfactory result with the character creator since that sisi client despite the several recustomization tokens ccp has thrown at us if they cant give us an option to resculpt for a small fee or loosen the sculpting constraints the option to look at changing bloodline would be rather welcomed
still not fixed on current duality build of incarnacome on ccp this is an easy fix to make
i support this idea i ahd like 125 fit before just add an option if we wnat to ave our fit save don server limit 50 or computer no limit
i dont understand peoples problems i came in not too long ago so i dont remember when we had many fittings but geeze i learned never to rely on mmos to store my data so i always keep a notebook on ahnd with my fittings in it only use my most common fittings in the quick select fitting list so yeah it may take you longer to look it up and manually slap it on but geeze just cause you cant have it saved ingame doesnt mean you cant equip it use notebooks more reliable then servers
supported because it seems logical there are so many different options i can see how veteran players hit the limit
not supportedi like incarna and everything about it sims in space sounds cool to me on a more serious note incarna is going to be the future of eve already allowing people in an early stage to circumvent it will only delayhampercomplicate its full deployment
i like incarna too but i believe the slight benefit of forcing the entire playerbase to test its features is outweighed by the harm that move would do to immersion as well as faith in ccps willingness to listen to its customers
to add insult to injury the pod is now on a gantry hanging out there in the hangar where everyone can see you as you climb in and out while naked and dripping wet and overcoming your temporary blindnessdisorientation awesome stuffwe dont need an undock button in cq theres a capsule we can click on to say board ship then we can undock once in control of the ship looking at the world through a camera drone
what harm would come to immersion by forcing cq ere the opposite id sayi can see it be slightly annoying if all you want to do is get some more missiles or some such otherwise i dont see the harm especially not to immersion
scroll up around the big red letters i explained the harm to immersionto reiteratecapsuleers do not get out of their pods every single time they dock like players they value their time and efficiency and on top of that decanting is a very uncomfortable and embarrassing process by portraying things as if capsuleers do get out of their pod every time they dock no matter how brief the task they docked for and as if getting into and out of the pod is trivial ccp is ignoring their own prime fiction and setting new roleplayers up with false perceptionsit has been pointed out that we can just pretend our character didnt decant whenever we dont believe they would have done so especially since cq is currently singleplayer but why should we have to why should we have to when the solution is so extremely simple and harmless
wrong thread
agree upon entering a station player should be placed in old hangar menu with an option via button in hud to leave the ship and enter cq because immersion is fun and all but i dont feel like leaving ship every time i decide to drop off some cargo i doubt any capsuleer does even in lore ideal way in my opinion
1having a choice is fun
choice
supported my laptop runs eve fine on high settings but the new character creator lags horriblyi would like to use the old station interface instead of running through a potential lag storm everytime i need to do the simplest thing
experiments have shown that there is quite literally no reason not to make it optional
to those who keep going just lower your settings if cq is such a resource hog did it ever occur to you that changing settings every single time you dockundock is going to get old just because cq gobbles up resources like an overprivileged teenager with hisher parents credit card doesnt mean that the rest of eve does as well currently everything in space runs smooth as silk with more or less maxedout settings on my machine on both tq and duality station environments even smoother than that on tq and well bluntly on duality the cq runs like  with the same settings sure i could change the graphics settings every time i go to dock or undock but if you think thats something people are going to do regularly you are sadly mistakenadmittedly the performance issues might not be a problem by the time the expansion is actually released but given the complexity of the cq environment and the fact that itll still be a fairly new engine in the grand scheme of things im not going to hold my breath on that being the casealso speaking as another member of the roleplaying community i agree wholeheartedly with the idea that its ridiculous for a capsuleer to decant every time they need to pick up a crate of ammo or drop off a piece of cargo or whatever capsuleers have crew and hangar staff for that in addition while i really do love the bit with the openedup capsule by the stairs in the hangar seriously good catch on not rendering a second pod when your capsule is the active ship by the way  it doesnt make any sense for it to be out in the open like it is  even ignoring the privacy issues of having your slimy naked body dumped unceremoniously out of a green eggshaped contraption out in the open what about safety issues those whove read the burning life know that there are a lot of security measures in place to keep capsuleers nighinvulnerable or at least excessively safe from attack or assault on foot from the baseliners to borrow the phrase from the jita 44 chron theyre not completely safe but theyre a damn sight safer than being decanted on the edge of a lightpit i figure that the reason for the capsule just being there instead of in its own chamber as it was in a couple previous incarnarelated videos the teaser from 2009 and a presentation at 2008s fanfest for example is just that its effort to make yet another room in the cq but i really dont think most capsuleers would be comfortable decanting in an area as open as the current iteration of the cq would have us believe they doso while i expect ill probably get a fair bit of use out of cq and incarna once its released i dont like that the cq environment appears to be mandatory its immersionbreaking for the reasons i and others have given above and i find that the performance hit really isnt worth it on the occasions im not going to be using it
agreed just as there is a button to exit the hangar there should be a button that for exiting your pod to exit your pod every time you dock is stupid
i would like to see ccp give us the option to use wiscqincarna a simple check box on the esc menu as many others have suggested would be just fine with me having it on the neocom would be much nicer though let us dock and if we wish to disembarkchange ships dump us onto the balcony

there have been countless threads about how railguns are utterly broken in comparison to their lasers and artillery counterparts as weapon platforms after spending some time understanding how railguns work i came to realize that its not the weapons that need to be buffedtweaked its the ammo that needs to be completely overhauledcomparing ammo typeslet me first start by saying my approach to wanting to fix railguns is that no 2 weapon platforms should act or perform in the same way ammo for each weapon system dictates how the weapon performs and i wanted to point out each of the weapon systems distinct traits excluding missiles based on their ammo lasers use frequency crystals and capacitor for their ammodeal em and thermic damage typesand can switch between ammo types without a reload penaltyprojectile turretshave no reliance on capacitor and only fire projectile shells at their targetshave 3 ranges 50  0  60 unlike the other weapon platforms 8 ranges  50  375  25 125  0  20 40  60 but make up for this disadvantage by being able to deal any damage typeand boast a generous unstacked tracking bonus for each range  0  20 5hybrid turretshybrids are supposed to share the characteristics of both lasers and projectile turrets unfortunately there arent any real standout characteristics for hybrid ammo besides they fire shellsthey do thermic and kinetic damageeach ammo has various cap need bonuses that dont particularly make sense from antimatter to iron the 8 different capacitor needs are 05 8 40 50 24 27 30 which really doesnt aid hybrids in having any distinct trait or advantage over the other two weapon platforms how railguns should functionlet me start by disagreeing with how hybrid ammo is currently dictating damage and cap need for railguns it is contradictive to how a railgun works basically a railgun is an electric gun with two conductive rails and a conductive shell inbetween them to complete the circuit the destructive force of a railgun doesnt come from its payload but rather its kinetic force the magnitude of this kinetic force is always a function of two things the length of the physical rails and the amount of current capacitor delivered to the rails knowing this there is a problem with the current ammo we have for railguns looking at the facts the current description for hybrid charges states that they all have a titanium shell which means the conductivity of each shell type antimatter plutonium iridium etc is the same right now hybrids use the most cap at their closest ammo ranges and the least at the midlong range types so how do their ranges and cap needs make any sense together its like the attributes used in hybrid charges are just there because ccp is following the same convention that frequency crystals preceded with for a railgun on earth less energy means less velocity for the shell it projects and im not sure how fluidic space friction factors into the ranges dictated in eve but i would argue at the very least that rails would require more energy to fire at longer ranges so heres what im going to propose for hybrid ammohave lowest cap need at close ranges and highest cap need at longest rangehave kinetic damage increase as range increaseshave tracking increases as range decreaseshybrid weapons would adopt a completely new tactical philosophy by being most lethal at long ranges while most accurate at close ranges
heres what that could look likeantimatter 4 thermal 1 kinetic 50 optimal rangecapacitor 100 trackingplutonium 4 thermal 2 kinetic 375 optimal rangecapacitor 75 trackinguranium 4 thermal 3 kinetic 25 optimal rangecapacitor 50 trackingthorium 4 thermal 4 kinetic 125 optimal rangecapacitor 25 trackinglead 4 thermal 5 kinetic 0 optimal rangecapacitor 0 trackingiridium 4 thermal 6 kinetic 20 optimal rangecapacitor 20 trackingtungsten 4 thermal 7 kinetic 40 optimal rangecapacitor 35 trackingiron 4 thermal 8 kinetic 60 optimal rangecapacitor 45 tracking
this honestly sounds like a really cool idea but would it make railguns too versatile that seems a bit overpoweredwhat about blasters theyre hybrids too with emphasis on closer range
keep in mind that they would be fairly ineffective at short range they may be able to hit smaller and more agile ships with the improved tracking of short range ammo but they wouldnt be able to deal considerable dps unless they switch to use long range ammo which would only be effective against either really slow or really big targets this longrangeonly aspect would clash with blasters shortrangeonly aspect and make hybrid platforms especially potent at either long or short range but not so much inbetween
something like this already proposed
 1 my spec hybrid lvl5 skills are at the lowest priorety only because of the matter how bad they are atm but still im training those in case they will good some day
i really wish it was painful being as stupid as this guyis a drake the same as a ferox not by a long shotis a drake better than a ferox yupwhyif they both had the same role the tier system would be justified  but they dont which means its not just ships that get shafted for no real reason  its entire playstylesthe breacher is laughably inferior to the rifter but flies completely differently the only reason its in the sorry state it is is you guessed it the tier systemif it was eliminated youd see nothing but greater variation more viable ships  more variety  more choice  better gamehaving said all this i am actually in favour of gypsios suggestion in another thread of eliminating the tier system among bcs by nerfing the tier 2s frankly they really are way too good for their cost
the tier system is just a sorry excuse of not trying to balance t1 as a result there are ships that essentially exist only for completeness admitted they have some flavour such as minor speed and play style differences but buffing these aspects would help considerably to see more of these lowertier shipsccps method of selecting tech two models in the past was pick those ships with a cool model which are underused according to some document how about balancing a bit to make the ends meet right where things start t1 after all in todays eve a smartish player who follows the tutorials has a million or two after day one it isnt like the old days when we needed to warp uphill both ways and mine veldspar to afford that mighty tier 2 frigate
110 truewolves are after kiddies 
i want that standings were visible if at pilots have mutual excelent standings
just change the default page to your standings with the character and have the other tabs available for loadingless calls to the server and everyone gets the info they want  need
00 is big enough as is many alliances control vast swaths of space that they dont even use on a regular basisthe problems currently are distribution of moongoo truesec distribution relative profitability compared to highsec l4 missions supercapital proliferation and blob warfare in general throwing out more space isnt going to really fix any of these problems
i think the idea of a module doing all this is a bit over the top and trying to make it balanced as well as abuse free would be near impossiblei was thinking the other day though why couldnt you have a duel invite optiona bit like fleet invite youd get a pop up saying xyz invites you to a duel if you hit yes you both then form a fleet with each other and are forced to warp to a random safespot 20km apart from each otheryou are now in the same fleet in a random safespot which in theory is a completely fair and honourable fight until someone can be arsed to probe you down
agree you should be able to repair youreself
only when you are not engaged in combat then 1at save spot etc im all for this one prety lame you cant tbfh
i will only support this idea on one coditionif you scaned down that pve ship and warp to the guy to finish him  since he is already get good damage hit from npc  all room instatly switch agro to you  just lke sleepers dowanna easy kills suck it
i like this idea new players could find themselves making money as a gallactic taxi cab cause i know some people wo jump clones in a system 30 jumps away would rather pay people to jump them there and i know thats what autopilot is for but autopilot will get u killed in lowsec and nullsec maybe this would come when we can walk around in ships actually said by ccp dev at fanfest
itt rage
nice km
if you end up in a fair fight youve done something very very wrong somewhere along the line
so regarding ecm and how ty chance based mechanics areto make ecm not chance based make it always jam with the length of time jammed being proportional to the relationship between the jam strength on the jamming ship and the sensor strength on the jammed shipthe next few points are interrelatedonly one jammer may be active on a ship at a time and sensor strength so that it scales more drastically with hull sizerejig the numbers so that jam strength is proportional to the hull size on which the jammers are mountedrejig the cycle timer so that for the given paradigm of naked no bonus modules equivalent size hulls ie cruiser sized jamming platform jamming a cruiser hull and considering lock time its not quite possible to permajam there is a window of say a second to two seconds to fire at the jamming ship in pseudomaths terms jam time  lock time  than cycle time of jammer because only one jammer can be on a ship at a time this means for naked hulls you cant be permajammed rejig eccm and ecm boosting modules to roughly scale this slightly less than cycle time paradigm so if both ships are invested then you still cant be permajammed this needs to be further thought out as jamming ships will always be invested in boosts to their jam strength so its unclear exactly how big a difference there should be in the statement jam time  lock time  cycle timeall the above plus the required number jigging for balance considering module load out should result in a playing field where frigate hulls vs frigate hulls or any equivalent hull size pairing the ecm ship is good and powerful when synergised with sensor damps smaller vs larger hull is worse off due to the scaled sensor strength of the target but still not useless as the smaller hull size means lock time is longer  basically changing the jam time  lock time to be more dependant on lock time for protection this needs number balancing of courseone consequence is that bigger jamming hulls will  littler hulls ie keep them permajammed i dont think this is an acceptable outcome but im not quite sure at the moment what the natural way is to complete the circle without invoking arbitrary restrictions its 115 am here and my moment of brilliance has petered out
just get rid of ecm altogether its horrible and boring for both the jammee and the jammermy counterproposal replace ecm with something less allornothing roughly equivalent in effect to sensor damps and tracking disruptors think up some sort of weird secondary secondary ewar for caldari recons like a shield resistence dampener or something and the we get on with our spacelives
so if ecm always jamswhats the point of having a cycle timer
he wants a way for his insert frigate to be immune to carriers
didnt they always jam way back in the day and then ccp nerfed it to chance because it was too powerful
yes if your points were higher than the target ship they got perma jammedi used to go hunting ceptors in my buzzard pre the first ew nerf not this char
i would like to see ecm changed as well the old system was terribly annoying and unbalanced the new system is balanced but still very annoying for both partiespersonally i would like to see ecm made more realistic while preserving some semblance of balance and getting rid of the annoyance factorchange the ecm system so that it functions more like real ecm remove ecm burst modules this will replace them radius  aoe based optimal  falloff like weapons no target lock required jamming effect becomes a signature modifier ships drones and missiles being subjected to jamming receive penalties to opponent signature size apply a stacking penalty to multiple jammers being used in the same area script to make it directednonaoe the script would provide a bonus to range require the jammed vessel be locked but otherwise work the same wayfor gunslasers the effect would be computed and applied at firing time and is pretty easy for the existing mechanics to cope withfor missiles things are a bit more complicated ideally the system would cause the missiles to detonate some time prior to impact with the chance based on their position within the field realistically that will be terribly complicated for the devs so a signature penalty applied at firing time as with guns would be okthis would make ecm less annoying on the whole for everyone involved
combine the fact that only one jammer can be active on a target and assuming you can get the numbers right that jam time  lock time is less than cycle time then you have a window before the module cycles again where you can engage targets as no one else can jam yousomething like thatperhaps it would be better for jam time  lock time  cycle time much much less so ecm functions more like a consistent lock breaker but you can lock again well before the module cycles again
i personaly think that ecm must be focused not at locking brake and preventing target from locking for some period of timei think it must be focused on the ships rof and damage output just like dampners and and tr destrutors do and not completely disabling ships ability to participate in figth though this will bring new issue with it you have to boost recon ships namely caldari ones for some extra surverabilityjust my 2 cent
soi can field 5 dronesecm always breaks lock altough for a small timei launch 5 drones and set one on each of my oponentsnow there points drop and i can warp outi like it
how about adding to this patchnoctis is the ultimated salvager but a pain to pull out the loot out of the wrecks spec when running ratting sides usaly clean up takes way longer then the site it selfso since the noctis is spec in salvaging why not auto pull the loot directly into the cargohold its kinda frustrating and nerv breaking open close open close container to drag and drop loot into the cargohold specialy in drone land since there is no bounty and you have to count on the loothopefuly you will add this future to the next patch 
are you truly this lazy
its not about being lazyas a exampleput one carrier in a sanctum and one in a high end drone side in drone land while the first carrier can run two sides in a hr and gets instantly iskis the other carrier is only able to do one side in the hr with cleaning and still get less then the first carrier makes in a hr plus he has to haul the alloys to the station while the other carrier can constantly rat 
as a noctis pilot taht slavage is lvl 4 i know how its frustrating to loot 50 wreck one after another so i support this idea
and while your at it put in one button for the noctisjust onethe button says i winseriously get out
yea this is a good idea
supportedbut also our ships need to be connected to bridges and fuel lines and stuff like that not just floating out in the middle of nowhere and possibly see visuals like cargo crates and people traveling inout of the ship make it look real immerse us in this scifi simulatorand yes everything im talking about should be clientside only
i am pretty sure that if ccp would let the players create the clothes paint jobs own stores like in swgprecunge alot of new players would join and thus would pay the billsinstead of milking the cow and creating microtransactions which is a step in the wrong directionit is seriously a missed opportunity if they go thru with it
aur is a way to get some plexes out of the market a tool to stabilize a market and keep it at bay but i like the idea about custom made paintjobs it will require a special toolset of course but it might end up as a great isk sink
how would you do it without making eve into a bloatware productall other mmos have a couple of thousand characters on a server  eve has up to 60 thousand the amount of data required to keep track of custom jobs will be excessiveonly way is to make it client locked so that only the person with the custom job can see it but then whats the point  it would be like wearing silk panties because they feel nice but youd never get to show them off in normal society anywaywe may get corporate or alliance logos on ships at some point but i seriously doubt finger paint ships will be introduced this decade
i would like to see a lot more player created items for incarna
hmm i did not really mean infinate possibilities i was talking about crafting like in swg in swg everything was player made  well just as it was in eve p  so you train the skill you invent the bpc and then you paint the ship like camouflage style silver rainbow whatever p so a finite amount of choices but player made like industry works right nowsame goes for clothing you can make 3 types of toxitos in 5 different colors  15 possibilities  for example  surgery would allow you to alter the face harcutting the hair tattoo shop has tattoes and piercings etcsome players would make furniture to put in the player owned shops and so onlike player made content just as it is now but then in incarna pit is a missed opportunity to not do it in the beginning i thought this was exactly what they were planning but i guess i was wrong
that and it is the first time microtransactions with a cash shop is added to the game where a player can buy itemsservices directly from ccp  well beside swapping character portraits and transferring characters altho the latter is more meta gaming really  just wanted to make that clear
i see no difrence since its all same the is only 1 rule  money talks 1you can buy 28 plex every 24 hours sell price 10 billion isk2gtc are not even limited at all you can sell how many you wantx 30 60 days gtc sell price 23 billion iskso you cant buy items directly from ccp but there is still way around in or out gameso as i said above its seems all same  to me rich kiddies have they toyssuck it up
read all before postingi appologize in advance for the fact that theres probably another thread on this but i looked for 20mins for one to post on and i gave upi propose that the shippos explosion graphics need to be updated explosions are ultimately the visual goal of all combat in eve when you see an explosion youve either done your job or had your job done upon you and for those of us who veiw video games as a movie you take part in the current graphics are a complete dissapointment well not really there is still a huge level of satisfaction gained from blowing somebody else up but my point is that when you destroy a capital ship you should no see an explosion thats 14 the size of the actual ship and then get left with the original model cept with holes in it when the ship blows up there should be pieces of the ship of all sizes that shoot out in different directions kinda like this picture
well get new explosions soon click though im not sure how large blowing up ship looks my duality character is lamebut i agree that big ships should blow up royally like with breaking on pieces which slowly drift away from each other for couple seconds animated wreck  but no way this will happen before all ship models got a redesign
ohh wow looks like they did update the graphics but i will not delete this proposal untill i see proof that the capital ship explosion graphics have been updated as the 1st reply states
nope moa is one of the worst and strangest how the hell someone came up with this kind of strange space ship designes ever made it fails both in practicality and aesthetics it should gosome people loved original scorp and maller and were will be disappointed by replacement but its a small price to pay for enhancing overall look and style of the game i think that neck part will be spared to save at least some part of old moa but everything else right now is one big clusterfk of ship designing i like how it looks on paper though just like moa falcon and kitsune which three also look hidious
nah i wouldnt mind the remodelling of most ship hulls
fly a laserokh and shield tank
my alt army still mines macro mining destroys this game you need to drop the price on everything so the bots dont make any money out of it remove plexs or increase there price the bot owners need to see that there not actually making any money for this to exist
which podcastsi cant listen to them on eve radio since noones ever active during my nonwork waking hours
if you think about it everything nc new nc wanted failed despite flooding the csm anoms got changed jump bridges got changed and well everything mittani and the rest of the scooby gang wanted didnt happen and probably never will hahahahahaaww ccp you guys are awesome this is even more funny considering how smug mittani was at fanfest never change ccp 3 it
just a thought but if ccp wants to encourage more people to live in 00  get rid of docking permissions and replace them with a set docking fee that is paid to the corp owning the station people wouldnt be afraid of losing all of their assets in 00 space and opportunities for small scale pvp would exist at every station in 00 space
who sets the docking feewhy should stations accept docking requests from sworn enemies of the empire
yeah noif i dont want you in my house why should you be allowed to pay me five bucks then just walk in or similarly thats like saying you could walk into fort knox or the us pentagon by paying an entrance fee its their base if they dont want you there its their right to slam their door in your faceedit how about anyone who gets within 15km of a nonallied station in 00 is automatically pvp flagged against the owning alliance of that station nah jk but really no docking permissions are great but maybe add an optional docking fee with a corprank permission that allows free docking that way corps can charge newer members or just people they think have too much money to dock with tehir station without causing an unneeded step for players they conside important or people running to hide
yeah face the truthincarna is comming and you wont be able to stalk that hot innocent girl across the station anymore since her alliance booted you and left a little note perv
by the its my station i should be able to decide if i want you in or not reasoning then why cant you close stargates to just stop sworn enemies from entering the system in the first place you cant simply because ccp doesnt want to restrict movement in such a fashionim not saying that you should offer station services to everyone  but just allowing people to dock would go a long ways in encouraging more empire folk to at least explore 00
2 reasons 1 you didnt build the stargate2 from a scientific perspective gates are in pairs so if the companion gate got turned off do you know how hard it would be to reconnect it to its companion due to drift only giving a realism sciencey explanation because i was using reallife examples for my initial arguement and if you allowed anyone to dock then you would have sovereignty space filled with people not in the corp using an alliances own base to mine roids in that alliances space and when caught retreating back to camp inside the alliances own station horrible it would yes allow more people to enter 00 but also allow more people who come just to be annoying
your fears are great wonderful even you are actually afraid of neuts coming to your system and mining your rocks while your fleet sits helpless in the system
not gonna happenif anything ccp should make 00 npc station services targetable
personally all i want out of it is the ability to raid their inferstructure for resources and isk i dont want to take their poss down or effect sov in any reasonable way i dont want to remove their jb networksall i want is to be able to siphon off some of their money i want to ninja raid into a large alliances territory with black ops ships and covert haulers shoot something load something into the hauler and try to get out before they respondi dont care if mechanics dont allow me to plunder whatever the structure is whole sale and take everything i dont care if i cant plunder the thing more than once a week because of some sort of timer nor do i care if i can only take a small part of a much larger wholei want a clear cut definable objective for an op today were going to go hit this moon steal some of the stuff in its hopper and get out or something moon some new mechanic whateverjust raid the large power blocks and annoy them gnat stings cost them a few billion a month in resources lost and have some fun in the process
because we certainly have not heard anything in the main thread from themare you able to shed some light
you must be living under a rock
anoms are a terrible mechanic and youre not getting your moneytree back
ramping up the sinks doesnt help unless you put the sinks where the isk is currently settling in huge pools going stale and stagnantso jo random has a huge industrial empire and has more isk than she can spend what is she going to do with that isk now buying more ships isnt going to help since jo has three of everything already buying better modules isnt going to help jo already has officer fits on every shipthe isk is just going to sit in jos account with no purposeturn up the existing isk sinks and suddenly those people who have a hard time accumulating isk in the first place are just going to be hit harderwhat we need is a new isk sink which will provide an endless stream of new things to offer the pilot who has everything
thats actually a pretty good point  how do we get those traders who accumulated hundreds of billions of isk to recirculate their money on the other hand how much have they really accumulated in active accounts most manufacturers and nearly all traders should have a rather small wallet compared to their total navpersonally im all for an isk circulation which is as closed as possible ie as few sources and sinks as possible remove all npc bounties in nullsec and lowsec
even better lets just get rid of npc bounties in just high sec since 80 of the eve population resides there the biggest faucet gets the biggest nerf that should take care of the fountain of isk spewing from l4 agents
check check still not fixed
this alllll this cmon ccp
def has my support
gallente ewar need to be looked at the bonuses are crap on gallente ships caldari gets bonus to strength of jam for example lets have some of that love
nerf dramielsrebalance t1 ship tier system battleship hulls should cost 708090 mil isk not 4080120 balance the effectiveness of the different tiered t1 frigates cruisers bcs and battleshipseither improve gallente ship speed and agility or improve rangetracking on blasters and railsassault ships are fine in frigate combat except their price they should not cost as much as tier 1 bcs but desire to engage larger targets which is usually fairly dangerous with medium neuts in abundance maybe their 4th bonus could give them a unique ability increase cap regen by quite a bit which would in turn allow them to wield cap neuts of their own change ecm to work in such a way that the time being locked out is determined by signal strength rather than a chance based full 20s jam in other words if the ecm strength is significantly greater than the targets sig strength the target can be jammed for the full module cycle time on the other hand if something like an ecm drone engages a target the jam time could be pretty minor this could make it worthwhile to equip ecm on nonbonused ships if the goal is to achieve short 25 second jam bursts this could also make eccm more valuable because right now even with eccm random luck can still allow you to be jammed for the full 20s cyclewhile i realize changing ship cost mineral build requirements is a pretty big deal in a lot of cases it simply does not make sense to fly something that isnt much better but 3x the cost
suggest complete change of ecm mechanicsmake them similar to tds and damps in function ie  reduction in effectiveness of specific ship abilitiesi suggest making ecm reduce the effectiveness of other electronic warfare modules any mid slot targeted module i feel this would bring ecm in line with the other ewar modules by giving it a specific part of the other ship to screw up without totally making them useless a tds ship can still point and web a webbed ship can still shoot and pointweb a pointed ship can still shoot and move etc etc etcmight also reduce range of guided missiles if reducing the effective range of webspointsdampstds isnt strong enough if it was included it should be used with a script similar to how tds operate
rokh its underpowered mostly because of rails themselves but hybrid damage bonus instead of shield resistance might really turn it into at least more or less useful ship its a sniper boat what the point of it to have a nice tank if it cant damage 
this  is precisely what is needed the biggest reason imo is for each individuals play style a lot of ppl are cookie cutters but theres also plenty of outsideofthebox thinkers thay want to throw off their opponent and have a good chance at succeeding at it pirate faction frigs namely the dram ive seen ppl hating claiming op and so forth well i say no quite simply i believe there should be kings of the hill with the balance being its cost of which they are plenty more expensive currently this is valid as greater cost  greater risk yes they are a force to reckon with and they should be but ppl forget that a these ships are available to everyone via public contracts b there are plenty of ways to kill them ppl merely whine because they dont want to have to plan for them but as ive proven even a no prop battle badger can kill a dramiel dram kill we could probably agree that its the pilot that makes the ship not the ship that makes the pilotthirdly the hybrid weapon systems need help theres been plenty of threads for how from my readings and i agree a boost in damagetracking to make them a feesible choice given their short range blasters long range alpha rails they should properly fill those two niches while having little glory in between right now they have zero glory save for maybe small blasterslastly a serious look into creating the dogfights we want  gank fests an absolutely great idea somewhere in the assembly hall here was sig reduction per locked aggressor to put it simply the cross to it was its logical reasoning ie white noise makes it hard to lock said ship as more enemies lock it thus giving fcs the debate of how many should i commit to a single target as targeting would exponentially increase to worthlessness now you get a need for more organized squads and thus more variable needs tactics and dogfighting honestly i could care less about why it would be this way the white noise i just want to see it happen so we can have more epic fights that we all crave this should start taking affect even at small scale pvp and not just reserved for large fleetssorry for the wall of text but this topic warrants it i just hope this helps and is in time as i see im more than a month behind the opthank you
so how are you going to buff ecm ships to make up for the fact you just crippled their ewar you may not have noticed this but ecm ships with the exception of the rook tend to be very very bad at anything that isnt jamming unlike the ewar ships of other racesso if ecm is getting a massive nerf what corresponding buff are you proposing to avoid adding another half a dozen ships to the lol terribad pilecost is not a balancing factor dont believe me just look at the current state of supercapitalsangel ships in general are stupidly overpowered and not even the most expensive things around nope absolutely terrible idea as are all the variations of limit how many people can lock a ship why simple  this will result in people locking up key members of their own fleet and making them nigh unkillable
improve 00 station bonuss not the ones originaly seeded has too many slots but ones player built make it so that it is equal to pos manufacturing or better with upgrades in mean time reduse price for station upgrades kinda really silly how expensive they are on this way it gets cheaper to manufacture stuff in 00 compared to empire but it is more risky now industry gets buffed in 00 and peopel can start to create t2 production in 00 combined with buying up reprocessed loot or mins all u need now to import is certain moon goo types spread or design a system that all types of moon goo can be get everywhere ccp should make it so that a sun can be mined but no specific moon mins can be determaind as output 1 day its xxx other day its xxx for what i care lets call it a static gas harvester that convert moon gasses with a complicated process to random moon goo make it so that its unsecured interact with small gang ect put 2 reinforce timers on it something now all stuff needed to t2 production is availeble in all 00 put it can be made just as expencive or cheaper depends on station upgrades this should make it possible to have local t2 markets this would make 00 station more valueable and a strategic point in disrupting t2 markets adding a screeny from my personal station cost exell sheetstation upgrade rules
dont forget an asteroid buffreplenishment upgrade for the industrialists
be really nice if this would also give small gangs some part in 00 disrupting in sysytem farms and fields
industry can only be made worthwile in 00 for huge alliance blocks there is insufficient demand to produce a large variety of items when youre in a small alliance having sov in only a few systems we dont want changes that will only benefit the large blocksand i dont see any major issues that will be fixed by making industry more attractive in 00drastic changes will be needed to make 00 industry viable when a few people turn to industry that will draw people from other activities thus making those more profitable
not sure where you are talking about we build caps and super caps in null other construction projects pale in comparison to that in terms of time material and effort at issue is the margins in high sec are slim to negative you could make more just selling the minerals in some cases for smaller things why build them in null when you can import someone elses poorly thought out industrial plans so the more stuff that sells for next to nothing in high sec the more null industry can focus on building bigger projectsbecause many dont like working in groups and the less secure the space the more you have to work together on stuff like industrythere arent warlords there are groups the bigger the group the more effective you are if you think someone else is going to run defense for you while you make iskt2 bpo are you joking thats just something people will farm simply because it would be a disproportionately higher profitrisk ratiothe problem that is most obvious in null is how risk is not distributed well in eve a whole swath of problems in eve are related to this if you want more industry in null that require more risk in high sec thats really what it boils down to

no
yescan alt accounts vote or is that stacking the deck
no
noits players like sapphire fangborn that scare me the most wanting things to magically become easier by paying for them its an absolutely terrible idea and is a pure money grab how about ccp focuses on fixing crap that actually matters instead of looking to infuse more cash into pointless projects
nousing microtransactions instead of good content in incarna is a big missed opportunityinstead of giving microtransactions they should make great player run content  player shops player crafting of goods like cloth drugs furniture etc player services like haircutting tattoos piercings etcnow that would bring in alot of cash because of all the new players that would join

reiteratingthere are very few aspects of eves game mechanics that an immersionist has to filter out in order to maintain their immersion ccp should not add another thing like that especially when doing so would be ridiculously contrary to their own stated purposes and the solution is both utterly simple and completely harmless
ow goodie i need to haul a lot for the corp mining op lets get out of my pod everytime i dock  as much as i like the idee of being able to walk in stations i would also like a choice to not walk in stationsi can think of a long list of reasons why i would not want to unpod each time i dock1 for a switch new station features off buttonedit to flip on support
im now supporting this if i havent already people have made very good points on the immersion breaking of the forcible always leave pod on undock
i dont see the need to enter the cq when docking supported

i still have 5k kinetic heavy fofsi want more of them bringem back 
remember that blasters particle accelerators do also use the same ammunition as railguns as such sweeping changes like this are not looking very likely also from lore standpoint higher range  higher kinetic energy its a military application you dont want to dial down the weapon when you hit someone whos closenow having a look at the different weaponsguided missiles pros long range usually high alpha select damage type tracking doesnt matterguided missile cons can be shot down or outrunfof missile pros long range usually high alpha select damage type no target lock necessary tracking doesnt matterfof missile cons can be shot down outrun cannot select targetshort range missiles pros higher dps than above select damage type tracking doesnt mattershort range missile cons difficulties hitting fast targets can be shot down can be outrun low rangeblaster pros high dpsblaster cons effective only at point blankrailgun pros extreme rangerailgun cons low dps low trackingautocannon pros high dps select damage type no capautocannon cons low range usually fight in falloff reduced damageartillery pros high alpha select damage type no capartillery cons extreme range requires fighting in falloff low trackingpulse laser pros high dps relatively high optimal range fast reload select optimal range t1 ammunition is not spent by firingpulse laser cons high cap usagebeam laser pros fast reload select optimal range t1 ammunition is not spent by firingbeam laser cons high cap usagefor a railgun fix id personally look at the strengths or the strength which is supposed to be extreme range gallente are supposed to use blasters and caldari railguns so perhaps increase the range bonuses for the caldari gunboats allowing to use higherdamage ammunition at higher ranges since the blaster optimals are laughable and railgun optimals fairly decent a small increase in bonus would be significant at the ranges the railguns are effective but would not effect the blasters very much this would mean that railguns would become the best long range sniping equipment face it  long range means max lock range or over 200 km and more competitive at the fleet ranges due to ability to use higherdamage ammunition as well as kiting with tackle support targets with shortrange weapons at medium rangealternatively introduce a skill which boosts only railguns but not blasters compare to guided missile precision blasters or blaster ships may need their own boost though but it is highly dependent on other things such as mwdwarp scrambler mechanics
im not convinced by 2 but i think 1 would be quite a boost for blasters by releasing cap for mwdab and gallente active tanksperhaps have 1 damage amount across all ranges maybe with variation on the kintherm ratioeg all small ammo does 10hp damagethis wouldnt be the silver bullet for hybrids  their platforms but i believe something on this theme would be a good step towards giving them a role
i disagree with ops explanation of a railguna railgun is two electro magnets that pull a projectile forward and then switch off before it can pull the projectile back you need a bigger projectile for more damage because of magnetic saturation why its pointless using massive amounts of energy with a small projectilethe majority of its power is derived from kinetic energy but putting a payload on the projectile would most likely do more damage than kinetic energy on its own against futuristic armour types
get rid of all railgun ammo replace with one ammo type then give the rail module itself energy level settings that increase cap usage with reasonable limits and rangedamage at the expense of trackingthat would be more like how a railgun should work
i would add that rails are primarily an alpha weapon and as such would have a longer rate of fire to help against the arguement of it being opd it would further define its roleniche otherwise this is all very good suggestions to the rails fix well donenow what about blasters it should be almost the complete opposite save for tracking as they would be designed for in your face fighting
the rails are a completed circuit with the completion being the slug they form 1 magnet not 2 anyway this is a good idea
dear csm and ccpi support this idea its really silly that the ship with the closest range are the slowest the gunboats needs a optimal range and agilityspeed bonus and the droneboats a dronespeed
signed gallente subcaps do need a buff
ccp will only cater to caldari for some reason i just cant imagine a expansion where caldari it the race to get shafted

isnt eve about scamming and being untrustworthy you can have it all you want to scam but then dont want to be scammedtbh for me remove all information about standings and employment historyand to be honest mate this will not come back ccp have made their decision and they dont listen to csm anywayso meh
also this
this has change has destroyed rpimersion in the game worldif i am playing a gallente patriot i want people to know i have ve gallente and ve caldari standingsbring back display of standings or at least make them optional to show just like for certificates
i support any nerf to inadvertentpassive information proliferationso no thumbs up from me
let me recycle early n00b mistake skills 90 reduced unlearning time no learning while unlearning 70 or so sp to allocate

i believe ccp will make mission npcs smarter and a more powerful than easily killed dummies if they will npcs will switch aggro fineby the way even sleepers dont always switch aggro depending on the ships used in anomaly and tackler shiptype
on grid boosting only takes care of t3 shenaniganshard limit of 10 on the rs ratio takes care of unprobeable missioneers complete safety should require a person not to play the game ie docked setting the max achievable ratio at 1 should make them hard enough to find so that they have ample time to notice probes closing inasking ccp to add new variables is just begging for gamebreaking bugs to be introduced so would prefer not to
this
all i see here is wambulance this wambulance that first off missioners or anyone for that manner shouldnt be easy to probe out period i believe that the current system aside from unprobable ships is too easy for people to probe others down and attack them hell it usually takes 30 seconds to 1 minute to find someone that is too easy here is a bargain for ya we can get rid of unprobable ships as soon as its not insanely easy to scan down other ships does that sound like a good compromise for ya whether you think so or not these missioners are taking some form of risk and this is catching them at stations andor gates catch a t3 ship undocking at a station and you pretty much have it made so dont fool yourself over the fact that these missioners arent risking a damned thing otherwise you just sound like a damned old fool who needs the wambulance to come and pick him up before he drowns in his own pool of drool infested with bitterness and lies
not supported you can find unscannable ships if you put some effort in
sup
i cannot support this it is working as intended why else do you think ccp made it so that if sensor strength is 105 time sig radius it makes it difficult to get scanned if you did away with this then you made a set of defensive subs for all t3s useless and we already have enough of thoseunprobability gimps the ship just like cloak does so i dont see the reason to nerf this
i know it has been suggested a hundred times but still eg unlearning lasts 10 of learning time you cant learn a skill while unlearning you get 70 of sps or whatever compensates attribute mapping bestits basically to get rid of those n00b mistake skills and not a way to recharacterise skillwise

good way to add more varietythe thought of adding ferryable npcs or heck even other players would be a nice additionsupported
supportedgreat idea eve is a deep game and this would add to it a dimension which is currently missingvalidus
i know old thread is old but did everybody seriously miss this absolute stupidityhave you not heard of dust 514
the thing is this feature does not add anything to the gameplay its just another menial chore that everybody do so why is it there
not supported the mechanic adds to gameplay you are not supposed to like to die once dying becomes essentially meaningless  like it already is to the rich characters  pvp just breaks down large scale conflict is essentially already decided by who gets bored or demoralized first smallscale pvp assuming it isnt dead yet doesnt need to follow in suitewhat would be next losing a capship which took some time to save isk losing a skill which took some time to train by being afk in an anomaly by not updating your clone should be given back by ccpif you really really cant remember to do simple things like updating clones i suggest you download evemon or some other character monitor software those do have builtin features such as reminding you when your clone is running out then losing sp becomes even less like dying for going afk in as safe pos and more like dying for going afk while warping to a fleet fight  from simply careless to simply stupidadmitted the automatically upgrade clone sounds okay though there is an issue where you must be on a station with a med bay  which is an important distinction since if youre able to upgrade anywhere offices in stations with no medical facilities rise in value
not supportedpodkill should mean biomass and your belongings get taxed and passed onto your next of kin
all that is needed is that the skill point loss is reported in the km  skill loss problem solved
i have always upgraded my clone and i have never lost skillpoints so i have a question if you had 100 mil sp and you had only a 900000 sp clone would you sp go all the way down to 900000 if you got podded
one way they could mitigate this is a severe financial penalty if you die with an unupdated clone something like 10100 times the normal cost of the proper medical clone isk is more easily replaced than time and there still is a significant penalty if you cant pay it then you face standard sp loss
afaik it has always been this way youre losing a 5 difference between your total sp and clone capacity the loss can not exceed 1 level ie 5  4
not supported this is eve onlinenever underestimate stupidity  players lose sp working as intended
it is a good and clear punishment if you dont update your medical clone your highest skill is goneit favors newbies over veterans thats a good thingit adds consequences for your actions another good thingi like the systemnow lemme see if i would forget to update clone i would lose 27 days ouch i better not forget p i did forget once and lost 7 days or so lesson learned  
ty my point was merely to show that its the pilot that makes the ship not the ship that makes the pilot the battle badger was set up for cases just like this to lure in ppl who think theyre almighty noob killer ship is the pwn only to humiliate them in this fashion note the noob on the kill list was the drams very recent kill prior to its own demise
ive seen drams killed by a helios but that really doesnt mean the dram isnt out of balance for the frigate class i think anyone would be hardpressed to argue that the dram is balanced when compared to all t1 frigates all inties most afs and most faction frigates it has the best speed the best agility nearbest sig near best damage and near best tank its just two awesomely wellrounded and people want it to have a vulnerability so its either an excellent inty or an excellent af but not both
youre right its a hell of a ship and i can understand your point have you ever considered that this ship along with its pirate brothers are meant to be kings of the hill their balance or offset is their cost a greater risk of loss you argue imbalance but look at the price tag ferraris go faster than pintos would you argue that its an inbalanced car no you expect better of high cost items thus be our world the issue not everyone wants that risk ie it sux more to lose one so what do they do whine about their unwillingness to risk their own in a claim of imbalace of said pirate factions worse more they dont want to be bothered to plan against tougher ships ive proven that indeed it can be done to quite an extreme and tears and lols were had so again overcome and adapt use your god gifted brain and seperate yourself from the common mammalsdont hate the ship hate the pilots that refuse to adapt and whine
1read lore youll learn why cal and gal are so similar2 so you are tellin methat you wanna give better long range guns to the only race that has super drones seems a lil unbalanced sniper sentry domis would be the only thing you see seems a little unbalanced3 so youre flying a cal gun boatwtf fly something else unless its a rohk why bother flying it and caldari already have a ton of long range weapons at its disposal cruise heavies and the likepoint is i believe the reasons rails suck is because thats the tool ccp gives us minnie and amarr only have gun bonuses so thier guns need to be better to compensate for lack of drones or variety of weapon systems once you think about it that way its not so bad imo
this
i dont really see why you think ecm is annoying in its current state 
again fine idea without thinking consequences or even figuring out how effective and overpowered logistics and other ewar types are for examplejust saying
no i like chance based and the other ecm working diffrently
honestly it would be better if the variable was a decrease in how many things could be targeted rather than how long they are jammed it seems more functional if you have 4max targets and the jammer is even with the jammee then the jammee has 2max targets for the cycle if the jammer is dramatically stronger than the jammee then they have 0max targetsi think this would be a more reasonable change to ecm if you dont want the chance based component it isnt over powered but still provides a useful niche for ecm
or have a max number of ecm modules which would in turn make people most like fit more multi spec jams if they didnt know what they were going up againstorthey more you put on the lower the strength of the jammers go wouldnt change things too much and wouldnt affect eccm they do it with enams and mag stabs why not ecmorcompletely revamp ecm boats make ecm short range like tds so the ecm boats have to be a lil tank combat boat rather than way off out there paper bagsso many diff ways to fix this problem
assuming there is problem
i really like this idea actuallythe reason im against chance based mechanics is that no fight no matter the scale should ever be swung by pure luck consistent behaviour gives rise to tactics inconsistent behaviour gives rise to because of falcon
ccp please allow fleet logs to be exported again or device a system to do it automaticallyyou effectively broke a very useful way of keeping scores in fleet operations for miningwhile youre at it also bring back the table layout of the loot history this new format is not efficient or useful nothing wrong with the older systempretty please
win against what wrecks its not pvp where one persons gain is another loss less time wasted and cheaper minerals is everyones gain especially for those fueling sov null blobbing it would cut into mining bot income though but thats okay
not supporting further devaluation of salvage
absolutely ridiculous its way too easy as it is i think the noctis needs to be nerfed its disgusting how easy you have it now compared to how harsh it was to do it wish a destroyer with 400 cargo you are like that spoiled younger brother who always thinks its too hard shamefull
cant support im afraid the noctis was implemented to make it the salvaging ship where it is now a profession i mean seriously you can fit multiple salvagers and multiple tractor beams now for god sake mate at least work for it plus how much this would feed even more macros would be crazy not only do they macro rat they can macro loot and salvage  no thanks
fypfy
my alt has salvage 4 ore industrial 4 and salvages any level 4 in under 5 minutes thumbs down
eh in b4 everyone who has ever argued this point ever
it is past time that ccp fix their non mass component of eve mass is real and has a cause and effect ccp addresses mass in their ab and mwd calculations however they completely ignore the most important aspect of mass small ships ramming into larger ships should both inflict damage and receive damage anything in eve should inflict damage due to mass mass has to be a factor cause and effect the excuse that people dont want to die every time they hit an asteroid is failits space its supposed to be dangerous and you need to learn to fly your ships without running into things or you die my favorite example of just this argument is ccp own storyline about an admiral ramming his titan into a station and killing both his ship and the station that is cause and effect however it is also totally impossible due to current eve mechanics this blatant disregard for physics has unbalanced this game look at all the possible tactics that could be utilized if mass had its correct effect in eve titans would have to consider a mass charge of dreadnaughts as a serious threat to themselves new tactics would need to be devised to prevent suicide freighters being rammed into stations the whole sovereignty warfare dynamic would have to be redesigned no longer should any ship with more mass fear being knocked around and bumped off of docks or gates because there would now be cause and effect to trying to hit a ship 600 heavier than your is you die please propose that ccp now address this most important feature to this universe
basically what your asking for is tat the exit corridor for the jita trade hub and similar staions to become a point of mass suicide because with how many people undock everyone would dieif tere were no problems that would arise fro this ccp would implment it fact is only an idiot gets close enough to an asteroid to bounce off the main problem with your idea is the stations considerng ho expensive some ships are people ould lose alot of money just undocking and then gt podded by their buddy who crashes into them 3 seconds later the only wy this mechanic could work is if your ramming a target your either currentlya at wardec aganstb at minimum currently engagig them in combatand even ten there would be one too many issues with accidental crashes in trade hbs and ahole just sitting instation undock zone with abattleship waitin for noobies to come ou ad rack up his killboard or at least just to gref people for the amusementthere are probably more points im missing or something i should have clarified on but im too tired to continue
theres been a lot of objection on the forums to the way supercarriers scale between the effect of lag and massive alpha damage its difficult for a gang of supercarriers to be challenged by anything other than more supercarriersso heres a mechanic that doesnt scale very well local active tanking theres a reason its not popular in fleet fights whats adequate to tank three players is useless when seven show up and the capacitor draw is a big liability to energy neutralizationnerf supercarrier hit points prevent supercarriers from receiving reps possibly as a module to enable fighter bombers and then give them an appropriate boost to local tanking obviously certain things may need to be tweaked titan doomsdays for example but if youre looking at a way to nerf scaling mechanics then active tanking fits just look at dreadnoughts
how powerful active tanking are we talking about here
leave supers alone stop whining about them they are fine and there are more important things that need to be fixed
like fighter bombers
nothing wrong with supers as is they die constantly just stop sucking and kill them
congrats you killed an sc and carrier in a 23 man gang with a 91 man gang that had a titan 4 scs 2 dreads a carrier and a load of bss you have successfully demonstrated that scs are overpowered and the only counter is more scsedit i like the active tanking idea with no rr allowed that said i also like the idea of deleting fbs giving them back the triage mod and just making them a more powerful triage carrier bigger local tankingrring bonuses
delet please

well i suppose you can look at the vote count every time this topic comes up for support and then you can make a note of how fast it goes down in flamesa small fraction of the eve population posts on these forums and a small fraction of that number read and post in the assembly hall so again thats a very small and certainly unrepresentative sample of eve players im not sure what the point of trying to make such assertions is anyway if youre right then all you have to do is state that you disagree and move on as the torrent of no votes flood in instead i see just a couple of people insulting anyone who supports this idea
out of simple curiosity i went back through this post to see what the general feeling about afk cloaking was and tried to put the posters into the three catagories below a few i couldnt place and some i guessed at based on their remarkssummaryfor some afk cloaking solution 17 57prefer current mechanics or removing local 11 37not sure 2 7rounding may cause percentages to not equal 100for some afk cloaking solutiongariboldi phironmatrixskye mk2thomas phillippekaelie onrenabdiel kavashseamus donohueswynetamy garzanryan starwingsveti antejohney walkerim super gayeperordev rombetter than youharrii karriemamba levagainstbaaldormars theranmystical mightmarlona skyrascaelshepard bookmurkelostlove hammerfoolish bobghurthemagsnot sureaamrrtraq mardonso i guess this should be proof enough for baaldor that most folk really do think there is something wrong with the current mechanicsedit updated to add names
not really i can as well as others post with my 3 or 4 faceless alts to support  kill the idea the point i was making is that you see this idea posted quite a bit and yet it goes absolutely no where ever wondered whyit has something to do with starting out in an emo rage or it attracts hand wringing nerds and trolls in which trolls feed on hand wringing nerds sending your thread into a tail spin i am not opposed to change just as long as the change does not nerf the crap out of game play because someone nerd is wetting himself about cloaky pixels that may or may not be afk

your missing a couple of the against column like mags for exampleafk cloaking isnt an issue without local there is no need for the afk cloaking
youre right i was skipping over mags posts by habit and missed him in the count if there are any others i missed or misplaced ill fix them but it was more to give a general feeling for where these few players posting here stand and to see whether baaldor would accept evidence he suggested we look at and not surprisingly he rejects even thati respect your opinion and disagree i think the game would be better if there was some difficult way to detect cloakers and i think people would still afk cloak if there was no local although certainly less
there would be no reason to afk cloak in the way its used now unsettling the locals if there wasnt local yes people may still cloak and leave there computer but it would be for things like needing to pee if the locals dont know you are there no local then there is no reason to afk cloak in its current formi personally think your list is a little off there are so many threads on this issue now with so many people having argued against it before some people just wont bother any more because no matter how much they argue against a particular fix the same idea comes up again about 23months down the line by someone else and the argument starts over again it never gets anywhere and descends into a mud slinging match instead of an argumentdiscussion then the cycles over again
ive been thinking a lot lately with the extended downtimes and overly long responses to petitions that maybe now is the time that the csm should start building the case for eve players to have a set of minimum standards from ccp that we can expect and when  if ever the optimist they are not reached that recompense should be forth coming from ccpnow i know many of you will say well if it does go badly wrong ccp will look at recompense in the form of skill time ect ect but if we look at this in the cold light of day we are paying for a service a gaming service like many of you i love my eve and enjoy all the tears and lols that come with it but i do believe that eve has reached a point where there should be a minim set of standards that we as the eve community should expect from ccp in regards to a number of key areasi am going to give some examples below of my view on standards1 a maximum time limit for petition responses that can be monitored and reported against2 a minimum service standard for uptime for example if there is a patch update and they give a conservative estimate of 6 hours to deploy and they go over that by a maximum additional time of 2 hours then a compensation programme should kick in possibly in the form of skill points and could be based on the additional time they go over exclusions may have to apply for server failure due to hardware failure3 a minimum standard for engagment with the eve wider community and also the csm as reps of the player basethere a number of other areas that can be given above that would set a basic standard that eve players can expect from ccpid be interested to hear what the csm think and other players to a set of minimum standards we as eve players are expected to fall within the rules of ccp and there set of minimum standards they expect form us why should we not expect the same from them towards us eve is no longer the fringe game it was many years ago and if as a eve community we are expected to move with the times and engage with incarna and other nerfs that rebalance the game then i believe we should also be able to expect minimum standards towards us from ccp as subscribersthoughts ljb
1 csm cannot force ccp to do anything recompensation to long overdue patches2 ccp sets its own standards based on subscriptions subs go up were going the right thing subs go down what are we doing wrong or is it seasonal3 eve in my opinion has never been a fringe game but a niche game  its skill system being the most notable feature as well as its core value of anything goes ganking to scamming missions to pvp and everything in between aka the sandbox taking these three points into consideration id suggest that the csm stick to its intended function of collecting player ideas from the players who took the time to vote or buy accounts for votes and conveying them to ccp as the owner of the game this is also known as a basic setup for shareholders the difference being were subscribers  and thats a big difference as ive said in other places game forums or the real world if you dont like it dont use it now this can have one of two effects taking the mmorpg aion for example the american base by and large quit because ncsoft was unresponsive to europeaamerican gamer needs less grinding in this case the result nothingthat game base has dwindled to almost nothing and remains so the asian playerbase continues to prosper and with them aion and ncsoft ccp has a diverse market of playersbut not nearly as large as i said there are one of two effects  the other is of course the company changing direction relative to their subscribers demands as a capsuleer you have two things at your disposal in the real world  throwing walls of text at a company that can easily ignore or delete them via yourself or the csm and your subscription a gallon of milk is rather high in price right now so the town has boycotted the milk guess what prices are now down because they have nowhere else to go is it fair depends on your side  the point is change was conveyed through the consumer as we all know large portions of the account base are owned by a few individuals  ccp encourages multiple accounts after all to that end multiple csm votes rest with one personguess what multiple subscriptions do too between my friends and i we at one point had 14 accounts  thats 210 usd a month small money to ccp right for a year thats 2430 usdnow were talking a bonus check the point im driving at is it makes a difference though small now lets take goonsquad and have them quit now youre talking a devs salaryor two or three since we know goons each have 18 computer screenstoo lazy didnt read if you dont like the direction ccp is going with internet spaceships which is serious business and money your money then quit not ragequit not can i have your stuff quit but without us your company goes bankrupt quit is it fair depends on your side considering ccp envisioned a zero rules sandbox game i bet theyll understand  use that warp scrambler called my subscription and make your ransom the standards you want to see be they petition response times hybrid guns new warp effects a fw system that works bot reports a barrelroll function or whatever you the subscriber desires at the end of the day if youre playing a game that isnt the way you want it why are you playing it
is this a rl death threatas to why i said that it shot over your head the maroon reference was a play on words you obviously thought that he was being too oblique so like a dumb fck you rectified itbut then again i expect that off you
coloured text didnt read
supported stations look lifeless
because ccp really needs their devs spending all day approving designs and making sure people dont put copyrighted material into the game that could be a lawsuit waiting to happenor lord knows the first thing submitted would be a ascii pen15
you know just having a corp or alliance having its own paintjob though putting a minimum player limit on it to unlock featurealso doesnt posting in these boards to suggest changes to the game count as playercreated or at least playerinspired cause these forums are more than you get in most mmos should be grateful i mean to say at least you can try to have a say i remember a certain mmo i used to play where the company did the exact opposite of whgatever teh palyers wanted and the one time they all gathered together in a trade hub to protest the changes the gms random spawned and locked all the players in high level areas and banned quite a few
also as a miner myself if one day ccp did correct and screw over the macrominers mineral prices would temporarily soar as the market empties until more players atke up mining for the rpofits then it returns close to normal which would make capitals and titans much more expensive meaning blob warfare would become extremely uneconomical and inefficient which could cut down on blobwarfare except with the biggest of alliances and even with them they would have to shuffle alot of their stuff to keep enough income to maintain blob warfareso yeah do not legalize macromining last thing we need is another reason to make this supercapsonline
did i get this right first i need an alliance or other big group of players the resident vote doesnt matter since unorganized vote is utterly ineffectual then get voted as the mayor and then sit on my posterior doing nothing except watching the money flow from the racketso to work in any kind of a way the upgrade economy would need to be completely separate from the player economy except the taxes reason otherwise the mayor will raise tax to maximum gather money and then use the entire sum to buy a single cheapesttomake upgrade from himselfaltcorpmatealts corpmate and pocket the money only if theres no way tax money will end up in a players wallet the system will be secure and then it will be of interest only for people wanting to play simcity which admittedly there is a good number the only way the mayor could be rewarded is by a fixed tiny fraction of the income in the region impossible to be modified this would make it imperative to promote activity in the region and to keep the taxes lowon the fiction side theres only one democracy in new eden the gallente federation the state is a corporate state anarchocapitalist oligarchy and the republic is a theatre democracy possibly aristocratic or more likely just oligarchic the empire is well a theocratic feudal monarchythe suggestion is somewhat close to the idea of viceroyalties that have been thrown around for a very very long time in essence a group of players could gain a viceroyalty development rights etc to a system this could be done various ways the bestfitting to the setting of which would be an auction say you pay a few trillion to be the next caretaker of jita and try to set policies so that you make it back during your stay in the office on the other hand the bid to become the manager of nirbhi derelik 09 no stations no valuable ore not possible to put up pos located in the middle of nowhere could be won at a minimum bid amamake development rights would naturally be highly contested for their epeen valuethe balancing issues therefore are the amount of money moving and the size of the viceroyalty a whole region is certainly too large  though people or better yet corporations should be allowed to bid for multiple systems storylinewise it does not make sense someone to be able to take control of say amarr or pator so the access to bidding should likely be gated someway  possibly the same as pos corporate standings not possible to manage 08 and up there is some issues here specially when the caldari state has already sold the development rights to npc megacorporations to the gallente fw systems their militia once occupied
thats like blaming obama for the 2008 market collapse
its the same reason we dont tell people our pin or give them the password to our accounts if you tell people how a lock the game is made then they will know how and exactly where to break it secrets are kept secret for good reasons
completely different issues and not gonna happen isnt exactly a compelling argument a much better way of saying the same thing would be if it aint broke dont fix it  that is of course if you actually believe that 00 space isnt broke
no one said 00 isnt brokeit isjust not this part docking permissions are fine as is could maybe use more flexibility in permissions distribution but hey i dont wanna be greedy because there are more important things for them to look at then this right now also im not a true 00 denizen i just vacation there every now and then and have never had any trouble fall onto me because i couldnt dock just means you have to be smarter about how you play and dont log off in a high traffic area or you will log back in inside the middle of pirates or really annoyed sov owners
oh i have docked in almost every region of eve it isnt hard to get docking rights in any region through creative use of alts and corp changes but it isnt about me or any individual who has already lives out in 00 the idea is how to get more people into 00 thats one of ccps stated goals and many changes they have made have been with this as the goal i am providing a suggestion which will increase the number of empire bears that are willing to give null space a go ccp wants 00 to have real markets the way to do that is to stop restricting docking rightsprovidence back when cva ran the show was a prime example of what all of null space could look like i challenge anyone to claim that providence wasnt a kickbutt region because it certainly was note ive never been in cva or any cva pets and have almost always been red to cva with my main
do you honestly think youd get more people into null by letting them dock in stations filled with people who would kill them without hesitation provi under cva was an anomaly none of the major sov blocs work under nrds systems like they did
voithno one is advocating that all fights are smallgate camping by a small gang is the problem not the goal what can a small gang of 520 do gate camp that is it gate camping can harass another alliance but is not often a well defined goal and most gangs are looking for good fights currently these small gangs do not have any other attainable objectives than harassment and picking of solo or pairs of stragglers they do so until bored because there foes stop using the systemitel is onto your gank or a much larger blob appears and run away this is not ideal for either party and not sustainably fun now imagine something bettersay for a station a small gang could achieve some tangible goal in system the gang would form up go out and go towards there objective the defending side would be forced into action or risk losing x this would prompt defense fleets to actually form up and defend on short notice and maybe not reach blob sizeyou have no created an objective for small gangs encouraged small gangs for offence and defense and improved sov warfare and made parts of it more fun than grab 1000 ships and lag fight each other and tally the tab to see who won or maybe a module that acts as a cyno jammer that is deployable in systemwould show like a cyno become so no hiding the small gang can now go about there objective and a defense fleet would have to take out the cyno jammer before hot dropping the smaller gangthere are a lot of options many better than my terrible ideas the goal however is simple make small gangs funhow it is done is not as simple you are right that we have to worry about small gangs having to much effect we also need to ensure the mechanics of such can not be abused and cause inordinate effects to the effort involved this is why i would like to see more discussion on this topic so we can provide the csm and ccp with clearly defined goals and objectiveshalyconthat is exactly what i would like to seei especially enjoy the bit about a clear defined objectivefor the csm maybe a clear concise statement of what we want would be of more benefit judging from the thread to many people believe small gangs just want to gank with impunitystatementsmall gang warfare in 00 is lacking requires more small scale objectives to foster this style of game play small gang 00 warfare should promote the followingencourage small gangs to form up give small gangs rewarding objectivesenable small gangs prompt a response from other alliances encourage gang on gang warfareadditions or qualifications to the above goalsi suck at writing these things so looking for some help
i had a corp mate that had an interesting idea player controlled incursions the gist is small gangs can deploy a device in a system that will cause incursion effects for x hoursdays if the residents dont put a stop to it this forces the residents to actually defend their territory rather than safe up until the gang passes through and if they dont they have to deal with poorer bounties etc etc player controlled incursions
so youll be happy to share empire with everyone when they just pack up and leave because theres utterly no point in paying the sov bills then i dont particularly like grinding anomalies to earn isk but all itll take is a moon nerf to send alliance balances into the negative and no it wont impact any currently existing supercapital pilots because theyll just pull a plthe future of eve roaming supercaps in low and null sec and ten thousand bots grinding l4s in empire to support them
adapt or die move to highsec you wont be missed keep in mind pl is being funded by the largest sov holders in the universe at the moment who also happened to be based in the most worthless nullsec space this side of providence dont rmt away all of your isk like vuk and co so you can keep the bills paid and ships replaced
you probably would come and take it just to prove that you could but that is not really my point just seems that if the moon already shows that it has resourses it should be able to be mined
well i doubt anyone makes serious isk from highsec ratting  but it would be interesting to know how much isk is made from mission rats in highsec compared to belt and anomaly rats in nullsecas for mission rewards this is balanced by the loyalty store there was a post by a dev sometime ago i dont have the link though in fact together with the loyalty store missions are a negligible sink
