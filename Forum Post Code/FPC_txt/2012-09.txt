1 naturallyof course this is one of many things the long overdue rework of corp roles and management includes
im not gonna repeat how for the very majority of t2 items the t2 bpos have little impact on sell pricesif you make the invented item more efficient to produce it will benefit all inventors prices will fall and margins will remain similar to before the changemany items produce at a loss because people invent blindly not doing the math oversupplying the market driving price down selling below cost
the need for this can be explained with the following bullet points new ships create need for minerals to be harvested thus giving industrial pilots more options on ship builds new ships create new targets particularly lucrative ones for pirates it is a nice isk sink purchasing bpos from the npc corporations it is a nice mineral sink as it would technically be a capital ship much like freighters it would enhance the capabilities of ship production corporations to move vessels they have built it would enhance actual logistical capabilities of corps engaged in numerous types of operations it would allow for people to move their base of operations quite easily it would make shiphauling contracts much simpler it would open up a new subcareer for haulers it would allow for neutrals to move combat vessels for corpsalliances engaged in wars for a steep price it would create many many tears to be collected if destroyed and allow for the chance of a carried ship to be dropped in spacei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
if youre going to change the skybox of any region do it to delve delve is boring as

sighlots of wordsposted from in game and lost it alltldr make pos modular mooring is not the way to go

god damn people arent still suggesting those sodding awful stabilizer ideas are they i thought we were past this they are horrific ideas stop repeating them
why not wormhole destabilizers that way we can really just give a giant middle finger to everyone suggested stupid crap in this thread
lol we pretty much want the same thing the only way id advocate a wh stabilizer is if all whs are initiallydestabilized and the stabilizer which would be a vulnerable attackable module somehow replaced the mass limits that currently governs wh travel i understand most people hear only module to let infinite ships through a wh and equate it with wh blobbing but thats not even remotely what im suggesting and as for your wh destablizerhow would it function a bomb you launch at the wh to randomly remove mass  terrible idea as people would just launch bombs to close whs without risking your precious orca targets would it be a module you anchored that collapsed the wh the next time a ship comes through  terrible idea as people would use them to close whs without risking your precious orca targets how could it function in a manner that i cant exploit to risklessly close a wh the problem is wh mass limit is too mathematically defined people know exactly how to close each type of wh and worse wh vitality is actually dependent on the ability to close a wh because you need to spawn a new wh to find more sites to run what ccp really needs to do is randomize wh extinction events and i dont know the best way to do this but ill listen to whatevers on the table to identify it as good or bad other ideas coupled together could also work 1 prevent ships from using a wh when their mass is more than the remaining mass on a wh and perhaps have it actually close the wh without going through 2 make it so a new static wh will spawn without needing to close your old static example whenever a current static goes critical time andor mass a new static will spawn 3 more ambiguous wh mass limits via wh mass regeneration 100mish kghr but dont update the mass critical messages 4 change the critical point so a wh claims critical randomly when the mass limit remaining is between 1035 whs mass limit 5 alter the timeremaining to vary inversely with mass regeneration ie if a whs mass is regenerating then perhaps its life cycle speeds up so it decays faster there are pros and cons to each of the above too
take the noctis remove the two rectangular cargo hold thingies flanking the ship near the engines and replace them with some kind of cylindricalspherical gas tanks examplemove 4 of the high slots to low slots lore states the hull is an armour tankerremove salvagertractor beam bonusesgive the ship a 10 bonus to gas harvester yield 4 become effectively 6 at level 5 ore industrial skillgive the ship a suitable secondary bonus tank or somethinggive the ship a 75m drone bay with 50mbit bandwidth and introduce gas harvesting dronesgive the ship a small cargo hold and large gas bay approx 500010000m3done its only a little better than using a bc and requires very little work
how about that you just do a t2 version of the noctis that is specialized in gas harvesting or somethingand seems that i wasnt the only one thinking this xdand to make it more fun they should add nice new graphics also for the t2 ship so it would look like a gas harvester rather than a regular noctis
this may be interesting but ide wait for the mining frig to come out as i have a feeling that may actualy not be to bad for gas mining if not then could be interesting to get a specilised gas miner as ccp seem to be heading into this kinda thing more and more
indeed so what will happen if a dedicated gas miner is introduced gas supply goes up prices fall and gas mining profitability remains about the samethe only actual changes would be to require people to sink sp into the dedicated gas miner and to increase the hassle of moving gas to market as the larger volumes of gas are now worth less the best griefing is when people ask for it themselves
this needs saying more even if the number of players doubled and all the new peeps were pvebears it would improve the game  for pvpersotoh lets get rid of mining and then the last person with a ship is the winner
yes please do thismake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
on a seafaring ship ammunition for the batteries and guns is stored in what is known as the ships magazine it separates possible explosive ordinance form everyday items such as food allowing minimal interference should there be a fire considering the amount of ammunition that is sometimes carried by pvpers and pveers alike my proposal would allow a small portion of the ships cargo hold to be designated as the magazine which players can manually place ammunition for their weapons into the ship will automatically reload from the magazine instead of ammunition from the cargohold this also serves to separate ammunition and scripts from general cargo so as to ease the transfer between the ships cargo and the instation inventory managementleadership is something you learn maybe one day youll learn that
im gonna stop you right there we fly space ships
which doesnt negate my point in the least considering several scifi shows that have kinetic weapons also use magazine holdsleadership is something you learn maybe one day youll learn that
ammo bay because ccp has a problem with multiple windows open multiple location access and generally having a useable product i do not see this happening in the near future
i like the idea but how do you decided how large this magazine should be how many rounds is considered enough is it a standard size per shipon another note  i am always looking for a good scifi show could you name of a few you enjoyeddusenman
this seems like an addition for the sake of an addition also you cant use real life as inspiration and then not see that eve doesnt have an issue with ammo exploding inside our ships and destroying our consumablesthis thread has some great suggestions
i wish there was an ammo hold like ore holds etc if you are carrying gear or lootingsalvaging you have to waste time looking to see how much ammo you have left if you put the ammo in a can you cant load it loot and salvage go straight to the cargo holdi agree with the spirit of the op
make an ammo filter it take all of two seconds
i dont particularly see the need for this either you bring sooo much ammo that you are limited in the loot you can hold or you minimize the ammo you bring theres a nice trade off here in actuality your cargo hold is an ammo hold that you can also put other stuff there very few ships actually have need for a cargo bay
i had a similar idea but no separate magazine or holdauto restockthis way when you undock it will tell you if you are missing any ammo  charges  user set of course 
let me tell you what i used to do i used to have the cargo hold open at all time in it i had a can that about took up a good portion of the cargo hold but left enough room for ammo this was awesome with medium can in a caracal all loot went in the can rogue ammo stuff that i would never use that time went in the can toothe point was to keep ammo i was not using out of the context menu of the launchers and gunsit also prevents grinding ammo you builtneed which my friends did oftenthe lootallbutton is a blessing and a curse it is vastly faster to loot but there is no flow control the new cargo viewer is also a blessing and a curse its huge even in its smallest form it has grown in size progressively over the years so i gave up on keeping it open ccp tends to feel that large clunky windows and naming schemes are bettera filter can help with viewing how much ammo i have left yes but it will never affect the weaponry context menu also filters would have to change each time i changed ships which would just be annoying since i fly so many types i really dont want to have than many filters eitherat this point i see two options1 an ammo bay which would do the separating and could be kept open to view rounds remaining sadly this would not be efficient use of screen realestate2 an ammo display that showed how many shots volleys and even rounds remaining it would probably only show the ammo in use it could even go in the hoverinfo of weapons and possibly other modules eg cap boosters however this would not clean up the weapon context menuboth would be ideal since missile ammo now has the same names for fof and normal ammo it has become a lot easier to mistake one for the other its an annoyance until you are reloading under fire
some of you may have noticed these remarks in the last csm notes regarding the project to revamp starbasesso our huge revamp originally slated for this winter has slipped to sometime in 2013now keep in mind this is from the same company who announced walking in stations in 2006 named the release incarna in 2009 then followed up with release in 2011 im sure those alliance logos on ships from 2008 are coming along nicely guysso in the same manner as the supercap rebalances earlier this year im asking for a sticking plaster patch to help relieve some issues with starbases until ccp can realise their final vision for them this would be solely using statistics tweaks and an absolute minimum of coding workproblems a the increase in general ship ehp and proliferation of logistics since 2007 even if youre manually controlling all the guns on the tower it takes far too many medium guns to damage typical fleet ships of 100k ehp large guns typically need over a minute to lock and cycle to the next target and thats assuming any of them track the target and that the target isnt immediately locked up by 50 logistics cruisersoh wait you wanted to ewar those cruisers to hamper repping sorry thatll be a whole minute to lock it with that single ecm then hell warp out and back quicker than it took to lock himb no risk to supercaps at all even if a tower could tackle one most modules melt in seconds resistance as they say is futile you used to be able to kill dreads with these things if you used them properly now everyone is sporting enough dps to level a tower in moments and the only real risk during a siege is if you forget the bring a support fleet and the enemy reacts within 2 minutes flattowers stats were last balanced over 6 years ago and were meant to be hit by a dozen dreads at most who would sit in siege for 10mins in order to do anything of note now everyone rolls around with 5min siege cycles and supercaps that the tower cannot possibly hurt unless the pilot happens to suffer a stroke midop while thrashing his hands into the keys that turn off his hardeners and accidently saying go on guys ill catch up later into commsc useless mods hands up if youve ever used hybrid weapons or god forbid missiles on a serious tower if you raised your hand there get out of this thread youre dumb and i dont want your supporteveryone knows that even vaguely effective towers use laser or projectile guns or more likely just lots of hardeners why not make starbase citadel torps an actual antisupercap weapon like their shipmounted counterparts lets make hybrids capable of blowing up things larger than passing jetcansd stagnation with the exception of various tweaks to jump bridges or fueling starbases have been unchanged for over 5 years now sure they can tip the balance in small scale fights as low sec corp a sieges low sec corp b with both of their dreadnoughts but anywhere else theyre not even an issue sieging towers in nullsec is another dull structure shoot that no longer encourages real traps or surprises because the tower cant do  because everyone just puts hardeners on themplease bring back the risk the drama and dare i say excitement of putting your  out in space and hoping someone wont chop it offpossible solutions1 make starbases even a slight risk to supercaps  such as letting warp scramblers not disruptors tackle just like a hic focused point or buffing energy neuts with more cap drain and hp thanks to the huge sig on supercaps any such module could be balanced around its scan resolution very easily2 general increase in weapon damage especially for medium guns failing this let large guns lock faster  they certainly aint for killing capitals anymore 3 right now the only reliable way to get enough pos gunners to a tower in time to man everything is if your opponent is nice enough to send a written invitation in advance give people with starbase defense management trained the ability to use more modules more effectively such as 2 per level or starting with 3 basic then add 1 per level or 5 basic with a scan res bonus per level 3b a couple of ui fixes to starbase gunning would be sweet too why cant i grab or drop multiple mods at once  i swear one of you devs is making money off a cure for rsi4 tweak tower bonuses with appropriate racial ewar caldari already get ecm bonuses but why dont we get neut bonuses on amarr damps for gallente or webbing boosts for minmatar5 varied size ewar mods with stats suited to their appropriate target we already have small medium and large guns why not the same for ecm damps neuts and websmedium webs able to lock battleships but not slow them quite as effectively as their larger counterparts small ecm with a quick locking timer to counter small threats like bombers but with a suitably small jamming strengthsmallmedium damps intended to counter logistics cruisers in a way the current ecm mods cantoh and are you worried about balance in wormholes im sure that crazy space can be convinced to do all sorts of zany yet very simple things to starbase systems just like ships scan resolution tweaks anyone
small changes could make poss more livable for everyone if we had even small tweaks now instead of waiting a few years for massive changes fix the small things like cleaning up the way moon miners and silos interact making it clear things are linked
i have starbase defense management trained to v on multiple characters but havent controlled pos guns in at least 2 years there s very little point to it anymore other than being a tiny nuisance to an enemy subcap fleet buffing pos gunning would be a good stopgap while we await a long promised overhaul of the pos system
id dearly love siloes to have the option to send mails when theyre full or empty much like towers scream to give you warning that theyre going to go offline
1 i would be willing to have a ccp devs man baby if they would change the rorq hold to an industrial hold that allows either ore or fuel blocks just sayin
oh yeah some realtalkbased on the previous track record with other features and major changes a 2013 date for this project means we should start seeing solid info around fanfest then ccp will throw out some foundation work for the main summer patch to help get things lined up but we wont see the new starbases themselves that will follow with a lengthy handover plan coming in the winter patch intended to get things ready and swapped over in time for christmasbut wait something went wrong they found a bug and now the handover gets extended to new year our new starbases are now live in early 2014 but with some indicated features like docking in them still on the drawing board and coming soon prove me wrong stoffer 
hi the marauder is a little obsolete because the t3 and noctis are better than the marauder the idea will be to use the same hull then now but to add one sub function only onethe sub function is like sub for t3 you add some bonus to your ship example for sub function for amarr its only some examplesub function amarr 1  75 bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems 100  bonus to range and velocity version like nowsub function amarr 2 5 rate of fire 10 m3 and 10 mbitss for drone  with lvl 5 you have 25 more dps on the guns and you can use 5 heavy dronesub function amarr 3  800 armor hitpoints sub function amarr 4  5 tracking speed 10 optimalwith this system that would be possible to had some love to bs t2 that will be possible for all t2 shipthey are some advantage for ccp to make that you dont need to adjust the ship parameter like cpu power grid etc its only some bonus
well this is news to me why did no one tell me marauders arent obsolete a noctis may salvage better and a strategic cruiser may kill better but marauders can do both sure theyre not amazing at both but they shouldnt be which is great for someone like me who has one account and doesnt want to switch ships to go back and salvage
nerf the noctis its opnerf t3 cruisers theyre opproblem solved no new ships neededseriously
or you could require npc ship kills to finish a site
lets get some more support goingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
actually you can you set it to your corp and then you can accept a courier you madehow many battleships would it have to carry to be better the just shuttling over and flying them back freighters align and warp slow if the new freighter could only carry two it might not be an actual time saver three may be better but not by much so it may have to be able to carry 4 to really be an advantage over just making more trips1
i support this proposal fully 1this is very close to how i imagined pi should beif this will ever be realized slim chances but we could hope eve will gain entirely new dimension that will make its universe much closer to ultimate scifi game ever conceivedand if it will be done it could  would lay great foundation for nextgeneration gameplay  flying in planets atmospheres and maybe even walking or driving on planets surfaces first person dreams dreamseditthis gave me another ideaccp has been able to merge read bought white wolf company so why not do same with mindark who produced great planet based game entropia universe and then use their system for planetary based gameplayjust food for thought but worth trying
except i was trolling i dont want any kind of stabilizer or destabilizer that would just dumb down wormholes and when you dumb down wormholes all you do is allow some tard corps have the ability to live successfully in a c5c6 and thats a bad thing noob corps deserve only one thing in c5c6s death
while i agree with your points the idea of a wh stabilizer could hold merit you are making the mistake of thinking that whs are individual systems but theyre not just like new eden theyre a galaxy of systems only instead of stargates there are whswhat youre seeing here might not just be the option for large alliances to stabilize an entry wh in null and just blob through but rather a way to travel in this new galaxy one owned entirely by players without actually owning the territory like null basically if it was wh to wh stabilization i dont think it would be a problemthat being said wh stabilization would add an interesting mechanic if allowed only in certain whs or systems it could create an interesting system of linked wh systems while still allowing for random and limited transportation between other sections of the whs galaxy and ks furthermore by making it a player tool that means it can be lost unlike stargates that are there forever these stabilizers could be destroyedimagine for a minute if you will an alliance of wh corps who have slowly but surely stabilized whs connecting to each others systems they can now combine and coordinate forces inside their linked systems but must limit their movement outside of their stabilized systems or to ksnow to prevent corpsalliances from just sieging with a stabilizer in place there would be a system wide warning that a wh is being stabilized giving players a chance to stop it or a counter modulebuilding or require that the stabilizer must be put on both sides of the wh making it vulnerable as 1 it would lower mass to bring that through and 2 it would be attackable also due to it lowering mass of the wh it would give the defender the advantage as less forces can warp through to defend the wh stabilizer and the more defenders they bring in to protect it the weaker it gets suicide runs by the defender to try and pass through whs to close them making the stabilizer set up uselessnow that ive said all that i can full well understand why at face value this seems bad but honestly it could be a great expansion to the kinds of play you can experience especially for other wh goers ive been living in a wh for about 7 months now and while this could be catastrophic if done wrong if done right it could probably add a lot to the game
1i find it kind of lazy that sleepers are still based around the scan anom run anom mechanic i would find it more fitting to have to go through acceleration gates perhaps using hackers etc and other skills to navigate through complexsie longer perhaps e

after the fiasco with the horribad inventory you really want the inventory to be more complicated or butchered worseso to your proposal i dont just say no but  noi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
that shows all the ammo you looted as well when what you want to see is just the ammo you plan on usingbut that brings up issues will ammo be allowed in the normal hold if yes can i move it from the normal hold to the magazine can i jet ammo for a fellow fleet member to load
this is a general call to the csm and to the community as a player who is drawn to the hard nature of eve online i am sure that there will be some who say that i got what was coming and that is ok but i am a bit saddened by this course of events and ask the csm to make sure that stuff like this does not continue my storymy character formerly called prize dept had a scam going that involved contracting ships to winners of somer blink 
quite frankly im suprised you even got one person to fall from it as i spotted it almost straight away when you sent me a hookbill wanting a bill for it
its a shame that the sandbox is getting so small feel your pain caldari citizen the game isnt what it used to be
scamming is allowed and i dont see how this is violation of the eula at the same point in time your actions are pretty reprehensible even if legit
but wait poses need to cloak and have a jump drivev
hell put a range marker on the green box so we know how far away it is for minimum distance that would make life a bunch easierim not even going to try and ask to get rid of that damn box that would be a pipe dream
if you check with the amarr sub function 1 you have exactly the same marauder than nowi have only add some new role with the same hull with this method you have more flexibility like t3 on the marauder the amarr caldari etc have learn from sleeper technology and began to adapt some sub for this ship class example  you found the sub function bpc in the fractional warfare lp store to build them its a mix with rig component and t3 component
i dont think id like acceleration gates in wormholes but id support more dynamic sites or more varied mechanicsgoals for sites
bump bump bump jack i want to have your baby
i also believe that there should be tiericide for the industrials and i lean towards idea 1as for a industrial  freighter midpoint i would suggest a tech 2 transport with a massive base cargohold and massive cargohold bonusesthe fact that the gallente have five industrials doesnt hurt the idea of specialization at all rather three of them would be highly specialized and the other two would be more balanced but still leaning in certain directions also there would be subtle differences between the races also few industrials might tend towards flexibility with poor base stats but a large number of slots high cpu and pg thinking of the sigil with 5 low slots maybe if it has even moreanother concept is to have both tiers and special roles the minmatars fast industrial would also be the cheapest and lowest skil requirements wreathe and meanwhile the one with the largest hold is expensive and has high skill req unchanged mammoth this might reflect the lore that the minmatar have the fastest ships but a poor economy meanwhile the gallente have more middle of the road ships on the bottom two with more specialized ships on higher tiers
you know you are a vet when you have seen this proposal resurrected and rehashed at least 3 timesjust putting my friendly no vote again its just like a character bazaar but worse will likely spawn people who play 1 year as a certain class then switch up entirely to another one a year later that essentially cheats the skill system out of another years worth of your subscription money and effort assuming you take 2 years to skill up both classes
terrible terrible ideaterriblein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
maybe that means you should bug ccp to fix the tutorials or otherwise make the new player experience better not ask for a cheat to compensate for a bad tutorial i think team five 0 is doing good work on this front recently but in the big picture of things is  the sp you end up putting into skills after running all the tutorials is what like less than 12mil that not that much wasted time also i didnt find that any skills learned in the security tutorial agent was wasted im curious to know which ones were wasted and would have been better spent making you fit a kestrel properlyyou shouldnt assume that just because you took the indy tutorial then you should be prepared for the security tutorial they are distinct and independent remember that some people choose to skip some tutors entirely if they wanted to say be just a grunt maybe you should have done that instead of wasting your time and sp with the indy tutorial
i think you need to live with whatever ty decision youve made its called a consequencenow ing deal with iti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
no1 if i can unlearn a few million skills every year i can save them and instantly ship into anything i desire at a moments notice this is not a good thing hell 700k sp will allow me to train a brand new race from noships to frig iv cruiser iv and bs iv its another 400k for frig v 1m for cruiser v and its 16m for bs v 2 i can train precep will skills all day long and then untrain them to pick up nice leadership skills without remapping to charisma or whatever this basically allows me to earn those pesky specialty skills 55 faster and 2m sp is enough to pick up four basic fleet bonuses to v or two warfare link bonuses to v 3 just because you arent utilizing a skill now doesnt mean you didnt gain benefit from that skill in the past so youre essentially reaping the rewards of your skillpoints more than once also just because you dont use a skill now doesnt mean you wont use it in the future people change careers all the time in eve and having a wide variety of skills keeps doors open
while it sounds like an attractive idea all it really does is cater to the impatient or lazy just keep the skills you have and train new ones t hat you want in a few years youll wish you had something new to train
k so this is an idea i dont think has been proposed ive looked around but hadnt seen anything quite like this so here goesidea is to create a temporary bounding sphere when the bomb goes off of varying sizes and masses in order to utilise bumping as a tactic in null sec warfare tech 2 bomb launcher ammotype 1  creates a small but extemely heavy temporary bounding sphere upon detonation 1000m radius 15t mass 50sec duration bomb should have a slow speed and regular flight time to make sniping with this less likely and getting in range more difficultfor example10sec flight time  1500msec range 15kmtype 2  creates a large but relatively light temporary bounding sphere upon detonation10000m radius 200m mass 25sec durationunsure of bomb characteristics to this possibly a faster speed and slightly shorter flight time intended to overshoot the enemy and push ships into the damage profile of conventional bombs for example75sec flight time  7500msec speed range 5625km
i can totally see people using this on their own fleets to gtfo
sure you cant get it to show the exact ammo type youre using but you can specify for instance regular or advanced cruiseprojectilehybrid ammo that will filter it down maybe three or four results if you cant put in the effort to look through three or four results then god help youand the truth is people have managed without ammo bays and filters up until now this isnt one of those vets have had it harder back in the day posts but really how much do you want this game to play itself for you
actually you can have it show just the exact ammo you want just type the first three or four letters into the search bar its really not that hard to find your ammo if youre willing to just make a modicum of effort
i honestly dont get what the op is on about if i need to change ammo right click my weapon and select what i want i dont need to open my cargo i dont need to rummage through anything i picked up
dont know how i missed that guess im not used to the search bar kudos for yousee people
if your name was irrelevant to the scam then being renamed is irrelevant to iteither you were trying to trick people into believe you were someone else or it doesnt matter that you were renamed

hello allin the five career agents that new players get access to after completing the initial new player arc each mission has a the standard buttons at the bottom i would ask that the deny button be removed as there is no reason to deny the missions in the arcs i know characters could easily hit the button by accident in haste and that should change
one does not simply buy a company lol
i fully support an expansion for pi which will lure more people to the gamebut i have two issues with the whole concept i disapprove of terraforming in any way shape or form the increased supply of pi would have to be negated by using more and more pi in tech ii or tech iv whatever ccp has to work out manufacturing
bump
would love to see u try that and watch 90 of ur fleet end up misaligned drifting due to inertia and unable to get into warp for longer than if u hadnt have used it
actually the way i see it if an engagement goes south for your own side you have your own stealth bombers lob a couple of these at your own fleet and capitals sending everyone flying and giving everyone a chance to warp off to random celestialsbtw have you seen how fast capital ships move when they are ejected from a pos shield they make interceptors look slow
yahh but neither of my 2 ammo suggestions would work as effectively as pos shields pos shield r like 60km in diameter roughly the largest version of mine is like 20km and even with that itll only launch a bs equivalent to if another bs bumped it by cynoing right ontop of itthe other more brutal one has a diameter of 2km not exacly much in the vastness of space and no where near like a 60km pos shield
i would like to be able to set multiple jobs for example highlight multiple identical bpcs and then set the jobs its been too long ccp it cant be that hard
topic says it allwhy1 you are not playing the game but yet you still are2 your getting an indirect benefits in many ways and your still not playing the gamei dont realy care how this is dealt with my solution would be a heavy water fuel bay to the claoks but thats my ideanow lets hear the whines next
there is a search function on this forum try looking up how often this has come up before starting a new one otherwise we end up saying the same things as before over and overjust go back and read the old threads all 30 or so of them in which this gets shot downin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
can you come up with a way to do this removing afk cloaking that does not hurt active cloakersso far no one has
currently the insurance system is about rewarding you when you are a failure and lose a ship the insurance system should be removed and replaced with a killing system where you get rewarded for killing the shipsoverall there would be less isk being generated because there wouldnt be any platinum insurance killers would get the base insurance prices
i wholeheartedly agree there is too much isk in circulation as it is and baddies need to be punished more
i beleve a system should be in place where that there is instead of there is there being a insuranze system there should be that there is a killing systemtm if where u kill and there is a ship you kill that you should then get that killing systemtm reward this reward would be the basic insurance of that shipulimtately this will be good  i think
the problem with this is amarr and caldari only have 2 haulers they need moar
as others have said this has come up before i have a very complete answer in fact the thread title was changed to rescinded some time afterward 
no becausetrain skills want to change entire eve lifestyle remaps skills and suddenly instead of max industryscience skills i can fly super capsthe only way for this to work at all is for there to be a remap in which you lose something like 50 of the sp that you remap so a x5 skill being remapped would yield about 500k sp  lvl 5 of that skill is about 1mil sp this means anyone remapping this skill would have lost about 12 days of training and flipping professions would have a very very large penalty
1would be awesome in so many situations
this might be a small issue but i has bothered the hell out of me for a while nowwhy are the armor repairer and remote armor repairer pictures the same thing i mean this is not an issue when it comes to the tech 1 and tech 2 modules that say large armor repairer or large remote armor repairer but when it comes to the meta modules most of the time i cannot tell the difference unless i show info and either read the description or look at the variations tab and i figured this shouldnt be an issue seeing as when ti comes to shield booster vs shield transporter they have different pictures so why cant the armor counterparts get different pictures even if its as simple as adding the arrows from the shield transporter picture to the armor repper picture so that it indicates its a remote armor moduleam i alone in feeling this or has this bothered any one else i mean its a simple picture icon that im sure wont take too long to make and install can we please discuss this and possibly work towards fixing itlord rectanus
if you like this idea please vote for it the thumbs up icon and dont forget to leave a comment thank you helloi already posted a similar message in the features  ideas discussion but ive been told that it deserved to be here too so i allow myself to suggest it to you if you dont mindsince i saw the smart filters that have been added to the inventory window devblog article i told myself it would be really cool to also be able to filter the overview windowi know that overview tabs can be configured the way the player wants them to be but it would be nice to be able to filter the overview in real time thus the overview window could have two new filter features  the smart filters and the quick filter box note that this post now contains other ideas related to the overview window not only filters1 smart filtershere is a mockup image that shows what it could look like
the overview needs love the things here might be part of the love but id like to see much more love and integration
briliant absolutely lovable perfectly perfect sweet sxy time idea o
this
yes yes
so i decided to try this afk cloaking thing that people clearly think is an exploit so i figure il get rich doing iti set my alarm to wake up right after downtime and undock from jita in a stealth bomber with nothing but a cloak eagerly awaiting isk and rage mails saying why they think i am cheating or a bad personso i warp to a safe and cloak then go back to bed i woke up with no mails or isk  so i guess i have to stay there longeri left my computer on till downtime again didnt touch anything other then chat a bit in corp chatnothing happened even the next day which i did it again there seems to be no exploit or issuetherefore afk cloaking isnt a problem
no no and no ever hear of psychological warfare well just cause u never encountered it doesnt mean its not an effective tactic grab the enemy by the balls squeeze reaaal tight and then u put a cherry on a cake and put a few cloaked ships afk in their remaining hq systems oh yeah i can hear their tears in the cold vacuum of spacebad idea to deny that
yes i have and i want that part of the gameplay be active and not have fun with my alt ill go make isks elsewhere while you look at my alt theresee now the key word active gameplay which seems to be something ccp also likesgoing afk is not active gameplay i dont mind the cloakers or the people who cloak up and do psychological warfare its a real fun part of the game but i hate people who are not playing the game but are still playing the game even though they can be at the mall buying porn films or something else
suphere my reason why id argue its legit with regards to active gameplay  the corp that is being greefed this way deserves it its a valid mechanic they allowed them self to be in such a situation it wouldnt be fair for the attacker to suffer boredom in afk psychowar an attacker by that point has the right to make an enemy suffer while retaining the flexibility of time to go about their life and leaving afk boats to discourage the enemy that right was earned by superior ballstactics whatever else to do thattruth is there are more reasons too for example ure in 0 sec and gate is being camped on both sides u ether a hunter an explorer or maybe even a daring trader in a cloaked indy the game shouldnt force u to be online for next 50 years the gate be camped u should be able to go afk and return later to see if ur chases to make a ran for it has improved there are more there it came from on the other hand i do agree that cloak needs an effective counter a way decloak an enemy some other way then drone swarm something more dependable maybe a new anticloak probe or even a special ship that specializes in antirecon activities donno0
if afk is the problem because they are not playing while playing thenadd fuel needs to drones so people cant afk missionsadd fuel needs to mining lasers so people cant afk mineadd fees to sit in stations so people cant afk in stationand add an auto log timer so that if you are afk for more than 15 min you get logged outthat should suitably counter all afk activities
i think youve provided enough whines for this thread already azraeljint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
any solution to afk cloaking needs to be careful not to hurt standard cloak operations a cloak is a valid tool for hiding from hostiles for going afk for several minutes to answer the phone for   essentially balancing it would be very hard and difficult to do add to this afk cloaking is the only valid manner to counter the nearlyomniscient local chat that is used as an intel tool addressing afk cloaking without addressing local chat is like banning legal gun ownership without addressing the high crime rate or demanding abstinence only education without addressing teen pregnancy or banning abortion without addressing incest  or legitimate medical concerns
my god is this arguement really going on againjust give it up there is nothing wrong with afk cloakies if theyre afk then they cant hurt you if theyre not then they would suffer fromt he stupid ideas people come up with the hurt the afk onesjust give it up there is nothing wrong with afk cloakies
did you know that in almost a decade of eve online not a single person has died to an afk cloaker
no
1 assembly hall is for well thought out ideas that are ready to be brought to the csms attention 2 youre proposal is a bit vague on details who gets paid for blowing up a ship do you get paid for blowing up your own ship cause thats what the insurance system currently is do you get paid for blowing up someone elses ship how would this lessen the insurance faucet are you only addressing semantics or what is your idea

thank you for participating in this forum betolii am ready to accept suggestions to make it more integrated but i dont see how i could do it more lets start brainstorming by more integrated would you like it to be less visible or you would like it to have more options maybe when the smart filters menu is not expanded it doesnt take much space and the quick filter box is still available 
very good 1

theres been some good ideas in fi and one or two really comprehensive ones do a search and on the old forumsthe overview is the most important ui element in the game  its also the crapest  and it takes up most space there are so many things wrong with it its hard to know where to start but ccps approach is generally to go at something comprehensively  the risk is that in doing the odd tweak they wont touch it again for yearsmuch more should be graphical we should not be limited to one for example i could have a single column celestial view next to my detailed pvp view tabs are far too annoying and unintuitive to set up with consequences for getting it wrong it is the epitome of spreadsheets in space configurable buttons column for common actions appropriate for each object linked to tab settings you should never need to right click take cans  what do i ever do with them  approach and open so my cans setting should have those two buttons in the button column other people might want warpto and orbit for cans too ewar doesnt live in a proper column so you cant move it to the front and there is a risk it gets pushed out of view if your not careful colour icons user definable icons  i want to be able to identify classes of ship easily  i want to use icon x for interceptors and icon y for logi a simple pattern match against ship type to set the icon or the default ones for no matches a single interface should cover scandscan with a range slider as a filter the controls should be in a collapseable panel like your filters and results merge with the normal ones in the main table with colouring or some other indicator of where it came from bookmarks tactical overlay should link in and provide more velocity vectors ability to show multiple modules ranges follow my overview tabs settings colouring my main look and feel wish would be to draw it on space without a window  a title bar is pointless so are the spreadsheet lines so is the visible window frame when transparent it should really be transparent  i need to have it full height in case lots of stuff pops up but when lots of stuff isnt there it takes up half my screen looking fugly tabs are really fugly angular velocity to 8 significant figures really ever see the last one change by itself why cant i have a visual speed bar from zero to fast for the velocities i need to be able to set the definition of max and id like it to change colour according to my thresholds  be handy to have a visual cue when something is racing at me at 4000ms and see when something comes into tracking range without breaking my eyes every time columns are always filled in even though data for that column might be pointless  eg type for spaceships is handy the type column for stargates  well err i can see the icon thanks this adds to the spreadsheet feel and clutters up the display option to collapse alliancecorp into one item threshhold values for colourblink highlighting  someone approaching rapidly someoneone within my guns tracking as above at warp distance at gun distance  everything visual  detail for when you need the detail columns should go away completely when there is nothing in them  say tags  why do i even have a tags column visible when there are no tags set cant it just work this out and hide the column completely and now your filter suggestion too  1000 papercuts   more like a billion needs a complete redesign
i like the idea i do but allow me to play the devil here for a biteve does not currently calculate weapon trajectory when you fire your guns at a target the game rolls a hit dice to determine if you hit it or not having each shot physically simulated is just not possible with current generation computing the servers would melt what could work now is if you have to target a friendly and activate this new module on the friendly target each ciws module would afford a certain level of damage mitigation to the friendly ship and you would need to fit a full rack of the ciws to protect more ships it would also mean that the aegis ships couldnt protect themselves since it doesnt generate a bubble of protection
1 we needed this from the beginning of fleets
proposal do not allow new post with the words afk cloaker in the title or opening post
ccp should provide star trek tricorder scanning for life signs in front of the monitor if they are none the cloak would disengage automatically
they have those now sort offnowhere near as compact and multipurpose
oh boy its another nullbear cry threadif you want the rewards of nullsec deal with the risks babyrequiring fuel or cap usage would destroy legitimate active cloaking and extended recon deployments its a terrible idea simply awful ps heres a list of things afk cloakers have never and can never domake a single iskprovide intel for their fleetkill someoneshut down a system or in any other way prevent you from doing whatever you wanttake your battered psyche and go back to hello kitty online if the mere presence of another player scares you so bad
nowhile they are cloaked and afk they cant hurt you why because they are afkshow us on the doll where the bad afk cloaker touched youhtfu or gtfoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
these afk cloaker whiner threads are a staple of eveo every post bashing the notion just gives birth to new fanatic illogical posters on both sides and there are those like me who get in just because i like the sound of my own voice err typing 
ok if someone has something in this game that you dont have that you consider some kind of unfair advantage the answer isnt to try to get it taken from them the answer is to go for that thing yourself praxis astra master of assassins and punctuality
i started playing eve because it was a pvp game apparently now im only a month or so in the game so i havent experienced most of what the game or even highsec has to offer i want to pvp but its my understanding that by going to lowsec and pvping i will be locked out of highsec so now i have to wait until ive experienced everything highsec has to offer before moving on to lowsec and risking lock outhow does this benefit this socalled pvp gameend of the day its likely i will never get a chance to properly experience lowsec or 00 because i will be bored before getting to that point with these proposed changes i could go pvp tonight lose everything gain experience and then come back to highsec and continue exploring and learning the game at my own pace while building up resources for my next pvp session its hard to disagree with these changes in my opinionthe only reason i dont pvp is because i am punished for doing so remove that pleasein short punishing people for pvping in a part of a pvp game that is meant to for people to pvp in is strange counterproductive and really spoiling my day
crap idea i want this little bit of space for my playstyle at the expense of everyone elses when what you really want is a bit of 00 without bubbles and a few more npc stations

why cant we have spawns in the belts that target a specific ship based on size duration in the beltfor instance a hulk in the ice field would spawn a much larger rat than a frigate in the asteroid belts the spawns can become tougher and more frequent the longer the ship remains if the pilot warps off the spawn should not retarget the next ship but also warp awayideas suggestionsi really wish id listened to what my mother told me when i was young why what did she tell you i dont know i didnt listen
while tiericide of industrials makes some sense i dont consider it a priority if we were to tiericide it i would expect a few variations 1 the max hauler paper thin and gets bonuses to hauling capacity with each indy level 2 the armored transporter much lower hauling capacity and gets bonuses to tanking with each indy level 3 the agile transporter medium haul medium tank bonuses to agility per indy level again this is not a priority and no matter what they do the max hauler when setup for maximum hauling should have a pisspoor tank 10k ehp and the armored transporter should have significantly less hauling capacity 30 make it a choice on which to use and dont protect the stupid from themselves
this is an amazing ui improvement tbh  fantastic no other word for meits exactly what i would like it to be maybe a couple different option etc but tbh with what you are showing its already easier practical and the fact you could eventually choose different advanced filtering would be absolutely awesomenow if you could manage to make all these border lines excell like completely disappear from the screen make it like the little anchor for targets and once configured info is scrolled and kept at the screen like now until off grid or depending on bracket options this on top of your awesome idea would make my eve experience absolutely fantastic 
well done 1 from me
i support this
when it comes right down to it the loss of any member of eve generally brings some type of sadness form the community while we all might feel contempt for the goons vile rat was a goon unlike any other he fostered diplomacy in eve okay okay i realize diplomacy in eve is a little silly especially with regards to the goons but beyond that he worked with the united states state department to foster diplomacy between the united states and other nations if that isnt enough he worked on the csm attempting diplomacy between the players and ccp itselfthe man is probably the most diplomatic person in the history of evei think it would be appropriate in that regard to erect a memorial for vile rat his ingame persona and real life persona were oneinthesame in many respects it is not every day that eve loses a man who has such a weight on his shoulders and when he is killed trying to foster friendship and diplomacy over the world it deserves special recognitionleadership is something you learn maybe one day youll learn that
there should be a monument with every eve player who passes in the description have every name of the people
i do agree that a memorial for this person should be made just like that one in jita make it in vfk home of goons and there shall be peace in the galaxy

no reason to and no this would mean you can afk farm belts in highsec and make decent moneyit wouldnt hurt anyone but legit players and no one sits in belt for that long mining anyways unless they have orca support in which case they would simply warp to a new belt by the time rats got heavy
also bots would just have warp away after x minutes then return
wow betoli thats a long list of suggestionsi dont know where to start to create a mockup with all these ideas

seems reasonable to have a dedicated gas miner shabby to have a mining ship with combat bonuses on itseems kind of hack nothing like a company coming in to do a job with a juryrigged improvised piece of machinery if its that important a job someone will have made a dedicated tool for it maybe high sec gas amber mikocerosin for drugs isnt all that important to most but when your in null or worse in a wh looking over your shoulder while pulling out clouds for t3 ship production every second counts a couple extra minutes of dscan checking can mean be the difference between survival and profit or death and revenue lossnoctis didnt ruin the game just made cleaning up easier lowered the prices not by much of buying meta equipment cheaper for us maybe there was a need and people built a ship to meet that need reflections of real lifethere are people who mine gas for a living gas is the one frontier of mining that i feel ccp could do more in i like the idea of creating a t2 version of the noctis model to give gas bonuses to or a whole new ship the criticism i have heard about it is kind of limp the argument is basicallyi dont mine or mine gas so its something the game doesnt need so far seen some maller fits domi fits ferox fits and a scad of other renovated ships that just do an adequate job at bringing in nebulas to market i am not saying to make replicas of all three barges one for durability cargo and yeild just saying nice to have a ship built for the job and believe it or not if your flying a t3 like a tengu or a loki someone risked thier lives and crew to get the gas for your level 4 mission run or gate campUFFFDyou see in this world theres two kinds of people my friend those with loaded guns and those who digUFFFDi digUFFFD  clint eastwood misquote
ive been pod killed so many times that ive lost all grasp on the human condition my current incarnation is just a small and temporary mechanism that serves a greater immortal will life and death are a seamless continuum to me so why is it that even on the fanciest of machines when i die the first thing i usually notice is my evemail flash informing me that a new clone has been activated meanwhile my screen has already begun to load the station shipspinner or if you are one of those damn hippies like me who run captains quarters because they like the whole seamless thing ccp was going for despite the obvious shortcomings of incarna then you find yourself standing upright in your quarters like wtf dude not very seamlessso ccp how about we stay up late one night and come up with something a little cooler than that i know you guys could come up with an awesome way to die i would also wager that you could improve the seamlessness of the lifedeath experience without demanding more from the machinesslowing your battle against lagid love to see my pod split open and a frozen corpse fly out with goo crystalizing and all that but hell ill take a kind of visual effect where you see it explode like most any other ship and then your screen narrows to tunnel vision like youre being pulled away like tony gonzales describes in eve empyrean age something anythinhighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
i know this is going to ignite a storm of controversy but i dont give a flying as eve players we are a tightknit community even with the people we hate in game our community suffered a major tragedy recently at the hands of a bunch of radical extremist holes and this is intolerable sean vile rat smith was a member of our community and helped shape it in a manner in which most of the community will never know or understandhe has left behind his wife and two children having died a patriots death in service to a country that he loved i think that as a community we should once again band together and do something incredibleccp please read this as a member of the eve community and a patriot who serves his country much like vr did i believe that we should try to do something for his family what i propose is this start a plex drive with a percentage of the proceeds from said plex being donated to a fund which ccp will hold the fund should be donated to vrs spouse and children to assist them in this dark time everyone in the world has suffered a great loss at one time or another i sincerely believe that we as a community should try to give back to vrs spouse and children as she was understanding with his trips to iceland so that he could help better our communityleave your negative comments at the door because i dont want to ing read them and no one else does either we should honor the memory of this brave patriot who gave his life in service of his nation and who in game was a patriot for his cause and passionate in the cause of making eve a better place for all of us i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

doesnt get much simpler than this1
an absolute 1if we can take the time to commemorate those that succeed in our ingame tournaments then we should absolutely be far more than capable of putting up a monument to people and their characters such as vilerat any character in eve deserves to be recognized imhowhile i may never have met nor heard of vilerat up to this point his story and history in itself justifies such recognition while i am torn between the goons homebase in vfk null sec bases do change with time and jita this is a moot point in the grand scheme of thingsccp i for one am 100 for a permanent structure to be erected at jita 44 in memory of any and all active eve online players whom pass irl this is a community that truly fosters itself off and on each other unlike any other and we should recognize that while some people may leave us in the real world their memories and stories that they scripted here in eve should never be forgottenfurther ccp your very own trailers advertise that here in eve the universe is yours with that this universe is ours and our stories all carry their own literatureimmortalize the players of this game regardless of their race or persona as their living selves pass beyond their mortal coil and you will create something unmatched in the world past present and futurerip vilerat while some of us may never have known you we will remember yourespect

1there are no stupid questions just stupid people ccp goliath wrote
i agree on the monument but i dont agree on a monument specifically dedicating to only one person there should be a monument dedicated to eve players who have passed on in real life with a list of those who have passed on the reason behind not speficially creating a monument for one person is that you dont want to create a bias you dont want that well why does that guy get a statue but my friend who was killed doesnt get one etc
i personally didnt know vile rat but from what i have been reading about him he does deserve some form of monumenton a second note my deepest condolences go out to vile rats family
i dont think i would ever deserve mention in monument in the game for dieing of natural causesvile rat was a former csm alliance leader and diplomat of the largest and most of all died for his country in a national tragedyif vfk is the consensus of his alliance and close friends i think it be a fitting spot
1 for these reasons i dont normally think it is right to ask for such a thing i would understand if ccp didnt choose to it is kind of a can of worms and as much as we and they care about our eve players building memorials for every loss is not wha
1i thought the diplomacy skill description was good too
i think my idea for a general memorial was not clear enoughi didnt mean a singular monument for every character but rather a single monument that has a perhaps a description with the characters names listed maybe the description could have a link to a dev run thread in which people can post the deaths of their friends and link their characters maybe added with maybe a sentence or two i don but i didnt mean a singular monument to each character i meant one monument for them allhowever lets not lose focusthis thread is about a singular monument in vfkjita for vilerat considering his rl and ineve efforts to see a better world
i definitely believe that some form of nondestructible monument should be placed in a welltravelled system jita rens amarr or dodixie for eve players who have passed on this monument should be speak of some of their accomplishments in gameso long as we carry on the memory of the dead they shall remain immortali am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
nothe intent for this is to create a single memorial commemorating the death of a man who fought not only for his beloved internet spaceships but also attempted to foster friendship through diplomacy in real life sure people die all the time but what makes this man any different and more important than other playershe died in a senseless attack while trying to make the world a better placemaybe im being insensitive but i see no reason to erect a memorial for random people who have done nothing more than play this game and then passed on sean smith is a huge exception because of the way he lived and the way he diedleadership is something you learn maybe one day youll learn that
it isnt just to say one person is more important than another just like sean an average player who died is just as important to to a family  friends or a group just as sean was to histhe statue itsself can be a statue of seans in game character followed with a short yet memorable description of him followed by a saying something like here lies those who have passed on  then ensue a list of namescreating a statue for one person only incites jealousy and envy  then youll get people petitiong ccp to create a statue for everyone individually
1 monument in jitain the description the names of all the people who passed and maybe the datesthe monument never disappears but simply gets updated when relevant

1 for vfk
1 as this is a sandbox we create the lore and now vile rat has become a legend please help us honor him
if a memorial is being considered it has to be a titan wreck model62555 pm vilerat i was elected to murder titans62604 pm vilerat death to all titans
1 for vfk also the inscription should say shoot blues  tell vile rat
i like the idea of a general monument in trade hubs for those of us that have passed on but i do feel that sean should get his own one as he was stolen away from his family and friends in a act of pure undeserved violence he did alot for this game and as such i feel he does deserve his own monument in vfk somewhere his friends can keep his memory alive and he will live on through themalso ccp how about starting a plex for seans family collection i for one would like to know his family received something back from the community he dedicated so much of his free time too

then that should show that you should go out and do something with your life sean lived a life full of selfsacrifice he was an air force veteran he was a veteran in the state department in both capacities that lasted over ten years of his life he worked to improve life for people all over the globehe is more important than the thirtyyearold living in mommys basement he is more important than the person who is living his life thinking of only of himselfif you want to set up a memorial to all he people who play this game and have passed away then fine but this is not for them this is a petition to set up a memorial specifically for someone who served a life as a public servant who put the needs of others before himself this is for someone who wanted to make the world a better place and in so doing was killed by extremists who want to do the exact oppositeyoure damn right hes more important than 99 of the people who play this game he did something with his life he came home and did all of that ingame but yet youll pull this bs of itll cause envy amongst the players good get off your lazy ass and do something meaningfulstop it now with all these we need to have a memorial to commemorate all the people who have died who play this game you are not noteworthy this man was and should have our respectleadership is something you learn maybe one day youll learn that
i will continue to support a memorial to sean vile rat smith a null system named vrrip would be perfect i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you have the right idea but i think youre taking ideas the wrong way the purpose behind creating a statue for those who have passed on is to simply remember if this statue were to be created and names were listed it would show that to someone out there heshe was significant your basing a persons importance off what they did in life thats not how life works for example you are not more important than me because you got an a on your test while i got a b we carry the same significance to someone out there as we are both humans there are statues of people in real life  for instance martin luther king sattues abraham lincoln statues although the statue is of a single individual the description and text on the statue speaks for all if you want to get technical about why the statue shouldnt soley be for one person well thats becasue youd have people constantly petitioniong ccp to have a statue erected in game in the name of someone they cared about one statue of sean in game can be a memorial for all i dont need to personally list what ive done in life and how i have served my community  im not vain like that edit other people agree or are sharing the same view as i am this copy and paste will show if we do it for this departed soul it sets a precedent to be done for others i dont think it is appropriate or necessarythere are many players in eve who help shape what it is today not just a select few that sums up basically what i said or is a better version of waht im trying to get across
1a memorial for vile rat is both appropriate and necessary
1wherever it ends up as long as we have onei think the memorial to other people is a good idea should have its own thread and separate petition though as this one is for vile
im doing it all the time and still i think its UFFFDUFFFD retarted that no one has a chance to get me while doing it
then you have a terrible understanding of game balance afk cloakers are incapable of any kind of action whatsoever for other players to be able to affect them while they themselves are incapable of doing anything is utterly stupid its the most basic level game balance imaginablenot to mention the fact that all these stupid stupid ideas about capfuel needs probes to find cloakies etc would cause even bigger imbalances when it comes to holdingcapturing territories in null it is essential for a dynamic healthy environment that cloaking exist and allow you such protections at the sacrifice of absolutely all your own offensive capabilitiesand last but not least it would utterly destroy wormhole spaceadditionally you didnt address the points weve raised about how your terrible ideas would ruin legitimate active cloaking rolesso to summarise stop crying man up or go back to hisec you terrible nullbeari respect hisec bears more than you at least they admit they are risk averse and choose a gameplay style that suits that rather than crying to change all styles of gameplay to suit their carebear ways while masquerading as pvpers
i dont realy care do you respect me or not and even if you dont no one cares dand to address something i tossed the idea of fuelbays in its not an terrible idea and i dont need to think about the balance nor do you ccp needs to if they are willing to implement something like that into the game and lets face it ccp is also saying afk playing is badso i see afk cloaking as a bad thing and thats my point of view and i presented one option to address it if you see it as a good thing cause you want to jack off while playing well thats fine but stop yelling stupid stupid stupid if you dont have anything else to say
what happens if two or three csm members go inactive at one timei dont see this as being very useful while being a good idea to present it can be easily avoided by an educated player base electing persons with a solid track record not just voting for the first nominee who spams their inbox with propagandatoo bad we do not live in a perfect worldedit inafternecrorealization
the thing that struck be about eve when i first began to play is that the distances between celestial is actually correct  everything measures in aus all that stuff is really great for immersionif there were one thing that i would really like to see changed one easy little thing is to have asteroids rotate in rl all asteroids rotate  some fast some slow all natural or derelict objects rotate in spaceperhaps the same scripts that make ship debris rotate at things like magnetotronic sites can be applied asteroidsi would also propose that the destroyed player ship debris clouds are sized to correspond with the ship size and expand over time finally and here is the big oneyou may or may not noticed that planets do not rotate stations do not orbit moons moons do not orbit planets and planets do not orbit suns i get the same view in my home station a day from now a year from now and 2 years from nowi have heard some argue that it would be a coding nightmarewell perhaps perhaps the celestials can change position during downtime but for gates and stations there are these areas in solar systems called lagrange points where the gravitational pull is neutralcertainly this rl mechanic could be used in some way in the gamei feel that if the game is to evolve eventually celestial orbits will need to be addressednow there is one other issue and i would appreciate the input but are the backdrops realistic perhaps there are areas of space where its just lit up like crazy weve seen such pictures from the hubble telescope  perhaps this is more of an intellectual discussion rather than a proposal for ccp to change the backdrops in any way
look at how the front has these sunken parts with lights under them like the hurricane brilliant
1 as an avid corpse collector and ocd affected person i like to know not just guess who is resting in my morgue
still needs supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
we need someone who is a major force in eve to support this cause i messaged the mittani in hopes of drawing more supportersi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i believe there will be a donation drive setup with funds going directly to vrs family details will more than likely get posted once everything is setup and ready to go
i hope soi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i will donate the loss of such a player is a great sadness it takes a special type of person to put themselves in harms way for the shallow hope that prejudice and hatred of any type can be overcome with an open hand and a good heart i dont believe either side is free of blame in this i simply say that those lost had good intent in their hearts for when the opportunity was available for it i have always taken pride in my membership in eve and whether it was playing in lowsec or trying my hand at nation building i have never wished harm on another player podding pvp and the occasional destruction of an alliance notwithstanding outside of the game i count my self lucky to have eve friends on every continent and in many countries and hope that one day we can work as a planet to get out into spacesalut vile rat you will be missed and remembered eve also should have a tshirt for him
i will donaterest in peace vile rat
not so much a hope as the time for the technical people to set it up and his family to mourn as they would have input i would expect to see something in probably 2 weeks until then be patient it will happen but it takes time
player created monuments should be permitted sovereignty should be required
nope antisign no special treatment for specific individuals thanks
i see were you are coming formi do not agree that planets and moons should rotate as it would not have any signifigant effect on the gamehowever i do think that planets and moons should orbit the sun and so forththis would make is so people would have to change bookmarks oftenand if they are adding the ability to place poses anywhere in space it would be interesting if you could put it in orbit around the sun as a planet doesi dunno but i do believe that adteriods do actually orbit and move in mining beltsi think that to have moons and planets rotate is a bit meh but having them acually orbit would be cool
the static state of eve is an old mechanic from a 2003 game things should move large object lightly at down time belts except for 10 and maybe 09 space should be discovered that spot you saved for mining should expire logistics for pi shouldnt be static nor should trade routes extra long jumps shouldnt always be there nor should extra short ones
hmm extra long jumps vs extra short ones you mean from solar system to system or within system or are you talking about some kind of stellar drift that changes how a gate may work
while i would like the realism of moving planets i dont see the need and even moreso i really fear the implementation the thing i fear most is my bm collection getting very messed up i spent many many many hours creating bookmarks in regions of space i regularly visit and i know a lot of other people that have too i use bookmarks to safely move between gates to rat in asteroid belts to hide by poss for jump bridges to dock to undock to safely collect pi for safespots for obnoxious safespots for  i could go on but i have thousands of bms mostly in null that i have spent a lot of time making and they are something i use regularly id be very unhappy if suddenly these all became worthless because someone thought it would be cool to rotate the planetary positions within the solar system
most amusing implementing such a mechanic may result in the loss of less bookmarks than you might think esp if every bookmark is anchored relative to any given celestial or stationthe bookmarks in empty space between gates could stay where they are many gates could stay where they are if they are on stationary lagrange points those gates that are in orbit around planets would have to be consistent with the mechanic though the gates that do change position would have to be reoriented to face the proper directionperhaps when you drop a bookmark one could choose between anchoring it to a celestial or dropping it free floatingyou may or may not be aware that station positioning is going to be changed up by ccp sometime in the next year  no anchoring is what i heard you may loose your bookmarks anywayif you follow the principles of gravity then all objects in a solar system are affected by other objects in some way  they all orbit or are affected by orbitsanyway  asteroids should rotate lol

interesting idea not sure if i would like for it to be a freighter class ship though
for it to be capable of transporting the amount of cargo that 34 battleships would take up it needs to bei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
eve is another universedimension n which space has the same properties as watertherefore eventually things stop spinning
if its anchored relative to a celestial its a null change and there is little point bms that are created near a noncelestial orbiting object would expire almost immediately because something orbiting a celestial is moving as many kms relative to the celestial that change would effectively mean you couldnt use bookmarks at gates or stations or a pos if the orbits followed keplers laws so you would have to have bookmarks relative to any object  which in turn makes it a null change to gameplay the aesthetic value would be quite nice its odd that undocking from a station always presents the celestials in the same place undocking from balginia i have always had the sun directly in my eyes day after day year after year it would also mean that intergate distances changed with time  which would be coolthe change applied to asteroid belts no bm relative to a belt would be good and making all belts have to be scanned would improve gameplay hurt bots and add a much needed dimension to mining
ok if i am following you correctly i think you mean that since all bookmarks are anchored relative to a station moon pos etc then it really makes no difference to gameplay after implementation yes i think those bookmarks can be saved its the ones that are out in the middle of nowhere that cannot logically last since they are relative to well nothing so safes far away from anything they might get all jacked up for this it sure would hurt bots however i can already hear the miners screaming bloody murder  plus all their cargo cans might get lost unless they are anchored to the field
im pretty new at this game and in the community so the topic im raising my be some old news im curious whether any thought has been given to a custom color editor for ships or if we will see something other than the four major empire logos on them even something as simple as a corp logo would be a welcome change
not to be rude but please do a forum search before posting a topicideaconcern here or in fi and no being new is not an excuse to not run a searchyes corp logos and possible ship coloration is being worked on no we dont have a timetable no we dont know what it will look like no we dont know what limitations it will have
seleene has confirmed that the assembly hall is effectively useless now i will rewrite this in fi later
supportedbeing podded is obviously a terrible experience especially for new players in corp generally new players get a bit quiet say they were podded say theyre going afk and then not log on again for a day or so wouldnt it be cool to see the new guys saying in corp holy  i just got podded that was awesomefood for thought it might negate some of the sinking feeling you get in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

i knew nothing of vile rat i know of him in name only while i have an absolute loathing of goonswarm as does most of the eve community vile rat served his country and paid the debt that all men pay regardless of his characters actions in game this plex drive is in the service of the moral high ground vile rat left behind a family not an internet family but a real living breathing family who have lost him in the spirit of what jack carrigan is trying to accomplish here i urge everyone to donate upon ccps approval this does not happen often within our community and i pray that it does not start to happen often no matter what happens in the game or how vile rat may have wronged you inside it its still just pixels on a screen what happened to him was real it doesnt get more real than this
so there is a lack of lowsec specific activities and i came up with one that may worki propose that in 0103 systems there be a new pos module the corpse rendering unit this unit will enable users with the nessicary skills to process corpses of capsleers with a  chance to recover implants contained within this should not be an easy activity it should be very difficult to recover said implants and hardwirings there should be 2 skills one for implants one for hardwirings and each should be a 5x skill under the industry category with a prereq of industry 5 and anchoring 5 to help ensure these are less likely to be throwaway alt charachter each level should grant a 5 chance of recovery ie 5 at 1 25 at 5 this is per implant if someone had 5 implants you would have a 25 chance of recovering each implant this would make it probable enough to recover implants so as to be profitable not so probable as to place too much negative pressure on the implanthardwiring marketthe thing is is that this is a repugnant activity in all empires and carries with it a significant loss of sec status it also must be done in a pos as no station owner would allow it within their station it would be limited to lowsec the home of pirates and scofflaws in eve it would bring profit seekers to low sec and keep them there as their sec status drops of course it would require a new pos mod and 2 new skills of course this activity is not condoned by any lawabiding institution so these would be dropped in lowsec pirate anomolies bringing more activity to low sec this also will open up a nichemarket for corpses of course with no way of knowing what implants were in what corpse this would be a risky market indeed prone to scams and other buyer beware activities all of which increase conflict in eve
oh noes hold on they scream anyway
enough is enough the gallente culture is like a virus a vile infection that must be weeded out destruction and assimilation of the weak by the strong the selfrighteous hypocrisy of the federation is over a new dawn arises caldari supremacy and purity an idea reborn
this is the game mechanic trolling forum you want the incharacter trolling forum
locking this thread for being a duplicate
seriously i should probably pay attention more its taken me 3 days to find this since the first post i noticed related to it i havent been actively searching of course but youd think id have noticed zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
just responding to say shahfluffers doesnt mean to sound rude but alot of people ahve a tendency to beat the dead horse in proposals that have already been brought up multiple timeseve has been around for almost 10 years you can bet everything that could ever possibly be sugested has been the issue is time and technology for instance with custom colors lets say you have 50 harbingers on field rigth nw the server only has to keep track and send data about 50 dots labeled harbinger your computer can generate the image itself now if these harbies have custom colours well now the server not only has to keep track of location and combat information but it has to store and distribute that information to clients in the battlefieldnow this may nt seem like a big issue i mean hey its only a little extra data but take into account 50000 players in multiple systems as well as ships sitting idle in poss that would have customs and the server starts to ahve to carry alot more data than it used to and with a game that has to tick in 1second intervals to function properly and then can still have issues with alrger fights this can quickly become a game breaking deal and that is why many features in eve are spread apart by months or eyars of development adn then still have bugs for a long time ccp works on them bt there is a lot of issues wit coding and serverload that can creep up with things like thisso in conclusion use the forum search engine and show your support in those threads not many ideas are new or innovative enough to warrant a new thread all ideas will be considered and given dev attention at some point just some not as soon as otherslike us wh players have ben waiting for corppos revamp since whs came out
hell give me the option to only show broadcasted ships on the overview unless i want a more advanced view
smilingvagrant this could be one of the smart filters yesas for me i would like to see a difference between empty wrecks and full wrecks to be able to select these words as filters for the smart filters menu to do this i guess ccp devs will have to add on the type column of the overview a new description for wrecks to differentiate them
1 thumbs up do it now
interesting ideas butthis is not really how aegis works as i type this i am sitting in combat systems maintenance central on board an east cost based arleigh burke class destroyer currently deployed to the middle eastaegis allows aegis equipped ships to share information with other ship not necessarily aegis ships and to fire defensively and offensively from that data the problem is there is no real reason to do this with a few exceptions and most of the time we are not close enough to other ships for this to be practical  some of this may not make sense because i will have to leave out some classified stuff that limits aegis if aegis detects a vampire inbound missile it will find a firing solution and depending on the ships weapons posture will automatically fire an evolved sea sparrow missile essm to intercept it or the essm will be command launched by a watch stander if the essm misses or for some reason does not kill the vampire then super rapid blooming offboard chaff srboc will fire and the close in weapons system ciws will get it for offensive we have the sm2 standard missile for surface targets and the block c and d tomahawk missiles for longer range strike packages now for the classified omission for reason i cannot discuss we cannot in practice shoot off of another ships data unless we are out of missiles not likely to happen if a technical problem prevents us from shooting off of our own data that same problem will prevent us from using another ships data and thats all i can say about thatso in summery the biggest advantage of aegis is allowing aegis ships to share data primarily from the anspy1 3 dimensional air search radar with other ships allowing the battle group to use that combined data see the strategic picture covering thousands of square miles and to use that data to plan air strikes from carriers tomahawk missile strikes from vls equipped ships assist in deployment of marines and overall fleet defense because knowledge is poweroh we also have vertically launched vls antisubmarine rockets asroc for offensive and defensive antisubmarine warfare think torpedo deployed by a rocketarleigh burke class destroyer
and that is unfortunate i think i got podded 3 time my first day in eve ok so im a slow learner i like this idea as long as it does not slow me down too much getting back in a ship though you are correct getting podded is not supposed to be a positive experience and should cause some amount of a sinking feeling other than isk lossto the new guy though a discussion about what to expect when he gets podded and how it happens to me more then most  i mean how it happens to everyone and that when they do get podded that the best response it to get back in a ship but learn from the experiencewhat did you do rightwhat did you do wrongwhat can you changeimprove upon to get podded less often
yes i agree that it should be a traumatic experience and if anything i hope they make it even more gruesome and jarring id even love to see your clone step out of its little reanimation pod bald headed and redo your haircut and clothes joins the list of things you routinely do after youre reborn including update your clone and buy new implantshighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
while im ok with a 20s animation showing my clone activating im not ok with being forced to redo hair and clothing options which takes considerably longer edit i typically want to reship and get back into the fight after i die and dont want any significant slowdowns tbh
well yeah let me clarify your portrait should stay the same but in the quarters it might be fun to still be podbald maybe just until you walk over to the mirror and click the set appearance to portrait settings button or whatever but yeah agreed the whole thing shouldnt take very longhighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
id support a full movie the first time any character on an account was podded or docked in a ship with cq turned on in order to establish the immersion after that make it a short cutscene thats there to hide the loading screen so theres no slowdownedit and add an option to the esc menu to disable or reenable the movie in case an existing player starts a new account and they dont want to see the full cutscene again
only 1 if its a general monument where ccp can put the names of eve ppl who died like in jita or wherever
i feel that he was a real hero and the man should have a whole system or even a region named after him that is how we remember heroes
nullsec should not be risk free one of the risks we deal with in nullsec is afk cloakers heres an idea fit up an interceptor and learn to catch them on the way in if they are using nullified t3s learn to use hictors with infinipoints
tbh nothing is wrong with afk cloakers as stated in this thread they cant hurt you when they afk trollso the thing that has to be done by you is to as followed1 continue ratting 2 minimize local chat3 do not and keep an eye out on dscan 4 sent rage mail to the guy when he kills youtroll
theres way more than 30 threads about this topic unless you accidentally forgot the k after the number
1 i dont think their is datapath that correlates the 100s of corpses in my general freight container to the implants they had when i made the pod pilot a corpse 2 25 chance of recovery per implant is quite a high percentage and would definitely modify the implant market this is actually the lp market thats getting hurt most of the corpses i make have at least 2 implants in them and many many have much more 3 this has been proposed before and you should of course do a forum search on the topic and at least link the relevant threads look at the pros and cons in them
another implant recovery proposal no i think this is like the fifth one this year 
i dont think this csm has gotten anything constructive done we should execute them
wheres ccp robespierre when you need him
the grid system wouldnt fare well with moving celestials
why in 2012 we can predict the orbital paths of most objects within meters are you suggesting that our computer couldnt automatically compensate for normal celestial motion in the 17th millenium
each grid or bubble near celestials asteroid fields and bases would have to move every day to be sure it would be a pretty interesting puzzle of trigonometry a system would go in effect for each celestial object and bookmarks would have to be set on coordinates based on thisfor example amarr v moon 4 has a bookmark at 212 km from its origin at 12329 by 1846 degrees so if moon 4 moves the bookmark is still on vector 12329 by 1846 degrees at 212 kmsame would apply to undocks on stations etc i would suspect that a safe in the middle of nowhere would have to use the sun as a reference unless perhaps specified differently by the playermaybe interplanetary navigation or anchoring should be a skill associated with bookmarking at some level earth bookmarked without being anchored would be correct only once a year
i understand your adversity to going to lowsec there are many other ways to experience pvp without going to lowsec and now you even have faction warfare which doesnt affect your security status one could even argue that the faction warfare changes have addressed the difficulties that this proposal addresses although not all of themtheres wardecs and merc groups in highsec red vs blue moar tears etcyou can also fight people who are criminals minus 5 or more sec status in lowsec or anywhere without taking the sec status hiti just really think the falloff from high to low is too steep a cliff there should be some areas where concords protection is iffy or npc empire factions navies or rapid response teams provide limited protection
1 for me also cj

1great ideasurely ccp could create a simple cutscene to hide the loading screen as mentioned above before the next expansion right
i will donate as soon as payday rolls aroundi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
technically all bms are relative to the local gravitational fieldhow ccp would implement such a mechanic i have no idea the hamsters would not be pleased
you know what else is missing from eve rogue planets and systems that are void of an active sun
ummmm we already have lore regarding rogue drones the gallente created them by accident in their efforts to create an automated drone defense fleet and they broke all efforts the contain them laws were then passed to prevent it from happening againthis also explains why automation on ships is limiteddigressioncarry on
there is no such thing as a local gravitational field
the idea of rogue planets is an interesting one even moreso though that for every star you can see in the sky there are about 4 red dwarf stars that you cannot see these red dwarf stars are also the oldest of all the stars drake himself you know drake equation beleives that there is at least if not more as much chances of life existing in these red dwarf systems as any otherok one other thing that gets me and just slightly bothers mein rl from the orbit of neptune and pluto our sun looks like a really bright yellow star in eve when you fly to the outer edges of a system the sun is always the same size and brightness unless you fly right up to it when its big what gives
i still support this
although you can now have an armor gang with skirmish links thanks to off grid boosting that doesnt necessarilly mean you must be able to have this if it is decided you must be able to use every sort of booster with every type of gang then they can address this issue make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
1your idea is fine but i think it has the potential to interrupt players to much when in fleet and you have to reship and join reinforcements in addition to that you dont ever had cutscenes in eve maybe except the one you get the first time you start
you dont think dying should have consequences beyond new clone activate next ship undock even for a 30 second delayreallywow
no no you misunderstand maybe a cinematic thing the first time for the sake of the noobs but the other times i just want to see my own pod there in the field explodecrack start to explodeflash something not asking for much a transition effect i hereby coin the term deathwipe a kind of slow insidious tunneling of the vision then the bright white light of the medical drone checking you out and boom youre back in the hangar ready to deploy and let me reiterate that this whole process shouldnt be long at all 20 seconds would be too long i think more like 10 seems like a relatively small fix for a big step forward in seamlessness the way it is now is just lame you gotta give me that lol highsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom

wrong fuel or cap usage for covert ops ships is an utterly atrocious idea this is a simple fact
why post a proposal here when it regularly gets destroyed in discussion 25 times a month
i think he should show us on the doll where the afk player touched himoh wait he cant because the player was afk
one day im going to go back and catalog how many times this topic has been brought up and summarily shot down like a wounded buffalo that will also be the day i finally lose the last shred of sanity i have
i dount the hamsters would mind i presume currently a bookmark is an absolute coordinate 3 numbers and a reference system with localised bookmarks you would still have 3 numbers and a reference celestial object its only when you need to use the book mark that the fact its a relative coordinate becomes relevent and you have to add the relative coordinates of the nested orbital systemso for a book mark off station you might haveabsolutelocation  locationplanet  locationmoon  locationstation  locationbookmarkthe problem arises because a book mark relative to a station moves between you hitting warpto and actually getting there probably by around 1000 km or so you actually need to warp to the point that the station will bethe good thing about this new system is that it would prevent station games as soon as you undock the station would whiz off into the distance far faster than your frigate can fly tldr either it has no game play effect or all of eves physics needs fixing
so the guests on the dj bigcountry show on everadio say that asteroids do rotateuhummm all of them
no sir in rl this doesnt happen because of physics in eve the way to get around that is to incrementally change the location of objects during downtime
just replied in what happens in lowsec proposal but thought it might be good enough for its own proposal too so here  kick this aroundits lowsec right why not just implement a way to buy up your sec status interstellar credits greasing the filthiest of palms in some seedy spacestation bar should be enough to get your sec status right with the law its a simple mechanic they could implement and even tie in with some walking in stations to get that bullt looking like its half worth it to have in the game and not just a forgotten remnant of the failure of incarna come on already ccp make lowsec the coolest place ingame and it will change the whole landscape spacescape of play
this would be a highsec gankers wet dream if you do the crime you should not feel bad about the punishment you cause yourselfnot supported
i never said itd be cheap but you cant disregard the potential to invigorate the game in many ways through this
ffs fi is the place to debate half baked ideas this is for well thought through widely supported ideas
pardon my noobishness to the trollhall and all yall but this is hardly half baked the concept of using currency to pay for legal indiscretions is as old as money itself how do you think society was built on good intentions and sweet candy kisses am i doing it right yetpoint of this is to use isk to pay for your sec status as opposed to time via grinding up your sec through missionsrattingetc i believe giving greater access to high sec and less issue with regard to security status to casual pvpers coming from high sec to low sec through easing the burden of sec status improvement can only be a good thing for all in gamewherein do you see half baked the wis aspect was a fluffy little add on granted but the essential point of isk for sec status increase is a valid idea that is here now to gain the wide support is deserves so get to it and 1 this thang yo
concord only respond on gates and stations in 05sec status loss proportional to the sec status of the system you committed the act in
its lowsec right why not just implement a way to buy up your sec status interstellar credits greasing the filthiest of palms in some seedy spacestation bar should be enough to get your sec status right with the law its a simple mechanic they could implement and even tie in with some walking in stations to get that bullt looking like its half worth it to have in the game and not just a forgotten remnant of the failure of incarna come on already ccp make lowsec the coolest place ingame and it will change the whole landscape spacescape of play
as the title says it would be interesting i think to have wormholes with statics based on specific geographic regions i also suggest this sort of thing to be done in order to buff nullnerf high sec and cause more people to go out where the risk is greater
how would doing anything to wormholes ever buff null last time null tried to wormhole they got smacked back to null with a couple less capitals and t3salso the complete randomness any hole can go to anywhere si waht makes wormholes dynamic if we started separatingt hem into geographic regions then it would bcome to easy for allaicnes to spread out and lock down an entire wh chain with caps and towers and be able to ferry supplies because they know there are only x possibilities that their new hole can go to and almost all will be friendlyno i like being able to pop a new hole everyday pay a visit to our temporary neighbors andjump their siteships then have the wh closed ebhind us then rinserepeatkillrepeatetcunless you actually meant separating where wormholes appear based on kspace sec staus if so then thats a huge no because most wormhole alliances rely on that 1500 hs wormhole in their c5c6static in order to ferry supplies in making majority wormholes only open in null for your buff would indeed buff null by making wormholes and nearly all t3 production part of null sicne no one else would be able to get supplies in order to live in them anymore
i mean providing a static c1 to maybe c3 per regionconstelation that can link to other non region wormholes like the ones we have now would make a nice link between the two this way you can have 00 corps settle into wormhole space but it would only be a c1c3so at the end of the day they still have to come to guys like you if they want real profit but there is a window for them right now if you want to be in a wh you are either in a wh or you are not its not very easy to bounce between one or the other a c1c3 regional static wh wouldnt make it much easier it wouldnt make wh just another part of 00 but it would provide more encounters between whs and 00 entities buffing 00 morei think this should also be done in conjunction with doing something to make high sec less profitable you have entities that make billions easily all in the safe confine of high sec where as in 00 you are always at risk mining ships got buffed and if you are marginally intelligent you wont ever die in hs
once upon a time eve was a fine place for pvp then they introduced jump bridges warp to 0km sanctums and interdiction nullifiers if you living in 00 you already know how easy to grind isk unharmed with absolutely zero riskfor the rest of the peoplestep 1 get into a large alliancestep 2 get a drakestep 3 go to a system where you have a lot of sanctums and an online posstep 4 put the local chat in a big window in the middle of your screenstep 5 if local is clear start to rat in a nice fluffy sanctumstep 6 if you see anything other than blue in the local window press warp to pos then goto step 5even if you are a totally stupid idiot you can still avoid being caught the only way to counter this level of carebearness is semiafk cloaking logon traps fast jumps in directional scans are way too slow methods to catch anyone else than true retards and you want the only working solution left out of this game dear azrael dinn you are an 
who gave you permission to postoh sweet jesus you could be the twin brother of sloth from the gooniessummary of eves last four expansions
i think being in hisec counts as failure and should be punished perhaps a tax based on time spent in civilised space the funding for concords beastly ships has to come from somewhere after all
if i were a member of a large alliance who never takes anything seriously and always tries to break the game id aid their efforts into abusing this system for our own gain or just for the laughsthankfully such an alliance doesnt exist and would never do such a thing oh wait summary of eves last four expansions
having celestial bodies orbit the sun would be a nice touch but lets be realistic the game coding for such a minor change would be incredibly difficult and the game would gain little if anything from such a massive effort excessive bookmarks have been known to be a problem in the past implementing such a thing would only exacerbate thatsummary of eves last four expansions
i disagree about excessive bookmarks  especially if it takes some skill to mark them however the thousands or maybe tens of thousands of existing bookmarks would bea challenge
probably 10s of millions fortunately computers are good at this sort of thing and should be able to crank it in about 30 minutes
its half baked because it has consequences other than those youve mentioned
dedicated lowsec dwellers dont care about their sec status and i wouldnt expect theyd pay good money to up their sec anyway this would be to encourage more people to venture into low and try their hand at pvp how could this be a bad thinganyone anywhere should be fearful of flying through space be it high low or null and this mechanic would bring an edgier feel to this game and make it all the more satisfying to play how could this be a bad thingthere are always consequences to this game some most by ccp are unintentional however they exist and they unbalance things and they are weird and wonderful for a time this could be another one of them it would bring action and excitement to a game that has been diluted as of late by factional warfare overpriced ships and other rampant market inflation just to name a few things i thank you for batting for the other team but why dont you give up and sign on to this its just plain awesomesauce
does the sec status hit bother suicide gankers at all

ive played this game for quite a few years now and have seen lots of trends in ships and fittings ships have come in and out of fashion but there is one class of ship that has steadily gotten worse and is now close to obsolete in the future this situation will only get worse hacUFFFDsso a few years ago ships like the deimos vagabond zealot and ishtar terrified me and a lot of other people too they had strong damage high base resists and lots of slots to take advantage of utility modules even unbonused ones these days they are still ok but do not justify their cost and this is a factor  t2 prices are not as inflated as they were years ago combine this with them being a t2 ship that has no role and no reason to be flown over slightly larger combat ships and things get a little bleak for hacUFFFDsfactionpirate cruisers are much better and similarly priced with amazing bonuses that give them definite roles battlecruisers can do their job better than them in every way tier 3 bcs make all sniper variants of hacs obsolete so why when hacs havenUFFFDt changed do they suddenly find themselves adrift in a sea of mediocrity well lets highlight some key changes in eve that have affected them module stacking nerf  a good change but it ended the 7 heat sink zealots reign of 1shotting terror warp core stab nerf  expensive relatively small ships suddenly lose their getoutofjailfree option when things got too hot vagabonds with 2 stabs where not only common but regarded as legitimate and necessary tier 2 bcUFFFDs UFFFD these new combat orientated bcUFFFDs where a huge nail in the hac coffin costing a fraction of the price with more offensive and defensive optionsUFFFD speed was the only thing hacUFFFDs had going for them at this point nos nerf  those utility high slots suddenly became less useful neuts hurt their own limited capacitor a lot and medium nos dont suck frigates dry the way they used too its a lot of extra fitting that just isnt worth it ecm nerf  people will remember the nosecm ishtar it was devastating but still the ecm saved these ships from taking damage sometimes and also gave them another getout factor capacitorehp global buffs  these hurt hacs more than helped them using high dps and quickly overwhelming ships became less of an option and while they might still win some of these engagements it leaves more time for backup to arrive and quickly tackle and destroy these relatively lowhp t2 ships nano nerf  i agree moving at 10kms in a battleship was stupid but most hacs found a new lease of life when they could break the 4k mark they could avoid damage then swoop in like wolfs and tear targets apart at an opportune moment then flee again to fight another day web nerf  drop a frig to 100ms then cut it in half with 500 dps doesnt really work anymore so they arent as strong in the antifrig role so what to do the mwd bonus the afs got was nice but ultimately only useful when sig kiting on small ships like frigates in large fleets hacUFFFDs are too expensive and donUFFFDt add anything another ship doesnUFFFDt do better or cheaper hit and run is something hacs always did well behind enemy lines in small gangs or solo so how can we achieve thiswell iUFFFDm open to suggestions but i think something radical is called for  here are a few ideasnb the purpose of these changes to keep their offensive and defensive abilities the same but to also give them the ability to escape small engagements they will still die to medium gangs or gangs with heavy tackle or ew very quickly this is more aimed at getting hacs into belts with unsuspecting targets or catching stragglersscouts for larger fleets and allowing them to get out afterwards once help starts to filter through immunity to warp scramblers mwd cancelling effect  sounds crazy yea it is but it also means that they can escape almost any solo engagement im not sure this is the best solution but iUFFFDm putting it on the table to inspire some creative thinking i personally dont like immunities as a solution however bonus to warp strength  we have seen this on transport ships this would be for example 2  allowing them to escape a scrambler point blank if a frigate burns to them or to escape 2 long points if they are being kited by interceptors who sit at 20km and move far too fast to slingshot or otherwise escape no penalties for fitting wcs  this is similar to the above but allows these ships to fit as many bonuses to warp strength as they please at the expensive of loslot tank speed or gank immunity to nosneuts  again i dont like immunities and i think this wouldnt achieve the hit and run goal simply make them unkillable through cap warfare old fashioned nos  so they basically get nos to work the way they used to sucking cap regardless of your own cap level of all the above ideas i prefer the warpstrength related ones as these are easily overcome by larger gangs or stationary bubbles but still give them and edge in 1v1s feel free to comment
if you seriously think hacs are obsolete youre doing something terribly wrong
bhac gangs are popular right now but thats an extrememly limited use of this ship class and not to mention the vast majority of hacs arent included in those gangsahac gangs wont be as popular when tiericide reaches the cruisers since tech 1 cruisers will be 100 times cheaper and have similar effectiveness
yes give goons and rvb control of eve great idea

not a blanket removal like whats so often requested but yes i have found a way to counter afk cloaks without screwing active cloakers the currently useless system scanner array pos module could very easily be tweaked to provide an active and limited means to counter afk cloaking in a system couple it with an ihub upgrade requirement and youve made it something of an advantage to holding sov over simply slumming in npc space and harassing your neighborsdetails on the module change would be similar to the followingwhen activated this module sends out a system wide burst of harmonic radiance or whatever you want to call it that disrupts all cloaking in system for 5 minutes this effect is so energy intensive that it can only be used ever pick balancing number hours and disrupts any other module of this kind in the system for the same durationmy personal thought is that if you cant scan down an afk ship in 5 minutes you deserve to have afk cloaks in your systems im also of the opinion that any half competent pilot can avoid scan probes for a few minutes to stay alive thru the disruption effect if youre too stupid to get yourself a collection of safes so you dont have to bounce off celestials at grid ranges you deserve to die because you fail as a covops pilot now whether you consider afk cloaking to be a problem or not is irrelevant  the simple fact is covops cloaks are too good and have no balancing factors of any kind beyond the limited number of ships they can be fitted to
the reason ahac fleets work is because of their excellent resist profile meaning they can tank a ridiculous amount of incoming damage with logistics combined with their reasonably high dps and low sigthe rebalanced t1 cruisers while being a lot better than the old t1 cruisers will still have terrible resists not enough lows and nothing like the projection range of the hacs therefor no if anything ahacs will increase in popularity after winter because of the heavy pulse laser fitting buff and the probable diminution of the drake fleetto the op yes hacs could do with a buff it is not that they lack a role it is that the t3 cruisers fill that role a lot better than the hacs do if the hacs were buffed into line with there respective t3s it would solve a lot of the issues with both classes of shipexcept the vaga its fine
beam buffs only really effects the zealot  were still left with ships like the cerberus and deimos which are literally pointless compared to t3s and battle cruisersand i actually think the vaga isnt fine i have flown the vaga for years across my accounts and have to say its underwhelming these days i would rather pay extra and fly as sleipnir since the vagas speed bonus leaves you with a hard choice have better damage and projetion and only move 2400 or get more speed and lose damage and projection at which point the vaga does about  200 dps at any sort of real rangethe sleipnir on the other hand has the projection slightly faster than most bcsbss and enough ganktank to make anything faster than you wish it didnt catch you in the first place
perhaps you should learn to fit youre vagabonds better then you should be getting 350ish out to about 35 kwith damage out to 50 at 2700 with 450 out to 20 ish with excellent trackingthe sleipnir is a field command ship and as such should have more damagetank than the hac making it better in a small gang this is balanced by it having a sig the size of the moon meaning it can tank much less incoming damage and therefor be next to useless in a large fleetthe cerb i will give you is  it realy needs attention but the demios is well liked by lowsec pilots as a gank boat it does 800 dps while still having a 50k ehp tank pre boostsslaves and a tiny sig
im not saying hacs are completely useless they just dont offer must to the lineup right now t2 frigs all have a role t2 battlecruisers have a role t3s have multiple roles t2 bss they work as intendednow when you look at the t2 cruiser lineup you have logistics mega buffed and very useful recons who for better or worse have a definite role and then hacs which kinda feel like expensive battle cruisers with slightly better agility and resists and much worse ehpwith regards to the sliepnir and vagabond the vaga needs 5 low slots to do that sort of damage at those ranges which means no speed mods or ehp  which severely cuts down is survivability and the sleipnir is simply top of the dog pile right now with asbs  its a monster sig radius or notsig tanking is such a finite thing most 100mn ab cruisers are the only ones who can take advantage of it to any real effect you need to have a signature literally half of a gunmissiles target sig for it to start significantly lowers the damage you take slap on a few lses and the point is void on the vagabond
did you miss the point in my first post about hacs having a roll which is just being better filled by t3s just now which could be fixed as i suggested by generally buffing hacs my point is there is no need for a role change they just need to be made better at the role they have the ehp of a hac is usually better than a bc unless you fit them horribly cerb is the exception and as mentioned it is those stats for the vaga are based on the two gyro two tracking enhancer one nano layoutas i said field command ships should be better in small gangs than hacs try taking an asb sleipnir to a fight against 10 or more people see how quickly you die you do not need a 100mn ab to sigtank effectively try shooting at a 10mn zealot with a battleship and form a new opinion
there has been alot of solutions and topics how they would be counteredmain problem seems to be that most of the solutions would kill cloaking completely i would personaly want to see fuel bays for the specialized ships and just fuel in cargo bay for others and it would be ccps problem how to balance it so that it would be fair to the ones using cloaks and it would also kill afk cloaking mayby higher meta level mods would consume less fuel so you could cloack up for longer period of times or somethingi dont see how this would ruin cloaking completely it would just mean that if your stupid enough to leave your ship to be cloaked for long period of times without you being around someone would eventualy find you and kill you if they wanted to you could still do all the psychological warfare you want by being in the system or traps and so on but you would most importantly be active and not passive ratting in empire waiting there and not even paying attentionand stop posting no no no no i cant play without afk cloaking and start saying something constructive
what indirect benefit are you getting if its stopping other people from ratting then its not benefitting you its just harrassing themalso how do you know if they are afk or not you complain saying theyre afk cloaking but if they are theyre doing no harm are they theyre not even there
ill just counter this by saying lets add the fuelbays and scans into the game is there a problem thenand if you dont get the indirect benefits of psychological warfare well thats your problem then
is it possible to add the option for the client to auto detect your videocard setting for the game this will be next to the options to best perfomance best quality settings in the esc menuasking this because videodrivers gets updated lots of time and after installing the drivers one clicking auto detect maybe gets you a newer result 
would definitely be useful most modern games do it maybe only a function od dx10 though
it will be very usefull for notebooks the videocards in those are a nerfed version of the desktop original and might help to get your best settings without overheating the videocard
1this would be so epic
ive gone on several wh and null roams where i have done more than 24 hours worth of cloaking most of my roams last a week or so depending on how much i am able to play without being anywhere near someplace where i could dock upany sort of fuel or cap use or whatever that would have any effect on an afk cloaker would make my personal activity very very difficult im sure there are many other folks who do similar things that require long cloak times away from any source of refuelingand to the person with the pulse thing that kills bombers and gatepos scouts adds certain death to an already tedious joband if it had a significant say 6 hours cooldown it woudl be pretty useless against the afk cloakers
fuelbays kill the active cloaker who spends time away from any refueling base for example behind enemy lines work or deep wormhole resident huntingsystem wide scans however they work even if you dont use them to then scan down a cloaker simply knowing a cloaker is present in this way still breaks wormholesedit posted the following before and i am sure i will post it againsimply remove cloakers from local and deny that cloaker local now cloaks are really cloaked now afk cloaking cannot cause any fear now active cloakers have to work for more intel now system residents have to pay a little more attention to whats going on around them now if done correctly bots can be caughtjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
immunity to scram mwd effect would really only be a boost to shield  kiting hacs while i doubt an armor zealot or sacrilege or diemost would truly benefit from it as for x warp core stab strength  no penalty to warp core stabs etc what are you trying to create here blockade runners and mining barges havehad this utility built into the hull but thats so they could run away somehow creating a combat vessel with a getoutofjailfree card doesnt make a good design philosophy this will certainly make them more hit and runish but hit and run shouldnt be about surprise and potency with the caveat that a poorly chosen target with nearby backup can result in the loss of your ship id much prefer suggestions like all hacs get stronger webs or increased propulsion jamming scramwebdisrupt range or  something that helps them fight better not run away better i agree with you that tier 2 bcs offer cheaper excellent dps excellent tank alternatives to hacs that tier 3 bcs offer highspeed highdps excellent rangealpha yet is cheaper alternatives to hacs and t3 cruisers offer significant advantages over hacs if youre willing to spend a little more i also agree that pirate cruisers overshadow hacs but thats mostly because they are hacs or have extremely unique utility like 90 webs in the end i dont think there is a fixall solution that will suddenly make hacs viable again i think all bcs need to be rebalanced first and then hacs given an appropriate role bonuses that make them superior choices over the bc counterparts
our alliance is in a lot of wars and we intend to accumulate more however the wardec interface is woefully lacking the options to manage our wars easily it is bubbly and friendly  which is fine if you have 13 wars but were sitting north of 60 wars and intend to get multiple hundred there is no sort option by name mutual status start date end date isk damage etc there is no table view which would go with the first point there is no compact list like in chat channelsplease create the option for wars to be listed in a more manageable way
keep the support rollingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
at least i would like to be able to create subfolders for bookmarksbecause currently here is what we have  personnal locations folder 1 folder 2 folder 3i would be nice to be able to create subfolders like that  personnal locations folder 1 subfolder a subfolder b folder 2 subfolder c folder 3 subfolder d subfolder e subfolder f subfolder g

if all else fails the biomass queue is over dont forget to give me your stuffi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i also hate afk cloackies mmm now i found this
can someone help me maybe i am doing it wrong i been in jita for like 1 week now didnt even get 1 rage mail
so what youre saying is that  which is what i said in the thread name  my idea where simply things to get people thinkingthe warp core strength bonus was to take hacs back to the days when they used wcs as a lot of expensive ships did so they have options other than die in a fire when someone tackled themincreasing stats ehp resists dps simply turns them into mini battleships which is boring  we have battle cruisers for that being difficult to pin down and trap is in itself a role for a heavy hitting low tank ship but its just one idea  i was hoping for more constructive feedback p
wouldnt a mwd sig bonus be enough
insurance isnt a reward since you lose more than you get back what it is is a reduction in pain when you do lose your ship
humm killers already get rewarded when they kill the ships you can loot and salvage plus try losing 4 or 5 maelstroms abaddons on the trot and see if insurance is rewarding you
bringing this up again as it continues to be a major limiting factor that seriously needs attention
why do i keep having to make threads with this titlethere is something terribly wrong with wardec mechanics which horribly punishes the aggressor whenever an aggressor declares a war they can and will be permanently trapped in that war and made to permanently fight an unlimited number of opponentsformal definition of problemthe defender in a war can set the war to mutual and the aggressor is permanently trapped in the warhow to transfer wardecsa wardecced corporation joins an alliance that alliance sets the war mutual transferreda corporation joins an alliance then leaves they have a perfect copy of all alliance wars transferreda corporation leaves an alliance joins another alliance transferredthats right we can transfer wars from any entity to any other entity what questions does this raise why would you ever use the defender system in wardecs when you could just transfer an exact copy of your war to an infinite number of entities why pay for defense when you can gain infinite allies for free using warduping why let your enemy ever escape tired of fighting the war store it on a 1 man alt corp that you can use to revive it years down the road completely out of the blue to continue your revenge i promise to do all these things and make everyone regret the poor design decision i will be at eve vegas to personally argue this case before the devs but player support is muchly appreciated even if just for the lulzthe goal of the wardec revamp was to make wars popular and fun now youve accomplished the opposite by making war an unthinkable crime that can only be waged with disposable alt corps you must fix this exploit before i ruin highsec for everyone for all time because i willlink to original dec shield thread
1 to the opit seems that ccps intent to promote empire warfare has surprise surprise resulted in the concepts total destruction although we didnt have the tools to publicly see all wars before inferno id be willing to bet good money that the v
great idea i support this concept not slow too much to reship but some slowdown is ok after all that new clone that just got reanimated might need a little stretching and warm up before running into his next pod fully clothed
the army will give his wife a fat check and if he had any brains hed also have another life insurance policy due to the nature of his job
as we all can see currently is being exploited to artificially inflate prices in game last night for the 4th time in just as many days i went to sell a couple plex to someone buying 5 just to not get the sales due to them not having the cash needs at the very least taken from 25 to 75 escrow to reduce the  of people manipulating the marketbottom line its out of control and starting to effect the markets negatively both for sellers and buyers
bumping it upto a required 75 escrow still would not add any risk to  id say leave the skill as is but if the marketeer does not have the full amount of cash when someone goes to sell them the item they not only dont get the sale but also lose the 25 escrow they put down
your ideas of giving them builtin wcs or bonuses to fitting wcs are unspeakably badyour other ideas are problematic because youre imposing onesizefitsall solutions across a diverse ship class what use are bonuses to nos for ranged hacs that never want to be inside nos range good for sacrilege useless for the eagle and cerb hacs need to be fiddled with individually before a uniform bonus can be considered and somehow room will need to be found for them in a game with t2 and t3 bcs tricky one
i dont see a severe problem with hacs although considering their cost they are not too amazing however for me the hacs should be all about getting in the fight dealing good damage and good mobility they definitely should not be immune to scram by default typo forgot to put not after should
i would definitely like to see this implemented
beat me to it please implement this ccp 2  lines of code port the find in contracts function over to find in assetsim sure its more complicated than that but the results will be very worthwhile
why isnt everyone jumping on this say youre fitting a ship and you know you have the mods somewhere in all of your assets but you cant remember where you have the option of right clicking and viewing the mod in the market or in contracts to go and buy another one but you know you got one somewhere so  you have to open your assets and then type it in and all that but why  lets have a find in assets option with our right clicky  thank you
because unless people hate an idea  99 of them wont reply they love to flame 
best thing to do is if you see ui devs responding to other discussion threads link them back to this proposal
what game mechanic are they using to interact with you whilst they are afkdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
what acual risk to someone trying to scam people using  blasphamygood idea tho
is it dumb idea day or whatthere are some hacs that need looking into but there are several standout hacs that are outstandingthe only reason im not in a vaga right now is the damn things have gotten as expensive as pirate faction stuff
i think all of dotbros and cfc would tell you that zealots are pretty damn goodhave you ever flown a dual rep sacvaga is undeniably one of the best solosmall gang ships in the gametell bl the muninn sucks and see what they tell youcerb sucks because drake tengu fittingbeagle can be pretty gooddeimos ya it sucksishtar ya it sucks tooi dont see a problem with hacs i just see a problem with gallente
isthar is phenomenal for pve and pvp its not easy to fly but it can project damage better than most other hacs without risking itself put a 30km point on it and give it some speed its quite effective worse comes to worst you dump your drones and fleethats kinda what im talking about hacs being able to do that is good  its also why the cynabal is popular but im trying to get some idea to make all hacs feel like they are that good the vaga is decent as is the zealot  but these and in the minority the gtfo factor is what makes them popular since other ships can tank and gank harderprojection and runawayfactor are top choices for making a hac harrass gang
i agree the hacs are largely overshadowed by other things these days but i also think youre over thinking it a simple fitting buff to them is all thats really required the reason the cynabal outclasses the vagabond by such a huge margin isnt because of speed or gun range its because the cynabal can fit a full rack of 720 arties without any fitting sacrifices while a vaga struggles with even 220 acs its like that across the rest of them too
this wont change anything i place a buy order for 2000 units of x at 1m each and whether i need 10 or 25 or 95 in escrow as long as i need less than 100 the order gets put on the market as 2000 units of x at 1m each and as long as my minimum buy order is 2000 units when you come along with 2000 units and attempt to sell them to me i wont have enough funds to cover the transaction hence the order fails i dont gain any units of x and you get to keep all 2000 units of x no one is harmed in this process changing it from 25 to 75 would really only hurt legitimate traders who have billions in both buy and sell orders that they are continually moving the mechanic is not responsible for the success of the scam its your greed the only way to prevent it would be to alter the way escrow funds work a youd need to increase escrow to at least match the minimum buy amount b you would need escrow funds to be used last not first as they are now c when a persons wallet doesnt contain enough to cover the buy order the escrow is used to cover the purchase and the order is cancelled however this would require a serious rework of the escrow  market system currently escrow funds are put into one big account and all buy orders use up escrow funds first and then use money from your wallet you have to change this mechanic or you wont stop margin scamming and frankly that would be a lot of work to change something that really doesnt need fixing id much rather the devs focus on rebalancing ships fixing pos system fixing sov tweaking fw etc etc etc the market system works very well even if the 001 isk war gets annoyingedit the scam is sooooo easy to spot does the buy order have a minimum quantity greater than 1 a no its probably not a scam b yes its probably a scam and the only way a margin trader makes funds is if you buy the product from them at some ridiculous price so as long as you dont buy overpriced items to resell youll never get burned
extra fitting would allow them to do things involving 100mn abs and the like it doesnt address the issues that the close range hacs have with being close to pointless
just nerf t3 cruisrrs and hacs come back
definitely would like some bounceid also like to see plex for boobs spend one plex and the proceeds go toward breast cancer research in return a female avatar on your account gets to sport another two cup sizes extra with a resculpt to apply it
hey you got boobs what else do ya need maybe tight pants showing my manroot
i would be all for it as long as it was within realistic parameters as in no dead or alive volleyball bobs but the slight movement of the chest along with the torso when your walking would go a long way to improving the look of the avatars would also like something other then freakin heels but thats a rant in another thread
if they are going to sell plex to resculpt the avatar how about a plex to change a character name they could leave the old name and date of change in your employment historyive passed on good characters in the character bazarr because they had some really stupid names but i did buy one id really like to changeim betting others woud be interested in thisbrundlemeth
this has already been discussedrepeatedly
nopeyou should recognize someone at first sight and not after digging through employment history
why are they used by half of nullsec if they are pointless
by being used in nullsec you mean if you can fly a zealot you do it  if you cant you fly something else cause its better than nothingim also sick of people taking 1 type of massed ship making a fleet out of it and declaring that ship viable because of one limited situation the muninn is the perfect example an ac tornado is just plain better than it in its strongest role  the only issue issue is its skill point intensive and lots of nullsec is populated by experienced players giving out orders minority then pets who turn up in a ship they are told to buy majority when you see fleet reports from serious pvp alliances their ship choices are include practically none of these hacs  simply because they take other ships that do it better
firstly do you even know what muninn fleets do because they are firstly designed to not die a concept foreign to the tornado and secondly designs to kite and do decent damage at medium range with good tracking which the nado doesnt do particularly well eithersecondly are you seriously suggesting that irc are a serious pvp alliance if not as i assume because lol then who exactly are you talking aboutedit also how is the tornado skill intensive its a t1 bc
good idea
probably not what your looking for but you can drag and drop bookmarks in to your cargo hold and save them in a station or pos until they find out what to do about it
imagine if you are hunting war targets and you are using locator agents to find where they are this is what you have to dowhat you have to do nowset your agent finder to any and level 4 right click each agent and show info until you find the nearest locator agent then you go to it and write the name down and the time you use it fly your alt all the way over to the targets location only to need another locate because they have moved so you again right click all the agents to find another and either look at your list to make sure you havent used it or just pray you haven used it ectideawouldnt it be nice to have an option to find your locators maybe highlight the agents names in yellow like on the market if they are on the way to your destinationor have a timer that tells you when you can use that locator againjust thought of this and think it could be helpful
yes god yesthis really really needs to be done also it would be such an easy thing to implement compared to most of the suggestions made plus with the bounty system getting an overhaul for the winter expansion this will need even more attention with people looking for other people more often people will be using the locator agents almost constantly which is going to make finding them a royal pain in the assi made this same suggestion in a thread on fixing the bounty system if the new bounty system sees implementation without this you will soon see threads like this one popping up all over the place ship itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

being able to transfer wars from one alliance to another by alliance hopping is obviously an exploit and needs to be fixedhowever the defenders should be able to make a war permanent because thats what the aggressor deserves if they want war they can have war otherwise starting wars as an aggressor is a no lose situation not like the way the war is going pull out is not a good way for the war system to work especially for the aggressor the mutual mechanic needs to stayin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
im the single largest abuser of these current game mechanics and i absolutely believe this is not how wardecs were intend to beas i see it ccp intended wardecs to be a commitment from the aggressor for at least a week at a time no more declare war fight until its inconvenient then drop the war 24hrs later ccp tried to accomplish this commitment through the various new mechanics increasing wardec costs restricting player corp hopping 7 day rule removing the ability for the aggressor to revoke the war allowing a defender to mutual a war to prevent the aggressor from ending it corps that leave an alliance receive identical copies of its wars lets talk about ending wars for a minuteas of right now the mechanics for ending a war are equivalent to ending your phone service by stopping payment thats really what it is you have to default on the war bill to end the war if some corp in your alliance goes through the alliance bill list and pays them all like an upstanding citizen then your alliance is unwillingly hooked into another week of war regardless of your intentions there is no off button why is there no off buttonfurthermore the defender in a war has the ability to permanently lock the aggressor in this war by setting it mutual obviously the intend consequence was to prevent aggressors from just ending a bad war and escaping but the horrifying sideeffects of this are people like me trapping as many people as we can in wars if this was somehow ccps intention then it would have been prudent to review how this played out with other war mechanics but they didnt a corporation that is in an outgoing wardec is forbidden by game mechanics from joining an alliance this might make sense but it no longer makes sense if the wardec has been declared mutual aggressor corps in mutual wars should not suffer this restriction since the defender has thrown down and agreed to face them in open warthe natural mechanic here is to have an offbutton for wardecs when an aggressor declares theyre no longer interested in maintaining the war and then the war ends at the end of that week interval regardless of whether or not its paid if the war is mutual there are three options as i see it the war is retracted if defenders want to continue they can counter wardec traditional the war continues aggressors are trapped current the defenders become the aggressors and assume billing responsibilities for the war okay so lets talk about starting warsthe current system calculates the cost of a wardec based on the number of players in the target corpalliance this is a mistake that protects the large nullsec alliances from highsec harassment a more equitable system would calculate the cost of a war based on the difference in member count between two entities in other words it should cost the same for a 1 man corp to wardec a 5000 man alliance as it does for a 5000 man alliance to wardec a 1 man corp likewise it should be considerably cheaper for a 5000 man alliance to wardec another 5000 man alliancethe old wardec system cost 2mil base for a corp to dec another corp and 50mil base for any wars an alliance were involved in the old system increased the cost of declaring war based on how many wars you were in and how many the target was in the current system only cares about how many wars youre in and the base cost is 50mil across the boardwhile itd be nice to maintain those 2mil wardecs for long abandonned highsec offline structure clearing  setting up a system to calculate active subscribers in a target entity is generally beyond a simple fix but such a solution would be more optimal to prevent obvious abuses such as packing your corpalliance with 51day trial accounts to fluff your numbers and inflate wardec costs 51day trial accounts are the 21 day buddy invite trials plexd once to give them 51 days of play time while giving a plex to the recruiter these accounts dont technically count as trial accounts and thus do contribute to inflated wardec costs and i will slap anyone who claims otherwise because weve tested it the goal here is to remove loopholes related to wardec costscontinued below
if they did this i would pod myself about 5 or 6 times just to see the animation 1 lol
i dont know if ive said it yet but id like to see a change to how this skill works i still believe it is exploited i dont agree with the 25 escrow because anyone with billions can still run the scam easily and anyone legitimately using it would lose a great deal of benefit from iti think the simplest answer is to penalize the player who frauds the system freeze their wallet put them into a negative isk balance or otherwise make sure they are properly chastened in a realistic fashion for misusing the skill it could still be run as a scam but the player would require some work to reaquire either market liquidity or rebuild their credit status for the skillit really is as simple as looking at real world consequences of which there are many and finding one that seems appropriate to apply in game it doesnt have to be too harsh and it certainly doesnt have to remove that use of the skill as a viable means of scamming but it should alter the effects of making such a choice and give a person reason to consider whether it is worth it andor how often it is worth it to do and for what reasonsthe skill is used on mains rather than alts or at least specially trained character intended for trading i also dont see any reason why the person failing to sell to such an order due to it failing shouldnt receive an appropriate market transaction with the name of the buyer who failed to complete the order along with the order and amountzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

after talking it over with quite a few people in real time there is no possible way to guarantee that the bounty system cant be exploited in one way or another it offers new players not familiar with its working an artificial sense of possible future retribution against the target who eventually just gets podded by an alt to collect said bountyeven if the new implementation of a percentile based bounty payout takes place in some of the more extreme cases it is still worth it to pod yourself at least once for collection of the billions of isk you would receive for the first few self terminations add to that that most people with bounties on their heads are station dwellers and well they have a source of emergency capital if they need it for their next station based scamuntil there is a sure fire way that the bounty system cant be exploited it may as well just be scrapped if that is not an option at least put in a warning that can be activated for new players stating that it can possibly be exploited maybe even put it into the tutorial
you missed the boat theyve already announced that theyre fixing the bounty system for the winter expansionalso this has been discussed in detail and there are many varied ways of preventing the bounty system from being exploitedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
no i havent missed the boat truth be told the fix isnt really fixing it it just keeps someone from collecting all of the money at once apparently they can still bring a ship along pewpew themselves and if the bounty is high enough it would still be worth the cost of a clone
id prefer space flight and battles more if it was a little bit more cinematic
