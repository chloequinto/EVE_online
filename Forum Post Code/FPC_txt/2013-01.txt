i want it back too
im prettier
i have to agree with the lykoleon here
if the cost of the fine outweighs the profit of the crime youre bound to be fine
ccp were talking earlier in the year about allowing criminals to buy off their low sec status possibly through trading in npc dogtagsi see no problem with this
there is already a forum about fleet ideas 
the tug should have a special module which allows for tractoring empty subcapital ships in space
not a bad ideai am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
please bring back the jukebox im not impressed at all by the new system
so uh can we have the jukebox back already the new music is dull
i dont stealscam from people in my corp or alliance ehonor is such a burdento the point of the opscamming and outright theft are part of the dystopian universe that is eve online so are murder backstabbing betrayal treason and bullying the game is not that way by accident considering its been ongoing for 10 yearsalso there is no real monetary value associated with isk thats like saying monopoly money has a real value because you bought the boxed game with your credit card you paid for a service from ccp when you bought the plex that service is the right to connect to the game server for 30 days the plex item is simply a representation of the service owed to you in that sense its like a token at a video arcade  you traded your money for token to be able to play the games  but the tokens themselves have no real world value as an in game asset you are free to trade the plex for any other in game asset at an exchange rate determined by the in game market but like every other in game asset they have no out of game value the only thing involved that has any real world value is your time and presumably you agree you are getting an equitable trade for that time or youd go do something elseif you propose that in game items have a monetary value you should be able to use them as a normal medium of exchange so unless you can buy a cheesburger and a beer for a fully fit tengu your argument fails to hold any water
sovereignty has always been a pain in the ass for everyine in nullsec and ccp it doesnt have to be thoughthe one massive problem has been that its always been based around a structure grind first posses and now sbus all things that dont really need any presencei say remove all structure based sovereignty and base it entirely around activity if an alliance manages to form at least 6080 to be determined of all activity in a system for a week they gain sovereignty of it activity can be defined as follows from the least impact to the mostinfluence see below basic presense be present in the system the more pilots spending more time in a system the more activity you produce cloaked ships do not count as any activity construction manufacturing items in pos or stations putting down pos doing nothing else with it also goes here moon mining belt activity ice mining belt rats the lot anomalies capital ship construction in pos construction of outposts pvp kills pvp kills over the past x days are tallied up more kills final blows from players generate more activityactivity accrues over time retaining the level 1 through 4 for a given system massive pvp action can swing activity in favor of another party making war a viable option to switch it however to retain sovereignty one must remain active system level and the amount of time where sovereignty is held also produce influence around the system ala the eve sovereignty map this makes it so that fringe systems do not need to be actively pursued around the clock but still gives smaller alliances room to manouver into a part of spacethis system also allows smaller alliances to claim a part of space without being overrun by larger alliances almost immediately  sovereignty is no longer a matter of plonking down an sbu you no longer need a pure capital ship force to take over systems making invasions by smaller alliances much more feasible aswell as them simply taking unused portions of spacethis system also means that travelling to another part of the universe for a prolonged time means you may have to give up sovereignty back home since you will be much less active there this makes cross galactic wars much less common and much harder to maintain this combined with the possibility for smaller alliances to take unused space means that conflict may become much more common and localrenting out space is still possible a new standing might be created where the renter doesnt generate any activity for themselves in return they get full or partial access to the system and generate activity for the landlordfreespace alliance could retain their sov due to surrounding system influence as most freespacers will not generate enough activity over multiple systems to affect this but they could also enact a systemwide tax which generates activity in their favor this would apply to bounties and refining at least possibly also a fee for pos maintenance this would apply to neutral and higher standings towards the sov holder negative standings dont pay tax but are also unlikely to be able to dock in stationsoutposts nor survive for very long in the first place unless theyre in invader in which case they have to be able to generate competing activity anyway another mechanic to enforce open space would be to have it declared as such but tax has to be paid to concordthe pvp mechanic could be enforced by a dominance system a tugofwar style system where dominance goes from 5050 to 0100 or 1000 for the parties involved all attackers vs the sov holder the more dominance one has the less activity one generates by more kills this also prevents abuse of the pvp activity by repeatedly killing a pet corp in newbie frigates for example since they will not generate dominance activity in return and will cap out very sooncontinued in part 2
part 2since capital ships are no longer the sole factor determining sovereignty guerilla warfare suddenly becomes an effective way to wage war aswell defenders are no longer relegated to fleeing to empire or playing station games with little to no effect they can actually affect the war if they play it right this also goes for offense large empires cannot ignore smaller invaders anymore if unchecked they can severely hamper their activity ratings in systems this further incentivizes only taking systems you will actually use rather than spamming sbusposses everywhere you canto ccp i strongly believe that this will not take away points of conflict since the activity system encourages actual activity conflicts will arise at the points of interest in a system mission areas anomalies asteroid belts and moons aswell as stations since pvp activity is still the most valuable people will still be engaging one another only theres little to no incentive to blob each other out depending on the size of the organizations waging war on each other making warfare far more dynamiccurrent structures only incentivize vast blobs the entire organization gathered in one place to simply force their advantage in numbers with little to no thought behind tactics or strategy nor any worry about having to defend their own territory while attacking spreading out points of conflict together with incentivizing smaller empires because of the activity system will generate enough points of conflict as furthermore smaller empires will move into nullsec thus increasing the likelyhood of conflict elsewhereabout using sbus and poss theres a brilliant quote from the philospher james mayits an ingenious solution to a problem that should never have existed in the first placethey are artificial means of creating conflict where none should be necessary and in the process they eliminate any chance of significant conflict anywhere elsei truly beleive that this sytem will revitalize 00 aswell as making it vastly more accessible to new alliances and players
quick were losing sov to the mining barges everyonethis is silly
i think that the sovereignty levels should be more granular than they are now and that there should be multiple metrics that all feed into determining the level of a given system so that rattingminingetc there are references in the database to other types of indices beyond military and industrial all contribute in some wayhowever making sovereignty based purely on those sorts of things is silly
it cant be based on anything else if you want to get away from the structure grind thats the entire issuethe values on which activity is based are tbd of course after a lot of testing i dont really see any downsides to this proposal but i do see a massive improvement on what the situation is right now or what it has been ever since sov was introduced
thats the only way that doesnt make the problem worse its still a bad idea but its the best bad idea of the lotthat said my signature is appropriate to this topic
convo spam was abusing a coding issue that ccp admitted existed wherein the spam did cause players to lag if not disconnect its a very different mechanism from bumping and conflating the two is silly
so i have been playing eve for a few months now my character is much older than his skill point level reflects as i was turned off at first by the steep learning curve of the game having been begged by friends to come back i cant help but notice a number of things that drive me absolutely batty the first of these is ship design while i understand that developers have children that build things with duplos or make finger paintings of space these things belong attached to your fridge with a magnet not thrown willy nilly into the game you are making that being said i find the most difficult thing about eve is tailoring a ship for a mission everyone says to switch ammunition types tank modules and even drones to match the mission at hand i fly gallente ships because the few ship models that are not intolerable are actually very good the problem here is that all of the bonuses are directly related to the racial module a bonus to hybrid turret damage for example i find that this prevents me from using other weapon modules artillery for example to their full effect when mounted on my ship so really my questions is whats up with that is there some underlying game background that prevents starship captains from wiring their ship hulls with electronic components from other races would it actually unbalance the game if players could put weapon modules of one race on ship hulls from another without suffering a penalty is there any kid of idle chat about making ships customizable in some way so that players who like to enjoy the way their starship looks can have their cake and eat it too by also fitting the weapon modules with the most pleasing effects and not suffer a penalty for it just something for yall to ponder those who feel it necessary may troll away as i will just ignore you
ships have roles bonuses are designed to help the ship to fulfill the role they create diversity between ships combined with the fitting attributes of the hull
not to mention that ships that are fully and equally customization will all sport more or less the same fits and use similar tactics against one anotheras opposed to the rochambeau game we currently have where each ship can be fitted for certain tactics that other ships can be fitted to counter and so on and so forth
omg what a can of worms that would beim all for more customization thoarmor tanks lose space for nanos and damage mods shield tanks lose space for ewar it would be nice to be able to switch that out to fit your favorite ship to fly in a specific kind of fleet it would also be nice to switch out shield boost or armor rep bonuses for resistance bonuses for fleet pvp i always liked the hurricane and rifter because it could be tanked either or and be effective
im not saying ships cant have roles i just mean that ships for each race that fill essentially the same role the tier 3 battlecruisers for example what is the underlying issue with the percentage bonus to hybrid turret damage of the talos applying instead to all large turrets so that i could fit artillery if i wanted a more satisfying boom or the choice to choose ammunition with a different damage type on a hull that was also aesthetically pleasing as it stands right now my options are fit medium hybrids to the talos and throw away any advantage the talos really has in effect making it an expensive cruiser fly a ship i dont like to get the bonus for the guns i do or just fly it as is using the rail guns at no point am i allowed to have my cake and eat it to i mean i would be perfectly happy if there was a way to customize so much as a color scheme on the ship to make it more appealing on another note whats up with the specialized ships being the same hull as a non specialized ship with very minor changes i mean sure a navy issue version of the ship i get but the enyo and the incursus are entirely different ships yet the only real difference in appearance is color and a minor change tot he engines or the vagabond its just a stabber with some camo paint and extra wingy bits glued on the sides im sure there are more examples these are just the ones i am familiar with
can anyone check which ship gives a racial bonus to paragraph size i need to know what this guy is flying
duh welcome to eve  you will likely be very unhappy for the short time you are here that fact that you think that the only difference between the stabber and the vagabond is the paint job and a couple of frills means that you are eithera a troll so obvious that even other obvious trolls are calling you an obvious troll orb so ill informed on the topic at hand that we can safely ignore any input you might makeactually they amount to the same thingseriously l2playthedamnedgamebforemakingdumbasssuggestions
i am quite aware that the stabber and the vagabond are two completely different ships the numbers and stats and bonuses are different  their abilities are different my point was why the devil are these people so lazy with the models hell we didnt even get four brand new destroyers we got three brand new destroyers and the amarrians got a coercer polished up a bit with the abilities changed around one might expect better from people who are descended from a culture that more or less wrote the book on ship building
additionally the next time you want to use an amalgamation of words longer than my arm you can precede it with a hashtag and post it to twitter where it belongs your reading comprehension level is worse than my niece in kindergarten
because one is used to create the other think of t2 ships as modified versions of the standard ship yeah that one was a bit underwhelming but its not like too many people cared it does what it does and thats why people fly it
see now this was more helpful in dispelling my negative feelings toward ships the flavor text fails to explain that they used the original ship as a design model it just says so and so was paid to develop this to solve this by this in fact the ship flavor text is very cookiecutter all the way around i just figured there would be more people that would hire some space junkies to float about in the hangar and repaint their ship if they could

there is a very simple fix to rebalance drones prevent npcs from targeting themi dont really get why this was changed anyways drones were fine before and are now the probably most tedious thing and nothing but plain annoying it feels like someone came up with the idea that guns have a 1100 change to explode when trying to fire a plain nuisance to increase the price for the itemas it stands currently all you need to do to counter that targeting is to keep an eye on the targeting and recall drones as soon as it changes bigger drones may be kept alive using remote repair but for once that does not fit on every ship and for second the small drones tend to die way too fast to keep them alive using rrbut what does that change add to the game beside the increase in droneprice i cant see anything here drones before havent been overly powerful as their damage was extremely restricted they only thing you could do using a drone boat was to afk through a mission but at the drawback that it actually takes 23 times as long which sounds balanced to me now drones have been nerfed from an addition to useless as i and i am pretty sure many others as well dont want to spend their time in the mission staring at the targeting signs and keep recalling and sending back out their dronesif a change adds nothing but an annoyance to the game it is a mistake and needs to be reverted and this drone change is a mistake
there are actually people who seem to use bots to place bounties on everyoneive been in jita recently and someone asked what the word scam means so i said scam is if someone says like give me any amount of isk and i double it guaranteed2 seconds later i had 100k bounty on my head as no one can actually place bounty this fast by hand and several other people had the same issue with the same person placing the bounty my guess is that this is a bot watching the chat for certain words scammers and throws around bounties
sorry op i dont support your proposal imho the new bounty system was a fantastic part of retribution and very well thought out too congrats to all involved btw my main critisim of your proposal is that i cant see why a small bounty on your head would be something to worry about in the first place
you missed the point you dont understand or im not familar enough with english the low bounty on me or someone else isnt really the problem itself the important word is everybody i detected that bounties are placed on almost everybody around jita the problem is see is that the following game feature helpful for bounty hunters to detect pilots with interesting bounties gets unusable if more than half of the players in the universe have a useless bounty on themoverview window  icon column  player has bounty on him  and if there is no chance to set a filter on the bounty amount to be tracking or place a threshold on the initial bountyps yes  i agree that the new bounty system was a fantastic part of retribution
youve skipped both reasons why these structures exist  the main one being timezones its very difficult to have a fair mechanic that ensures alliances cant lose their assets while they sleep while at the same time not giving them a massive defensive advantage how would such a system react to a euro alliance going to bed then having 1000 hostile us timezone players sitting camping their hq each night while they sleep what if those 1000 players split up into groups of 100 and camped 10 systems what if they did that each night for a week its not practical to enforce activity 247 to claim a system nor does it work if the period is so short that it negates the effect of timezones on top of that any mechanic that demands players to sit around in a system doing nothing is even more boring than grinding structures at least when shooting ihubs you might be hotdroppedsecondly structures and reinforce timers also serve to force fights at times when one party would not otherwise engage while youve gone into some detail about a pvp mechanic that measures who has the best kd ratio or whatever you havent provided any incentive for those parties to actually fight if alliances are in two different timezones and system ownership is determined by activity in a system what reason would they ever have to fight each otherin truth i think the best solution lies in a combination of new and existing mechanics as myanna said there should be multiple metrics that all feed into deciding ownership of a system or region its all very well asking people to compare kd ratios or rat more but unless you provide other mechanics that actually force parties to engage when they may not want to youre just going to end up with a race of who can run the most bots or keep the most eve clients logged on afk
another group being active in their own timezone in your systems means that they are giving up on their own systems to do so that said while timezones are an issue they are an unimportant one imho you could simply make nonpvp activity by the alliance that owns the system count 100 more than activity from alliances with no sov theresitting in a system doing nothing should give next to no activity sitting in a system cloaked gives no activity whatsoever this also counts for active covert ops ships as such theres no point doing nothingthe point of this system is not just to eliminate structure grind its also to force alliances to only take systems they actually use any kind of sov system which does not reward actual activity in the system ie sbus posses whatever can and will be abused to spam them around making it impossible to wage any meaningful warfare nor stake a meaningful claim to somethingas i already explained the best way to take over someone elses system is to fight them pvp activity especially succesful activity is rewarded with a lot of activity this also makes guerilla warfare possible and a credible threat rather than something to be ignored since they cant hurt out possbu anyway if you want to conquer a system you have to fight if you want to keep a system you have to fight aswell you cant simply ignore invadersif you choose to try and ignore invaders all that happens is that your activity will degrade since youre not doing anything there other than hide in the mean time the invaders are happily making use of your system generating their own activity cloaked fleets dont help you the occasional gank doesnt create any meaningful activity due to the time spent cloaked and a single kill here and there wont offset the otherwise massive activity an invader could bringif alliances are in two different timezones sovereignty will be determined by whoever is the most active simple timezones should not count as a defense against anything  as i explained already offline defense requires structures that can survive untill the next time you can log on which introduces the structure grind yet again this is exactly the thing i want to avoid and so does everyone elsetimezones not mattering for this also reinforces the effect of more space being available to smaller alliances also one should not be able to claim sov soloas i explained above parties have to engage one another to force the other out if this cant happen due to timezones then quite honestly its just bad luck or bad timing eve isnt turned off when you go to sleep nor should it be but structures do exactly this they dont just make it boring for defenders they make it boring for attackers aswellthe current system also forces capital ships to be used for each and every fight that determines sov any other ship class does not matter for this since they hardly do damage to the structures determining sov or can even defend themselves against stuff like pos guns
by unimportant did you really mean the most important issue
i dont see how timezones are more important than the sovereignty system itself this is an important distinction to make  catering to different timezones is a part of it not its main focusthe problem with catering to timezones is that you are saying to give a defender a means to defend without actually being there the next question is how long should he be able to do that why should the game give free defense to someone who isnt actually there to defend it catering to timezones is one of the reasons why the current system doesnt really work
i made a similarlythemed attempt at sovreform awhile back basically line up the incentives so that1 holding space has inherent costs which vary based on the strategic value of the space in question2 holding space affects your neighbors encouraging localsmallscale conflict effect scales as more space is claimed3 the more active space is the more it can be improved in various ways conversely disrupting activity can have major impact on both the economic and strategic value of said space 4 timers are defacto set by defenders but this ability is related to and limited by the financial costs of holding sovereignty the longer the timer the greater the costs various other oftenasked for goodies
you could of course reply with actual arguments based on facts and deduction instead of going for the typical trollflame response that adds nothing to the discussion in this topic nowhere do i mention that 247 presence is required you only need to generate more activity than other groups in the same system if you dont want to actually be active in the system there is no reason to take sov there  if you dont want to invest in an area of space why should you be entitled to take it and keep it the current jump bridge mechanic is one of the major offenders in this entire story aswell by the way if that wasnt clear enoughif you can come up with actual arguments that 100 refute and put down my proposal id be happy to concede the discussion to you and declare you the winner if that makes you happypoint 1 is inherent in my proposal  you need to actually use the system to generate the activity points clarifying this term like this for now needed to obtain and retain sovereignty the costs are again inherent as time is the most important commodity in evepoint 2 is also covered under influence which is one of the activity point generating mechanics in my proposal it basically works like the eve sovereignty map influence albeit in a modifed form influence alone could feasibly take over systems but since its activity rank is the lowest any proper activity in the system will very quickly move sovereignty to the proper userspoint 3 is also inherent to my proposal that word is popular today isnt it  more activity points enable more sovereignty levels which might work the way they do now enemy activity without even needing to generate points can be incredibly disruptive since it disrupts your own activity point generationpoint 4 would be irrelevant here timers are something youd want to avoid since they encourage more passive play aswell as being prone to abuse both from internal and external sources
so youre arguing that if you can pve grind in your timezone better than the other guy can pve grind in their time zone you should get to own the systemthat shouldnt be a question if a pvp fight comes into it great but earlier you talked of other activity so that is in fact what you are arguing and thus ends anyones legitimate interest in your ideas
sounds to me like youre proposing we trade an annoying system for one that is completely broken and easily exploitable no thanks
wed game this system by camping you into station and holding a frigate tournament outside
so riddle me this why are the only people complaining about this proposal goonswarm members alts or pets seems pretty childish to attack my proposal purely on me being a member of my current corporation i thought goons were such nice people 0o
goons like to postand theres plenty of constructive criticism of your proposals over the last page amongst the lol evolution comments
once it hit the point where you failed to take in the constructive criticism offfered and failed to notice the parts where you contradict yourself within your own posts it became a comedy thread which of course weve been passing around on jabber alongside choice quotes at no point have we complained this is simply pointing and laughing now
your silly bumping is ramming s spaceship into another convo spamming is lagging a client until they disconnect
there are two changes i would make1 reduce mwd mass increase which will dramatically decrease the effectiveness of bumping2 allow ships to align despite bumping i dont believe you should be able to keep a ship tackled just by bumping it it seems like an abuse to me
what if item mass added to a ships mass so that a full freighter would be impossible to bump while an empty one would be easierherping your derp since 19potato url
seems sensible to me why should plex be the most expensive way to pay for the game
because it is functionally different than just paying for a sub it can be used in multitude of ways and even traded for goods and services within the game its a superior product from player perspective in every way which justifies the larger price tag
this scam is very easy to counter by using brain tm1 check the market and realize someone is paying a lot more for an item than someone is selling it2 understand that if the seller would have seen the buy order he would have definitely sold it to that guy instead of putting it on the market3 realize that you did not just get lucky today but that it is a scamon the other hand i recently got 100m for a 1m corpii btype because someone was not doing the scam right 
okay so it does say that it was based on the stabber hull and i have overlooked it completely dont i feel sheepish still the fact remains that i think there should be some method of changing a ships appearance so that you can have a ship that both serves a specific function and is pleasing to the eye in most cases i would settle for a make symmetrical button
i think your problem can be solved by improving on the market systemsif ccp made it easier to browse all buy orders from a specific playercorporation sellers can easily identify buy order hotspots if they do that buy orders can be met quicker and possibly at a higher profit then market averageso for example a player or corporation has just setup in a fairly empty system and a group of buy orders go up for standard t1 products sellers can browse a buy order and then look at all the buy orders of the player and sellalso to encourage this brokers tax can be reduced depending on the number of sell orders in that stationhaving npcs sell products on the market goes against the player orientated environment eve has so id vote against your idea sorry
this gets an enthusiastic 1 from me really anything that can help the overview would be welcome but this would be a major improvement
absolutely 1ing this this is basic common sense
well ccp could make it configurable at which point a char appears for you as wanted or as has bounty on the overview so everybody could decide for himself where the threshold is
yes exactly
my bad and apologies i did miss your point an appropriate filter in the overview options i could support assuming the coding would not be resource hungry
because your idea was pretty godawful bad to begin with so it got linked around for others to recognize the awfulbadness of it when confronted with attempts at argument and discussion such as my and cynonets points that its a good system but ought be combined with others rather than used on its own you brushed them aside declared no it has to be this way and later labeled them with the blanket of complaining thus its guaranteed that youll be pointed at and mockedand thats ignoring as cynonet pointed out the flaws in your arguments i mean youve made such claims as this will help small alliances gain a foothold when in fact such small alliances would be drowned out activitywise by a larger alliance even if theyre in other timezones youve claimed that time zones wont matter when in fact a multitimezone alliance will directly contest a smaller singletime zone entity in their time zone and drown out their activity in an uncontested manner the rest of the time youve claimed that nothing but caps matter in sov warfare when in fact deploying unsupported caps is just asking for them to be murdered by an opposing fleet comprised of supcaps or properly supported caps thats just from reskimming your post im sure i could go on
lets introduce something called null plex and you have to orbit a beacon with your titan to contest it if no enemy enters a npc will spawn to amuse you if somebody contests your system while you are not on you have to spend the same amount of time when you are on to decontest the system again in worst case its a total waste of time for both sides in best case both are on at the same time and meet at the beacon at this point you have to make the decision if you should better orbit something else or press f1 while activating your batphone ok maybe not
i think the ops ideas have merit and ive seen other suggstions that an activity based sov maybe the answer to the problems a structure based system introducesi loved playing the board game risk and still remember fondly the arguements gnashing of teeth and heated debate that would often ensue as temporary alliances were forged the beauty of risk was that ownership of a region was soley determined on occupany i also liked that if you occupied all of the several regions that defined specific areas such as north america you recieved bonus rewards i wonder if an eve based occupancy sov system could have this too say for constellation and regional dominationgoons gonna goon afterall intelligent and reasoned debate is somewhat lacking in their group psyche
thats actually not a bad idea i dont really see any problem with thatas i explained before you can do that but people will just jump clone out and do the same in one of your systems so it will all balance out the only counter arguments ive seen were ones where i believe my first post wasnt read properly1 pvp and other warfare activities are the most valued timezones always have some kind of overlap aswell its not like that at the exact moment eu goes to bed us logs on not logging on before that there will always be conflict of some kind2 structures are a bad thing since they only relocate the problem and dont solve it as i keep explaining they require large blobs of capitals to defend and place effectively drowning out subcap ship classes significantly as far as sov warfare goes the time commitment as in having to show up at very specific times to be effective due to reinforcement timers is also stifling and leads to less organic warfare in almost every single way aswell as posing a significant barrier of entry for anyone wanting to participate3 larger alliances would have more space but only as much as would actually be used think of this as people per system  the system works in a linear fashion not exponential so an alliance of 1000 people would be able to hold 10 times as many system as an alliance of 100 people instead of the approx disproportionally 2030 times the larger alliance can try to contest other systems with smaller alliances but this would lead to other systems being less active and this easier to take overlastly people seem to be under the impression that under this system sov should be flippable within a matter of days thats just silly sov will require a commitment to the space whether you actually want that part of space spending time and generating activity there means you cant spend it anywhere else on a per player basis i believe that this will lead to more interesting warfare in the long term since sov is no longer a matter of spamming poss and sbus with structures taking on a support role instead of a pivotal role in determining such a defining mechanic since structures still serve as staging and reinforcement points they will still act as points of interest as far as generating fights is concerned but since activity is a much larger issue small gang fights will have a much larger impact on wars they do now anything higher than 0 giving added incentive to engaging in this kind of warfare over the currently only reasons of being annoying and getting killmails killing in its own would actually serve a much more defined purpose under this system whereas now fights would be avoided entirely unless absolutely necessarym like the structure grindthat said i do genuinly appreciate yours and cynonets comments i will admit that my proposal may not be entirely sound but i dont understand why this may be just yet it may be that the truth lies somewhere in between but i dont see how retaining the mandatory structure grind is in any way productive in this issue i havent seen any definitive alternatives up to this point i really hope that theres some way to avoid structures reinforcement timers and all that jazz in the end sov needs to be much more organic to be truly fun to deal withalso i do apoligize for my somewhat derogatory tone in my quoted post
i have removed some nonconstructive trolling from this post please attack ideas not people or their corporations and alliances
i may be awake in russian or eu prime time but im certainly not available and useful for conflict this applies to many people in many other time frames scenarios in which space is flipped or fought over without the two sides ever seeing each other remain all too probable or ones where a large multitime zone alliance dominates the small single timezone through matching kill for kill in their time zone while dominating the pve factor in other time zones oryou get the ideastructures are bad for allwell for manyof these reasons yes they do not in and of themselves require large blobs of capitals to tackle large blobs of capitals are used either because theyre available or due to hostile opposition necessary and i still disagree with the notion that subcaps have no place in sov warfare or that the best solution to what issues you list that i do agree with is to burn the whole system downthis is an undeniable upside yes it is not a quality unique to your suggestions however there are many ways to place a soft limit on how much space can be held and frankly i happen to think that there are a lot of reasons for an alliance of any size to want to own more space that is not actually used such as an alliance in period basis for example absolutely requiring midpoints somewhere in either delve or querious to perform logistics runs to and from empire if theyre not friendly with those who own the space around their midpoints defending them will be hard enough as it is to say nothing of if the requirement becomes entirely one of use the space as opposed to defend hardened and static structures at a fixed time once again these are not qualities unique to your proposal think of it this way  a medieval attacker may have weakened the castle by blocking all supplies from entering and taking them for themselves but at the end of the day starving and weakened as though its defenders may be theyve still got to storm that castle as i mentioned previously i have no problem with the idea of activity tying into sov just with the idea of it being the only determining factor so perhaps in eve terms the structures are perhaps more easily taken out if the activity levels in their system are low whether thats through enemy action or simple lack of use for a concrete example placing the tcu gives you the system but the reinforcement timers for structures that have them have a large variance 6 hours perhaps increased use of the system be it ratting mining commerce in the station whatever increases the value of one or more indices all of which contribute in a finely granular way to the sovereignty level one such benefit of a higher sovereignty level attained this way could be the placement of another structure of suitably not too high but not too low hp that gives one finer control over defensive timers
nope not supported plex prices are subject to the player driven economy excluding impact from the release of siezed plex by ccp or by increased supply from ccp offers in exchange for rl cashnote that according to a recent article on noseygamers blog there appears to be a direct correlation between the success of rmt operations and low plex in game prices so in this respect high plex prices kick rmters in the gonads something that i hope everyone welcomesalso i hate grinding missions or whatever for isk so for players like myself a high plex  isk exchange rate is very attractive
1 kill pod2 chance for corpses to drop3 pick up corpses4 biomass facility in a station that can refine corpses for a fee5 if corpses had implants chance to drop implants or lesser implantsif this idea has been posted please ignore
this has been posted before proposal salvaging corpses for implantsproposal corpses and implantsand more a couple comments 1 i would always have a corpse drop some people like me collect corpses and i have many many corpses 2 this would hurt lp stores as lp is the primary source of most implants depending on the drop rate you may nerfing a significant lp to isk conversion item used by fw incursioners and mission runners

yeah been suggested before and really recycling implants is a pretty boring and underwhelming way to make use of the idea make corpse harvesting a new industrial activity which provides unique materials roleplay technobabble about how capsuleer biomatter is a required product for the control interfaces of certain new shipclasses and modules for example and it would be much more fitting approach to take
so ive been lurking and watching this topic ever since i suggested that dughan take his suggestions to the forum since im tired of hearing about it i just got done laughing at how he mocks someones reading comprehension and then fails in reading comprehension a few minutes later the great flavor text debateat this point i think he needs a little bit of help032730 dughan beltayn  and my whole point is i should be able to change the appearance of ships because they suckmaybe that gives you guys a better indication of what hes really trying to say
im glad this idea is being discussed by ccp at the very least looking forwarding to hearing back in the future throwing in my support
1 to both the op and betolis post great work guysjust a couple of small questions from me would the ov filters also carry over to the dscan results this could be really useful would there be an option to easily transfer ov settings between cor
1 with terraforming version b or a modified ain its current state terraforming makes no sense so you have a class m world you destabilize it and suddenly you have other minerals present that wherent there before to mine  it does make some sense 
i have plenty of ideas on how to rebalance drones though they were thought up before these changes were even announced never the less they are still quite valid
one of the reasons i like the proposal is that it would encourage alliances formed from corporations in different timezones this would naturally lead to greater alliance inclusivity rather than them being divided upon ethnic grounds or dominated by one single entitity within the alliance imho the proposal is winwin in that not only would it encourage more widespread pvp in sov null but would also increase social interaction within the playerbase
how about eve starting to make some fin sense  1 what the is bump mechanics anyway  the magical push of a ship by another through sheer willpower  pixiedust 2 the station exit mechanics is a sad joke especially in cases such as 44 50 ships flying overlapped until one moves out of the convergence bubble then if you steer you bump in to the bubble and bounce off this is just a workaround for not implementing any decent physics into the game the above is just like saying that broken mechanic a cant be fixed because mechanic b is broken also yes both where workarounds from the start instead of implementing a sound system its the easy way out the cheap fast way where ships are nothing more than bounceboxes in the enginehow about a revolutionary approach to gamedesign if you have 2 halfbaked systems in the game fix both1 ship collisionshields will push back against shields  at small speeds and similar mass the ships will slowly push each other away except if they are intentionally fly towards each other  shields will be drained by this just like any projectilebeam hitting the shieldif the speed exceeds what the shield can push back  ships will crash into each other resulting in serious damage to both  depending on the mass of eachfor example a frig flying full mwd into a freighter will be a fly on the windshield wishwash gonea battleship ramming the same freighter at full mwd will result in the bs going boom and the freighter loosing  10 shield and  30 armor  10 hullthe pod of the rammer also going poof in both casesyes this will make highsec ganking cheaper and easier2 avoiding ship collisions  station exitsstation exits are actually very easy to fixstations are big actually huge why not having them 58 exits instead of only 1  version 1 more realistic and more difficult to implement properly each station has 58 exits ships are sent out through them in roundrobin with a timer on each so that no ship is sent through the same hole in less than 5 seconds maybe 10  needs some testingversion 2 cheaper will prolly be favoured by ccp just like stargates place ships at random points in a random 20km radius of the station  problem solvedavoiding collisions while the safety is on your ship will automatically try to avoid collisions  if your ship is on a collision course with a ship less than 5000m away it will breaksteer away of the object if a ship is on a collision course with you your ship will try to get out of the waymove away from the incoming ship 3 possible fix for increased ease of ganking if you intentionally safety off ram accelerate into another ship in highsec and cause serious over 50 damage to either ships concord suspends your flight license for 30 15  days leaving you unable to undock from the station in which your clone is  the first station you dock into in addition if you dont dock you also get a 5 min counter  warning to do so if you dont you become suspect for the duration of 3015 days or until you dockand im sure the above solutions will also uncover other bad mechanics in place to which i say fix them too keeping bad mechanics because fixing them will cause problems with other bad mechanics is not valid argument
currently when scanning in known space you must scan an unknown signature all the way down to 75 strength in order to figure out if its a wormhole or some sort of combat complex this makes life harder for everyone scanning in hs as the population of explorers that are highly interested in combat complexes is generally fairly distinct from those who are highly interested in wormholes moving wormholes into a wormhole group similar to how a ladar or a mag has a distinct group in the scanner ui and perhaps renaming the existing unknown to combat would make life easier for everyone wouldnt it
i will agree with that how abou to add capicator usage of these cloak modules or remove the autorepeat ability
ecstatic 1 from me these are great ideas and would make the overview much more useful and accessible ccp do it
indeed i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i think drones are unbalanced in only one regard cost prices are way to high to just be throwing away drones these days to balance the cost ccp could either seed more t2 drone bpos or lower the production costof course if you want cheap drones you could always come down to lowsec and scoop up the drones people leave on gates
exactly right  as a droneboat l4 mission runner i like the improved npc ai  it makes missions a bit more challenging it just takes some creativity to come up with new tactics ive found this approach to be especially effective  i think someone suggested something similar earlier in this forum
you might reason that it is actually the returning of the escrow that is brokenif somebody tries to sell to a buy order but it fails due to insufficient funds of the buyer he is at default to my knowledge when this happens the order is removed and the 23 at mt 5 escrow is returned to the buyer this is wrong the escrow should be given to the damaged party the party willing to sell without the seller having to deliver any of the requested goods this way he is partially compensated for the fraud and he can try to sell the goods to orders that do go throughmt scams will be more riskfull and it might trigger the creation of a new profession mt scam bustersin order to not completely penalizing honest traders the change could include a 1 x day notice period in which the buyer is emailed that he is is at default and has limited time to get the extra money in order to get the goods that he wanted however he should not be able to changecancel the order any more
escrow funds in this game are a weird thing first they are used up first meaning if i place a buy order for 4 items and 25 is put into escrow i can sell myself one of those items to empty the escrow funds and then i still have a buy order up for 3 more of those funds then i transfer isk away and the margin trade scam is working the same as it is now
 0 to this request first thing i did after launching eve for the very first time was turn the music off
so we shouldnt post ideas and new suggestions because ccp should of thought of it alreadyi fully support this topic and hope ccp gives it some special consideration because eve online could be a more immersible experience and pi feel less meaningless i also think if csms arent going to take new game ideas seriously they should be csms just an opinion
best mindfrack evayou have my support
heres what i saw one person suggest and i think it can be a fullproof solutionwhat if instead of changing npc ai to target drones they would just remove the aggression factor on drones so you have to activate them manuallythis would remove the sit and wait in order to make all players earn their isk with hard work make drones effective again i agree with the npc switching target i disagree to the drones being targeted  are the ships not balanced between weapons and drones  if yes then let them be used as suchi hope this gets to ccp

i here by announce my theory to brighten the future as dim as the thread at current may be and redirect your attention now smart gadget its quick its smooth it involves human contact you have ship  human and get to  whatever your standing causes because of common goals and enemies im talking tracking devices to distress beacons pilots that can make insane jumps into uncharted space and make an sos here to help sure i am because i have what gadgets it takes to respond to such a signature you can get anything as long as you ask for it nicely is the golden rule i was brought up in this world with i always turned off my oven when i wasnt cooking and for it ive never burned down my house you have weapons aid jettisons thermal resists and even names like bell now dont think there would be a problem arming us with some more would you its not like running from a dam in 15 minutes is necessary but its better to keep resists on the mind than your location in spacethere may be love for ecm eccm control of drones and awesome vindicator technology but is it hard to dedicate time to making what makes us fly personally what makes someone fly is a pilot and their wings a compressed stock and its advantages by the executives call where ever that may lead you you still feel a cold because not everything thought of is there if i were to come back into this game i would want it to look like july 4th the day of freedom the day of the brave the day of rust what you could salvage from this is what technology could be flared into your mind right now the more than what this has already lead you to believe we have what else can you think of what will take it from here to in there what might save us a little more from an incoming attack what could put the fires out a little faster petition to start educating towards smart technology
im sorry ive read this four times your proposal is what
its to bring new gadgets into the game to use as another category in the mainframe like a tracking device which in all cases would be most efficient if the idea being step 1 use an interior ship mainframe was enabled you goodpetition to start educating towards smart technology
im good im fantastic even howre you
what if instead of changing npc ai to target drones they would just remove the aggression factor on drones so you have to activate them manuallythis would remove the sit and wait in order to make all players earn their isk with hard work make drones effective again i agree with the npc switching target i disagree to the drones being targeted  are the ships not balanced between weapons and drones  what they have done with missions is once again ccp trying to put an empty gun to our heads and force us to do null incursions but what ccp doesnt realize is we already know the barrel is empty and we casual players are the backbone of the eve market its why theres still 45000 players online at any given time if ccp doesnt take up this resolution then by next expansion you can expect only 6000 being online at any given time so ccp your gun is very shiny and threatening but im holding the selfdestruct button and i can take us both out 
confirming that repeatedly pressing f1 is hard work and eve needs more of iti think they did that with the followup patchi dont believe you even have 39000 accounts but on the off chance you actually do can i has your stuffz
drone aggression is a good thingtwo changes to make it better for the player1 show when a drone is being targeted make the drones in space bar flash with the individual drone highlighted this saves the drone and gives you a chance to get it home before it pops2 show the background of the drone as a bar that fills up with aggression when full the drone will be targeted  i am sure this number exists in the code already  this means you can tell what drone is in danger before it is targeted and possible switch targets so the aggression comes back to you
still doesnt solve the issue of drones being targeted the moment you throw them out from my experience when the rats flashes yellow it normally means they have potential of switching targets to your drones the problem is you can wait an hour for the rats to switch from flashing yellow to flashing red but even when they all flash red theyll still go after drones if your drones gets even close to a pack
i agree that he number one hindrance with drones right now is the first sign of them being targeted is when they take damage currently if i deploy heavy drones they are half dead before getting to the targetit makes sense for the rats to target drones first what do we do when you see a drone boat in pvp personally i take out his weapons first hull later if the drones are ecm than they are an even bigger threat as they prevent me from doing other thingsfix it so we can better manage our drones and the understand the aggro they generate then we can balance how  when they get targetededitas i understand it the npc ai hates ecm with a vengeance equipping a target painter or ecm module may help to keep them targeted on you not confirmed just a thought
well maybe a noob would kill the drones in pvp but every expert pvper knows you take out the ship first kill the ship you kill the drones drones are almost impossible to kill with standard weapons the time it takes to kill the drones youll already be dead in pvp you should always know you kill the most dangerous ship first as quickly as possible or youre whole fleet is already dead those who has the 1st tackle are usually the ones that wins the fight
there is one very simple fix for this it would not only eliminate the margin trading scam except for the excessively lazy but would improve the margin trading functionality for the traders that use it as intended add a show info for market orders this would allow you to view stats of the order such as the available escrow total units of the original order blocks of goods sold to the order and possibly if the traders who placed the order has enough isk available in the appropriate wallet to cover the order if the escrow is not sufficient this would not need to show the owners wallet balance but only a greenred icon to indicate in the required funds are covered any time you see an order you are not sure or suspicious about you can check the info to see if it is a valid order or not not only would this expose scam orders but allow you to double check larger orders to make sure they will not fail before completing them this would benefit the trader who owns the order by allowing the order to show it would fail if the owners wallet drops to low while they are offline allowing the order to stay active and be available once the owners wallet recovers it is not like this would be a major inconvenience you do not have to show info on every order unless you are ocd paranoid but will allow you to double check any suspect orders for example if i placed a constellation wide order for 100000000 units of tritanium with a 100000 minimum buy and i have margin trading trained to 4 i have no intention of this order to fail but as the escrow is limited there is a chance my buy orders could fill before my sell orders rather than have my order fail and come back the next day to a limited amount of trit and have to place another order potential clients could view the stats of the order and not sell to it until my wallet recovered giving the order an increased chance of completion better for me and better for the client that would have suffered a failed order otherwise at the same time any true margin trading scam would be transparent and an obvious scam to anyone who bothered to check the info on the order as a result margin trading as it was intended to work is actually improved while margin trading scams are all but eliminated
it would make life easier and thats exactly why it shouldnt be done

1 from me great idea
totally agrees with you this change suck so much i cannot find wordsif the afk farmers are the problem change the missions  complexes  anomalies so you have more freqvent spawns that initially go after the drones instead of having the npc switch target so ofteni use a droneboat as you probably understand and while some sites  missions etc is not to bad some are horrible combined with the nerf i have seen in faction loot  bpc many of the hard good and rewarding sites i did before i actually dont find worth doing anymorein some sites my dps have probably been cut with 5070 since i have to refit armor rep in highslots and even then constantly pull drones in and out during the site in some sites i cannot even target the drone to rep it before i have to pull them in ofc using sentriesusing my old ratting ship is not fun anymore it actually make me not want to playease up on the drone aggro and change the sites with more frekvent spawns instead that is my 2 cents
we need some better understanding on why they switch targetsi know there was an update to what sizes of npc will target what size or drones  frigate  light etc understanding what types of ewar or remote rep will draw aggro away from the primary will make a big difference for us
same issue here i have this 12 billion isk gila and had a lot of fun with it the last year and this single change rendered it almost useless and i am this short from hitting the quit buttonthis is already known target painters and ecm seem to have a much higher aggro keeping npcs on you but if a is bad and b nullifies a then this is not a solution for a but more a kind of an exploit for a badly implemented feature a target painter or ecm is not supposed to save your drones it is supposed to increase your damagereduce incoming damage
there is no problem with everyone having a bounty nuff siad
i suggest that the bounty system be reformed as followspeople i do like should be able to freely put bounties on anyone i dont likepeople i dont like should be unable to put bounties on anyone i do likethis is the only possible way to have a fair bounty system and of course it will help new players
scale the wanted sign on the portrait with security status of individual  current size could be 100 one third that for 00 and half again for 5biggest problem is that has bounty is not ticked by default in ov settings since everyone has one now i had a hell of a time lost a ship to wt figuring out why stuff didnt show properly
first reasonable idea ive heard wrt to the wanted signsi would have np with this if it was easily coded i have no clue
i suppose thats good to hear im well thankspetition to start educating towards smart technology

im quite sure that youre not so bad at pvp that you need to pick on the noobs pbut if that is how you want to spend your money and your repthis is a sandbox after all
do it up id like to give these missions a try 1 supporting either option
da dom and anjuan jacksonthank you both for supporting this proposal please promote and refer this proposal to other capsuleersdmc
and a target painter does increase your damage and ecm does reduce incoming fireadapt or die everyone must agree that pre retribution npc ai was terrible it wasnt actually intelligent now its a little more challenging its no longer a warp in get aggro from group a wait till drones kill all the things get aggro from group b let drones kill all the things etcchange your fitting fly differently fly in groups adapt to the new npc ai
pretty sure the entire point was to make npcs more intelligent have them switch targets kill your drones etcie working as intendedweve dealt with this in wormhole space for years and mission npcs are nowhere near as difficult as sleepers so whats the problem
1000 agree with op i am losing 12 drones per mission and i do not afk at all sometimes i drop drones and lose one within seconds totally lame honestly i feel for any drone boat pilots i will not be training drones from this point forward i will also be only using drones i loot from missions as replacements for my lost ones
that i spent 6214415 skillpoints on training drones which have just been rendered useless by a single patchas i have a solid amount of skillpoints in gunnery and other ships than drone ships allows me to switch to my vargur and kill them the other way but someone who doesnt have that much skills and completely focused on a drone ship is now pretty much screwedyou are implying that all of ccps changes are final and they never make mistakes which is both  luckily  not the case i consider this change a mistake and so do many others and a mistake needs to be fixedthere are several ways to fly missions you are describing the droneafk version which is easy if done right but has the drawback of costing a lot of time if you calculate the iskh flying a drone ship vs a gunship that gunguy will make twice or three times as much money so the droneafks are already penalized by having a lower income i dont see a need to fix that any furtherbesides all you need to do is to stare at the targeting and hover your hand over the drone recall button this isnt challenging this is just tedious and whether or not your drones survive depend solely on factors like lag and drone reaction unless your personal reaction time is incredibly lowif npcs tomorrow stop targeting minmatar ships and instantly kill every other factions ships as soon as they enter a mission would you still say the same
he just said its not useless nor a problem im a drone pilot and i fly in wh space it isnt always about keeping an eye on your drones as much as it is knowing when to launch them and what target to attack with them through my time in wh space nearly a year ive lost maybe 20 drones to sleepers in addition you can tip the scales to your side with almost any kind of ewar if you can spare a slot for almost anything like remote reps web a warp disruptor target painter ect it will give you targeting priority over your dronesthat being said if you launch 5 drones and there are 15 frigs 10 cruisers and 8 bs on the field you are probably going to lose one or more of them now if you remove most if not all the frigs then launch drones there is less of a chance of them getting quickly destroyed
maybe ccp can fix it customizable game rule sets and corp servers i suggest april 1st as eta for the release date

im tired of fighting organised fleets of what the eve storyline calls friendly allies since the last big fw patch we have seen many gallente fleets who because of the new purple colourtag dont show up on the overview randomly attack minmatar militia while trying to fight amarr or deplex and hold minmatar systemsit is  ridiculousit is one thing when individuals do this but seeing organised corporations and alliances doing this is totally against the core storyline of eve and tantamount to an exploit by larger groups to remove thenselves from your combat overviewproposaljust like minmatar who shoot minmatar gallente and minmatarcaldari and amarr militias should incur the same massive faction hit for shooting each other
incorrect sir we are the core storyline of eve not the other way aroundfaction standings hits for shooting friendly militias reasonable requestsupported
go to the grocery store get some food get to the counter try to pay for your food find out that your spouse used your card to pay a bill so you dont have enough to buy the groceriesobviously the store should be able to keep a portion of the price of the groceries that you attempted to buy out of your account even though you are not leaving the store with any groceries doesnt that make sense because that is what you are proposing here
no it isnt what you told is an example for sell orders not for buy orders for this example to be anything like the eve buy order thing he wouldve had to tell the store to deliver some stuff to his house promising a certain amount of payment for it and we were already discussing half a thread ago why real world stores dont like to do this when anonymity of the supposed buyer is involved

confirming that this is a big kerfuffle over almost nothing if you arent sentryrangedependent simply swap an otl for a painter as mentioned earlier also remote reps are good at getting the attention of the sleeper ai too
this doesnt even matter i ran the assault mission level 4 today with a target painter and remote repper on one of my senties and had to keep recalling them over and over because targets still switched to them i would like to be able to use heavies again and regular drones but i dont think that is a good idea at this point which is sad because i just got done training for these
well to be fair mission really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really suck took me forever to get level 4s and that was simply so i could get jump clones now i never do them just too damn boring
1 as an obviously needed update along with the pos systemhowever realize that to go in and deal with that very old code is extremely difficult and time consuming hence it gets put on the back burnergreaterinsightskillknowledge
if heavy drones are no longer feasible then drones are imbalancedpretty simple
i am surprised how many people agree that drones now die a lot faster some of them are situationally no longer usable and you need to exploit the ai using a target painter or ecm but then still say this is finei sometimes get this feeling that no matter how obviously something is wrong there will be always someone saying it is fine just deal with it i think it is because i am more of that problemsolver type than the problemaccepter type
this
uh what lets see here so im supposed to let their ecm drones jam me out so i cant shoot them im supposed to let the carrier ive tackled kill me before reinforcements get there im supposed to not kill their drones as im kiting them to do just that and bring their dps down to near nilright got it im now an expert pvpero
if you see an order you are not sure or suspicious about should you take a step back and decide if you want to risk buying goods and attempting to fulfill it i mean you have doubts because there is risk in the transaction why should that risk be removed you currently can accept the risk and attempt to fulfill the order or leave it alone of you think the risk is too much please explain why ccp should remove the risk by providing you a green light when there is money behind an order and a red light when there isnt also most take out restaurants operate using anonymous buy orders and most other wholesale industries operate using nonanonymous buy orders i do not support fixing the margin trade to remove the risks involved in moving goods to buy orders i do support adding more info to the game by a the creation of financial analysis agents and market analysis agents this allows you to follow money and opens up lots of metagaming opportunities b remove the character anonymity from buysell orders if you can right click and show character info on the corp or character that owns the buysell orders you can use social media to identify scammers etc this creates lots of interesting potential solutions that dont involve dumbing down the game
scanning have never been easier  yet whines continue
while your at it ask for a dropdown menu for the dscan range i get tired of having to copypaste
they had this prototyped years ago
i agree that the pve of this game is not one of its strongpoints it could be made better maybe with work but that is a bit otnow for drone aggroother mmos have abilities that can reduce or wipe aggro my suggestion is this why not have some drone control module that can temporarily reduce signature of the drone or some module that lets the drone discreetly target or have the ai of the drone know when it is about to die and automatically return to drone bayi am not to the point where i can reliably do the high level missions yet but i do hear on teamspeak mates complain it is annoying
there are some concerns with a mechanic like this but i love it who hasnt seen a space drama where some cavalier space captain hasnt said i know its risky but full speed ahead were gonna ram them no captain youre mad do it im your captain and i gave you an orderanyways 1 for the idea
so that means hybrid turrets are imbalanced because medium hybrid turrets suck more than a thousand stabbers named purdy
very simplejust like the resculpt for plex this will be remove skills for plexfor a plex you can remove your unwanted skills ie mining all planet management trade skills etcyou do not get reimbursement of skill pointsyou do not get reimbursement of skill book pricesthe system already has a check to see if you can inject a skill it will not let you if there is a prerequisitejust reverse that order  have it not let you remove a skill that is needed for another skillif by chance you want to train that skill you removed then buy the skill book  skill it againjust a few examplesinjecting a skill without fully knowing what it does just to find out you didnt understand itmining ii comes with new character and is completely worthless on combat altlike me you are ocdtried pi didnt like it want it gone to keep you from trying it again me againbought a character off forum some skills on there that you dont likeyour nyx coffin alt had there drone bay nerfed  you cant use regular dronesthis will probably never happen butwould be just another use of plex since ccp likes to find ways of using them up
why would anyone ever do this
answer me this  why would anyone ever spend a plex to resculptanswer because they can if they wanted toosame would apply to removing unwanted skills because they want tooi for one thinks it is a waste of a plex to resculpt but i guess there were enough people that would do it for ccp to add it to the gamei have three alts that i would gladly pay a plex each to be able to remove some skills from themif ccp did this i bet they would consume more plexes with this then the resculpting
paying 600 mil or 15 bux to downgrade your character i have no idea why anyone would be stupid enough to do this or why youd even want thishow about plex for account removal d
same question as above why would anyone pay 600 mil or 15 bux to resculpt it does nothing for you waste of isk or rl moneyalso i am not downgrading my character because i want to remove the followingall industry skillsall planet management skillsall trade skillssome science skillsi am actually cleaning my character up from all the nonsense that i will never ever use again once again it is my choice to do it why do you care
not to mention high profile members of alliances sometimes get their accounts hacked so this is a terrible idea deal with your ocd some other way buy a jar of mice and smash one every time you get annoyed that you cant micromanage something
that is bad logic if an account is hacked  proven to be hacked ccp can reverse everything so no loss thereso if a high profile members of alliance get account hacked  the hacker uses a plex to resculpt the character do you not think ccp could reverse it
because its a useless feature that would detract dev man hours from things that actually do need fixing
they spent who knows how many hours puting in plex for resculpting and this does nothing toofurthermore like i said in post above everything is already ingame to do itskills are already removed from you when you lose a t3 ship or get podded in a lower sp clonethe injection of a skill is check to see if there is a prerequisite just reverse that checknot much to do to implement this if a ccp dev came on  said this is impossible without lots of work then i would understandyou do not know that it would take or detract dev man hours p
resculpt is a vanity issue i may change how i look in real life and decide to make my avatar matchyour idea is like saying gee i havent done algebra in 5 years i should pay a surgeon to remove that part of my brainas for as isk sink there are many better ideas out there for it
if the devs can install this quickly and easily let them if it takes longer than an hour its not worth the effort in my opinion by the way anyone that actually spends plex to remove skillpoints from there character is a moron but i see no problem helping morons be morons thats pretty much how we end up with rorquals spamming the jump button on lowsec gates
then i am here to tell everyone that i must be a moron 3 times over because i would pay for the plex on 3 different alts right nowbut then again i did try to jump a rorqual thru a gate once
remove skills would be a vanity issue i may decide that pi is a waste of my time and decide to make my skill sheet matchgee i havent got laid in 5 years i should pay a surgeon to remove that wart on my faceactually eve online is set far far into the future we have clones that we can jump to on the other side of the universeoh wow each of these clones can have different hardwirings in their head so not much to stretch that you could remove some skills if no longer needed
yes but vanity by definition is for others to look ati cannot see your skill points and even if i could i would wonder why a x year old pilot only has x skill points this means you were inactive for a potion of time or a really poor player and didnt train to your attribute skillsthis is why implants are important they allow you to shift your attributes without remappingnow in terms of vanity i would pay a plex to have a jump clone with a different face think resculpt on a clone by clone basis no name change no attribute difference just a different face to look at it may be a headache for cpps servers but i think the delayed portrait thing is already in place
i dont see the point not supporting
wow talk about crazy ocd
well i can see a point ill try to be the devils advocate herewhen i started my character certain skills came with it and i had no choice in the matter we still dont with somemy character is pure pvp but there are 2 skills that came with birth mining and industry both are at level 1 meaning a grand total of 500 sp i can honestly say i would pay to remove those 2 skills i can see the issue the op has but my thought on balance and consequences sees the need for large limits on just what skills you could remove and how much sp each one holdsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
why i just dont understand why you would remove skillpoints let alone pay to remove sp these are the images that come up in my mind a hack account destroy pilots skillpoint pool very harmfulb ransom pilot and force them to remove sp to save their ship this is pretty funny actuallyc extremely vane aesthetics this is either extremely ocd andor just stupidand really any skillpoints you have are part of your characters history have a pvp pilot with some indy background so what if you have mining iii and indy iii from your early stages of playing so what need an rp reason to have those skills easy i know how to rollerskate i havent done it in 20 years but i still know how i never skated regularly but occasionally i went to kid socials at the skating ring birthday parties whatever make up a backstory that explains why you have indy 1 and mining 1 maybe you played with mining lasers as a toddlerpod i honestly just cant imagine how this is worthy of developer time i put this idea on par with allow me to wiggle my finger i dont want to be able to do anything by wiggling my finger and its important to note that noone will ever see me wiggle my finger but lets waste dev time on making it so i can wiggle my finger i really just dont understand this request and unless you can give me a decent reason i just dont support taking dev time away from revamping sov revamping poss revamping ships revamping wis revamping industry or the 1000 papercuts that truly improve the game
security status isnt really relevant to bounties though  james 315 for example has positive sec status but well over a billion isk on his head in bountiesi do support the idea of having a filter to only show the wanted above a userset threshold though
sorry man but you are using the fact that you got scammed to try and get margin trading removedthis is a useful skill that any station trader will use every day to broaden his market groups some days certain modules move more than others margin trading is a way to spread your bets across multiple market groups and increase your chances of obtaining goods and selling them the fact that people are abusing a mechanic is no excuse to remove it there is hundreds of mechanics being exploited daily and if youve played any other mmo you know that you will never be rid of exploits and you can avoid being a victim of this abuse by paying attention to what the hell you are doing with your wallet to quote ccp here eve is real and i doubt youd sign a contract in real life without at least thinking about it or asking the contractor a few questions about it would youapproach eve contracts the same way
just a minor thing but it has been bugging me for oh so longif you want to check your mission status to see if you completed your objective which can be kind of vague for certain missions atm you have to open your journal and read mission detailscould we please get an additional status in the mission journal so that when all objectives for a mission have been completed the mission status changes to completed it saves having to open another pointless windowand while youre at it could the mission objectives and their status be displayed in the little mission hud thing below the start system info
yeah i want the jukebox back as well scannings just not the same without itcries
i have played eve for almost 5 years june 27 2007 and i for one enjoyed the music and have many memories of pvp and pve with some of the tunes on it i also had some of my own on there all in all why was it removed it wasnt hurting anyone or anything for some myself included it held fond times of the good ol days 1bring it back really you added a dumdarse spin counter for the station spinners now wheres the jukebox
jsomething box bake noa
let there be bounce
up again
once again why would someone waste a plex to rescuplta ccp can reverse any account that is deemed to be hacked  non issueb you want to ransom me to remove my skillpoints ok i will do it but first let me dock up so i can buy a plexc this one is just a plain stupid responseonce again none that has posted can say that it would take more time to implement this then did the resculptall the code for it is already in the game just takes some tweakingplus once again this is a another way for ccp to remove plex from the game helps their bottom lineof course there are more important features to add or revamp not saying to drop all of them for this
i bet a plex i am not the only one in eve with crazy ocd p
i think this idea has merit but as a nice middle ground at least a percentage of the sp should be allowed to be reallocated deffo not all of it but a percentage this would more than likely give enough people pause before going through with the process i know i have a few skills that i would like to see go away but i did spend time on themthat shouldnt be 100 wastedevery time i post is pardy time 3
absolutely not i would allow people to remove sp for free to be honest but i wouldnt allow them to redistribute them

resculpting gives a benefit though making your character worse by any standardreally doesnt
would clone cost be one of those standards
this thread has officially failed at progressive discussion and compromise every time i post is pardy time 3
this statement really doesnt make any sense at all it is so much nonsense its not worth a replylets get back on topic again everyone reread my original postthen lets please discuss its pros  cons with some thought
there was a long and bloody battle between the caldari and the gallente faction it is clear that the caldari elite understand by now that freedom is stronger than oppression however the real fighting was done by our volunteer pilots and their allied counterparts the organization of the gallente militia was simply outstanding the men and women that enlisted and the ace corporations that lead them have achieved what we always knew would happen freedom of oppression victoryour pilots suffered heavy losses the caldari proved to be an oponent to respect but at the end our pilots have pushed them all the way back and have conquered all of the systems in the name of freedomtherefore our pilots should at least be rewarded for their courage dedication execution and their victory an award would mean a lot to them the pilots involved in the fighting are entitled to a medal of highest honor so they can proudly show them to any future opponentwe showed already once that freedom is stonger than oppression and we are not afraid to show it again if anyone tries to prove otherwiseit is clear that the many of the caldari did the right choice giving up the dirty fight for the caldari wealthy elite we salute you for that we are also aware of the guerilla tactics and operations that are being undertaken against us as we speak and our pilots are everywhere spread out trying to deal with the situationso let our pilots have such an honor let them show that victory has been achieved by gallente for freedom and peace let them wear such a medal so the remaining caldari fighting for a hopeless cause can clearly see that we have already won and we will never quit to fight for freedom and we are ready to die trying to defend itgallente pres spokesman degaulle

the few fights i was involved in thruout the total time gallente were taking systems was so freaking fun caldari fought hard and they tried their hardest a reward would be awsome for those who deserve it long live the federationchin drum king salty
fair is fair cant give it one faction for winning all the systems and then not give it to another faction for doing the same
i did not participate in any offensive fighting  i just want to congratulate all pilots who fought brave and fought welli do not need any other award  and i surely did not deserve one  than knowing that the right thing prevailed

far too much of a pain to code and too much overhead to be worth it it really wouldnt add anything to the game itd just be annoying to work around gameplay  realism
i agree with mxzfthis would kill the serversjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
whats the point of that other than to annoy it will be the same as walking in station time and resource consuming how about they first finish fixing so many broken ships sov npc sov pos system minerals mining etc
seconded this is eve not a spaceflight simulator
margin trading is a v ery needed skill to anyone that goes deep into marketing proffession as for a fix  it still need the right plan to do a scam with it  so if you are taking by fool when you try to do some fast profit  then accept the fact that someone was more clever than you and you fall into his scam next time be more carefull or if you got what it takes do the same
how totally arrogant as well as presumptuous and how wrong you at ccp can be to say wardecs have been fixedhere is one basic example of how it is not just broken but totally incompetently impotentgroup of say 810 ice miners mining away for arguments sake using their main chars who are all in another player corp or npc corp lots of almost unlimited isk whether they bot or not is irrelevant at this point they are in it for massive isk returns not simply a reasonable quota to fuel a pos or two they might own but to fund wardecs they then form up a separate small player corp of alts and use that as the front corp to wardec any and all small and medium corps  alliances and with that level of isk flowing in from their mining chars they can fund permanently a wardec on small and medium corps or alliances you cannot know for sure who they really are as they are in effect invisible it could take months years or never to find out whom the main chars really are to deal with them leaving aggressed corp players to endlessly chip away at only alts ad infinitum with no way to ever effectively get to the end of an infinite and infinitely funded wardec also if and itUFFFDs a big if you do by some freak chance discover who the main chars are and you find they are in an npc corp the only alternative is the suicide gank process so why even have a wardec process in the first place if you leave embarrassingly glaring gaping loop holes like that if i was was a patient in hospital i would hate to think that ccp were the doctors fixing me i would rather be treated by a vet and you say you all play the game same as us mortals and are in touch with it sorry but you are not in the same world as the rest of usjeez
i noticed this looking over dust stuff and it bothered mein rp noone seems to be blameless in the struggles between the empiresright now gallente and minmatar are crushing their enemies in fw amarr and caldari need a bit of a boost if anythingwhen i look at the descriptions of the empires the words that are pushed the hardest for each empire make gallente and minmatar out as the epitome of all that is good and noble and apple pie while portraying caldari and amarr as evil dictatorial slaversamarr has been making a lot of strides toward ending slavery we have nice people we do good things really we do we honestly arent any worse than the old british empirecaldari are hardworking and independent people theyre big on collective action and the good of the many and theyre fighting for their independencemeanwhile you have gallente which is always portrayed as good and noble and wonderful gallente would never invade anyone they just have humanitarian police actions and occupy planets and assist them to set up peaceful democratic governments by the people that somehow are always run by a gallente representative and perfectly echo the will of the gallente government thats known as imperialism where im fromand minmatar is all about reclaiming their heritage thats fine and dandy but they dont seem to mind being repressive and whatnot while they do it and they seem like theyre a lot more concerned with recreating their traditions than they are with you know feeding their people or having a coherent government systempeople like to be the good guys and they flock to the good side and id appreciate it if the people who wrote the descriptions for each empire would work harder to try to muddy the issue of which of the empires was which on the material that people first see
whats that true slavei cant hear you over all this freedom
its pretty hard to put a positive spin on an empire whos policy is literally we will invade your planet and enslave your people because god told us to its all very well saying theyre taking strides to end it but theres still the whole seven hundred years of oppression for us minmatarr and the full third of us still in chains
minmatar is pretty good at being oppressive to its own people on occasion and theres more to amarr than lol slavery thatd be a bit like deciding that australia should be described as needing to be nuked into oblivion at every possible opportunity because of their ideas about the kyoto protocol its taking a whole culture and stereotyping it by one single issue and portraying it as evil based on that when in actuality every empire has some things about it that are admirable and some things about it that make its enemies justifiably think theyre scum i dont want it to be amarr is great and wonderful i just want it to be portrayed as grey vs grey instead of good vs evil
im pretty sure youre playing a different game than me
well thats because it is imperialism vide longe er eros di luminaire vii uni canse pra krage e determiniex sange por sange descanse bravex eros mie freires mortir por vostre liberete farmilie ide e amis lons proviste sen mort luminaire liber mas
and by extension an invasionthough youre quoting stuff that i dont believe ive seen before got a source i dont doubt the liberation invasion thing but youre making  up with the mary sue bit
it just seems that amarr and caldari are portrayed as the bad guys in character generation and gallente and minmatar are portrayed as the good guys every game that ive seen that had a good side and an evil side the evil side was completely outnumbered and lo and behold we have winmatar and we have gallente celebrating owning every fw systembut it seems like it isnt nearly as cut and dried and if someone wants to be dashing and heroic id like them to have to stop and have to make a real judgement call on where to go instead of just waffling between democracy or freedom and passing slavers and dictatorial by every empire should be described by a mix of virtues and flaws they stand for these great things buuuut they also do this nasty awful thing
well if youre a western liberal an empire built on slavery and an empire built on social darwinism is going to be seen as bad guys because these belief systems are offensive to us you are simply imposing your rl western beliefs on the game where only one of four faction could be considered westernalso when the caldari won all the systems in 2009 there were lamentations about procaldari bias from ccp your point is redundant
except that in character generation thats pretty much the only thing that you read about them the races get a little snippet and there is a biasold lots of education but slaves okaytough strong driven but dictatorial okaybrave and champions of liberty and democracy and on the other hand wait im not seeing anything to dislike in thispoor minmatar to have suffered so much and they are such awesome people on the other hand yeah these guys dont have anything written here to either appeal to the blackhearted or to give the heroic pause eitherthats really all i want is for these to be evened out a bit mention the valklears or something
you really cant expect introductory paragraphs to be that indepth when i read that all empires are portrayed as having good qualitiesbut i can tell from this that you like democracy dislike slavery dislike ruthlessness what if i dont like democracy like slavery and like ruthlessness especially that the latter tends to get stuff done far quickerthere wouldnt be any issue of bias at all this is all perspective
i also saw good qualities in all of them but only two were portrayed as having bad qualitiesplease list a few englishlanguageprimary speaking countries which have a positive reaction to slavery and dictatoreven dictators dont want to hear the word dictator its highly loaded plus it doesnt even seem to be the most accurate term available caldari seems to push for excellence and upward mobility within the system and that is antithetical to dictatorship caldari is conformist strict and even authoritarian to a certain extent but it isnt exactly a dictatorship per sewere it not for the minmatar problem amarrs stance on slaves would barely be worth mentioning its not worse than any of the other dystopic stuff thats going on elsewhere that doesnt get brought upi didnt see any words in the gallente description with negatives to most people they didnt work in hedonistic sybaritic or presumptuous for instance and as noted there are aspects to the minmatar that are less than positive  just indicating what the valklears are puts a bit of an edge on them for instance
while i agree the initial reaction to slavery is negative that is due only to our preexisting views slavery in the empire is a completely different thing than that of the british empire or modern societyslavery in amarr history past and present is done due to the sacred duty we are given in the form of the reclaiming we are supposed to spread our faith and slavery is a piece of that process at least the way that i understand it slavery is intended more as a rehabilitative tool while you can dispute that with examples of those who simply treat slavery as it is on earth it does not change the intent and purpose of it in new eden and the amarr empire god named them the rightful masters of the world 20 and tasked the amarr through the leadership of the amarr emperor with conquering the fallen people of the universe and bringing them back to his grace quote and later the reclaiming is viewed as a sacred duty with amarr citizens required by god to teach and guide the other races toward the amarr faith slavery is thus necessary penance for refusing to embrace god remember that slaves are not necessarily going to remain as slaves for their whole life either at least the way i read it proper rehabilitation is supposed to lead to the resulting freedom of the slavesbasically while i know what youre getting at i dont view this as a problem for the empire if anything it should encourage a second look if someone is interested in getting deeper into the story and lore in the game and yes even if the minmatar werent existent i do think it is an important part of the backgroundas far as the other empires well sure it depends on your perspective and the relevant subfaction but none of them are any better than the amarr caldari are an authoritative regime that has a strict dutybased system which allows for little at least public freedoms gallente call themselves a democracy but there is a lot of propaganda there covering things up i would imagine both internally and externally as for the tribals who call themselves a republic these are the terrorist insurrectionists in new eden now is that due to my bias maybe but there is definitely precedence there supporting that claim in fairness i have not studied the other factions nearly as much as i would have liked so i apologize if i was incorrect in anything that i said in regards to the other empiresif you want people to see more negative or positive of a specific faction they need to actually be interested in looking at it in the first place and if they are willing to look at the lore they will im sure they can find negative aspects by simply looking into the established history and lore of the different empires so i dont think it is necessary to adjust the intro paragraphs
exactly my view but i do think that those opening paragraphs should be tailored a bit to project a gray vs gray outlook rather than giving an impression of two empires that are interesting and have a dark side versus two empires that are also interesting but which radiate fluffy bunnies rainbows and apple pie a new player may only see that little bit before deciding and afterward might not want to restart a character after they start to get into the lore
i can understand that but the truth is that the people who care about the background are going to look into it themselves and they will find it all out anyway for a single paragraph description they do a pretty good job on describing key information on all of the empires even the federation and republic because depending on where you live the very words federation and republic suggest more freedom than state or empire do which could be considered bias really though its just the way the empires are and at least personally i like what they did with it
would love for some csmdev feedback at this point this suggestion has pretty much stayed on the top page since i submitted it and even though its a slow burning thing its still a serious issue
actually its lazinesslack of resources that were instead put into dustwodleave the old code as is as inaccessible orphan segments its a common practice in mmos that contributes to ballooning of client size an acceptable side effect reimburse obsolete assets rewrite new pos mechanics from the ground up i never liked the pudding with chunks floating in it anyway it doesnt need to be fixed it needs to be gone
but i want to be 10 like right now

i had this exact conversation with a guy who ate some mushroomssure
tranquility cluster exploding the videogame
i have no idea why players even need to dock to speak to agents at all to be honest faster then light communication and all that i could see mission agents not wanting to dish out sensitive info about missions but that the only possable justification i can think of
certainly would make things a bit easier supported
being entirely honest someone in a thrasher can easily take down a corp members orca if hes smart enough the thing about being in a corp is to develop relationships and working together good corp members do that and its a sign of a good ceo or group of corp admins to vet the people they let into the corp good ceosrecruiters do that its not just about game mechanics its about social decisions and that is the key thing that separates eve from damn near every other game out there choices whether they be good or poor have consequences when concord dictates the terms of every highsec engagement its not about the choices players make anymore
are you really suggesting that instead of ceos and recruiters doing gasp actual work and doing background checks on their potential recruits and asking their old corps what they were like and check their api key to make sure they dont train for this exact sort of thing that corp members should just not be allowed to attack each otherthis just screams lazy player getting their  blasted and deserving it keep it how it isalso eve is something like ayn rand but in space to say looking out for yourself and only yourself is the most important thing would be an understatement but you should still take the free healthcare if you can squeeze the system for what its worth
just remove it dont got the isk dont trade
you sound like the guy who tried to petition me for him being an idioti mean i didnt even scam him he practically gave me the money without me saying anythingthink before you act it could save your walleti recommend you do
primarily because diverse playstyles make a healthy game and eve players are notoriously risk adverse the only worth while industry in null is boosters and cap construction it also wouldnt hurt for reward vs risk to mean something in null activities beyond shooting red plusses and structuresanother problem is that nullbies want ways to prod for fights other then shooting structures in big blobs of players the more that is happening in a place offers more opportunities for disruption there really is no good reason to mine in 00 at all with mineral compression being what it is when everything of value comes from hisec there is nothing in null that is necessary to actively protect unless people show up to throw up some sbus everyone can dock up and wait for the hostiles to go away that isnt even gameplay

this is a terrible thread and bumping is one of the few ways to make many certain ships vulnerable at all honestly the physics are fine and bumping is fine if i really need to suspend my disbelief for ships bumping of one another ill just fancy the idea that shields repel one another

wouldnt solve anything all it does is make scanner spam mandatory farm frigs will just warp out earliertweaking the rats back up just did a large in a slicer for goodness sake should be the first priority in regards to plexes if the single current rat is deemed hard enough should hope not then adding a couple extra in initial spawn might be in order  need the tags either way so double whammywcs abuse could be solved by only allowing one locked target with them fitted combined with the 3 above rats youd have to do some pretty fancy flying to survive provided you are not using an altmain to clear rats before committing the stab ship
wcs come with penalties putting an arbitrary restriction on players that chose to fit them and take the penalties just because you cant get at them fast enough to tackle them is silly
 pretty much this besides after a short amount of time in fw plexes you can learn who the farming alts are then send in someone with enough points to hold them
for chars our age these changes are simply interesting for returnees and newbies many of these changes are game breakingi could give a rats ass about other vets hitting issues  they can adapt its the newer ones and returnees that have me muttering about the ai right now for them i think ccp needs to find some fixes but not ones that trivialize the stuff for vets againps all the l4s are still a joke for those running multiple accounts they arent hard at all for those players only the ones running single accounts are catching it really rough

reset no autorun yes reset would make defence way too easy even against plexers who wants to fight just show an apparent blob on their scan and theyll bolt  end result is gaming of mechanic with even less plex pewautorun on the other hand requires defenders to stay apprised of goings on while still penalising the running farmers after having done way too many defensive plexes i actually lean towards removing lp from defensive plexes and allowing an autorun timer to close themattacking a system should require commitment of more than farmers and the occasional counterblob space superiority ought to be needed 
given that i am completely insane that isnt a problem
base mag for a phase inverter ii is 12level v recon ships gives 150 bonus to thislevel v signal dispersion gives 25 bonus to thisoverheating gives 20 bonus to thissignal distortion amplifier ii gives 20 chance to thisand that is for just the phase inverter ii an ion field projector ii would of given a base of 36 and a multispectral ii would have a base of 24 or you could do this with meta 1 13 and 2 respectively any module would be getting those same bonuses you are solo you are the only target for a falcon which has 7 mid slots of course you are going to be near perma jammed
lets assume the falcon fit was 6 jammers 4 race and 2 multi there is still a chance that in the cycle the minmatar could be the active one by chance most of the time you where likely jammed by one of the other 5 ecms it just happen to be the one showing up on the km in fw the strength of the opfor is normaly a lot less than 60 due to being frigs  crusiers in a griffin the change of jamming is more like 5050 so i think you where just unlucky next time dont fly aloneUFFFD
sooo you want some more stuff in the captains quarters
im wait captains quarters what
if you want to code it sure
if you mean as a very longterm bit of polish as part of the general strategy to make the ultimate space simulator yes it would be cool and it would have interesting tactical implicationsany time soon no it would break so many things and the slightly more varied terrain is not a fair price
it would add a bit of overhead and orbit decay what id prefer to see is line of sight friendly fire for flying between ships etc that kind of physics with anomalous space  kind of like thermal layers and such you find in the sea that could mess with things like targeting based upon gravity radiation bursts and the likethat kind of physics i think could prove more interesting to play in the game vs just more things moving in space
i agree with being clipped by friendly fire
if you like this proposal please vote for it clicking on the thumbs up icon at the top right of this page or reply with the word UFFFDsupportedUFFFD thank youreason in fw the idea is to create pvp this is done by 2 main activities one is to take plex and the ihub of a system the other is missions the second is broken this is due to the easy movement of stealth bombers in low sec space these ships due select missions kill one ship or a few haulers can easily make a lot of lp without ever having to engage in pvp in a mission its easy to move more than 40km of the warp in and second also easy to cloak they purely gain massive lp that in turn means the lp is worth less for those who risk ships in pvp im sure the idea was that a mission required the pilot to travel though hostile space and be subject to engagement along the way as well as during the mission proposal remove the stealth bombers ability to do lvl 4 fw missionsUFFFD
arbitrary restrictions are bad for you better solution1 make friendly npcs actually friendly someone broke something 2 introduce poison pills in all missions  example is fox hunt where an item has to be collected opponent can force a missionfailed by getting it or make some cash selling it to mission whore 3 only spawn in hostile spacethe pills alone would make the bomber obsolete within a month as they have no hope in hell of killing the most common mission hunters frigs  if he cant kill the predator the mission is effectively forfeited he takes standings hit and will eventually be bootednumber three is there just because  makes no sense for missions to go to friendly space at least not when it is the same missions as on can get to hostile ditto alternative is to create a new set of missions more appropriate for friendly space such as build this mine there or salvage that
what is it with faction war people and the need to restrict everythingfirst there are people screaming for restricting stabs in plexes because they are able to flee combatnow its the missions rather strange i havent heard about those the moment people where able to get lp from plexespirates life from those mission runners and the lp is not even close to that people can get from plexes
speaking from experience no i can count the number of times anyone  pirate or opposing fw pilot  has followed me into or otherwise harassed me on a mission on one hand and ive run at least a few hundred of them the beacons are up there for everyone to see but theyre almost invariably ignored  the structure of the mission deadspace means that by the time you do get to them the preferred ships bombers as noted or fast cruisers are well away from the beacon and any halfawake mission runner sees you coming on scan anyway200k lp per hour is a low end estimate theyre way the heck better than anything you get from plexes and despite the nerfs from retribution a total income of a few to several hundred million an hour depending on what you buy from the lp store remains the norm to someone dedicated to farming them plex may have been what were highly publicized during the farming era because they were still quite profitable and could be done even more trivially but missions were where the real money was at and still arenow rewards that high are probably an issue but i dont have a problem with them being lucrative in general its lowsec and is notionally a warzone after all but the riskreward is way off and a large part of that is the missions themselves almost all of them are warp in and kill one thing or several things in the case of the hauler destruction missions there are item recovery missions but few people actually accept those  they take longer the end result is that your exposure the time spent hanging out in the deadspace is very low youre typically in and out of the system in five minutes tops plus the structure of the mission deadspace is conducive to safety as well like the old plexes the actual target of the mission is 5080km away from the warpin point that gives you plenty of space to move away from the beacon and react to any potential attackers even if youre not spamming dscan to see them comingbombers only exacerbate the riskreward factor since they can move about the warzone with near impunity thanks to their cloak the places you can die in one are a get horribly unlucky on a gate and get decloaked b get horribly unlucky on the warp gate to the mission and c get horribly unlucky with someone following you through the warpgate right after you warp in and given that as i mentioned before my experience is for most people to simply ignore the missions b and c are unlikelystill the solution is not to overtly target bombers with the nerf while theyre most peoples preferred ships because of the aforementioned safety a stealth fit tengu or any fast cruiser with an improved cloak to evade gatecamps and frankly the cloak is optional can do them almost as fast and with almost as little danger so we need to look elsewherefirst change the mission layout do what was done with the plexes and move the warpin closer to the objective doesnt do anything about people mashing dscan of course but that cant be helped second require players to kill everything to complete the mission instead of just the objective and then use that as a dial to balance how long it takes to complete the mission in their current form id say they have way too many npcs in them but thats easy to change this is where the nerf to bombers comes in especially since bombers will have a lot more trouble killing frigates than a more suitable ship wouldthose two combined will up the risk by obliging players to use easier to catch ships and spending a little more time in mission and lower the reward by making it take a little longer

youre late to this particular partyccp has already said they dislike off grid boosting and will be reworking it to require the boosting ships to be ongrid
i did hear that might be the case just not seen the actual text  post yet if you have it please link itUFFFD
it has been mentioned in different posts and devblogs that ccp doesnt like offgrid boosting in the new eden open tournament stream soundwave basicly said that the decision to get rid of it has now been made they dont have a public timeline or details on a new system but its pretty much set in stone that offgrid boosting will be replaced by a new ongrid boosting system

well look our cpt quarters would be a bonus but only to some slice of cheese you really want to know where we could be in 50 years just thinking ahead putting some money beside us and knowing our descendants will feel obligated to follow what the founders base idea was will be the root to our ideas i want items in cpt quarters yes but i would love and adore the thing most precious in my pretty little head right now that being holograms sitting in a room fit for real life communications and view to touch but not to touch to see but to only see to a certain degree i want tracking devices placed on ships fyi still and also to walk about them and have those cool phase gates that a cpt may enable to block out trespassers and dummies i always thought that if ccp worked through this ship walk that shield phases would be enough to blow automatically block out bad standing people about their ship at least to a certain angle to be restricted towards the cargo bay alone would be enough for my thoughts successpetition to start educating towards smart technology
yes line of sight first would make a huge change to the gamewanna avoid ganks hide behind a rock
on a side note the system and celestial data like mass etc do work for the most part when you put them in a gravity simulation ive tried it myself or at least thats the case with the tekaima solar system but i have no reason to believe that its the only system that would work in a gravity simulationperhaps when ccp first stated coding they wanted it to be newtonian but the technology at the time did not allow it when they tested ita halfway solution could be to do a 24h timestep during downtime but they want to eliminate downtimein essence the cogs are largely in place we just need the power to make them turn

youre missing the point entirely just because you dont see any value in it doesnt mean it has no value that just means you have a very limited understanding of this mechanicthe vast majority of people in this game do not go around ganking corp mates its quite infrequent you only hear a lot about it because the victims are usually loud and over dramatic what a horrible game mechanic exploit ccp fix or i cancel 30 accounts and this exploit serves no other purpose than to empower griefers weve heard it all before and none of it is truethere are plenty of methods for preventing and dealing with incorp griefers yet none of them are ever employed when was the last time you read a story about a corp thwarting an incorp ganker with all the tools they already have not often if everyou could put a thousand warning labels and safety devices on a wood chipper to inform the user not to stick his hand inside but if the user blatantly ignores all the warnings and bypasses safety devices to stick his hand in the wood chipper whos fault is that reallyits a false assumption to claim this is a game mechanic problem it is not this is a user stupidity problem ceos have all the tools necessary to prevent and deal with this situation but if they blatantly ignore them and get ganked whos fault is that really you can only protect the stupid from themselves for so long eventually the stupid will find a way to bypass your antistupid measures and get burned this is the real issue changing game mechanics will not protect the stupid from themselvessummary of eves last four expansions
no one module should be barred from use because it is annoying trust me im a pirate and there is nothing that gets me ranting harder than getting a shiny target to structure to have them warp off cause their stabbed to the gills i just accept it as part of the game along with inertia stabs that allow frigs to align and warp almost instantly get more creative in your strategy to catch the stabbed ships2 scrams will probably stop him and with his lows full of stabs its a pretty good bet he isnt running damage mods which should make it easy to pop him funny thing with farmers though stabbed or not they usually make enough isk loosing a ship here and there dont stop them from coming back
having ran missions in my hs days in a dominix i am for changes in the drone tactics i would drop ogres and come back every now and again to see if it was time to loot and salvage no one combat system should be so effective with so little effort i do think however ccp went a little overboard i put out some warrior iis on an alt in a mission just to see what everyone what crying about and every frig in the room immediately aggroed them hammerheads died even faster cause it took longer to recall them my alt cant use heavies so i didnt get around to testing them i think maybe it might be worth making it so npc frigs dont attack light drones that means you would need to redeploy diffrent drone sizes according to the rat size it would keep people from afking through missions but not reduce you to only being able to use remote repped sentry drones its just a suggestion im pretty indiffrent to the changesmy drones usually are too busy chewing on players to worry about npcs
i actually lold this one ive been pirating for years and i dont think any pirate is scared of a stealth bombers with bombs most ships at a low sec camp are tanked because of sentries and while they are going to take damage from a bomb and one or two already damaged ships might die chances are about the same if stealth bombers showed up with torps considering bombing takes some skill and practice and a pinch of lucka standard torp fit sb would probably be more effective go look at some of the alliance tournament matches especially plssome times they could take out support but bombs rarely put larger tanked ships in any danger logis or local reps couldnt pull them out of like a bunch of other people have said it is alot more to do with server resources than anything although a t1 fw fleet might be a little fun to bomb as a pirate
we know that ccp are looking into possible discounts for continued subs and discounts off second accounts further than just the current power of two offer that is available from time to timea nice feature i would like to see would be to move characters between my accounts without having to pay the plex cost there would need to be a cooldown on this to prevent loadabuse but i think being able to essentially be able to make it easier for me to control which of my different characters are available to be online without having to think of it far in advance of pony up on plex costs would be a very effective tool

i feel that current rats in asteroid belts are immaterial and serve no purpose fighting for your right to mine is a fun idea so lets make it fun and part of the game i propose scrapping the current system of spawning belt rats and replacing it with one that is reactionary and scales with the number of playersmy method for doing this uses asteroids like spawn triggers in missions when an asteroid is mined it has a chance of spawning a rat higher quality 5 and 10 asteroids should have higher spawn rates the trigger must be when mined initially not on destruction this should be obvious but i want no misunderstandingin this scenario the lone miner will find himself under fire more often but to no greater effect than current rats an occasional pest which can be avoided by mining the normal yield asteroidswhen you have a mining fleet spawns will scale up because more asteroids are being mined at once this could be expanded for mission runners and miners to play together while applying their individual craftsor maybe im a fool what says the internet
would be good for farming rats simply bring fleet and systematicly shoot a mining lazer at every roid in the beltalso would be awesome for greefing afk miners jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

no seriously what is iti thought i knew or wanted to think i knew but i really didnti thought the csm was supposed to be a body of elected individuals who would represent the players of eve towards ccp i had no misconceptions that we as players could or should completely influence the game design but i thought it was nice that they were willing to listen to us and take some of it into account in their game designonly thats not at all what happens with the csm i just read the minutes for the recent meeting not once did i see a single csm member say the words the players i have spoken to feel or i think most players think or even reference the fact that they are supposed to be speaking for many not only themselves but i did see plenty of i want and i feel and i i i i me me me me good to see the csm is acting as they were designed noi realize this is probably not a new thing but i am new and this is the first time it has struck me and to be honest im utterly disappointed take from that what you will

what i had in mind is to give to lowsec a purpose an identity the purpose is a quick buck at least faster and bigger isk rewards than highsec the identity would be the transition btw highsec and lowsec into null and viceversahow to achieve those thingsquick buck exploration missions mining drug manufacturing should be available in lowsec toothe new tagforsec idea is very welcomed into this scriptall of those activities need to be doable fast but yield more isk than they do in highsec  exploration there is need a faster spawn rate of plexes 1310 u dont want bears come form highsec and search for hours for something meaningful because they ll be probably dead missions lot and faster npc spawns shorter but dense missions rare spawn of dense rare materials in standard asteroids which u can deplete in15 mins max and should yield a nice amount of isk hint there would be a need of fine tuning these activities shouldnt be to short so that the bears have chance to be caught risk vs reward should be present 15 min should be enough for eachtransition highseclowsecwh or nullsecthere are few stakeholders that are meaningfull for this transition casual highsec visitors they are after the quick buck and we settled them with previous tipsthe other group is corpsalliances that became too good for highsec and they want to try the end game whnullsec the trial for the endgame should be lowsec but how to motivate those group to try first lowsec bare with me little more and i it will be a bit more clear booted nullsec alliancescorps they should retire into lowsec reorginize and consolidate but why would they do that when u literally will have harder time to survive in lowsec than in null answer coming soon entities that like lowsec mechanics organized corps mercenaries pirates etc and militia but i want talk to much about them cos they are now a sec for themselves and are standing pretty goodthe problem is that the lowsec atm is like null on steroids difficulty wise for entities trying to be self sufficient and survive the isk is very very poor and not there is not lot going on not a lot ppl to shoot atwhats was the motivation to change the situation again the same 3 saviours exploration 45610 plexes should be more present around lowsec missions lv 4 missions should ve the quality risen at least double to 40 minning more meaningful gravitometric anomalies with dense asteroids that can be depleted faster and yield same or even more than normal lowsec stations sohuld be buffed a bitand the ultimate motivation sovereigntyhighsec should ve the beggining of the ownership with possmilitia has its own sovereigntywh has its own u can claim a wh and make it a fortress almost inpenetrableand null sec that we know all aboutsow what kind of sovereignty lowsec needsnot the generic stadardized sov but fictional sov claimed by presence and dominion in an area but to motivate that dominion we need that area to be a bit more specialmy corp recently moved into a system attractive one and i think we made our presence noticed we achieved some kind of dominion because all entities that were around before are not anymore why we choose that system it has some nice composition of moons where we settled our pocos we receive taxes and do our own pi it is connected with highsec which means some more taxes trough pi and camping opportunity it has 2 lv 4 agents and 1 lv 5 the system is pretty good but is not even close enough all of our members have alts elsewhere adding helping our mains and corp to be competitiveso how to make the areas interesting for dominionmake them special make some constellations or systems have higher spawn rate for 45610 plexes make some areas awesome for mining industry make some places awesome for drug manufacturing and some with awesome agents make some stations having even bigger bonuses some with lots of wh openingsthat kind of lowsec would be damn attractive and would make a perfect highway for nullsec with some motelsand in my opinion only when that kind of lowsec is balanced compared to highsec u will have easier time to revamp nullsec and u ll know exaclty what to buff and how to buff

this is a very good point though it could also lead to massive super alliances would have to admit that this is dangerous territory on the other hand a lot of players value their individuality on either a player or group level so coalitions may be more likely  though on a much smaller scale than right now and in a very different way covering timezones instead of regionsedit seems like the latest csm minutes discuss a proposal much like this one iiiiinteresting seems theres more people thinking about this than i thought 
while i would love this personally itd be exploited to death with buddy invites etc i cant see this one happening in the future sorry bro
while i would love this too since i tend to move alts to different accounts after they are trained as to train another onei dont think ccp wants to lose the 2 plex i pay each time i do it so not seeing that this would work out good
how does ccp tell which accounts are owned by whom
if you take the data from an eve system like the mass radius density orbit distance etc of the moonsstarsplanetsstations and use that data to recreate the system in a gravity simulation program you will find that massradiusdensity interactions are correct and that when you run the simulation the system will likely not collapse or fly apart stable orbits
adding morebetter physics will add to gameplay just think of the possibilities orbiting a planet in a fast small ship will keep you from falling into the planet but if a larger slower ship were to scan you down and warp to you they would get pulled into the planet lots of new mechanics and strategies could be madethe only problem is ccp have stated many times they want the greatest bang for their buck so working on something like this for minimal returns wouldnt be realistichopefully someday in the future when ccp can afford twice the number of developers this can be implementedherping your derp since 19potato  url

what was the purpose of reposting the exact same thing in a new thread summary of eves last four expansions
op answer me this one questionwhere do changes like this endbecause they never seem to it just seems that things have been made incrementally safer andor encourage people to avoid conflict over a the years and this invites more risk adverse people to join the game and then advocate for better security and safety which invites more risk adverse people to join and the cycle seems to just keep looping back and feeding on itselfand heres the best part it changes nothing in the grand scheme of thingscreating an npc response to attacking people in lowsec will only force pirates to adopt suicide ganker tactics except you can escape from these types of ganks and the standings hits will just make pirates live full time in poss which is something only the rich can do no more poor pirates just the good ones that know what they are doing this means that the risk adverse people will still not go out into lowsec because they can still be killed just as easilynothing will change except for the fact that you have dramatically raised the entry barrier into piracyoh but it doesnt stop there if more ideas along the same lines as this one are put forth youll have more changes being made that make illegal attacks more punitive and more draconian until you eventually have another version of highsec
to be viewed by a different audienceas i explained clearly the goal is to increase the appeal of lowsec by enabling gameplay the idea that people are not going to lowsec because they are risk averse is mostly false some fall in to this category but they generally dont stay in eve for the long term anyway more important is that lowsec mechanics prevent many types of gameplay from occuring for a majority of players if all of my long list of ideas is forgotten or discredited this core principle remainsas i also explained clearly its only a set of brainstorming ideas if you have a better one to address the problem please put it forward if you dont have that then please describe in detail why the mechanics wont achieve the stated goal your current explanations assume that riskaversion is the dominant motivation while i am assuming something entirely differentthe unstated until now issue is that any assumption of motivations by a large number of players is just that an assumption in the absence of actual data we can only go with the idea that makes the most sense i find that simply projecting the antithesis of ones own behavior onto anyone that doesnt behave like yourself is not an accurate way to judge the behavior of others
note ive since been convinced by nick narrell that the better approach is to reduce the gap between pvp and pve a pve pilot will be more likely to engage in emergent pvp if his current ship has a fighting chance at it instead of being completely at the mercy of any pvp fit pilot
and the tears will flood tama a whole generation of eve pvpers grew up on the concept of kb grooming extreme risk aversion and engaging only riskless targets they will cry bloody murder
didnt want those pvpers anywayseve faq 72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided
like shahfluffers says just because they dont say things like the players i have spoken to feel or i think most players think it doesnt mean they are speaking only for themselves the csm and ccp know fully well that these members are already speaking on behalf of the players who elected them and all of these members are experienced in the matter of representationwe dont need them to say i think most players think to get their point across we just want them to be there to make sure ccp doesnt go screwing around like they did back in 2011
there is lot more than that if carebears could earn 12x the value of their ship in one trip there would be more and more visiting even now there are quite few visitors it is getting betterwhat really is missing is organised group atm to be self sufficient in lowsec is much more harder than both wh and nullsec
my first guess was more cowbellbut in an attempt to be serious i would say more lowsec systems lots more stations in lowsec no cynos and asteroids that are worth the risk to mine summary of eves last four expansions

emailscredit card infopast historystuff like that to tie them together you know connect the dots if they can track rmters and people buying and selling characters im pretty sure they can track simple character transfers to see who owns which but as others have pointed out the idea that the op mentioned is just asking for abuse it will just complicate matters considering we have the power of two and the buddy invite program in place

solution to 1 use brain in a box to tie to activity line in a box so that each job in an activity line is calculated based on the skills of the person preparing the jobsolution to 2 rather than change existing refinery modules introduce two new modules refinery and reprocessing plant add the new functionality to these two modules thus the only legacy code to interfere with is the this thing requires cpu  pg from the anchored ct then when modular poses come along both the line activity in a box and the refineryreprocessing code can be reused oh and as a freebie you get to replace existing refineries with the new refinery and reprocessing activity lines
now that pos revamp has been effectively stompedcan we get refineries that work now
its been said that even ccp is scared as  of the current pos code and wont try messing with it unless it breaks and i dont think ccp thinks that refining arrays are broken useless quite likely broken noall we can hope for is a swift implementation of the new starbase system
what would we call this harvesting gankbear tears doesnt sound catchy enough hmmm
nothing will push high sec people into low sec if it is not atleast as safe and profitable as high sec that being said lowsec is not scary i remember the first time i jumped into atlar with my blood pumping so hard my ears were ringing all my little noob life everyone told me how scary low sec was then i got a fight killed a frigate lost my cruiser and my pod and while staring at the station wall realizedholy crap that was fun i have since lived in low sec most of my eve life first as a carebearish and later as a pirate one of my past corps even mined in hulks in lowsec while the pipes ahead were scouted and gates were camped later i became a pirate myself and im telling you if you know the game mechanics you can easily get into and out of lowsec with minimal danger its just getting past that initial culture of highsec carelessness and adopting street smarts that is hard for most bears there is no point in making lowsec more friendly or you are in essense expanding highsec into low and tbh there is already plenty of high sec for everyone maybe even too much
they should either increase the risk in highsec or reduce the income from highsec lowsec is fine
i appreciate your explanation i just dont buy itif you know what you are doing lowsec is already very low risk hell you should see the amount of haulers and freighters that come and go through lowsec already my alt is one of them and he makes a killing in terms of profits by selling much needed ships and equipment to outlaws such as myself at a premium as far as lowsec preventing many types of gameplay due to its nature i can say the same of highsec and nullsec the simple fact of the matter is no real consensus will ever come with regards to how each should behave in relation to the other highsec lowsec and nullsec all require different types of methods and styles of gameplay the problem for many is that that the games general mantra is that more risk should produce more reward not the other way around the issue is that there is no real problem and people are still trying to create one if people learn to manage risk and use the options they have available they can do things they never thought possiblei mainly fly blockade runners around an active faction warfare zone seeding equipment and ships i have flown through amamakes gatecamps i have only been caught once and that was because i screwed up using the mwdcloak trick using a deep space transport early onthis is true i do believe that risk aversion is a dominant motivationmany get ganked the first few times they jump in and and then decide that it just isnt worth another try this is a common sight within the minmatar militia as many new recruits get caught in the amamakeossogur gatecamp after which they become scared of jumping into lowsec even through alternate routes without an escortagain once people learn how to enter and exit lowsec safely there is little issue its the initial experiences that scars people and yes i will concede you cant really put this into hard data either way without doing numerous and detailed surveys of many many players except that even this should be taken with a grain of salt as the first reaction of many is to create greater security rather than adapt to the current degree of hostilities

better question why is csmafter reading the csm 7 meetings minutes i dont see any reason for csm to continuewhy dont we just save the game time spent on voting and send ccp messages saying just do what you want to do every few weeks theyre going to do it anywaythere is a possibility that ccps money making schemes would be affected by player input lets not let that happenseriously if ccp went out of business what would we play
i know what seven is on about having read the minutes of the meeting i also wonder who the csm speak to ingame i suspect it is only to the corpalliance they are in as they do not seem to speak to or get the opinions of those who voted them inat voting time i am usually sent an evemail requesting me to vote someone onto the csm once i have placed my vote i hear nothing more until the next election how hard can it be for those that are elected to occasionally to sent a mailshot out to the people that voted them in if they know for some sort of opinion ok not everyone will respond but that is the nature of politics

pirates even rl historical ones prey on the weak defenseless merchant ships there is not a single story i can remember of any successful pirate who only went around attacking any of the contoling powers navy the ones who met the navy usually ended up bleeding on their own deck or hanging by a rope on a yardarm so yes ganking defenseless ships and taking their loot is a totally acceptable enterprise for people like me to make money now that everyone has a bounty it is even more profitable so yes if i see your defenseless ship in lowsec i will probably pop it and sell your blood stained items to the next person who comes along that being said i also love me some pvp and keep a wellstocked hangar full of various t1 frigates crusiers bc and bs which from time to time i go and visit the real boost to low sec fw people complain about low sec now but a few years ago it was so dead you could hear a rifter backfire from ten high sec systems away fw brought tons of pvpwilling people who are always happy to try and blob the hell out of a red flashy and they are usually successful cause i dont mind taking bad odds and i dont give a crap about kb and stats low sec has its own rewards its like living in a ghettosomeone is always trying to kill you you are always trying to kill someone else and the only thing that keeps you alive is your understanding of game mechanics and skill quit trying to make carebears come here and dont try and make it high sec v20 to get them here you might not understand the play style you may not like the risk of being ganked by someone like me but your also free to live in the some odd thousand systems covered by concord
i fully agree with everything u said but dont get the point or the context that fits within this thread
the first half was dealing with the people saying it needs less yarr and ganking is bad the last 2 setences mostly says it allthere are like 3 of the what low sec needs how to make carebears come to low sec posts rolling right now my point is low sec isnt broken fw brought in new life it is very active and attractive to the people who want to live there you could buff every mission mining opportunity npc rat and exploration site until it is paradise on eve but it is not going to make anyone move there who is already afraid to make the plunge it is not dead it does not have problems because it is missing isk making opportunites infact with the recent aggressioncriminal changes id say it is as perfect as it has ever been in my 6 years of living in it if it aint broke dont fix it
and your are living completely from lowsec u dont have any alt in highsecnullsecwh or fw which boost your isk wallet right
yesi support myself entirely on the contents of my victims wrecks or ransoms i have one pi planet that im always forgeting to renew the harvesting things onbut it makes me less than 5m a monthand from time to time when i get desparately low on isk ill scan out a plex or annombut that is when the bullet supply is in jeprody90 or more of my income comes from reselling blood stained loot
great u are a true lowsec citizen but unfortunately u are 1 of those that fits in 5 while the rest of 95 unfortunately finds they resources elsewhere
ill take that as a complimentbut the point i was trying to make is that you could get every item on your wish list and maybe get another 5 of players to come into low sec i remember when they added bs ratsthat was supposed to attract ninja ratterswho all died horribly some of them to my guns and aside from the occasional noob no one really goes to low sec to rat unless their suicidal if you add something in low sec so rare that it would attract attention it would probably end up like the high end low sec moons all owned by 00 alliances and there is nothing to be ashamed of because your low sec character is supported by an alt especially if you pvp alot and loose ships all the time pvp for pvps sake dont pay well you have to gank to bank null and high are good for selfsupport low isnt but the pvp opportunites are unrivialed by either i guess the way i see it you fit your play style around the game and dont ask the game to fit itself to your play style
ofc it was a compliment for example lowsec cant offer me all the isk i need so i need to find it elsewhere dont u agree that if the conditions were better u d see quite few more self sufficient corpsalliances in lowsec be it they come from highsec to find better opportunities or few that will get back from nullsec if they are chased away now if a nullsec corpalliance comes to regroup get stronger they d just disband in this harsh enviroment even and for a moment dont look at fw as a part of lowsec for me is the sec on its own same like 00 and npc 00 we moved in this region and we are quite happy there is so much more activity before this we were basically in all lowsec partscorners and the situation was desperate 75 od lowsec is deadi dont want lowsec to depend on fw it should depend of itself
many many moons ago i was in free galactic enterprises the founding corp of the long ago failed frege alliance after we got our behinds tossed out of 00 and the alliance fell apart we moved to aranir in derelik we ran missions for ammatar fleet locked the system down and our miners mined in hulks no less enough minerals to build everything from ammo to cap ships there is isk to be made in low sec and a dedicated corporation that is not riskadverse can repeat what we did not even once did any of us think our selves as having the short end of the stick because we lived therewe could have just as easily lived in high sec but it gave us all what we wanted the members like me who wanted pew got it the ones who wanted to mine and produce got that too we just were fearless after a rather brutal 00 fight and were not afraid of losses there is a mental block that tells you to stay safe and not take risks once you manage to hurdle that barrier the sky is the limit in eve until you can make players pass that block you could hand them free isk on the other side of a low sec gate and they still wouldnt jump in
well u are right but still there is a fact that those kind of entities are just so few like the fact is that lowsec is much more harsher to survive than both wh and null because members of corps have lot of harder time finding both the isk and interaction than in other secs i dont say it is impossible afterall balex is already 6 years in lowsec with few small pauses before i came in balex i was in nullsec whole time with some small amount time in wh and from my own experience lowsec is the endgame of eve atm
have you ever run drugs through empire then you know that at just about every gate you get this epically annoying prompt asking if you want to hand it over to the fuzzi cant think of anything more annoying and unnecessary and dangerous as this maybe a warning prompt everytime you enter lowsec that never goes away running drugs through empire in a cruiser or lower is almost no risk but this stupid prompt stops you at every gate if you lag at the prompt or arnt on the ball you can lose your ship or the drugs for no reasonwhy would i willfully hand over the 100mil in pills i just boughtat the very least make it do not show againif you want to make drug running dangerous just make possession of pills a defacto reason for empire navies to attack you
i think its rly buggy because i got the message one second before i was able to jump but if i warp off from a gate with a ceptor nothing happensbest thing was i clicked no but i payed them anyway
add the tickbox but make drug running more like real life random chance based on system security that police scans cargo if contraband is detected roadblocks are set up cant dock and cant jump and perpetrator is flagged as suspect handing over drugs at this point removes roadblockflag as well as a hefty fine criminal now has to shake pursuers must not be on grid with police for 3 minutes or so by warping around safes required ie preparation or kill all the officers present at time of initial cargo scan taking a sec status hitthen add drugs to market database allow affiliations with pirate organizations serpentis etc that decrease chance of scan redo lowsec to give pirate affiliated organizations bonuses to drug manufacturing at pos new and improved pleasebut first things first there should not be a popup without a do no show this again tickbox
keep in mind that the caldari medal is from a time when there were no incentivescarrots and no sticks for that matter whatsoever  it was done simply because they could and to troll the snot out of gallentenow we have lp for everything particularly farming plexing that not only yields stupid amounts of lpisk but restricts access to systems create a medal and stick it in the lp store for 100m lp which should be ballpark what the last years worth of incentives has given the individual farmer plexer 
well regardless each proposal and each change should be pushed this is what the player base needshrolt ceo live free die proud
everyone with high sp in gunnery should not be having any problems unless they are lazythose with low sp in gunnery and low sp in spaceship command should ask yourselvesdid i start doing higher level missions before i was readythe new balance to npc ai was directed at afk drone running boatsif it has totally broke your mission running ability maybe its time you went back to lvl 3s or lvl 2sbalancing ai for npcs is a logical stepdont believe this is the last of it
overviewthe proposal i would like to suggest would be to overhaul the mechanics ships and functions of black ops and force recon black ops ships and force recon tie together hand in hand but are currently not used very often in todayUFFFDs game as it is really limiting new players and players with high and specific skills the proposed changes would introduce changes to ships and skills with and introduction of new ships and tools to help the black ops and force recon shipsgame play changes black operations should be a name of a style of combat and not the battleship black operations should be a form of game play which allows newish players and experienced players the ability to experience and grow black operations togetherto be able to perform these changes and introduction and change of ships would be neededwhy changeblack operations in itself is reliant on so many different factors that make it very difficult to use black operations is very dependent the ability to move ships from point a to point b to perform its tasks to be able to do this the black ops battleship is required to use faction isotopes to allow the other ships and its self to jump to other systems the amount of isotopes used is dependent on ship size massdistance to targetas there are no tools giving the ability to judge the distance for bridging against the amount of isotopes required it makes the job of a single or multiple bridgingUFFFDs and jumps harp to determine because of the reliance of the isotopes as fuel against the size of ship and distance it would make sense to introduce more classes of ships to allow a variety of fleet sizesconcept introduce a whole black operations class of ships from frigate to carrier all still based upon the aspect that all ships would need to be able to be fitted with the tier 3 cloaking device or designated as a portal generator shipthe black operations ships would beblack ops frigatecovert opsbombertackler webification  covert cyno generatortackler warp disruption  covert cyno generatorecmtracking disruptioncap neutralisationlogisticsall frigates would require the use of a tier 3 cloaking deviceblack ops destroyer damage dealerecmtracking disruptioncap neutralisationtackler webification  covert cyno generatortackler warp disruption  covert cyno generatorlogisticsinterdictor  covert cyno generatorall destroyers would require the use of a tier 3 cloaking deviceblack ops cruiser damage dealerecm currently the falcontracking disruption currently the pilgrimtackler webification  covert cyno generator currently the rapiertackler warp disruption  covert cyno generator currently the rapierlogisticsheavy interdictor  covert cyno generatorcommandall destroyers would require the use of a tier 3 cloaking deviceblack ops battleship t1damage dealer  covert cyno generatorecm  covert cyno generatorcap neutralisation  covert cyno generatortracking disruption  covert cyno generatort1 black ops battleships can only bridge via the black ops carrierblack ops battleship t2command  covert cyno generatorlogistics  covert cyno generatort2 black ops battleships can bridge and jump to cynoblack ops carrier command  covert cyno generatorcarrier can bridge and jump to location t3 shipsblack ops command sub systemall t3 would require the use of a tier 3 cloaking deviceblockade runner no changeblack ops noctis see belowship description black ops neutraliser this ship would be similar to what the pilgrim does currently and adjusted to the ships typeblack ops logistics as per the new logistics ship given at the 2012 eve tournament the black ops logistics ships would be a variant of this ship all the ship classes would be relevant to the current versions frigate and cruiser the only new one would be the destroyer class logistics which would be a variant change and the difference between the frigate and cruiserthe t3 cruiser is use full but the cost size  speed of the ship limits this type of ship really to be jumped into a battleship class fight it would not be good as a frigate or destroyer fleetblack ops noctis the black ops noctis would be limited to the same category as the battle ships where it is a black ops ship and can bridge through black ops ship but can nit use a covert ops cloaking device this noctis would have all the standard noctic specifications nit have the ability to have a fuel storage are for black ops battle ships to use command shipsblack ops command ships are not able to fit the normal standard warfare links but fit a black ops warfare linkcommand ships are not effected by ecm or tracking disruption the role of a command ship is to give bonuses but not necessarily command the fight because everything is manual and not automatic it gives the command ship pilot more work to do protecting his own pilotsblack ops command ships are able to lock up to a number of ships dependent on skills and the type of ship flown eg carrier  50 battleship  30 cruiser  15 contiunued on part ii

have you considered maybe sending them an evemail to try to address something see if you can chat with them every now and then the forums are not the only medium they respond to that reminds me i need to get in touch again its been a long time for me since i last contacted my representative but thats because my account was in cryostasis for some time
i could contact my rep if i knew who they were when elected maybe i am not looking hard enough reading the wiki any issues are raised in a new topic in the forum and may be supported by a csm member if worthy of following up best that there can be i suppose with the large numbers of people in the game i do realise there are a lot more experienced players than myself in eve but cannot help thinking that matters raised at meetings between ccp and the csm regarding proposals are biased towards the big alliances and to their advantage
in the summit minutes ccp listed a number of things they would like to address regarding 00 and in the following discussion they seemed to introduce more skeletal points they would like to address rather than solutions to these problems the issues ccp would like to address are as follows in no particular order 00 alliances control a large area they are not utilizing ccp wants to avoid vacant systems and for alliances to use or lose sov large areas of sov control and presence of blob warfare make it difficult for a small alliance to carve out an area of their own in the shadow of large coalitions blob warfare is common because theres very little players feel that small fleets can accomplish they want more objectives for small groups to undertake industry in 00 does not exists not profitable enough better to just import from empire some parts of space could be more resourceful and a greater prize for large alliances while less resourceful space could be less contested giving some smaller alliances a chance to stake their claim ccp minutes mentioned luring industrialists out to 00 with more efficient research or quicker manufacturing capabilities my proposal imagine sov structures tied to the pos system this is debatable but laid the basis of an idea that can be molded as ccp sees fit each sov structure would need to be fueled by the alliance in control this fuel could come in the form of unstable isotopes these isotopes could have a half life that is tied with the jump system for the remainder for the remainder of this post i will use uranium 235 as an example u235 since it is both familiar to many readers and all ready used as a fuel source u235 could be used as is or combined with other piice products to create sov structure fuel blocks i will continue with the notion they would be used as is imagine that an alliance has a particularly resourceful system and wants to extract fuel for their sov structures once acquired an industrial ship loaded with 1 million units of u235 upon jumping from main hub to next system half of his cargo hold is converted from u235 to thorium 231 natural decay product in the real world im a biochemist let me use my fancy science leaving him with 500 k units of u235 and 500 k units of th231 he then makes another jump and now his cargo hold contains 250 k units of u235 and 750 units of th231 also those janitors in his cargo hold have had their faces melted off and are now units of zombies one can hope perhaps that thorium 231 could even be used to make chargeswhere would this u235 come from perhaps each time a miners laser cycle completes theres a 5 chance tor an additional amount of u235 equal to say 10 of the miners yield to have been found within the ore numbers subject to balancing of course whether this additional u235 was in a refined state or ore like state favored is irrelevant so long as they were still subject to decay in addition pi extractors could had a chance of finding an additional x units of u235 per cycle and could automatically be routed to the launchpad or silo these yield numbers could also vary slightly depending on systemconstellation to provice one more facet for defining more resourceful areas for large alliances to contest over and less resourceful areas for smaller alliances to gain a foothold this would require alliances to utilize the systems they claim sov of provide a need for industry pilots to exist in 00 large alliances that could afford the decay rates could even fuel a larger area without making the most of their systems but would limit the scope of vacant but still claimed space and with a need for more industry pilots in 00 the markets could also grow to the point where it would be more worth wile to produce in 00 than import from empire small fleets could still play a role in sov by disrupting enemy mining operations or protecting their own we all know how effective that can be in high sec perhaps spawns of valuable rats could even increase depending on the number of ships in belt to reward the combat pilots for hours of staring at strange blue lights they know nothing about and make coordination a requirement for industrial affairs in 00    oh god i just signed up to have more of my precious mining barges blown upwhy the idea of ting sov structures in with pos if miners and pi folks obtain raw or refined u235 in system they dont want to waste a half life by taking it to processing furthermore the lack of station capabilities is one reason that many systems go vacant if sov structures were tied to pos functionality areas that are claimed would be more usable ccp mentioned increased research efficiency or quicker manufacturing capabilities in 00 to lure industrial pilots to take the risk perhaps this could offer those possibilities no one enjoys hauling fuel to the pos and the idea of having to haul fuel to something else would be even more annoying but by fueling them both in the same place it would be less of a chore planting a flag sov structure that says this spot belongs to kno3 in an empty system seems like an empty gesture building a shiny pos and then planting that flag would suggest not only have i claimed it but i am using it i know there are complications to this but im not familiar enough with the workings of 00poses to discuss them how would this effect empire if the empire factions were to fuel their own sov structures by pulling u235 out of their derriere and shipping it using the npc merchant vessels that all ready patrol high sec hopefully it wouldnt any u235 harvested in empire wouldnt be shippable to 00 and could be refined into either amunition charges something new entirely or minerals though elements  minerals seems unusual
i ran out of post characters i welcome your feedback and suggestions and would love for a dev to take noticethanks for reading kno3
if you actually wanted to learn how to live in lowsec and develop the unique street smart skills it takes you can earn 300mn average for 23 hours of exploration work i made a very handsome living at it and i lived and explored minmatar lowsec for two years straight i will not live in highsecbut yes it requires you to understand game mechanics know your turf know the other inhabitants of the area and their habits like i said street smartsif youre an idiot you will die judging by your post id say youre going to die
by the way ccp will not listen to you because there is plenty of opportunity in lowsec the rewards and the dangers are well balanced many of us enjoy the game of evading our enemies lowsec living has an edge to it that 00 blob fest does notso quit trying to bring a cure to a society of eve that is not interested in seeing their turf changed so you can jump from your comfy highsec home to dip in the riches of territory we bleed forrecognition your fake sov ideawe already do claim space but we dont need a banner we claim it by raining bullets and plasma down on your hulls frankly wed prefer to keep you unsuspecting so no thanks wed prefer the intel of who owns this space wasnt so easy to accessyour wowlike petitionfurthermore i am disgusted by your petition you are just one more person in a string of lazy nubs who want ccp to make this game easyget it into your head eve is hardmany of us like it that way it truly means something when youve mastered a lifestyle in this game i have mastered lowsec it took me two years now im onto my next great challenge and this if the best thing about eve it has diversity of lifestyles that present a whole new set of challengesthe day this game gets simplified homogenized and dumbed down for the wow wusses is the day i cancel my accounts
get off your condescending high horse learn about economics and put in some hard work of making yourself successful at pve i get the feeling all you want to do is make a quick buck so you can easily afford to fly something other than tech 1 battlecruisersnewsflash more risk  more isk  nicer ships in 00 has great rewards but you can also lose your stations generally you can evacuate in timewormhole space have some of the best rewards but you are also risking everything its all on the line 100 of the timewhat does lowsec have no maintenance fees no fuel costs for starbases as is the case in wspace life no risk of losing anything you dont undockso please explain why you need a quick buck when you got nothing on the line
yep what he said fuzzy high sec carebears rarely shave their hides
i am quite good at making isk got more than enough for my expensive toys ofc isk is not coming from lowsecbeen both in nullsec and wh and if stronger entity comes in u move somewhere else same is in lowsec if a stronger entity comes in your system and camp u u move somewhere else so pls dont come to me with the speech nullsec bears risk everythingalso we got more poses than most of wh corpsalso why lowsec has the nickname lowsuxwhy at least 75 of lowsec is desertedwhy only interesting place is around fw systemsand i welcome coven into lowsec and live few months and live only from lowsec firstly u d never come cos it sucks badly 2nd if u came u d disband in no time why cos compared to null and wh it sucks badly
zloco what do you think about this idea would something like that benefit lowsec would you like some pro pirate hunters coming after you they would make more challenging targets then your average pve fit careber you would probably get better fights
greetingsjust had a fleeting thought that it would be a nice system to implement the petitions like whitehousegov and changeorg into eve either answered by the csm or even ccp directly for those that dont know lets say you have an ideaproposal you write it up and post it you get so many people to sign it and it goes public and searchable lets say 20 people sign it through you telling them about the idea then i can come around take a look at public and sign petitions that i agree with once it hits a certain number of signatures idk lets say 3000 csm or ccp has to respond to itthought id throw it out there
it would help get the players ideas voiced properlyhowever when there are alliances out there with 1000 members they would dictate most of the suggestions that get through
but even if ccp did respond to them wed still get three near identical nerf cloaks11111111 threads every week
is it ccps job to implement mechanics which specifically encourage 247 alliances rather than leaving it to the players to decide their membership
 thisthe unified inventory debacle is proof of this in my eyes from may to december 2012 we had to deal with how lacking it wasthe excuse ccp unifex uses that a pos revamp would require its own release is just being used to either hold off until this blows over or not do it at all because when they tried to fix the unified inventory it took the release of retribution to fix it sounds to me like they now understand that the ui fix was more than they could handle after the fact and dont want to have another 6 or 7 month window of poses being worse than they are nownow if they went to a modular pos setup most of the in game art and mechanics are already here please see my post on this here by using sanshaguristaserpentisangel stations for the art and player owned outposts for the mechanics examples would be 1 to dock 5 to use modpos services 10 to run jobs from the personal hangar either npc station with skills or from the corporate modpos legacy code could eventually be removed as it wouldnt be used anymore and it solves the securityaccessmanagement problems we all are facing now
screw infiltration i want to have a realistic field of options for providing roles to my membersccp already mentioned custom corp hangars we just need corporations to be revamped altogetherim tired of providing someone a role and they only need to utilize a small portion of it i dont enjoy losing billions of isk thanks to a easy clickanddrag that i knew could happen at any moment when i only want that member to be making ammo i should be able to see exactly what i want my member to be able to do and have options to limit it there is literately so many ways this could be done let me explainim sure a number of you are familiar with conditional formatting in spreadsheets well something like that you stick in starbase fuel technician you have options to specify when andor where the role will work we could be talking specific towers systems constellations regions specific security status minimummaximum isk levels when a specific member is in that system so many thingswhen it comes to corp roles its trust everyone or trust noone some are stupider than the rest some only pretend to know what they are doing
great idea ive seen similar before but this is neatly summed as to what needs to be fixed asap im running an industrial corp myself but im not willing to allow any acces to pos if i ever do set one up as it will be a massive security liabilitynaturally id like to see more borked corp roles fixed but if this at the very least gets fixed we can at least start moving forward
reduce drastically their signature and improve their ai  give a prograing command to return if on fire locked damaged  new pos system new sov system
great news low sec already has gameplay enabled so your goal is achieved without the implementation of your gamebreaking ideaswhat types of gameplay do lowsec mechanics specifically disable here is the trick though try to answer that question without relying on risk aversion by players which mind you is not a mechanic of lowsec
never understood riskaversion in players i started eve in a highsec mining corp for months then immediately left with a couple of my mates formed my own corp put up a platinum moonmining pos in devoidlowsec and proceeded to live out there for months we still operated just fine even with test burning null and lowsec not 3 doors over for days at a time granted im now in a wormhole merc alliance with those same mates and maybe that just says something about the approach i take to the game but seriouslyi have only ever been ganked once in lowsec adn that was my own damn fault i flew an empty bestower into lowsec to pick up 200m3 of trit i had bought a month prior hit a gatecamp a crappy one if i ahd flown anything but an untanked bestower iw oudl have survivedmaybe im biased but lowsec just doesnt seem all that dangerous it seems the reason people avoid it isnt because oh it keeps me from playing its more that they refuse to go anywhere they cant fly an untanked hauler safely plenty of epople could switch to stealthhaulers and change very little about their old highsec routine if they moved to lowsecwow i went on a rant didnt i well would prolly eb better to delete all this crap but i guess ill press post anyways
the op wishes to increase the appeal of lowsec by destroying the appeal of lowsec
exactlythe ops suggestion appears to be making lowsec more akin to hisec in order to incentivise people to move from hisec to lowsec but to what end you have just extended hisec albeit with a very small amount of increased risk and demolished the current lowsec completely and then consider the change from the new lowsec to 00 the gap just got massivethe proposal is pointless and without merit
scamming is legit though maybe not this particular form of scammingpersonally id just remove the order from visibility if the buyer does not have the isk to cover it i dont see why the ingame scc should condone scamming in such a way if theyre the ones controlling the flow of isk in the first place
are you new to eve online scamming has been allowed since forever some of the most noteworthy things to ever happen in the game revolve around scammingi think youre playing the wrong game
phase onethe aim of phase one is to modify sovereignty mechanics to induce alliances to claim sov over fewer systems and increase the level of activity in these systems maintaining and increasing sov level will require high levels of activity within the system which can be disrupted by hostile gangs with the potential to erode sov levels and make the system vulnerable two new game features are introduced military control and system influence1  military controlthis introduces factional warfare style system control mechanics to nullsec the aim is to make gaining sov easy but maintaining and extending sov difficult and dependent on player activity within the sov system11 in each system with alliance sovereignty pirate faction complexes will spawn during downtime each day these sites need to be scanned down and when their acceleration gate is approached within 10km they will be flagged as discovered and visible to anyone on the overview12 pirate faction complexes can only be accessed by certain ship types based on the complex type as per factional warfare mechanics13 initially the acceleration gate can only be activated by members of the sov holding alliance once activated for the first time the complex is set to activated and this status is visible to anyone in the overview flagged differently to discovered status sites once activated anyone can access the site in accordance to ship type restrictions14 the site must be controlled within 1 hour of activation otherwise it reverts to a status of pirate controlled this is an end state the site will be removed at downtime and degrade the systems military control level at that time15 if the sov holding alliance controls the site by destroying all npcs present and orbiting the control button within 10kms for 10 minutes the site is set to alliance controlled status this is an end state the site will be removed at downtime and will increase the military control level at that time16 if the site is controlled by players not in the sov holding alliance the site is set to hostile controlled status this is an end state the site will be removed at downtime and degrade the systems military control level at that time17 military control is graded from 000 lowest to 500 highest when sov is first gained military control is set to 30018 military control will persist and change each downtime as a result of the number or piratehostile controlled and alliance controlled complexes if all complexes are piratehostile controlled at downtime the military control level will fall by 1 point if all complexes are alliance controlled the military control level with increase by 1 point where there is split control this will be applied proportionately19 a systems effective sov level which counts for bonuses and the system upgrades that can be installed is the lower of the strategic level based on days occupancy as per current mechanics and the military control level hence where military control levels fall below the strategic level any system upgrades depending on that level will be offlined jump bridges cyno generators cyno jammers also bonuses from system upgrades will operate at the lower effective sov level note upgrades that have been offlined will still count towards sov costs110 once a tcu is onlined the system is invulnerable to attack until the military control level falls below 200 above this level sbus cannot be anchored or onlined111 if military control falls below level 100 and this is sustained for 7 days the systems infrastructure hub and outpost if present will immediately become vulnerable and will stay vulnerable until military control is raised to level 200 or higher2  system influencea new concept of system influence will be introduced the purpose of this feature is to allow sov systems to project influence to surrounding systems which provide sovlike benefits without the need to maintain sov in the influenced systems21 every system with sovereignty will extend system influence to nearby systems the strength of the system influence will depend on the effective sov level of the system the lower of the strategic level and military control level22 system influence will have the same strength as the sov systems effective sov level in all adjacent systems via stargates and decrease by 1 point for each subsequent jump for example a sov level 1 system will have influence strength 1 in all adjoining systems and a sov level 3 system will have influence strength 3 in adjoining systems strength 2 in all systems 2 jumps away and strength 1 in all systems 3 jumps away23 where two or more alliances have overlapping system influence the alliance with the higher influence level will have influence for that day when influence levels are the same the alliance with the higher military control level in their sov system will be deemed to have influence24 an alliance that holds influence over a system will receive the same bonuses in the influenced systems as received in the sov system eg pos fuel discount moon mining pi and mining yields25 pi can only be installed in a system with alliance sov or influence if influence is lost the pi yield will be reduced to zero offlined where influence has been lost for more than 7 days all alliance pi infrastructure will be destroyed
contd3  outpoststo compensate for the reduced number of systems likely to be held by alliances the following changes will be made to outposts31 outpost manufacturing and research slots will be increased by a factor of 432 outposts will be able to be repackaged to facilitate their storage and relocation this is possible at sov level 533 outposts can be selfdestructed with a 7 day timer during the 7 day selfdestruct cycle all outpost services are disabled and anyone can access the outpost to facilitate retrieval of items this is possible at sov level 3 if destroyed an outpost leaves an invulnerable core in place that contains any items held within the outpost at the time of destruction if a new outpost is built in the same system as a core any items held within the core will be accessible by their original owners in the new outpost depending on outpost access settings and the core will selfdestruct4  sov costs41 the cost of maintaining sovereignty will be increased in phase one to reflect the likely fewer number of sov systems held by an alliance by a factor of 5 cost will be split between an isk cost and a fuel cost in the same manner as pos eg pos fuel pi manufactures etc 42 fuel will be required by the systems infrastructure hub this transition will help ensure sov is maintained by local activity rather than just isk which can be transmitted across the universe instantly5  force projectionto limit the ability of alliances to project force over large distances in order to promote smaller local wars jump drive capable ships will be changed as follows51 normal jumps to a cyno will require a 30 minute cooldown before the jump drive can be used again52 jumping from a cyno generator will be introduced as a new feature approach cyno generator rightclick cyno generator and select jump to xxx jumping from a cyno generator to either a cyno or another cyno generator does not require a 30 minute cooldown53 jump bridges will be permitted for alliance members use only and not usable by dreadssuperstitansthe intent of this change is to force dreads base from systems with cyno generator making their placement a strategic decision the cooldown will limit their use in battle but will not prevent transit across large distances for migrations
contd phase twothis phase will involve a general boost to industry in nullsec enabling nullsec alliance to be self supporting and at the same time create barriers to highvolume trade between nullsec and empire6  industry boost61 new system upgrades will be available that greatly boost the yield of moon mining pi asteroid mining and ice miningpi booster  boosts all pi yields and processing times eg by 20 x effective sov levelmoon mining booster  boosts moon mining yield eg by 20 x effective sov levelice mining booster  boosts ice mining yield eg by 20 x sov levelsystem scan array  uncovers scannable mining sites containing rich ores quantity and quality graded by effective sov level62 outpost manufacturing and research slots will be increased in number and have increased efficiency and speed63 if ccp agree to a pos revamp industry could be moved from outposts to pos with the same bonuses but this can be done as part of a separate initiative7  logisticsto encourage industry to move to nullsec prevent the importation of highvolumelowvalue goods from empire and also hinder nullsec alliances from dumping lower cost goods in empire the following changes will be made71 jump freighters will lose the ability to initiate jumps from high security and low security systems72 steps can be taken to foster trade within nullsec and between nullsec and empire of highvaluelowvolume goods using blockade runners this needs to be developed further but examples such as booster production and expedited bpo research already exist8  sov costs81 the cost of maintaining sovereignty will be further increased in phase two as a result of the industry boost cost will be split between a reduced isk cost and an increased fuel costphase threethis would involve implementation of the farms and fields concept widely discussed elsewhere in summary this involves increasing the number of industrial structures and industrial activities that can be disrupted by small gangs this will create increased opportunities to disrupt alliances and generate opportunities for pvp as alliances defend their space
there are plenty of suggestions that i have seen that would allow a large alliance to live in a relatively small well used amount of space there are plenty of suggestions that i have seen that would force an alliance to live in a small amount of space there are suggestions in both categories that i like parts or even all ofthis is not one of them
the primary effort isnt really to force a large alliance into a small space its to move industry and market out to 00 i think regardless how ccp chooses to limit the scope of an alliances influence in unused space the current controlling interest wouldnt like it if the sov fuel lasted sufficiently long alliances could still claim large areas of space
the sov system used to be tied to the pos systemit was even worse and didnt limit claiming large areas of space either
i guess you didnt read the minutes well enough ccp didnt have a problem with alliances holding sov in systems they werent using they only disliked this if it prevented smaller groups from moving into the spacealso as was discussed in the minutes the issue isnt a lack of desire to move industry into 00 its a lack of ability to do industry in 00 because of the poor distribution of lowend minerals and the lack of industry slotsyour idea places another logistical hassle on owning space without fixing the lack of industrial capacity
there are many suggestions outside my own to do that that ive seen and like as wellthis isnt one of them so long as the relevant systems were well executed im fine with it ive got some interesting ideas based on discussions with one of our sov experts in that regard even
the alliance control and ability for small groups to move in go handinhand i thought requiring this effort would be an excellent way of allowing small alliances to negotiate control of areas while acting in partnership with nearby power houses that didnt prioritize themive been told from some folks in 00 that industry has no place out there that they arent even wanted if the limits were strictly lack of slots and lack of low end minerals although that was discussed and they had a plan for it then those things would be taken care of in a hot fix both would be quite easy to implement
back when i pitched my wildly underread sovnullsec reform package modeled on the farms and fields design i actually came to a lot of the same conclusions you did i think the best way of allowing small alliances a space in nullsec would be to create an incentive for larger alliances to tolerate nonrival alliances on their borders
exactly my point
oh god yes it is an awesome idea imo sheriffs should get very substantial amounts of concord lp for each pirate killpenalties for sheriffs are simple penalty sec status and lp substractionany act that causes suspect or criminal flag
i managed somehow to delete my reply
i mean we dont really need an eve version of twitter do wenor would it be wise to have the local chat window expand into an eve version of facebook would itand noone is going to go to ccp and say we have raised the money to buy you the tools you need to make us happier will they
there are the ingame chat channels for all those middle aged men with female avatarsmost of an eve players in game time is spent avoiding another player in one way or the other why would you want to see their faces if theres a nuclear holocaust and evetards are the last group of people alive from hiding out in their mothers basements i wouldnt want to socialize with them
thats sad because in the event of nuclear holocaust this basement my family has been over the last 30 eyars doubles as a nuclear fallout shelter complete with a hydroponic garden armory shooting range a whole towns worth of mres environmental suits and enough dvdsblurays to last you decadesbut if you dotn like socializing with eve players thats too badbut seriously i wil never leave this basement theres just no reason too
dont forget about these forums in the ingame browser theyre way better than any incharacter inclient social networking systems that elder scrolls online can createits good to know that youll be alive after the holocaust as i may need you to grind some standing for me
i agree with what he said please bring the j something box back nowlocation music sounds like a great idea but all i do is mine so i only hear one song and that song does not work well with my narcoleptic tendancies use alttab everyone keeps telling me yes yes i know but how about just put back the truely awesome feature that was one of the main reasons i fell in love with this game a built in music player that i can use my own custom mp3s every game should have this option previous games that let you do something similar never really got it right eve online was the first one that worked exactly the way i needed it to it was freaking awesome and you know it please put it back
awesome idea 1
1no changes to whthey are fineyou can add c7
signedrecruitment
completely agree with you there is a great deal that needs to be fixed 
100 from me seriously this simple change would alleviate many issues bumping for love for roles and linked in
dont you forget about me
but caps are really slow so if youre not at knife fight range youre completely immune to this
275 of a capitals max speed would come to around 300ms for most capitals the damn things going to hit you once it starts moving its a valid point though perhaps that speed could be applied as the damage but have an animation much like the mjd
if you jump dreads in at 30 itll take 100 seconds for a thanatos moving 300ms to hit youassuming all skills to v it will take 45 seconds for one seiged moros to destroy said thanatos assuming it is in structure and running a dciialso having it be impossible to stop said thanatos from ramming would be rather overpowered dont you think
i have a better suggestion why not make it so players can truly be the police in lowsec by having concord give security status gains instead of penalties for engaging players with a negative security status who are known criminals it increases pvp increases gameplay and improves the spirit of fighting
over a year ago i was one of many who brought a proposal to the table to overhaul the mercenary system the system was essentially nonexistent there was no way to ensure mercenaries were paid for the work they did and the wardec system was jacked up by having to wait to declare war to help a corp many ideas were brought forth and after recently coming back from a break i see theres been many changes which at first look seem to be for the betterone feature i suggested however didnt get added although back then it got quite a bit of support because of that i wanted to propose it again its my firm belief that pvp in highsecnullsec would be improved if players were rewarded by concord for shooting players who are known criminals or aggressive towards other individuals by giving them sec status gains like they do for killing npcs in belts not everyone wants to go grinding for sec status all the time myself included it would be a benefit to gain sec status for doing what i love doing in this game and thats shooting other players who also enjoy combati propose that any player with a 20 sec be agressible in lowsec without global criminal flagging and that any player with 24 or below be aggressible in high sec without concord interventionthe prosa it encourages moar combat amongst players in highsec  lowsec by concord not lowering your sec status but raising itb it gives players who hate grinding for sec status the opportunity to earn it a different way and again encourages more pvp in lowsecc it gives the bounty hunter career an added bonus to collecting bountiesd it provides mercenaries a way to focus on their targets at hand after having to suicide gank someone or several persons as part of a contracte it adds to the fun of eve without giving one side an overbearing advantagethe consi really havent found one as of yet but thats why im looking for your input i dont see how it can be exploited so long as you dont receive credit for shooting neg sec pilots in your own corp or alliance i welcome your input and appreciate your support csm please give this some thought and bring it forth to the devs
this sounds like a good idea to me 1
how about automatic bounties placed on pirates by ccp that could really liven things up
 seeing the flashing red sec status decrease approaching  the person you have to worry about on your way to jita because you gank people i like how youve tiered the pros in the description too overall great enhancement idea fitting apparent
ok lets move this up againccp wants to find ways to remove plex from gamethey did a resculp for plex which is a vanity itemlets have a remove skills for plex another vanity itemwhy you ask because some of us have too much isk to spend  we are ocd
what a complete waste of time
do you expect anything more out of this thread that hasnt been said alreadycitation needed
as someone else said already lowering your clone cost isnt a vanity thingmaking your character worse is i guess but really even in a perfect world where no accounts were ever hackedborrowedwhatever youd still get people putting in petitions to get thier skills back when the next patch rolls around and fixes or buffs whatever they deleted
i am sorry but removing the mining lvl 2 skill  the stupid pi skills i injected is not making my character worse and no matter what ccp buffs i will never inject these skills again p
your premise of involvement of real money is flawed therefore your context of the margin trading scam being tantamount to theft is likewise incorrectlet me elaborate you pay real money for plex this is where the link to real money is concluded though your plex thereafter converts into isk or gametime whatever your preference may be and neither of these things has any real money value from that point on why because there are no legal mechanisms in the game that will allow any player to convert their isk or gametime into real money therefore there is really no theft of real money in eveUFFFD ever you have to be careful what you are insinuating by suggesting that a game condones an illegal activity especially when there is no real basis for ityour isk is scammed from you because you failed to detect what was clearly a too good to be true marketcontract dealits a tough break but you have to learn to spot these types of scams its a part of the eve learning experience and it holds true for every activity undertaken in eve
lots of people like to solo myself included should it be a requirement of the game that everyone must fly in a gangstupid comment of the day either that or poor attempted troll
this idea starts with control of ones space being based upon something that if i read it right could spawn at any time in any timezone which those attempting to own space have no control over whatsoever that alone makes it pretty awful and the fact that it gets close to a few good ideas does nothing to redeem ityou get points for putting in the effort to try to build a complete system though
a good point fixed that now the sites would all spawn during downtime they can be activated only my sov alliance members so they have complete control over when during the day the sites would be opened to be contested
thats great its still a poor idea in my opinion i do not think some involvement of structures should ever go away for a formalized sovereigntybased ownership system though other styles of living in or using space can coexist such as the concepts susan black describes here however i do think that use of space should play a role however id prefer to see the overall level of sovereignty affected and boosted directly via actual use the general idea along those lines ive been thinking about is to first make sovereignty far more granular far more finely divided than five levels then feed the existing two indices military and industrial into it in some way finetuning them as necessary currently high military is easy to maintain high industry is hard perhaps new indices could be developed as well all based on disruptable player activitysovereignty now is governed to some degree by usage  no longer do you just claim a system and eventually tick up to maximum level and indeed the level of sovereignty achieved passively would be heavily limited for example if this new system were on a 1100 scale the highest you could achieve by taking control of a system and then not using it would be 20 for example below 20 there would be few defensive benefits available if any reinforcement timers on structures would be highly randomized or perhaps present in 24h increments so if your attacker hits it in their prime it comes back out in their prime the structures themselves could even have a reduction in hp however if you start to make use of the system it becomes more defensible hp gets higher you get finer and finer control over reinforcement timers defensive structures eg cyno jammers become available etcthe goal then is that the defensibility of your sovereign space is tied to but not completely reliant on how much you use the space and more importantly is tied to usage in a variety of ways mining ratting production especially if it moved to crunchy modular pos in the far future how much pi your members do etc rather than being tied to usage by a single or several glorified fw complexes contesting or weakening a defenders control over their space can then start by targeting their myriad forms of carebearing though a sufficiently powerful invader could simply go straight for the throat obviously its not a fully thought out idea and im sure there are quirks that havent occurred to me that would need be addressed i absolutely disagree with the idea of crippling the ability for trade to flow between high and null however i also acknowledge that ccp has made noises about limiting force projection but dont really like your proposal for doing it
id be interested to hear your reasons why trade flow between nullsec and empire for highvolumelowvalue goods eg tritanium etc should be preserved if nullsec is to have selfsupporting industry this link must be severed for goods transported in freightersjump freighters otherwise buffing nullsec industry will just reverse the flow of these goods trade in lowvolumehighvalue goods can continue via blockade runners and this should be encouragedif a nullsec alliance is forced to develop local industry to build ships ammo installations and fuel then there is no need for an artificial industry index to encourage this activitywell have to agree to disagree on the broad approach to sov i think this should depend purely on military force with all other activities implied by the need to build and maintain this
if an alliance has both the interested producers and the interested miners theyll develop local industry if they have one or the other perhaps they continue to import finished goods or export the minerals or both they should not however be forced to do anything nor should any such mechanisms to force them to have selfsupporting local industry be required if the entire system is appropriately balanced in other words if an entity wishes to live as a martial band holding a small pocket of space that they supply from empire as a base to burn and pillage their neighbors they should be allowed tothe point of such an index would not be to encourage such activity but reward it to give an additional or alternative route to improving their control over a system perhaps a system has poor ratting and mining potential but has a great setup for pos based productionat the end of the day taking and holding sovereignty in the system i described comes down to military force i do not think holding sov should depend purely on military force if an alliance is industry and mining oriented and is able to overcome the need for military force through either careful diplomacy or the use of mercenaries thats awesome  they should be allowed to
lets see the changes required to make it even possible never mind actually being preferrable for an alliance to support itself out of its own space before we start talking about choking off linksyou may wish to recall that not all alliances come with a fully fledged industrial wing and that these take time to develop also that not all 00 space holds all resources  most of drone space is cripplingly short of mexallon for instance and good luck supplying your ship building industry with that from blockade runnersand finally as mynnna say whilst its certainly reasonable to rebalance the advantages of a gameplay style or economic strategy its not so reasonable to force them if nothing else it will take time to change the vector of the cultural momentum that 00 has built up and simply trying to enforce that by fiat will just cause huge resentment
remark 1st post changed to reflect discussion and its not necessary to read the whole message thread  and tried to change some grammar as well
bump3
thanatos dies either way so to the pilot it makes no difference i agree that you should be able to shoot down a kamikaze carrier but maybe you could implement some sort of all power to the hull system where resistances shoot up during a kamikaze run id hate to see immortal carriers bringing down all sorts of other ships but at the same time i also would like to see the mechanic actually make a difference
so if say my alt was in an npc corp and i got this alt to 21 by ganking stuff then picked a quiet highsec system repeatedly ganked the said alt with my negative status main id be what 50 in no time
pretty much what i was going to say use an alt for ganking or simply smartbomb jita to get neg sec status then go somewhere and blow the snot out of your alt to farm sec statuswe all know what eve is like any gains to be generated by player against player actions will be exploitedjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the amount of gain would be important and as with npcs the gain in security status should be appropriate to the lossso if it was worth blowing up a bunch of battleships for you to get your security status up then sure you could fasttrack it but i think the price in that case would be sufficient that exploit would not be the correct term for it
i am sure this proposal will not go down easily but i believe it needs to be made and implemented at some point in the futureccp seems to be getting better and better at chasing down botters and rmt if we find any and we have good reasons to believe someone is breaking the eula do we use petitions to report them nothing further needs to be said at this pointthe sandbox principle works fine for all matters that take place inside of it players need not fear the loss of their ships and playing with a players fear of a ship loss is part of the game however players do need to fear the loss of their accounts as a means to prevent eula violations and it is not a matter of the game play within the sandbox itself accusations of eula violations are not required to have fun in evein eve there are players who use accusations of eula violations as a means to pvp while players are being harassed with spaceships are they often accused of being bots and to be breaking the eula because this is a play style which leaves the sandbox should players be protected from it to give a good meaning to the fear of eula violations and to preserve the good fun within the sandbox to stay with the sandbox analogy  it does not need kids in the sandbox who shout give me your shovel or ill tell your dadas such do i propose that any such accusations by means other than with petitions should be taken as a violation of its own and receive recognition by ccp meaning players who make such accusations as part of their play style to grief and harass other players should receive a warning ingame as well as when done on the forumsi believe by giving it more recognition will it not only lead to a better game play but also to more players taking eula violations more seriously
i think i see what youre getting at here but i want clarification before i respondbasically the situation i think you are describing is something likeim mining happily doing my own thing when some guy comes in local starts harrassing me and threatens to report me to ccp for botting unless i do xy and z things that hed demanding i do plus hell blow up my spaceship if i dont complyis that about the size of your issue
there is no size involved here
i have deleted a few off topic posts here
snipped discussion of moderation  ccp eternei still cannot see what size it is you are asking me aboutam i being accused of making a petty proposal
i am going to assume that english is not your first language since youre not getting the idiomallow me to rephraseis that an accurate summary of the problem you are proposing to solve with this thread
if i understand correctly his problem is ppl smacking drama in local about how hes going to get you banned for eula violation instead of quietly file a petition and let ccp sort it outtheres a merit in this 1threatening players with imagined backing of authority is akin to posing as gm and is already a bannable offense in most mmos this is especially acute in eve aka spreadsheet online where botting consists of ocr bots that do not use code injection and thus impossible to positively identifyproven banning for botting is merely a matter of educated guess
by no means it is about protecting the dignity of the players further than before by forbidding accusations of eula violations players should simply not be allowed to verbally accuse others of being bots or of grief playi have seen it a lot and i believe that all this i shoot you you are a bot and you shot me you are a griefer needs to be put down and to force players to play a little bit more seriously so we can leave some of the whining and smacking behind it sure does not make for a great game experience instead i believe the proposal will make eve a better game
ok yeah i was way offfor the record i think youre fighting a losing battle
why
not necessarily like i said threatening players with imagined backing of authority is already a bannable offense in most mmos ranging from huge themepark mmos like wow thats closely controlled to small ones like salem thats far more hardcore than eve you died biomassed no clones game overmay not guarantee it will happen in eve but precedents are all over the place in wide range of mmos
threatening other players and being accused of eula violations is almost commonplace in eve so much so that most people dont take the accusation seriously anymore i certainly do not mostly because i took the time to actually read the rules so i know what i can get away withit would also be very hard to enforce such a policy hell racism sexism and various other sensitive things are not allowed to be said in eve and yet you see it everywhere sit at a trade hub one day and read peoples ship names some of them are really funnyi highly doubt that ccp would ever find enough gms to scrub and enforce what people say outside of the very worst examples like develdrin said it is a losing battledignity is overrated it makes you concerned about things that you should not be concerned about
i assume you have little knowledge on human rights or only the rights within the european union of which iceland is trying to become a member of it will surprise you to know dignity is being recognized in article 1 of the fundamental rights to the european union which is possibly why you think of it as being overrated therefore will i not discuss dignity with you if you want to know more can you find plenty of information about it on the internetfurther does it not mean it needs an army of gms and isds to introduce this it will simply be another rule just like discussion of moderation is not allowed is a rule there is no need to ban lots of players what it needs is to create an awareness among the players that such a play style is unwanted new players will pick it up much faster than older ones however those who play eve long enough will already not violate it because i believe a lot of us are rather sick of itthis lets me believe that the battle has already been won and ccp only needs to declare the winner who then does not see the point of it will be made aware of it in the usual way first through leniency then through warnings then with temp bans
oh youre one of those peopleunderstand youre on the internet sir take nothing too seriously and understand the common rules of decencymorality as you understand them do not apply here especially in a game where bad behavior is not only encouraged but rewarded
no it would simply take the discussion further away from the topic which is about the introduction of a new game rule you wouldnt take your own comment now and call it on topic would you
actually it is somewhat on topic but perhaps i should clarifyi reject your argument for the new rule based on your premise that such a change is necessary to protect peoples dignity no such protection is necessary because if someone has not done nothing wrong they have nothing to fear if they do fear such a threat then i invite them to read the eula itself so they better know what they can and cannot do information and understanding is poweredit i would like to add what people can perceive as a threat is extremely subjective people talking about or quoting the eula can appear to be nonthreatening even when they are making a clear threat to another the same can be done in reverse
how does everyone know they did not do something wrong when many young players have difficulties interpreting the eula in the first place in the end is the interpretation of the eula entirely left to ccp we have no say in it and as such is a discussion about the rules of no help a rule which forbids accusations of eula violations on the other hand is quite easy to understand and shuts all arguments discussions and accusations up one rule to rule them all it gets everyone back to the game lets players dust off and get up faster than any whining or smacking ever can all it currently does is to lead to fixed mindsets and emotional trench warfare it would be nice to get rid of some of it
let me spell it out for youhis demise had nothing to do with ecm and everything with him being alone fighting a larger fleet you can solo all u like just dont  and whine about it when u die to superior numbers the ecm ship could just as well have been a logistics boat or another ewar vessel the result would have been exactly the same he dies and kills nothing
i agree with your point ideally both playstyles should be possible if deep nullsec receives a greater industry buff than nullsec adjoining lowsecempire then those alliances that wish to develop industrial selfsufficiency will gravitate to deep nullsec and those that wish to keep their umbilical cord to empire will stay close to lowsecempire the key is getting the balance right to ensure industry is viable in both nullsec and empireas long as nullsec industry is desirable as a means of producing the material required for a nullsec alliance then incorporating some sort of bonus to sov from an industry level can fit within my proposal perhaps higher industry levels can reduce the strength of the npcs occupying the pirate faction complexes or have an effect on system influence so for example where two alliances have the same system influence level in an influenced system the alliance with the higher military control and industry level gain influence over the systemin this example diplomacy means depending on somebody elses military force and mercenaries even more explicitly either strategy is perfectly viable under my proposal in fact corporations and alliances with strong industry will be even more valued under my proposal as their capabilities will be greatly needed they will be the new tech moons
voting is anonymous so actually it would be extremely hard to fulfill your request general we do have constituents though several established and reliable ways to talk to them or prominent figures in any subgroups representing them and relatively large networks of information gathering in general otherwise wed have been hard pressed to get elected in the first place  we also interact on twitter podcasts blogs news site interviews and interactive town halls in addition to being available by eve mail and private convo as for not knowing who the csm representatives are after you read the minutes id say yes you havent looked hard enough not sure if troll or just stupid but i was bored and thought id respond for the benefit of other players happening upon this threadopinions of eve players are not very difficult to find separating the signal from the noise however can be difficult aiding with that and acting as advocates for players behind closed doors are two very important functions of the csm ccp never has to actually do anything we suggest but recent history has born out that our advice should not be too hastily disregarded incarnasummer of rage unlimited alliesdec shield exploits the current pos stuff and can in fact push things in a good direction numerous feature refinements logistic frigates bounty hunting revamp planning a long term view of eve developmentalso for the benefit of other players the wiki is based on the csm white paper our founding document both of which are horrifically outdated as discussed in the minutes csm7 has managed to convince ccp xhagen to update them this month we hope hopefully such an update will include locking  archiving this assembly hall forum which has not served a functional role in the csm process for almost 2 years and really just confuses new players

this is one of the most upvoted proposals on the csms assembly hall but it didnt get much from their meetingseleene brought up the topic of offgrid boosting and fozzie responded that technical limitations were the only reason it continued to exist fozzie could not comment on when this issue would be resolved and stated that UFFFDone day veritas will come up to me and say UFFFDhey i fixed offgrid boostingUFFFDUFFFD but he had no idea on a potential timeframe for this sort of miracle elise emphasized that while offgrid boosting was an issue just the simple way that bonuses are applied in a fleet is flawed
i like the idea of ramming speed op has put allot of thought into it however after reading the mechanics behind the idea i can tell you as a pirate i can exploit the children out of thishere is what would make me mean it instead of making me lulz at the expense of othersthe skill is expensive and takes the same mount of time to train as the titan skillevery level of this skill would modify how much damage my death would cause instead of a speed multiplier the ships warp drive would overload breaking the hold of any points using the targeted ship as the focal point for the warp core this overload would actually act as an interdiction point as well as preventing the ship from docking or jumping basically pinning it in space basically once you choose this road theres no turning back for either of you take the total of the ships maximum structure hps modified by the pilots skills and them multiply like solvl 1 2lvl24lvl36lvl48lvl510this way you do a decent amount of damage and have a good chance at getting some revenge after all if your willing to suicide under this system it would have to be for revenge becauseeach time i use it i would sacrifice a level of the last skill ive trained in addition i loose one full level of my suicide skillalso if i suicide at lvl 1 i loose the entire skill and have to repurchase itanother idea id like to see is making the normal self destruct on caps to have an option to cause damage like the old amarian super weapon it would have all the same penalties as ramming speed but would just blow up at the end it could disrupt warp drives giving smaller vessels a chance to run for it or maybe just so i can say run you cowards before i vaporize them obviously freighters wouldnt get this weaponized version
the problem isnt that the pirates would be in dangerthe problem is jerk like me and my buddies who would use this to kill every hauler that was brave enough to jump inwhen you jump in your about 13km of the gate bombs have a blast radius of 15km last i checkedi have already had great success plugging gates with 6k radius smartbombs on their way out with bombs i could get them comming in too no one would ever make it through low sec againeasy fix infuse low sec with an attribute that kills bombs area of effect down to 45kor create a secondary ammo type that they can use that can be fired like a torpedo and trades power for tracking so instead of 6k base damage it would have say 3ki could use something like this to hunt solo targets with a wolf pack i could take down almost anything but it would be useless for gate campingright then game on 
the incentives never work the persistent idea that we need more players to low and null sec just isnt going to happen without diminishing risk to pointlessly low levels i dont see the proposal as being pointless just not all that workable that being said eve probably has most of the nonrisk averse players already customer growth will either be slow or the risk will diminish if that happens the player losses will have to be surpassed by the growth more safety more losses more growth repeatconversely the push for more pvp can only produce more complaints since the main source of new opposition remains new players or risk averse players or players such as myself unable to pvp effectivelythe game is mostly fine kindly dont make it squishy
the price difference between npc ships and player ships doesnt scale so well though you can have a multibillion rookie ship or a 50ish mil unfit battlecruiser also npcs do not have pods and implants so if isk lost is going to guide secstatus gain might as well make a mechanic where you can directly pay forbuy sec status from concordeither way i dont think that your proposal is as much of a conflict driver as you may think and is definitely open for exploiting
so basically this is a roundabout way to pay for security statusi have a few battleships lying around that i can insure and blow up
easy they read it and ask questions about the bits they dont understandi know this is a foreign concept to most people scroll down click accept but it does help to make it a habit and prevents a lot of stress in the long run true some of the rules will always be there to legally cover ccps ass but other rules are there because certain behaviors were actually destructive to their playerbase and discussed at length by the players and gmsdevs eg harrassment and new player griefingthreatening someone with the eula does neither of the above because again words are extremely subjective and they dont have any real power unless you give them that power either out of ignorance or true belief
besides what shah has already pointed out consider the following if we already troll with fake threats of eula violation reports whats going to happen when you make eula violation threats petitionablepeople are immediately going to threaten to report people for threatening to report eula violations itll turn into a constant swarming storm of garbage that will in the end only cause more problems for ccpbesides that i highly doubt ccp doesnt have rules for people who impersonate gms if theyre already posted somewhere im going to feign ignorance to where they are because im too lazy to look it up
what he said is his opinion and i will not argue it but respect itto answer your question what will happen when goons make it a method to accuse players of eula violations is that we then have a means to stop you or what would be the purpose of goons going around and threatening to get players banned if not for you wanting to take away their accounts you would only be trying to get others kicked out of the sandbox if you do this for joy or if it breaks your heart is of no relevance
1 just because they threaten people with the eula doesnt mean that it carries any weight they are only trying to scare people through their own ignorance which is a perfectly allowable tactic though to be fair its a metagame tactic not a gameplay thing but eve has gained a reputation for blurring the two2 you are aware that goons or whatever group will adapt and turn it right back around right instead of threatening you with the eula they will report you as soon as you mention the eula and get you in trouble and youll be back to square one because you havent changed anyones core behavior just the content of it
1 no threatening players over something that resides inside the sandbox is ok and good fun threatening players over something that resides outside the sandbox including the sandbox itself is not2 absolutely i believe it will teach players to stop thinking about the eula rules and to simply play the gamei have no doubt that for some will an introduction of such a rule be difficult to handle but who would these players be i imagine the extremest of the highsec carebears perhaps but not goons
dear csm membersi have read through the winter summit minutes especially regarding null sec i think there may be another way to solve the problem as all of you mention in the winter summit blobbing and small corp difficulty in entering null sec seems to be the probleminstead of changing all the mechanics perhaps there is another way as i see it the problem is super power blocks i think if the corp and alliance system was change a little the problem might be solved i am not claiming to be an expert regarding null sec and i dont claim that the suggestion to follow will solve all the problem but it might solve a fewstep 1 limit corporation and alliance sizesperhaps if we limited corporation to a maximum size of 250 members and then limit an alliance to 5 perhaps 10 corps this will perhaps creare multiple alliances with max size thus making over kill fleets less of a factorstep 2 local view in null seclocal view in null sec should not show you peoples names nor their corp or alliance unless you belong to the same corp or alliance eg entering a null sec system i see 10 corpalliance members and 34 unknown pilotsi believe its important not to be able to see another players name or alliance until youve received the killmail as alliances will then simple have unofficial alliance and thus avoid seeing shoot people because they can see the name and corp and alliance whereas an unknown threat will only be known once killed deadstep 3 delay killmail by 3060the reason being other wise each fleet kills one of the opposing fleets member checks the kill mail to see if they are friendly and then move on without conflictrandom fleets should still be possiblepeople should still be able to group with other people randomly and as long as they are part of your fleet you should be able to see their name and alliance ticker this will then also make provisions for empire fleets to invade null sec for the fun of itthis suggestion also solves a few other problems 1 fc wont necessarily be called primary first2 member wont necessarily die alphabetically3 the possibility of 3  infinite directional fight increase as i wouldnt know if the other people on the grid or in system are from the same or two different alliances in fact my fleet might jump through a gate into a battle i would not know which side is which unless they are corp or alliance mateswhy i believe super powers are the problemits very simple this is how blobbing started alliance a form a fleet of 200 to assault delve alliance b who control delve get the scouting report of 200 inbound alliance b drums up a fleet of 1000 to counter alliance as fleetone week later alliance a arrives with a 1000 member fleet alliance b responds by creating a 2000man fleet now if there was a limit to alliance sizes this escalation would have a limitin closingperhaps this is a simplistic view or the view of someone who knows to little about null sec but i thought i post and see what the response is like perhaps it get flamed most probable and perhaps not very unlikelyso wouldnt it be cool to see 40 alliances with 1000 members versus 10 alliances with 6000 members
the best thing about eve is the drop off however ccp obviously stole this from finding nemodont believe me observeplayer1 hey noob need any help mission grindingplayer2no thanks im just ratting right now its kind of funplayer1ahh cool cool where are you ratting maybe ill join youplayer2rancerthe dropp offfinding nemo
um kib4l for no content
locking this for lack of content
my proposal is to put making modular pos as an expansion theme for winter 2013 to the voteif the ayes have it 50 1 ccp must commit all its recources to itthe voting should be held by ccp to give all players the posibility to vote including the chinese server they have the resources to give us the ability to vote for csm so should we have this theme as a subject
bump
still want thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
bump
i am not a very assiduous reader of that forum and i apologise if the idea i am bringing before you has been exposed and objected alreadyas a nullsec player i have an alt most of my corpmates and alliance fellows have alts as well its so useful that its almost mandatory to get at least one other character to help you do stuff mining transport scouting what have youmy main character and my alt learn their skills at approximately the same speed with attributes and implants giving them boost where they need themok so thats how it works as of nowseeing that having alt is so important i have seen extreme cases of people multiboxing 20 characters at a time and i have no problem with thatbut i wonder if new players experience and also people that can only have one account at a time whatever the reason would not be improved if being active on a character actually made the skill learning quicker according to what activity the character is doing skill points bonuses would be earned as you are actually doing what the skill is abouti havent put a thourough system up how would science abstract skills get speeded i dont really know i wanna hear ideas but it would encourage people to actually do stuff instead of sitting around and waitingwhy not offer skill points as a mission reward as well it would speed up the training of assiduous players without removing anything to the othersit seems normal to me that a singlecharacter player would get more reward than someones 31st alt that never does anythingtldr reward player actions missions ratting mining pvp heck flying in space why not with skill points if the activity has a link with the skill being learnedwhat do you guys thinkedita handful of examples when learning a spaceship command skill lets say amarr cruiser v for instance flying an amarr cruiser effectively gives out more skill points it might be even better to attribute skill points in function of a players action so that just sitting in space doesnt give out the bonus when learning an industry such as refining bonus sps are rewarded in function of the volume and type of refined materials when learning a gunnery skill shooting at stuff will give out sps bonuses when learning an ecm skill using ecm modules gives out sps bonusesill try and come up with a more detailed list with ideas for skills that dont directly relate to an activity
queues up caldari battleship vorbits a pos in rokhgoes to work comes home to extra bonus skillpoints
which is why i stated there should be some sort of timeout measuring the actual activity of a player rendering afk mining the only actual activity that could give out those bonuses and perhaps cloaking as wellmaybe i should explain more mining and cloaking are activities that do not require much player operation to be actually usedfor the spaceship command skills it is simple to understand that your character would learn more about his ship if he uses it for some stuff rather than just orbiting a pos
you havent answered the most important question of all  why does training need to speed up in the first place
well for any player that comes from another game having to wait 3 years without any action from you to speed it up other than implants to get in some ships is discouragingthis system would lower the entry barrier of eve by rewarding active players over inactive ones that way people that come from another universe dont get so discouraged and have an incentive to keep playing and it also means losing because there is value in actionas it stands now the value of action is in isk and isk only i think the game would be improved by adding anothere interest to actually move your ship around in space and do thingsand theres a part of me that finds it unfair that a player that is on the game a lot and does stuff masters things at exactly the same rate and speed as someones never used 31st altthis addition wouldnt take anything from anyone whilst rewarding the active persons without removing any interest you can have in having alts hence only making the game more attractive to new player without taking anything from the vets winwin situation as it seems to me
this is the response i was expecting to be honest people that think this way are caught up in the model that other mmos have where catching up to vets is an issue eve doesnt have that problem precisely because of how the skill system is set upthere is no catching up to be had once you reach level 5 in a skill youre just as good at that skill as any other maxed character in the game your system would in fact benefit older players more than newer ones simply because an older player would have more skills that are applicable to any given situation which would translate to more bonus sp from any given activity than a newer player with fewer applicable skillsthe simple fact is that there is no ship in eve that takes you three years of training to be able to fly you can in theory obtain the bare minimum skills to fly a titan in about nine or ten months if you max out your training and remap at the right times you wont be able to fly it well but you will be able to fly it and any player that is discouraged by the amount of time training takes in eve is probably getting some bad though well intentioned adviceeve doesnt need an active skilling system  for one thing because some skills dont have activities associated with them and for another because it wouldnt close the gap between new players and old ones it would widen it
to give ppl a reason to log inas devs already stated sub cancellations follows a period of no in game activities aside from logging in to update skill queues this will keep some of these people in eve and no ppl wont stay in game just for that is not a valid excuse against this proposal some people will some wont its just a matter of numbers in each group theres no all or none in this it helps to some extent
oh sorrysits in amarr bs puts alt in something tanky shoots alt for entire work day insteadbetter
and only the first 30 minutes of your entire workday gave you the training speed bonus for the day read the post youre replying to before you hit reply its already covered youre making a fool out of yourself by not reading
but no timeout measure can actually measure player activity i mean lets say im bashing an abandoned highsec pos with my oracle takes a while so i just leave it alone to do its thing thats still me actively trying to achieve something or say im burning deep safes in a claw still doing something even if im afk or hauling or mucking about with a sentry ishtar in hubsany system which gives rewards like this can and will be abused to hell and back it will basically become mandatory to do soalso any system which gives sp as a mission reward is grossly unfair to those of us who dont live in highsec where is my easy sp for literally no risk whatsoever all you do there is encourage bottingin fact all this proposal does in general is encourage botting and afk play
if youre going to bot for merely 30 minutes thats your issue not ours if youre going to shoot alt for 30 minutes for no additional benefits instead of shooting ppl for kms or rats for isk for the same 30 minutes thats also your problem
the last threads on this subject
where on earth are you getting the 30 minutes from
so change the timeout to 20 minutes instead does finetuning the balancing matter to the essence of the proposal
i still think you should go with the defender missile approach for a revamp comparison the hue and cry from npcs being given very powerfuleffective defender missiles would be so loud yet this is what was done with the npc ai and drones making them less effective more expensive and eliminating portions of your weapons systems from use as you game

drones were bad enough before the stupid ai several changed need to be made 1 drone targetting warning some kind of warning that a drone is getting targetted so that your first indication that a drone is being attacked isnt that all the shield and half the armor is gone2 smarter drone controls for players options for autodock when targetted attack smallest to largest closest to farthest3 when drones are launched and you are already being attacked dont have them just sit there all  like until you can target something and manually tell them to attack or fire a weapon if you are being attacked drones should never ever just be sitting around doing nothingif they are going to leave drone babysitting the way it is then new skills maybe a break target skill allowing those tiny super fast drones to break a target dock repair where drones can be repaird while docked in the ship the way it is now went from weak to totally broken kiting for noobs is out drones are useless when you are jammed by 510 ships at once and before you could rely on your drones
there is a couple things wrong with your base arguments herefirstly you are making a broad assumption that less risk and more security means more players into eve and more players into lowsec both of these assumptions are not really based on anything except your own perception of the game which is limitedin terms of bringing in more players you can just as easily justify that making lowsec less secure and thus giving more pvp opportunities would attract more players its just a matter of which kind of players youre wanting to attract either wayas far as lowsec attracting more people and increasing its appeal the same thing applies making it harder for pirates and easier for carebears increases the appeal to a certain subset of the population people like you specifically but making it appeal more to some people and less to others solves andor gains nothing if you gain 50 carebears and lose 50 pirates youre still where you started from except people are afk mining instead of interacting through pvpwwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42
yeah that 11 yerr to carebear ratio were still talking about eve righteve was is and always will be mostly pve activity when headcounts are concernedits more like gaining 100 carebears and losing 1 pirate surely the 100 carebears interact with eve more than the 1 pirate interacts with himself not that anyone really caresthe question is whether lowsec gaining population is a good or bad thing some people likes the way lowsec is atm the fact that population will increase once safety increases was never in dispute
you see the annoying thing about your post is that you claim not to know much about 00 yet here you are proposing significant changes to iti mean cmon man browny points for the effort but plz plz plz do some research before you post an ideasomeone with much more spare time than me will come along shortly and tell you just how invalid most of your ideas actually are more likely you will just get trolled into oblivioni dont mean to cause offence but common sense is a valuable commodity in the absence of having direct experienceknowledge on what you want to propose the following also could work1 talk about your proposals with people that live in 00 that you may know and that are experienced and2 research the forums on similarly posted ideas and read the discussion
fair comment but if you read the winter summit stuff either we find another way or perhaps wait years for null sec fixes
1 i make multiple alliances and multiple corps run them all under the same leadership structure and manage them as one unit nothing has changed but making it more annoying to make multiple corps and alliances2 yes because my amazing spaceship with all of its futuristic technology cant possibly fathom an fof tag no thats not the problem with local3 if youre stopping and checking your killmails every time youve killed someone in the middle of a fight youre seriously doing it wrong and no theres no reason to limit killmail generation to 3060s after the final blow when youre just going to gloat over them anyways once youre done for the day
null is bad because structure grind not local
ERROR
like the poster above me already pointed out much of what you are requesting already exists or isnt neededforce recons t2 cloaky cruisers already have large bonuses for ewar and cyno fields stealth bombers can deal large amounts of damage 500 dps if properly skilled and black ops battleships will be getting a much needed buff very soon more jump range more fuel capacity lower fuel consumptionas for skill requirements it doesnt take very long to jump into a covert ops ship or stealth bomber minus support skills its a 2 to 3 week train from scratch to use either ship fairly effectively thats not very long in the grand scheme of thingsthere have also been grumblings that ccp is looking into splitting black ops battleships into combat and logisticsewar variants similar to combat and force recon cruisers
just like dust 514 skillpoints which are exclusively actively gained which proves that its not impossible after all there should be a daily cap to the amount of bonus skillpoints you can gain in a dayindeed the intagible areas of the game wont be accelerated that way and so what theyll still be learned exactly as fast as today whats so unfair in encouraging the guy that shows up at fights for nullsec or does missions or rats or mines over the one that doesnt even log in active skills encourage grinding like nobodys grinding already  they encourage those who show up to do stuff with the bonus sp cap it still doesnt justify your staying there all day long intangible activities logistics and scouts get bonus sps for repairing and scanning yeah you can always scam the system by repairing your alt but if youre ready to log in everyday to reach your sp cap so that you can do that hell i believe you deserve it sp amount balancing well yeah obviously its the whole question but there again its about rewarding people for what they actually do if you do damage to others at the end of the day if you feel guilty that you didnt grind on another skill and start franctically mining cause i gots to grind yeah youre the horrible human being making this mandatory to other dumbarses but for those who actually do stuff it gives them a bonus because of what they do reward for action once again people worried about max skills  aint this what this is all about except at the minute theres nothing i can do on a daily basis that accelerates my reaching this max skill state implementing this will only help me get there faster you will have to grind for years to get max skill and people will try well yeah and so what just because some people cant control their emotions and franctically want everything i shouldnt be rewarded for logging into eve it is not a valid reason to me
no just no this would be abused so badly
you arent supposed to get to maxed all skills that the point
nope outside of npc standings you dont have to grind for anything in the game and you dont even need npc standings unless you have something special in mind poss faction warfare better reprocessing rates lower sales taxes etc which are really just perks when you think about ityou can submit your services to other players in exchange for isk probing pvp logi ship logistics etcas far as being encouraged to show up and do stuff the game already does that you gain isk resources allies and learn more intricacies of the game if those arent enough to encourage you to play this may not be the game for youwhen i mentioned logistics i meant someone who hauls organizes supplies and generally makes organizations workpeople who perform logistics dont really utilize any ingame skills what skills they do use are a potpourri of various unrelated things that have little relevance to each otherthere are no direct scouting skills probers are just that probers scouts use dscan there is no ingame skill for dscanthe same applies for spies there are no ingame skills that makes a better spydiplomats dont have any ingame skills to make them better why should they fall behind one of their ratting gruntsthe list goes onagain you are already rewarded for doing stuff what an active sp system does in introduce a new mechanic that encourages people to perform see dedicate certain activities over others for certain periods of time or be left behind which is a concept that currently does not exist in eveand yes people will be concerned about left behind because humans are compulsive about things that give them tangible advantages people are very predictable in this regard nopemax skills give you an advantage but are not absolutely necessary a person who has all the skills within a specialty at level 4 can fly at about 80 to 90 of the effectiveness of someone who has all skills within said specialty at level 5beyond that being throttled and waiting for you skills to go up effectively forces you learn and work with equipment that is cheaper good for newbies who often have the idea that bigger and more expensive is better choose specialties that can give you clear short term advantages andor find ways around your lacking ability such as talking with other players who are proficient in that specialty and in turn you offer your specialty todo you remember the learning skills do you remember how they were technically optional but in reality they were not because they gave tangible advantages which you wouldnt see for a year but youd be stupid for not training them now
and structure grind happens because ccp now have to make structure strong enough to with stand 2000 man blob fleets
why wait years for fixes when we could make everything much worse right now
i am reading a lot of thoughts about the problems with playerowned stations and why it should be the topic of an entire expansionbecause i see this angst and misery i feel the time is overdue to post a solution to this vexing problem because that is after all what we do here solve problemstherefore consider the following at fanfest 2012 a blessing on my soul i mentioned the fact that as the new eden elite we do not have an address we have an office in a station but that is not our home who knows who stays there when were not there rightso how do i solve the problem of a personal home for the capsuleer and the playerowned station and keep eves character which has to be protected at any and all cost intacthere is what i proposea pos will become a new class of ship it can be anchored it can be equipped with all the traditional defences and features we know and love but this time with an interface that doesnt look like it was designed in a 1950s kolchoz it will be able to carry part of a capsuleers fleet in a massive secured hangar it does not serve the role of a carrier this hangar will the equivalent of a station hangar several poss will be able to combine in space so that they become a lattice of poss they will be able to disengage from the lattice at any time if the situation requires it this pos will serve as a base of operations if the capsuleer so desiresthe reward of having this pos will be that the capsuleer has access to it without being penalised for having bad standing with local factionsthe risk will be that it will be a very challenging asset to owna group of poss should not have the same resilience of a station but it should also not require sovereignty a capsuleer should be able to fairly quickly fold the pos and move itseveral different versions could be designed depending on the role they are required to play in a coporationsalliances strategy1 this gives ccp a reason to make a theme around poss2 this creates new content for players to explore3 poss will become an asset worth having and fighting for4 tearextraction from the destruction of these structures will be a natural byproduct of owning one5 a capsuleer will have an address a place of their own with the associated responsibility of maintaining and operating this assetand thats how you solve the pos problem
sorry but no this is a horrible ideain the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
no you dont deserve a reward for logging in earn it or dont get it at all
i have been an advocate of people getting sec status gain for shooting people of a lower security status than yourself since forever you dont need to change aggression mechanics though they are good as it is who is attackable where at what security status is fine as it is dont go changing thatif players are to get security status increases from attacking other players two things need to occur to stop exploits firstly the players your attacking must be below your own security status if your to accrue security status increases secondly the sec status increase has to be tied to the isk loss of the player you blow up because otherwise you could blow up your friends in n00b ships to raise your sec status without any risk or loss all roundin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
suprpower blocks is how some people want to play some people want to play smaller entities or even solo stop trying to make everyone play in a certain style if you dont want to be invovled in teh superpowers then dont its simplethe way sov works may need to change so that swathes of unused space arnt owned by powerblocks maybe have it that apart from your initial space an entity can only own space directly conected to it not just by stargate by by location too make some space that is simply inaccessible from any other null or lowsec maybe make quite alot of areas like that there are alot of options that will allow for power block play to run side by side with small powers and even solo corp play you dont need to artificially enforce arbitrary limits to sizes then say that everyone else is an unknown target as this is just ridiculousccp need to just use some imagination take some suggestions from the forums and use common sense no arbitrary limitations are necessary
first of all id rather ccp resources be spent working on a myriad of things before avatars in spacehaving said that theres probably a team working on avatar development as i work in recruitment for tgrad i can tell you that the population of eve has a surprisingly large number of mature players playing the game and real life professionals and business ownersso id encourage additional options that reflect that about eve including the fact that we have seniors in space middle aged folks in space dwarfs in space fat guys in space mature women in space and the likewhile i do have my cadre of hot cyno alts id like to see additional diversity

so basically a carrier that instead of launching ai controlled fighters it launches player ships i like it
what purpose exactly does this serve how much do those rigs really cost if you made such a ship its step quite a bit into the region of the carrier which has one of its roles to be a ship transport in lownull all you need to do is allow freighters to move assembled ships aswell unless they already can in which case no change is needed having them moved via courier is also not the worst thing and to those that say you cant courier to yourself im pretty sure you could make an alt and courier to yourself we already have the freighter and jump freighter for highsec as well as the orca add in the rorqual carriers super carriers and titans for low and null do we really need more ships to move other ships
it doesnt launch player ships it can transport them it will be incapable of launching ships in space the only way it will be able to interact with ships in space is with a pos ship maintenance array so that it cant be utilized like an orcaand to answer the question about rigs when it comes to certain vessels rigs can be pricey especially if youre talking large rigs or t2 rigs the point of this is to facilitate improved logistics and to plug a hole for transport purposes sure using an alt to transport utilizing courier contracts is all fine and dandy but not everyone has the money to have more than one account or has the time to train a second account while they take care of rl stuff or their main accountsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

i see no reason to change the current skilling system especially to a system as potentially open to abuse as the one you are proposing
i fully agree with this statementeve has managed to create imho one of the best and most balanced skill systems out thereno grinding no abusable mechanics no afk experience leveling no discrimination between players who can play for 10 hours a day and those who have to work and can only get on a couple of hours every few days or weekend playerswhy does the op want to ruin thisjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i read valid assertions but what i mostly see behind it is fear of nolifers that will abuse the systemhowever nobody replied to my quoting dust i am aware that both games are different however dust combines eves skill system with action reward its even a general reward not skillspecificit means that dust diplomats will never get any skill points for doing what they do nor wont the ceo is that unfair no its simply that what they do doesnt have a direct influence in their characters lifes as a fighter i think here many people confuse players and their charactersbut then again in eve as you said it doesnt require any ingame skills to be a diplomat or a scout so to what would you give out skill points anyway as there are no ingame skills for thatyou can scout and be a diplomat without any ingame skills which means you dont need a skillpoint bonus in that area anyway because there are no skills that make you less efficient at it than any other personperhaps i should formulate the first idea again in my thought bonus skillpoints are only awarded to skills that fall under the actions categoryfor instance i shoot lasers my character gets better at shooting lasers thats how it goesso a diplomat would get bonus skillpoints for shooting lasers because thats what hed be doing at that moment his role is in meta gaming then he isnt limited by ingame skills as the grunts are in the end if there was to be an injustice itd be the other way around grunts do their role and are limited by their potential lack of skills diplos or scouts are notand as for eves unique perspective well this system doesnt remove anything from anyone youd learn skills as fast as now which according to your own words is nothing to complain aboutat a time when ccp wants to attract and supposedly keep new people into eve it seems to me that giving a new incentive to various activities im sorry but as i dont have 20 accounts nor any valuable asset to play marketeer i actually have to grind to get any sort of isk be it hisec missions nullsec sites mining what have you might actually get people into staying and not just get into the game get told well you need at least 3 months before you can actually do cool stuff and  off as many do todaybecause its easy to say that rewarding action is unnecessary or even dangerous when you have several 34 years old characters that allow you to do whatever you want to do just as easy that it is for some politicians to say general healthcare is useless well it is not for them they got the money for it and those who dont well they can  off take it or leave it right btw im not american and dont give a damn about american healthcare im just making an analogy as many people as possible can relate towell thats exactly how many newbies see leave itand i know this feels like butthurt but its not really for me that i want action rewards it wouldnt change much to what im learning anyway now but i know itd encourage some newbies to stay long enough to get to see the whole game and not just lvl 2 missionsi have friends i want to play that game with me but none of them wants to spend 3 months to start playing and i understand them i know they can specialise in t2 frigates and get in interceptors really useful when you cant even do lvl2 missionsand a minor bonus for being active this skill being learned slightly faster because they did good it might just be the little push they need to click that subscribe buttonwhat would it change for newbies itd give them one more chance to stay in the gamewhat would it change for the vets nothing well yeah itd give the active newbies a chance to catch up with the lower skill inactive vetsbut you dont really care do you as long as you get to keep playing the game you own way anyway if youd be so kind for this conversation to keep living on in an interesting way to mark objections as under either the principle or technical level that be nice and itd clarify the reading  for instance saying that this proposition should not be adopted because it changes eves indentity is an objection on principlesaying that people will abuse the system by afk repetitive actions is a technical objectionthank you in advance
horrible sugestion
has anyone else noticed that everyone who says that drones arent broken always talk about dominix  sentries and nothing else
actually the real problem isnt that theyre being targeted its that theyre being instalocked ive seen light drones come under fire not two seconds out of the launch bay and by cruisers no less ive seen sentry drones come under fire in less time than the lag between my pushing the attack hotkey and them firing one shot no player ship can do this25m signature  01 second lockon time my ass and once they get locked the rats never miss my ass x2
the lock time should be looked at and perhaps the tracking aswell but for frigs to be effective at killing the larger drones isnt a large surprise at all can i also point out the fact that when the drones use their microwarp drives their sig radius explode just in case you werent aware one might want to have a look at the drones resists assuming they vary racially to figure out what to use alternatively use them high slots for autocannons or blasters to blap frigs before putting out the drones
ok how about this cant aim bombs at anything within 10km of a gate or npc station but everywhere else bombs would be kosher
tell me where else the bombs would then be used theres little point in being able to use bombs in these systems if thats your suggestion its also an incentive for moving into null territory what im curious about is why titans cant doomsday in low now that their damage is no longer aoe
i see the merit in the system the only problem i see is that if you make the sec gain too high then you are going to get alt grinds and if you make it too low then some players will argue that there was no point in wasting time coding the system frankly i would like to see a sec gain exactly like that for shooting npcs swap elite hulls for t2 hulls in terms of sec gain that way there is no point in grinding it out with alts no ratios no special conditionals just straight up sec the exact way you get it through shooting npcs i would like to advocate to make it a larger gain but if you make the gain too large  then you will get people making 10 alts to treat as a personal sec reliever
to counter this to an extent you could set point values for ships so that nothing below a bc got any significant gain therefore the player is having to spend all that isk he ganked to get his sec status back up you could also require there to be a fleet involved for sec status to be awarded theres many work arounds to stopping or at least hampering exploit opportunities
another thing you could do is put a maximum number of times one player can be killed by another in a single day and still receive sec status gain for it or even more simply make it so a players death rewards sec status only so many times per dayhourweek depending on the level of increase they would award perhaps they could make it to where the longer a player goes without being killed the higher the reward in sec status gain for his head just thoughts
1 excellent idea aye aye m8
good idea and it would need to be worked out so it cant be exploited bounty payouts shouldnt affect sec status gainspace cadet online  a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks  public npsi events fleet  launching 28th august
if eve would have no alts sure the problem is that the proposal has the same loophole as the first bounty system
so kind of like an orca that you can anchor to prevent people from stealing it
im fine with changing poses in a way that allows us to use them as stations and replace station functionality allowing it to be a ship however can be considered a troll the amount of rights managements to do this sort of thing would be mind boggling not to mention moving an object whilst a certain amount of players are already in it and doing their thing station size poses should never be able to move about or else it will be abused to the ends of the earth
i assure you i am quite serious about the idea this is a problem that many people struggle with it is part of the game play that ccp thinks is not important because they do not recognise that they are underserving the people who would use this feature if it was properly implementedmy intention is to contribute meaningfully to the discussion you can like or dislike as is your preference but im not trying to be a smart ass i do plenty of that in coms i dont need to assert myself hereit should be a ship because that is the metaphor we use all the time there is nothing new to the idea of flying a ship but the pos features would only become available when the device was deployed in posmodethink of it as a mobile oil rig it kinda sorta sails across the sea but its not really intended to do that the thing its supposed to be doing it only does when its anchored and deployed all the features are on board you just dont start using them unless and when the feature is required for the basic needs of navigation until its fully deployedso it would be with this device its a ship it will fly but you wont use the pos features because these only become available when the ship is anchored and the pos is deployed then all the features become available and it is now a posownership is a great issue but that is why the corp interface would need to be updated to allow for the private ownership and deployment of a pos in the corpalliance constellation you would be allowed to own your own poss that would not automatically translate into rights to other poses obviously this is a nontrivial problem to solve but i have confidence in the demigods in fair reykjavik and their subsidiaries to solve that problem thats what would make this a fullfeatured themebased expansion it would be real work with a real payoff and pilots would respond to this becoming availablei have not touched on where it can be deployed how it needs to be deployed that is work to be doneafter deployment features as now commonly used can be added to the pos the oil rig idea again you can add modules and start production harvesting protection as you do with a current posyou would then have to disassemble all the parts that are not part of the flying vessel to bundle the craft up and enable the warp driveyou would have different sizes they would fold swiss armyknifestyle you pack your kit up you store it into the pos you fold the pos you secure the ship for flightmode and off you go youve got all you need in one smart package all parts of which can be built  purchased on the market the geometry would change when you change the configuration it would look awesome like everything in eve looks awesome and it would be a feature that people would look for and use like wormholes have proven to be a very successful feature this too would be something to look out forwould it be a challenge to build it of course but this is eve the hard stuff is the most funi believe in this as a workable idea specifically because it touches on the basics theres great reward and great risk and its a fis feature this idea is an alleve all the time idea get the balance right implement a new posmanagement interface like we have seen awesome interface improvements in the last release and this will be a soughtafter assetyou can sell this idea i can see the fantastic video the marketing geniuses not a hint of sarcasm would produce to make us salivate over this release eve online  foothold its a serious proposition that i truly believe has potentialif you think its nonsense please tell me why im wrong id love to hear your ideas
a lot if not everything here has been discussed and beaten to death by the modular pos discussions
i have not read the modular pos discussion if there are no new ideas here and im certainly not claiming originality why havent ccp implemented them yet
contracts should be targeted for personscorporationsalliancesmilitiasfaction standingspersonal standingsor in general whatever filter eve online already applies to players corporations alliances etc ingamemostly im interested in being able to assign contracts to my militia but this sort of feature ought to be generalized
so im searching for a contract for a mimmi ship 90 of the contracts are multiple items 1 change multiple item contract icon to reflect the item you are searching for then the most expensive item if searching for all types 2 or let me have check boxes for which racial ships id like search to return hopefully both
no it doesnt player purchases plex from ccp for real money  the real money involvement ends there you get exactly what you paid for  what you do with it afterwards has nothing to do with real money because you got what you paid for
it may be worth considering that i havent seen a single gatecamp in the last six months that wasnt based around a faclon either alone or with friends no other bubble ships even get used any more that in itself should tell ccp that some balance issues exist

agree with thiswith all the mentioned downsides that the current refineries already have pos upkeep batched processingtime consuming there is really no reason why it should be as horribly inefficient as it currently isif u keep the current disadvantages it should at be alot more efficientalso cant believe i just posted in an industry thread yuck
lol good comments and welcome to the dark side hrolt ceo live free die proud
just dropping this in simply restricting boosts to a grid can possibly not deliver desired effect theres not much help if said booster sits 300 km away from you rather than at the safespot this can make little difference in big engagements and probably in smaller ones as well
care to explain why
on the good side ccp obviously recognized the massive demand form the players to do something about overpowered drones and decided to address it in a well balanced and nuanced wayccp just had to respond to the large number of players who threatened to quit if the all powerful drones were not nerfedhorrible drone ui and virtually useless heavy drones nice work ccpsigh
this has been probably already addressed before so i am most likely repeating myself problem as with being a miner it is pretty important to maximize your available time with this being said i find it rather curious that a mining laser would continue to work on asteroid that no longer exists i imagine that there is some code that makes the mechanic of when a mining laser deactivates it then determines how much ore was extracted based upon the time it was active i understand that this is a game and that mechanics dont necessarily mirror reallife situations but it really doesnt make sense why a mining laser would still be active while an asteroids mass has already been completely depletedsolution make asteroids like structures giving them hit points make mining lasers like regular guns that will reduce the structure of a given asteroid by the amount equal to whatever turret is being used and skill points given i understand that this would most likely change the entire mechanic of mining since the minerals gained would no longer be attached to a cycle time i also understand that this would have farther reaching effects in regards to mineral prices on the market and so forth i thank you for your time and considerationbest regardsalkolik
the amount of minerals removed from the asteroid would indeed still be tied to a cycle time the same way hps are removed from a target ship for each cycle of a weapon turret
this instead of new ships id rather see player deployable racing gates that dim when passed going the correct direction let the gates be linked and have a timer that times first gate to last this would be an actual improvement over the current anchored sets of cans to make gates further iterations would add course designers and touch sensors on the gates different size gates could allow multiple racers to race at once and everything would be destructible and manufacturable by players
this is a stealth anti new order thread the new order calls non compliant miners bot aspirants miners frequently are warned to not engage in botting afking petitioning new order agents excessive mining etc as violations of the new halaima code of conduct violators are subject to bump and ganking like someone in this thread who famously lost a billion isk pod to a new order gank and then put a billion isk bounty on new order logistics corp in short we tell them they are bots or almost bots we dont threaten to report them or call them eula violators we call them code violators and take action on our own we are on the receiving end of more actual eula violating actions such as real life threats cursing and racial and homophobic insulting than we could ever petition so we generally dont bother so somebody answer me this would an agent of the new order calling a miner a bot be a eula violation under this idea and if the answer is yes well you can see what this really is all aboutbing bangboomagent of the new order of highsecbelligerent undesirable by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
its clear the op is looking to retaliate against the player group responsible for the emergent gameplay resulting in this killmaildo not post killmails in this forum  ccp eternei believe bing bangboom is correct in that this player group has never threatened players with reports of eula violations perceived or real and ive witnessed firsthand the eula violating actions like reallife threats cursing and racial and homophobic slurs they receive from the socalled decent people the original poster fancies himself the champion ofthis whole proposal reeks of bitterness and malice
actually the way i read the proposal it seems like whitehound is attempting to adjust the eula to protect members of the new order of highsec he is proposing that people who use threats that are based on the eula should be bannedfrom what ive read and seen this is typically a response of people who have had their ships destroyed for whatever reason you know the one of youre griefing im reporting youso under the proposed changed the person who makes that threat in local and i would assume mail would be subject to a ban themselves with this proposal describing someones behavior as botlike or bot aspirant is not impacted nor would it be an infringement of the proposed changes i dont think this proposed change is needed but it is worth thinking about
why not
whether you are correct or i am would result in much the same thing new order agents are extremely aware of the limits the eula puts on player interaction each thing we do have been carefully vetted to ensure we are not breaking it the miners on the other hand have proven to be not only unaware of what the eula says but highly creative in making up many new rules for us to violate if falsely accusing an agent of violating the eula would result in a poorly educated emotional miner receiving a warning or even a ban the power of the new order would expand exponentially i have been accused of violating the eula hundreds of times in my career whole systems would be cleared of bot aspirant miners the hard way dont give us that kind of power although invincible we are only humanbbb by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
the thing about the eula is that every player and organisation interprets it in a different way its purposefully vague as are most eulas and is written in legalese so that they can cover their own arses in the legal senseluckily ccp are usually willing to lay down exactly what you can and cannot do by gasp actually participating in discussion about it the recent gm decision on bumping for example they started a thread for feedback on it then spent a month or so digesting all that feedback before coming to a decision and presenting it to us
thus a rule in the eula which states not to make accusations of eula violations would be extremely helpful in solving these problemsfrankly i am tired of the same repetitive boring and increasingly annoying accusations of being a bot if this happens directly or indirectly as botlike or botaspirant does not matter to me i got ganked a single time moved straight on placed a 1b isk bounty on the gankers to put them into the top ten for good fun which they could have used for bragging and bought me a skiff yet here we are and i am being stalked and accused of being botlike over and over again why can i move on but they canti am not sure if i should thank the new order for their comments now or if i should be just sad i find it an annoying play style to accuse others of eula violations which is a rather serious accusation and should not be taken lightly by anyone and so just goes beyond the sandboxwhy do i then need to delete mails by unknown players who believe what a blog says and then send me mails why do i need to read the same comments by the new order for the 8th10th time where they say that i am botlike i am not a bot and i do not want to defend myself against every player for being afk and who can send a mail or post a comment it is ridiculous and not worth the money i pay for a gamei say away with it i am sure some will feel the same way some maybe dont even realize it yet how much better the game could be if they were not being accused of breaking the eulaand i am far from being selfish here the proposal is intended to make the game better for all of us
haha this
and what about the guy who loses his titan and removes all the cap skills to drop his clone costs right down or the guy who removes command ship skills and then demands them back at the next patch and whats wrong with pi anyway its literally free money

i sit in a nullsec system cloaked for days even weeks gathering intel on which alliances come and go through here their peak hours their preferred ship type individual habits and so forthhow do you propose my character receive bonus sp i am performing a valid form of gameplay after allsummary of eves last four expansions
as i said previously this specific type of gameplay that comes close to metagameplay does not require any ingame skills other than cloaking therefore having lowskills somewhere does not hamper your capability to practice this activity it is out of game skills that countin that instance just as for diplomacy for example there can be no ingame sp reward as there is no ingame skill that limitates your actions in that fieldif you wanna be a good scout train and practice scouting and learn cloaking yes but its not exactly the longest skill in the gameif you wanna be a good battleship pilot spend 6 months learning skills and also train and practice to be on equal grounds with someone that has already trained that upim of course not saying that the system should turn to those classic mmorpg xp grinder style upping people to lvl 80 yay imma elite pvper in 3 days now im simply wondering if there could be a way that action is encouraged in another form than just iskso tldr to answer your questionactivity based on ingame skill  bonusactivity based on out of game skill  no bonusand before you say but its unfair  well no its not as you almost are not limited by ingame skills to do that job
seriously the above statement is not showing a limitation in eve as a game its showing a limitation in your friends intelligence and willingness to work towards a goaleve is not about jumping into a uberbattleship and screeching off into the universe with your solid gold pants onits about being dropped into this huge universe full of powerful people in a little tin can and a few coins in your pocket then figuring out what you want to become and how you are going to make your way therethere are many other games out there that reward grinding and where you can be level 80 in a week so you can be all end of game raid and wear the bestest hat why do you want to turn eve into another one of thosejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
hahaha i was expecting a vets condescending response and im not disappointedas ive said previously it is very easy to say that eve is not about jumping into a uberbattleship when you can actually do itit is somewhat less easy to actually discover the game and persist playing it when so many players are old and have several accounts and if you cant do  for three months come on dont serve me the be a rifter hero bull  you know you actually need at least two months to understand enough of the game to do that and one more month to have sufficient assets that you dont care about losing ships its frustratingcontrarily to what you seem to think i do not want to turn eve into an xp grinder i appreciate the fact that i dont have to be logged and grind every single free hour of every single day to have a chance to get to an equal ground with older characters ill never bebut ill still log in and do stuff so why not give active people a boost what youre afraid that some newbie will catch up with you through those bonuses lolanyway it clearly shows me that nothings wrong with this idea on principle but human uncontrollable fever for xp grind would actually harm eve and i as much as you guys certainly dont want thatis it not possible to consider having this sp bonus for basic newbie skills only that way vets dont have anything to  about the grind remains about isk for the immense majority of the players and it simply gives a boost to active new players without taking anything away from inactive players in the end they still learn the skills as they would todayas for eve not rewarding grinding really thats your argument with tons of afk miners in the belt mission and site runners in every corner of eve do you really think eve is grinding free as the meme goes btch please
and there are good reasons why games that utilize that kind of reward model has more subscribers versus eve just saying i think the problem with this game is that many of you die hard blow hards on the forums just cannot admit a better game model when its actually better you types are hung up on the fact that this is a unique game despite the fact that that uniqueness is flawed in many important ways
are you kidding rats could give sp when shot and completed plexes could also i have no sympathy anyway since you live in an area that supposedly pays you isk wise for the risk you are taking right to expand the idea further for killed rats and such the combat sps could be rewarded when your wallet updates every 15mins i think its totally fair
i agree to a certain extent this is why i agree to this only if it were rewarded after completing a plex mission or whatever the sps could be rewarded and you can delegate where they go the only catch is if you complete a combat mission it rewards sps that can only be used for combat type skills mining mission sps can only be used for mining skillsindustrial so on and so forth
since when is meta game a valid form of gameplay if you ask me its just a part of eve that will be abused far more often than the posters idea which isnt completely bad its just half bad
since day one
here we go lets insult the intelligence of prospective players as if you never dreamed of flying in a titan when you first heard of it how is that plan panning out yeah didnt think so
its meta game meaning its a part of the game but not really not officially anyways so if it isnt official then its not valid gameplay and will therefore not be recognized as such
i like the general idea of this proposal but the idea needs to be refined and remodeled ive been playing this game for over four years now so in my opinion players like me dont need the boost but giving new players a small boost to their skills with hard limits is actually a good idea and heres how it should be accomplished1 limit the skills that can be boosted to the essential core skills these core skills are debatable spaceship command engineering gunnery energy management etc2 limit the total value of skill points added again debatable on the exact number for example if the total training time assuming no implants and no remaps takes 1 month to train up all the core skills to lvl 5 then these boost would take off a week training time3 limit the way these skill points can be awarded or earned tie these bonus skill points to be only rewarded after completing portions of the tutorial missions4 establish a use it or lose it system once a player reaches all lvl 5s in the core skills any remaining bonus skill points are deletedthis system would encourage new players to run the tutorial missions it allows new players to finish the essential skills quicker which allows them to start training the skills that will put them closer to a veterans level its not game breaking in the overall process of playing because the bonus is small but tangible and rewarding for new players no veteran should cry about a new player being skilled a week earlier because we all know player skill and skill points are two very different things

i hit post instead of cancelim not sure how i feel about this proposal  im not vehemently opposed to it but my inclination is that one should err on the side of allowing more discussion instead of less as whitehound points out falsely accusing others of eula violations is generally unproductive but on many occasions what began as an accusation of eula violation leads to a fruitful discussion of what the eula actually entails im open to opinions
this is all very clever whitehound anyone whos been in a system that were working knows this is our casus belli we fly into a belt pick a miner out drag his name into chat accuse him of being a botbotaspirant and give him a chance to respond this is the absolute best way to start a player interaction there are a thousand things that can happen next i dont see a problem with it you know who has a real problem with it bots and afkers why you ask because they have a 0 chance of stopping us you may not believe this whitehound but we are so easily beaten if you are at your keyboard it isnt even a competitionthat is the thing about the new order i find so engaging we tell people exactly what to do to beat us but theyre usually botting afk or just dont care sadly weve never run out of targetsim awful sorry to have misjudged you whitehound i thought you were alright with how things went down hell ive caught you in our systems a couple times and always o at you in local so be it i oppose this idea fly safeo7
i have no problem with you shooting my ship but i sure have a problem with you accusing me of being a bot and even going as far as to call me out for it on a blogwho do you think you are to be treating a fellow player like this i pay just as much for this game as you do and you try to get me banned from the game or just to ruin my game time by telling everyone i am a botyou even follow me around here on the forum and keep trolling me with that one gank you have made continuing to insist that i am a bot or being bot likeif you cannot see how wrong this and think this is just fine then how serious do you take the eula yourself apparently is this all a joke to you and you do not take this serious at all so do not tell me you now suddenly have a problem with my proposalplayers have been accused of breaking the eula for as long as i am playing eve there may have been a time when ccp did not take bots as serious as they could have but i believe they are now doing everything they can and are being successful with it therefore do i believe it is time to get rid of these constant accusations and the witch hunts some players indulge in because it is not fun to be on the receiving end of it and being marked liked this within the communitynor do i like playing with players who might be breaking the eula because if they do then it could affect me too and because i do take the eula seriousas you may know is ccp going to take botting within alliances more serious and to make alliance leaders responsible for the actions of their members who here then wants to be accused of being a bot and watch how others begin to distant themselves from one because of such accusations i sure do not want to be treated like this
this thread is close to crossing the line you guys have remained fairly civil for the time being but please do not let your arguments devolve into personal attacks or insults
im not sure ive ever seen someone come up in local and start yelling about how heshe is going to report another player for eula violations in fact ive never seen this ever and im in the business of shooting at people who are most likely to be bots i did read your post forgive me if i didnt get the right ideadirection and i only skimmed the other posts but please note saying to someone of beingacting as a botaspirant is not out right saying you are indeed a bot
i do indeed take the eula seriously because of this ive never been warned gagged notified or even talked to by ccp in fact i can only recall one time ccp has warned one of us we might be going too far one time  not a bad record imoif you get your way on this whitehound i would certainly be in violation of the eula i oppose this idea for that reason
an accusation can be made directly or indirectly it does not change what it isif you then are aware of what you are doing or not does not matter but it may only be unfortunate for you when you do not know how your accusations are being perceived
how would you propose to tell the difference between a warning given to a player about violating the eula out of genuine concern that that player not place themselves at risk of a ban and a threat
you do not tell the difference you play the game and either do not bother with what players do inside or outside the sandbox that could violate the eula or you press f12 and petition it
so if a new player asks a question or ignorantly proposes a course of action that you know to be in violation of the eula you just ignore them and then petition them if they go ahead and do itsorry if i seem bewildered but as a new player myself i dont get how this proposal is supposed to help me
the decision is for you to make personally i would not go around and petition everyone for the smallest thingi did however only recently petition a player who indirectly threatened a group of players with stabbing them even when it is pretty hard to stab someone over the internet and we are playing in anonymity it just is not acceptable talk to me and i do not think we need it here or that it is required for having fun in eve
so in answer to my last question about whether or not i ignore someone who is about to do something that i know is in contravention of the eulabut earlier when i asked about discerning the difference between a warning and a threat when the possibility of assisting a player eventuatesthose statements conflicton the one hand it sounds like youre saying that i should use my discretion as to whether or not to warn a player but on the other hand youre saying that i should completely ignore them
if you cannot make the decision then just play the game this is why we are here and we should not concern ourselves with the eula if a violation is serious enough will ccp notice it eventually i believe ccp uses detection systems and in cases where it has got a victim will the victim report it you are not required to do anything about it nor should this ever become the case if you must help ccp then do it discretely to protect those who might be innocent and leave the rest to ccp
so from the answers to my questions it seems clear that the proposal to make accusations of eula violation a violation of its own would contain no distinction of what would constitute an accusation and that merely attempting to discus the possibility of an eula violation would therefore be petitionablethe net effect of the introduction of such a proposal would be to discourage more experienced players from giving suggestions to newer players to help them avoid issues with the eula arising from their actions as fear of misinterpretation of intent for which no provision is intended to be made would effectively create an environment where any discussion of the eula could be construed as harassmentthis proposal is not in any way beneficial to newer players and would in fact be detrimental to them for the reasons stated abovefurthermore in its current state this proposal infringes upon the inalienable human right of freedom of speechif iceland is indeed seeking to become a member of the european union as the op has stated then i can see the introduction of this proposal constituting a major stumbling block to that process and i would encourage ccp for the good of eve iceland the european union and indeed the wider international community to summarily dismiss it on humanitarian grounds
know that ranting on the forums is not allowed i can write this even without being a moderator and simply to inform you of the forum rulesfreedom of speech is not the highest of the human rights and it has rights above it like the right on dignity if you violate the higher rights with your speech then you can be denied your right of freedom of speech for this reason can you not say whatever you like and racists remarks hate speeches ranting and trolling can all have consequences for youother than this will i respect your opinion and treat your comment as such and not argue about it
thanks for the warning
i think this idea is terrible it essentially discourages players from reporting eula breakers in case they are wrong or in case the person they are accusing is well connected i think a more detailed report violator petition would solve most of the erroneous petitions with specific questions designed to flesh out why you think this person is a bot or why you think this person is violating the eula furthermore if someone overpetitions or what not the gms can deal with the overzealous culprit on their own perhaps they can create an internal list of complainers with low credibility but they shouldnt ban someone for reporting a perceived eula violation
we already have plenty of encouragement with the plex for snitches program where players can get a free plex when their petitions on bots prove to be right it does not need any more encouragement than thisanyone who throws accusations on chats and forums will more likely do this out of malice or revenge it is unnecessary and especially because eve is a pvp game is it important that players learn not to act like this but to find other ways to deal with it ie by shooting spaceships
i think you need to understand that what is being proposed is not a penalty for filing a false petition the proposer wants you to be in violation of the eula for saying someone is violating the eula in local just for saying it like in saying you are a bot lets just pull a random example from out of the air say an agent of the old chaos approaches a oh a person  ok i cant think of anything but mining so he approaches a person mining and talks to them in local when the person doesnt answer the agent says in local so and so is a bot under the proposed rule change this would be a eula violation on the part of the speaker not reporting them to ccp as a bot not putting them on a bot list somewhere and asking ccp to clean them up no just saying so and so is a bot its an attempted gag order on the new order of highsec a totalitarian solution to a libertarian movement it boils down to shut up he explainedbbb by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
ok this is even more terrible than i originally thought social pressure is one of the strongest ways to combat botting and trying to gag people for calling so  so a bot is just ridiculous besides the accused can always speak in local and to waylay any accusations besides where would you ever draw the line bob is a boti think bob is a boti fear bob is a botbob is acting like a boti wonder if bob is a bot you cant sensor all of these and social ingenuity will allow you to bypass any directly bannable offenses
or when you gank a player and the player then retaliates with accusing you of being a griever and threatening to petition you you can then point out to the player that what he does is against the rules and he needs to make a petition or to suck it upi can only guess why this is not in your interest perhaps the blog is your way of fighting back which would not make much sense because you would only fear of losing your fight here when really you gain a new toolexplain why this is bad for you so we can understand you
while this is only your opinion do know that bots do not care for what you say only banning gets rid of them or else do they keep coming back so you are only putting social pressure onto fellow players who enjoy a botfree game just as much as you do and for no good reason
its stupid to change the game just to accommodate one playermoderators please lock threadedit personal attack removed  isd suvetarsummary of eves last four expansions
first off if the guy with the titan wants to remove all his skills  lose all that isk in cap skillbooks then that is his right  what does it matter to youyou second statement doesnt make sense about someone demanding his skills back thats like me losing a ship in battle  demanding ccp replaces it because i didt want to lose itit is stated that before removing any skills that it is non reversal unless it is a hacked accountand back to pi you are correct it is free money  i have two alts that dabble in it its just that this character is for combat only  i was wrong to ever inject it on her i dont do pi on her  never will again

the single biggest issue with eve for me at this point is travelthe vast distances over empires is what makes a thriving economy it is also the thing preventing one area from being overrun by players from area bit is also hindering any sort of casual gameplay that is not planned in advancecorei suggest that ccp change the clone jumping mechanic to be restricted by isk not by time make it so that you can clone jump twice for around 10m per dayfirst jump 1m  second 10m  third 100m  fourth 1000m etc what is it that the vast universe really hinders asset projectionwhy changing of jump cloning would not change that very much at allwell you can not bring your own ship on the journey so either someone else already brought your ship to the deploy area or you go and buy another ship this supports the different trade hubs as well as restricts asset projection as the original universe structure intendedextensionsmake it easier to deploy a jumpclone either by giving corps with required standings the ability to act as brokers for jumpclones within game mechanics other than leaving your own corp and joining another or simply lower requirements to not hostile 0 to deploy a clonethis could also be the carrot for separating the empire factions with low sec in between you can safely and quickly travel between these places by just clonejumping to actually make a profit you would need to suffer risk of low secmake empire clonejumping stations a station that allows for anyone restrictions could apply based on standings criminality and such according to best balance to clonejump to another station in a different empirethis will bring your current clone with you but leave your ship at the stationpurpose and single goalto make it easier to coordinate with friends to do joint ventures without incredibly long set up timesto give players the opportunity to go out play with a friend and come back to his home station at the end of the day
its called bounty contracts
this would be great it would let small corporations temporarily move into unoccupied c1 and c2 whs and mine all the unused gravimetric sites that build up there without having to put up multiple large poss to keep up with the refine volume and lose 25 of the minerals off the top for no real reason it would reward industry in null and deep whs it would be positive in every aspect if minmatar outposts need a corresponding buff to keep them usable then sure i personally think increasing the refining amounts and formulating the base yield so with 5 refining spec in that particular ore and with the 4 implant the yield would be somewhere around 9599 would be fair to maintain minmatar outposts as the best refining optionbut 75 is insultingly low i think lowering the fitting requirements as well might be overcompensating a bit too much i wouldnt want to buff refineries so much that rorquals become uselessbut neither should using a rorqual and refining in high sec be nearly mandatorythis would be a simple and enormously important change to say that ccp should leave the simple and important changes undone because they have to focus on the changes that will take years first is really quite nonsensical this change should be done asap
agreed ridiculous that that a ship can sit off invulnerable and undetectable with eccm and small sig radius while providing massive bonuses
unfortunately offgrid boosting is not a gamebreaker despite what some people may think if it was a game breaker there would be teams assigned to it scrounging up as many ideas and shitcode that they can throw at the problem until something sticks and refine that into something that is workableif the problem rates one person that being said that person is veritas then the problem is either nigh unsolvable or quite down the list from the sound of the quote i would say boosting mechanics are close to the single thread node problem in terms of difficulty
i have deleted an obvious troll post from here
having the command ship on grid 300km off would be a poor choice as it would be quickly chased off or caught and tackled by frigates and other light support burning towards it or simply being slingshotted by a prober the safest place for ongrid boosters would be with the rest of the fleet stuffed full of buffering modules and prelocked by the reppers in the fleet
eve is such a big game that its true no current problem breaks the whole game but based on the player feedback in this thread this problem is causing the most damage to the game i am not aware of a specific mechanic fix that has more support from the playersyes lots of players say fix null sec sov but they dont give any specific ideas as to what should be done forcing boosters to at least be on the battle grid is pretty specific we really dont have any idea what the techincial problem is so its hard to speculate on what other options might resolve the issue and not be so technically difficultmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
if the ship is on grid you can see it and decide if you still want to take the fight you cant warp 300km away from someone bottom line forcing ships to be on grid will solve the problemmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i disagree with you i dont think there is a need to limit how many sps can be earned im getting tired of being regulated for doing this or that we get enough of that in real life i pretty much agree with what halcyon says here
why are smartbomb gate camps allowed in lowsec but stealth bombers cant launch bombs
because there are no bubbles to catch stealth bombers as they warp away stabbed battleships can be caught by hics and sufficient number of fast points they can be used far more precisely than smartbombs and a reasonable number of bombs can melt anything battleship class and lower
in my opinion lowsec is pretty much fine as it is with the exception of smartbomb camps now more than ever pirates seem to love parking their shiny bss in popular fw systems and get infinite free kills lots of frigates coming through and although most frigs can tank it ecm frigs almost never survive these camps what part of this is balanced if you cant know theyre there without relying on a scout who still has to risk it himself or spending 5 minutes per system scanning i dont mind the isk cost because the frigs are cheap but im sure this has great potential to  off vets clone cost
then do what us vets do  learn where smartbombing camps are popular create safespots 150 kms around gates you commonly use andor where camps commonly happen warp to a gate at 10km rather than 0 watch local for skulls use dscan suck it up and use something tankieralso know that smartbombing battleships while annoying cannot actively align to instawarp away from danger not without giving up their alignment to catch potential targets usually have weakish tanks large smartbombs use up a lot of grid you need capacitor boosters to run everything including your active tank and stabs use up precious lowslots have little to no offensive ability beyond the smartbombs themselves faction smartbombs only have a range of 6 to 7 km but most people use the cheap ones with a range of only 4 to 5 km well within scram and null ammo blaster range are slow and easily caught by ships coming in from the other end of the gate

this is an obvious contradiction if you cant even hold to the principle you are espousing in the thread in which you present it how do you expect anyone else to ever follow it i hope that ccp realizes this proposal is hopelessly paradoxical and straight out of 1984 a rule which it to even mention breaks that same rule we will all call it the fight club rule which will itself be bannable to say once this meaning is established et cetera
there is a difference between the two youre assuming that i believe they are a bot without reasonable doubt the player in question could very well be afk still im not going to wait around for an unknown amount of time to confirm and even if i did that still doesnt prove anything youre walking into this thinking that people assume players who dont interact are automatically considered bots and those bots are then reported i dont know where youre getting your information from but like i said ive never seen another player come out right in local chat accusing another player of being a bot and threatening to report them everif someone doesnt respond i dont automatically thing theyre a bot and i dont believe most people do eitherare you sweet talking me i am aware of what im doing and it does matter i dont believe you are aware of what imother people are doing concerning this topic
why is it a contradiction
like i said before it does not change what it is nor does it matter what you think or what you believe when you make the accusationfor example even when i a do not think of myself as a racist would it still be racism if i accused somebody of being a nword i could think about myself whatever i wanted and it would not change a thing but id still be a racist
you tell others not to concern themselves with pointing out the rules to others to let ccp deal with it you point out the rules to others this is a contradiction i thought it was pretty clear already
i felt it to be necessary for this particular discussion do you think i was wrong
based on the moral stand youre taking yes what you did was wrongit clearly contradicts what you have been arguing the situation is different but as you have argued that shouldnt change the application of the standards you seek to upholdis this a threat or a warning youve contradicted your own moral stance by posting albeit with the best of intentions a statement that could be perceived as threateningyou have beautifully illustrated precisely why the proposal youve made is impracticable
in which case you would be using the proposal against me and proven its successit was neither a threat or a warning it was an explanation and a trap for you if you were honestly against the proposal then you would not have used it yet you did and you seem to be enjoying it
youre mistaken im not saying that i think that what you did was wrong im saying that based on the moral stand youre taking what you did was wrongyou contradicted your own moral stance by doing something that you believe to be morally wrong based on your arguments if you believe what youre saying you must believe that what you did was wrongon the contrary what you actually did was to make a mistake see above
it was unfair what i did but not being free of sin only makes us human and shows that we need rules it does not relieve us of them
i have deleted some trolling from this thread
youve incorrectly stated that i used your proposal i have shown that i havent you have provided no evidence to the contraryif you disagree please quote me and i am more than happy to continue our discussion
your feeling that it is necessary to break the rule you yourself proposed shows that the rule should be discarded and discussion of it discontinued your question is therefore not material nor would any other be
if you cannot stay on topic but feel to make this personal then i will just ignore you and not take you serious i am not here to feed a bunch of trolls
i am staying on topic and not making this personal i am making logical arguments which are irrefutable making it personal and going offtopic would be if someone said they werent taking people seriously because they were trolls that would be a real problem if someone did that
i dont see you posting on topiccan we please not have this
