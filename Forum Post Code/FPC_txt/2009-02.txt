yup because abusing the person you want to take up your cause is a wonderful way of getting them to do it there is no magic number but i dont think there are enough people saying do this now compared to the people who are saying no dont do this if i felt strongly about this one way or the other i would or wouldnt pick this topic up to champion or just say no  im still on the fence as to whether this is a good idea or notunfortunately for you i cant just look at minorities which 57 people are and then demand that all of the eve payers want this as i said there are 7 other csms that can champion this right now or you can wait to get a bit more support and then ill consider it again my job is to represent everyone in eve for the betterment of everyone in eve if that means i dont pick something up that i consider is on the fence so be it as for adding elves to eve you can get me 1k people who sign a thread saying yes and i wont champion that topic just because you get a group of people who think its a good idea doesnt necessarily make it a good idea for the gameif you have such major issues with the way im conducting myself as a csm feel free to not vote for me the next time around or maybe grow some balls and run yourself and then you can champion the things you want to champion
this is very rarely the way to go i have always tried to be civil and would like to encourage anyone whom feels strongly about this proposal or any proposal to do the sameobviously anyone who plays is going to have some opinions thoughts or ideas about the game some we agree on some we do not some we dont care about either way i think the point here is there have been topics with much less visibility that have been brought forth to the csmthere are only two csm who have taken the time to reply so the attack isnt directed at solely omber zombie i do realize you probably get messages like this and eve mails constantly i know i sent a few eve mails p but if i knew this was being read by the csm and had an idea where each of you stood i could debate my caseyouve never heard of someone whom created a character for the trial on a whim and then came to love the game but didnt want to sacrifice all the skill time they put into the character to create anotherdont think ive seen many characters sell on the forums because it had a cool name most of us whom buy characters buy them because we want to fly more cool ships or more specialized ships skill pointsobviously the skill points are more important to me than the characters name as theyre important to the majority of players whom buy characters but ive seen a few who didnt sell or didnt get as much as they could because the name was horrible i would think by supporting this proposal you would help the character market because now you can buy a more elite character and rename it to lavista vista and all those crappy character names can be changed thus anyone who cares enough not to buy a character with a bad name can now change itdid i mention that you can already buy a character and off load your scamming character thus hiding your identityedit added reply to lavista vista
it would go well with the t3 module idea coming out

the new maelstromthe maelstrom retains most of its tanking ability and gains the much needed competitiveness at 180200km range minmatar have been sorely lacking it maintains its standoff mainbattle or ship of the line role in close range engagements with improved falloff compare it to the rokh250mm railsabbadon or apoc with pulses before screaming imbala whilst gaining a new style of tanking ability this time useful for its main sniping role as for mission runners the performance of the maelstrom for pve has not diminished due to its new abilities whilst passive tankingwith 1400mm artillery the maelstrom practically performs as before with slightly more dps but 125 less alpha than the tempest as well as generally poorer tracking when using 1650mm artillery fitting becomes harder like amarr pilots with tachyon lasers fitting slots would be requried with similar decisions as to how to fit given the limited nature of slotsusing 1650mm artillery fitting a maelstrom should require at least 1 rcu ii and a pdu ii with a mwd with max filling skills this could be worked around by using grid implants grid rigs or just by dropping a gyrostablier from your fit but for the added range and alpha from 1650mms and potentially improved close range performance i hope this would be a satisfactory compromiseand where does this leave the megathronhyperionuntil the ccp fixes torps lol double sig rad of torps the megathron and hyperion and the rokh for that matter are kinda in the mud id welcome a straight 35 damage increase on blasters because with the web massmwdacceleration changesbut i want my tempest to beits almost as cheap as most tier 1 battleships with a typhoon that would be a better tempest than a tempest could ever be it needs to be something more than the it can 1v1 a megathron even though now it still could sort of or that 1400mm lol alphapest from 2006 the game has evolved its clearer now than ever that when a ship finds a niche it finds a way into your hanger and its this elevation from other battleships into something newdifferent we should be all striving for the game has evolve your ideals will evolve and now cpp the tempest must evolvewhy this is balancedwhy are ravens which are able to do 1100 dps with any damage type out to 30km balanced why are beams which have incredible tracking and damage and now with the apocalypse at highly competitive ranges balanced i really dont know but when you place the changes here in that context combined with some of the stunning flaws inherent with the tools lol artillery clip size and ideology split weapons minmatar ships have to live with combined with the fact that versatilely and utility count for not very much after various waves of nerfs and balances the suggestion posted i and many others would be happy to announce that not only is it balanced its fairwhy 1650mm and not 1600mmsbecause every matari knows every millimeter counts i really dont care what there called tbh as long as its a number bigger than 1400 and not 1600mm  like the plates

1 also other silly thing is the faction navies shooting you in their space when youve done enough missions to opposing faction say your corp goes and ends up in hostile faction space what do you doyes its one of the few roleplaying aspects but its
yes it does count as working as intendedi have pointed out the problem with your proposal i will not continue to repeat myself i will simply take comfort in the fact that i do not expect the developers to implement your proposal even if it is raised by the csmyou can continue to waste your efforts on selling your idea or you can go back and work out something that is better in line with the spirit of existing mechanics
what problem is that specifically your first objection was that this is some kind of attempt at creating a realistic space sim  it isnt your second objection seemed to be that close ranged weapon systems are some how perfectly ok despite the recent 400 cut in effective tracking  ask any blaster piloti guess you probably wont answer but do you see why the tracking formula is flawed do you understand the concept of a closer target should be easier to hitedit not trying to troll or flame you here im really curious as to what you see as the problem with the specific proposals in the linked thread  it would not take us back to the old 90 web dayssecond edit this is not something that has been simply a reaction to the web changes i brought this up a long time ago
goumindong pulse lasers this is effectively what you are referring to would still be hitting less often than in the old 90 web days when targets were effectively stationary as in fact will blasters and autocannons pulse lasers were not overpowered in terms of tracking then  i for one never had any issues taking down pulse boats in my blaster boats provided i didnt try to engage them from too far off  and would not be overpowered after this
some of the mechanics are partly in game most of it should be about the db anyhowkill rights are already a feature in eve so some of the suggestions shouldnt be too hard to implement by connecting kill rights to corpalliance standings for example
i refer to this link
currently there are 10 implant slots 5 hardwiringscan we get like 10 more hardwiring slots please
i think its nice as it is you wont like to get a god character isnt it
while i disagree with the numbers youre talking about maybe having one extra slot that any type of implant of types 610 can be inserted into would work weve all tried to put our implants in order to find that two implants we really like take up the same slotthis would give a small boost to implants without implementing an i win button commentsquestions

i just lawled if ccp goes with this then just lawlthis will actually goin way towards wow in safe place nerfing pvp since people will make loads of alts just to kill rats to make it safe or wat notbut on another note a system could randomly go to low sec00 in a destination with a freighter on auto and we would be like omnomnomnomnom there are good points but bad points and bad points put me off alot in this situation as it will be more kitty online were ratters have no risk but loads of reward
okay i dont do courier missions so i dont know why theyre unpopular but my best guess is that they arent the sort of thing many people really want to pay well for so theres not much money in it do people really want even a dozen couriers active at once very often that only matters if theyre all on the same route and not that bigbecause it only takes 8 to fill a charon which doesnt come up too much are there really that many cases where contracting 3 isnt enough to fill your ship with couriers the one change that does need to be made is upping the max size to size of charon at caldari freighter 5 so that you can do the same hauling with fewer contracts but the contract count doesnt seem to affect it too much id be way more sympathetic to asking to up the limit on trade contracts than courier contracts
one reason is that it seems that more often than not they are scams a person will put a worthless item in the contract give it a huge collateral and put pickup in lowsec and gank anyone that tries to fill the contract and get to keep the collateral or make the drop off a station that the courier cant access why risk a contract that asks you to put up 100 mil but only wants to pay a mil or 2
ccp should realize that alot of players dont log in and play because of this lag if something is not done about it there will be very few people playing fw militia active numbers are falling steadilly
my proposal is to make so that when you set up a pos you should be able to choose what standing other persons must have to get through the shieldit should be completely optional but it makes so that you do not need to give passwords to other alliances for them to come in behind the shield it also makes you not need worry about the enemies getting the password to get inside the shieldthis make it so that your alliance can easy mange who can come through the shield and not
the only reason why this isnt already so must be because the devs in charge are part of large pos warfare alliances and enjoy the spying
2 reasons why this is a terrible idea1  it removes the ability for stupid people to lose ships at their poss by using an obvious password for the shield2  it removes the usefulness of spies and informants in enemy corps for the purpose of gaining access to pos shields and the assets within
or you could try not blindly handing out your password to spies v0v
no reason not to have it if you want to get inside the pos shields shoot it
no the spy just has to have access to change the settings instead of being any old joe bloggs joining an allied fleet so you know it actually takes some effort to infiltrate a spy again instead of being  easy like it is todaysupported but to be honest there are a ton of other more important things that need to be addressed and im currently not involved in pos wars so yay for me p
suppose a fleet fight is escalating beyond the ability of the node to keep up with it what if instead of the node grinding to a halt it spawned one or more wormholes on the grid where most of the action is taking place these would then suck in nearby ships taking a manageable part of the battle elsewhererelated ideas1 titan wormhole gun possibly replacing standard ddspawns wormholes that suck in everything within a certain area on grid and spit it out into wspace2 wormholes triggered by standard dd activationsame sort of idea but less predictable each dd fired in a system during the past hour makes it more likely that the next will trigger a wormhole on that grid
when a battle is too laggy to manage people cant event jump out the system because nothing worksi dont think a wormhole would work in that sense neither too laggy to be sucked in you know what i mean
i see your point but i dont think the comparison is a valid one people actually have to click a button ie communicate with the server to jump through a gate but as planned wormholes will actively suck ships in if theyre close enough
they havent actually decided that wormholes are triggered by proximity yet at least last time i checked the thread but the idea that a dd could cause a random wormhole to get generated is an interesting one
such ideas are already proving popular with certain devs not to mention on shc link to post
well theres a certain humour in the idea of doomsdays not only breaking the servers but breaking spacetime as well i guess but your suggestion just encourages doomsdays instead of fleet fights hey guys not only do we wipe out the enemy fleet but we get a free wormhole to go grab t3 loot afterwards and makes titans less vulnerable because the doomsday just teleported a good chunk of the enemys tacklers and dps to the other end of the universealso this suggestion comes a few months too late  in my recent experience a doomsday doesnt really wreck the node like it used to prequantum rise its the massive battleship andor dread fights that break the most
looks like my ideas already out there
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runneraggro should come from theft which assumes ownership  however if the wreck belongs and i am not saying it has an owner at all to someone it could only belong to the npc corp the mission runner was fighting true power guardian angels etc not the mission runner
hoping to see those minutes sometime still  the csm posts saying weve seen how cool things are gonna be dont help much
taken from omber zombies notes here
ccp has been really busy lately it seems like it might be delayed a slight bit
ya the tournie probably put a bit of a crunch on their manpower just please dont let it fall though the cracks is all i am asking judging by ccp earlier reactions i doubt it will but a good dose of paranoi isnt alwyas a bad thing particularly when traveling low sec 
trust me some interesting info will be released if it isnt out by the end of next week i will try and hear ccp what went wrong
that would go against what ccp tries to accomplish they want although they arent always succesful for 00 and empire space to be interdependant
most of the reasons why i feel you shouldnt be able to change your name have already been listedbut for me the biggest one continues on with eves consequences to your actions  actions creating or buying the character deal with itthe only time i would support it is after having your named nerfd by ccp due to a petiotion you should have a one time option for the same cost as changing your chars face to change your nameif it gets petitioned again and nerfd rinse and repeat
i could swing in either direction on this one i think however i will support it what keeps a person from changing their name in the real world to avoid something they did in their past nothing really though if you dig hard enough you could probably find the truth maybe add a skill criminal investigation to divulge info like this on people
i support any changes that make poss look and operate how they should
as i said numerous times minmatar is the only race without a sniperfleet dedicated ship ie a ship with an optimal range or tracking bonus tempest is the perfect ship to changei dislike the maelstrom changes mainly because they are just never going to happen minmatar gets active shield tanking bonuses that is what we get and it wont change 7th mid would be hot but mimmatar ships cannot get more mids than the caldari raven so that is never going to happen might as well ask for the drone damage bonus on the typhoon instead of the projectile bonus supporting changing the tempest so it can snipe better 1650mm arty is nice are you also in support of a 3rd type of pulse laser
ever since the maelstrom was released the tempest felt like an obsolete platform for sniping switching it to ac specialist makes perfect sense supported
but against nano sniping hacstactical asymmetry is a good thing its less of a problem since the nanonerfa drake is a pretty small moon
niiicesigned
sniping nano hac battleships cant be good at everything u think a mega can hit a sniping nano hac what about a raven with torpsabout the drakeneed to slow the drake down to less than 90ms for torps to do full dmg
definitely
great post artillery always needed that third tier
sure but it would be nice if the tempest was good at one thing you knowbut at 145ms its still going more than all the other turrets
love it
the tracking is one of the main problems with minmatar sniping for the love of god dont make it any worse
i like the idea for the tempest a lot but i would give it the standard 75 tracking along with the 75 damage the agility buff would also improve its utility if it were as agile as a bc coupled with its tracking bonus it would be easier to bring along on fast moving cruiserbc gangs where its various utility slots are of greater use
o
even when i like the tempest as it is now for close range i still think the tempest could need those changes tbhim not a maelstrom user so i dont directly know how the ship is so i cant say anything about boosting for the maelstrom yet then
why would i use a megathron the tempest will just become a megathron more versatile in different roles thats slightly more agile and actually can fight at a reasonable range oh it also have a dronebay larger than other ships only droneships have dronebays larger than that of its bandwidthi cant support this im generally against balancing issues like this overall this issue has certainly nothing but strengthened my believe that balancing issues are completely crap
the megathron has vastly superior range better tracking still and more damage the megathron even after the changes would be the better sniperdont get all emo because all the bonuses look the same differences in slot layouts and weapon systems are enough to differentiate the ships and there rolesautocannon wise the tempest would still suffer from having 6 low slots similar damage with the only difference being how well autocannons compare to pulses
tempest is good at close range dmg atm unless u dont know how to use it and as lavista vista saidwhy would anyone use a megathron after that
a megathron would still do more damage have a better passive tank with better tracking weapons sure it would not beat a tempest 1v1 every single time now but within warp distruption range it would still dominate as it does presentlya 725 damage bonus gives the tempest 416 dps with hail thats nearly a 100 dps drop from the tq version 505 dps the increased drone bay adds another 127 dps bringing it roughly inline with what it was at close range  a net 39 dps gainthe real question should be why do people fly megathrons instead of an apoctyphooninsert armor tanking turret ship here
a tempest can beat a megat every time now if the pilot is any good its all down to the pilot
the fact that your trying to have this discussion in an attempt to suggest that the tempest equv to the megathron suggests that something wronghave you ever flown a typhoon against a megathronsure theyll have similar bonuses but beyond extra tracking 1v1 wise little changes for sniping and anti support it sets its self apart from the maelstrom and creates a niche within the battleship line up  thats the objective and i think i achieve that with these changes
i dont do 1v1 balancing things based on 1v1 in general is a faulty way of doing it imo i fly a pilgrim solo and kill battleships with it by myself does that mean battleships are underpowered or pilgrim is overpowered no it just means that i knew to fly my ship better than my opponent knew hisbut dont underestimate a typhoon given player skills and skillpointsseeing as you need both ac and missiles the phoon might just win having flown one myself im very well aware of how nasty it can be despite peoples perception of it as a trashbin
i have flown a typhoon but we r talking about the tempest here with your changes its giving the tempest less dps giving it more drones makes it worse as drones can be killed thus losing more dps than current tq versioni still dont see how it will be a sniping antisupportthis is arties you are talking about isnt it
supportedive felt ive wasted training time into maxing minmatar battleships and turned towards training and always flying amarr
itll have better tracking with artillery and more alpha with 1400mms 125 more with an increased drone bay similar but not as large as the typhoon
if tracking is what matters in antisupport it will still be worse with arties but you may have also created problems with the ship when used with acs
i just noticed that the thread is titled  issue tempest vs mealstrom v2mealstrom om nom nom nom nom nomyou gotta admit the typhoonmaelstrom does any role better than the tempest isnt that worth looking at i would also like to see this tempest fitting that can beat any megathron pilot
hes probably thinking lar1600mm plate dual webs dual neuts or something whilst forgetting that theres half a dozen ships in which that razor thin balance between death and the target warping the  out just doesnt apply not that the situation in of its self is how you balance anything lolapoc
tempest fitting is 800s siege launchers gyrostabs plates web mwd painter other stuffoh and pilot skill
lol at this stupid thread this is not balance this is how to make matar the best in everything even in fleet sniping
nope even after these changes it would still have to go to the amarr
who cares about amarr as apoc is op both megathron and rokh would be completly useless compared to the tempestmatar speed and hit and run close range race  no need to have good sniper fleet bs
thanks for proving my point phoon does plate gank much better and the pest will do less damage than the megat at the same ranges unless you are trying to make us believe you can stay out of web range of a megat pilot skill nothing the megat is going to catch you and you will be fighting at 5km while webbed
phoon  5 heavy drones 4 torps 4 gunstempest  6guns 2 launchers 3 heavy drones different kind of gank ship oh and you are supposed to web them back or keep out of web rangebut aparantly in another thread blasters cant hit anything orbiting it i loled tbhif anything its acs that need a dmg increaseas for the tempest itselfits fine
i dont think that even with 1650mms minmatar will be able to hit at 200km well at there optimal they would have the worst tracking by orders of magnitude poor clip size with only 15 more alpha than tachyons on an abaddon and a 5 damage increase  as for the tempest it would be basically the same as current but with more tracking on what is currently the worst tracking poorest range turrets relative to all the other fleet snipers
you seem to miss out falloff all the timeprojectiles have the longest falloff yeh u dont hit everytime in falloff but atleast u can hit way past optimal unlike pulse lasers which have a higher optimal to compensate for their low falloff seems to me you are slowly turning this into a my projectiles cant do what lasers are doing so amarr are overpowered thread
artillery cant and wont hit at the optimal ranges megathrons and rokhs can insteadhappy
yes please make my large sailboat usefull again
support
supporting with my amarr char so have reason to use my minny char in bs
i am happily the first to say in any crowd that minmatar battleships are broken however these changes will do nothing to help themwhat you need to do is creativity a role for then not new module after 2 12 years in the game im not really sure what the role of the tempist was ever meant to becurrently the typhoon is a reasonably good npcing ship and close range bs however its split weapons mean that there is no best optimal range for it and alternatives like the armageddon and domi have better tank dps and alphathe tempist is good at close range combat with artillery and siege missile launchs  however it is less useful at sniping then a mealstrom and utterly terrible in comparison to other ship in large fleetsthe maelstrom has a high alpha and thats where it needs to excel unfortunately it was made as a minmatar mission running ship at which it is utterly terrible and cannot hit npcs to justify undocking this ship is best used as a fleet sniper however it becomes uncompetitive at any reasonable sniping range as its alpha is pathetically small in the shot optimal and long falloffwhat actually needs to change1 auto cannons  drastically i cant remember the last time i saw an ac fit bs for pve or pvp both terrible range and terrible tracking  no hits2 theres no sniper bs this race needs a sniping battleship that does large alpha traded with low dps however this is not in the game at the moment because the alpha cannot reach the target atm not the tempist nor the mealstrom can be effectively manipulated into this role
1st its called tempest not tempist2nd autocannons are totally fine as they are now its the artillery that needs to be looked atbut i still use t2 1400mms because they are fun to use not because they are omgimthabestever bcuz i have the highest dps
nt
i have long argued that the tempest and large projectiles in general are in need of some fixing a third artillery size and a change to the tempestmaelstrom bonuses would go a fair way to fix them i especially feel like the maelstromtempest need more to distinguish them for pvp right now the maelstrom is just a slower tempest with more ehp
like it
fun fun but a little bit late 
yeah to drone love
well some long time ago i found some abandoned drones at a station i tried to scoop them to sell yay t2 drones but got a message that i cannot do that since the drones are still attached to the owner but the pilot was not in system so it was 12 ass implemented alreay in the past 
give love back to the missiles
im always up for more drone love

the lols that would ensue when unsuspecting ratters warp in on top of a pirate camp that has a ratter pinned and in deep structure would be epic i fully support this as a method for pirates to bait mission runners and ratters to come to themor heck just release the distress beacon and wait for the antipirate wannabes to show up this would be great
how to solve tracking problemUFFFD change t2 ammo bonuses to compensate web nerf void hail conflagraition 75 tracking instead 50 null barrage scorch 50 tracking instead 25now t2 close ammo worse then faction
no   what leaded us to this situation carebears whines about nanosi escaped nanos many times  know that the best anti nano thingy is a domi fitted with heavy neutnos  sentries which is a easy setup to bring into a ganghow to solve this issue to noobs as ccp said it was a violation of ingame physic  my solution your ship has max speed if you go above this max speed you take structural damages and agilitytrackingrange drop seriouslyin order words  you can run but then youll be blind  harmless
i support this thread heavily between web nerf agility and t2 blaster ammo its very hard to make a good blaster boaton the other hand i find that flying the drone boats still works just fine so for anyone who is specced into gallente only i suggest getting into an ishtar domi myrmidonect until these issues are resolved
not that im against this but can you explain to me how i managed to hit a deimos good in my navy mega with caldari navy antimatter l on my neutrons ii when i had him webbed while he was orbiting me at 25 kmi was standing still though and this was on sisi and no its not any different from sisi to tq when its about the tracking and webbersi dont see any issues with large blasters as they are now maybe its just me though hehim almost maxed in skills for blasters from small to large and i have gallente frig cruiser and battleship at level 5but one thing is for sure though if the tracking on blasters are getting boosted then for sure they should boost the tracking on the autocannons to
and how were your shots connecting  just hitting and reliable putting damage on a target are 2 different things btw doesnt the navy mega have 1 mid from standard mega  2 webs change the situation a bit
a navy mega have one extra low slot not an extra mid slot the vindicator have 5 mid slots so i was then only using one gallente navy webberand yeh i was hitting the deimos good enough to melt him pretty fast
how about a hulktype space frame with room for 4 strip miners requiring exhumers vit would have a cargo hold to match the increased output of the strip miners with 1 extra low slot for a third expanded cargohold ii lets name it barsoomit would be a miners mining boat the big papa bear of exhumers obviously it would cost halfway between ridiculous and obscene but as with the hulk it would be worth the price of admissionwould that be a ship the miners among you would want to flydont spare your candid remarks show me you careabulurd bonifaceme meceo
sure as long as it cant enter highsec  we already have enough macro miners and large corps stripping multiple systems in a day
nothe hulk as it is should only be granted to those who have exhumes iv or v imhosuch a ship would make a mess of things and as obviously pointed out already not allowed in high sec
being a miner i would worship this ship but i dont see it practical from a gameplay balance point of view if it did i agree lowsec only and it would have to have some draw back other than just needing exhumers v and an obscene price
its february and we have seen almost nothing from ccpwhere is the report where are the names where is an accounting of the fraudulent materials where is even the smallest measure of transparency on this important issue
seriously in that wall of text thats all i read lets discussyes because your standings to the caldari navy really matter when doing missions with an employer who is at war with them thats like saying you wanna work at mcdonalds but dont ever want to see hamburgers wouldnt that make suicide ganking easier since the sec hits will be less o wait you forgot about yourself whining about that last cyclebut seriously if you wanna give a little i dont mind gankingerr taking a littleno noand as tchell said go back to wow missions are already risk free you cant make friends with everybody in this game and still be trusted by everyone additionally could you imagine the abuse if you could just cycle through available missionsonly getting the ones you likeare profitable oh thats right its only an exploit if it involves pee vee peein short missions need nerfingnot boostinglast time i checked it occurs on the 9th of march are you saying that a csm is either ignorant of that or too butt hurt to stfu for one more month or both i mean its not like missions havent been like this sinceyears
cultivating decent agents is difficult  there are typically a limited supply of decent level 3  4 agents available in a given area and it takes time to grind the standings necessary to access themif i end up with 4 or 5 agents all offering me missions that i cannot take due to playstyle choices such as not ruining my amarr faction status given im fighting for them then i have several options for other isk generation1 come back in 4 hours and try again2 decide to go find some random frigate or destroyer and do a level 1 mission with another corp and gain very little satisfaction loot or even isk for the privilege3 mine  because thats always such a draw4 if i even have the option drag a mission ship  a salvage ship all the way to an entirely different area of space assuming ive cultivated yet another bunch of highlevel agents  by the time ive done so without autopilot i might as well have done something outside eve vastly more productive and just taken a new mission 4 hours lateras a player with a life and thus limited time i pick option 1 i see no reason to waste time in eve when i can do something much more fun and then come back to eve when it is fun again if i were the game designer for eve id want people spending more time in eveas my partner says who doesnt pvp eve doesnt lend itself to playing all daya shame anhk that your post will languish here in assembly hall mostly trolled by those who never do missions but i applaud the effort in the face of mindless adversitythankfully you dont run eve as youre aptly illustrating that you cannot see others point of view its amazing how many stupid people dont grasp the difference between cold harsh world and cold harsh user interface to that world one can make mechanics far more accessible to a wider audience without sacrificing any ingame harshnessso a player that actually plays a role and thus makes intelligent choices in the game instead of being gungho and shooting anything that moves is not something you wish to encourage in a roleplaying game perhaps the problem is in the players who like you appear to perceive this as simply unreal tournament in space  no consequences no need for choices just shoot mindlessly if your best retort to those who take an opposing standpoint to your own views is to insult and blame their outlook on life instead of being objective one wonders how you cope in a medium like the csmpot calling kettle black
normally i dont troll but really is your life this pathetic or were you just incredibly bored if you cant say anything useful why speak at allum how about making your own thread on your strong feelings instead of hijacking other peoples that are on different topics the riskreward balance is entirely unrelated to the ops post
not exact you can use more than one gas harvester the use turret slots so some race can have an harder timestill equipping a bs with cargo expanders and gas harvesters is a horrible way to pass some hour but it can be the way to give a krnonos some usefulness in missions as athre pointed out doing half of a mining mission icegasasteroid is indifferent mission before dt is the worst way to do it as the target reset and the mission cant be delivered until the target asteroidice asteroidgas cloud isnt completly depleted
i see you dont know the difference between security standing and faction standingor you are feigning ignorance to score a pointmmmm decidedly trying to score point playing stupid so far no informations on mission changes with the new expansion there will be a whole new tiers of ships t3 a big expansion in exploration 2000 systems a new scanning systems and some odd and ends but no hard information on changes on the standing system some voices about new missions but until we see some hard data they are only voices we have heard voices of epic mission arcs before half of the expansions in the last 2 years and we are still here with the same system for missions
actualy its correct  you get negative faction standing for killing that faction ships  not only for completing storylines for the opposing faction 
i dont really have a problem with the four hour lockout but i do with the asymmetric standing changes you get in missions against another empire faction if im getting sent out to kill caldari in job lots the gallente federation as a whole ought to show some appreciation for my effortsalternately maybe a new skill is called for advanced diplomacy rank 3 or 4 reduces standings loss from killing faction ships by 20100
i agree the 4hour countdown is a pita as well but a necessary evil i think and something i can deal with as others noted just go find something else to dothat said i would like ccp to review how missions are assigned while i bet overall on a large scale the missions are handed out randomly the random generator that draws from a given list can be decidedly streaky streaks are actually a natural outgrowth of a genuine rng but the problem is the streaks seem to hit a single person rather than the streak being distributed across a lot of peoplethere have been a number of times where i got a vs faction mission declined it and got another vs faction mission worse i got materials for war preparation eight or morei was not counting at first times in a row i forget the last few i got while grinding standing for a new corp but again i received this utterly stupid important mission several times in a row had to drive like 3j in a shuttle to deliver something i appreciate that we will not like all missions and occasionally we get some crap we do not want to do and either need to suck it up and do it or take the timer i just wish there was a better spread in what gets handed outalmost forgotthe faction hit is staggering when you are liked some noob corpmates of mine wanted some help with some missions without asking i rambled over to them to help and twice helped them shoot amarr ships this is the only time in ages i have shot at amarr but figured i had pretty good standings so no biggiehelp the noobs when i was done i lost access to my l4 agents and had to grind up from l2 agents it should sting some but cmonand yeahi am aware that that makes me the real noob of the bunch
several months ago like 6 or 7 months ago eve removed the ghost traming and the stated responce from ccp was essentialy that it was a bug that it is not fair to other paying players nor to ccp because you should not be able train a charactor while not paying its unfair to others and unfair to ccp for maintaining said data base for you for freeand now i say in responce to that the followingi pay for my account and as such in my subscription account i am able to create three charactors i pay for these charactors i should also be able to train them simultaneously as wellthere is no reason why i should not be able to train them what purpose does having an alt slot in your account have i can only train one charactor at a time you wont give me skill queing only one charactor can log in at a time and there is no more ghost training then i should have available to me that witch i am paying for i pay a subscription and that subscription gives me three charactors choice that i can create and train i should be able to train all three at the same time there only relation to each other is that they come with one subscription feethere has never been any legit reason given why we can not train are alts at the same time no data base issues no data server side issues server lag issues nothing there has never been any reasons given other than the player suggested responce of greed ccp has said that they love the game and there player base but that they are also a businessthose players who have any reason for needing a second account 95 of the time it has been because they need to be able to log in both charactors at the same time carrier cyno alts fleet scouts etc you cant do that with a single account so ccp you would not loose any revenue by allowing us to sim train our altssupport this pettion with your comments and sign on to get our csms to bring this to bare with ccp
i dont know whether to laugh at him or take pity on him
oh my i want becuz and i am paying for and dev now becuz and it aint fair becuz ccp and stuff
i agree with the op we should be able to train our alts as for the the previous comments neither have more than 6 mths in game alot of weight your opinion holds or constructive for that matter
you failed to support the topicand no just no
is this an attempt at trolling
posting with an alt  5posting like a 3rd grade kid  10epic fail for troll  priceless

supporting some form of revamp for tracking as it stands if i am in one of my auto bs boats orbiting another close range bs boat at relative optimal ranges i hit less then i would at say opt  falloff as for the comment about making this a more realistic game and its not supposed to be blah blah i dont believe it was intended for us to not be able to shoot a stationary target 2x the size of our ship at 0 and not be able to hit it it once fix this issue
pulse lasers certainly were better than they should have been in terms of short range tracking in the 90 web days you could figure that just by running simple dpsehp tests 90 webs meant that short range ships needed to get into their optimals against laser ships nearly instantly or they would not have sufficient traction to win a fight without better skills or equipmentat least on the battleship level that you were able to kill pulse boats says nothing towards their actual effectiveness
the vocal minority of blaster pilots that post all over the boards are wrongandor troll altsthere is no reason other than its more realistic which you have explicitly denied as being a reason in the paragraph above there is no flaw in the formula unless you state that the goal of the tracking formula is realism and not balanceand it was just as dumb then as it is now
just as dumb  ok whatever you say whether or not you choose to acknowledge it closerange ships are having more trouble hitting their targets and short of boosting their tracking not possible too much of a boost with regards to use of t2 long range ammo modifying the tracking formula is a perfectly valid approach
pulses need a nerf not a buff not supported
like what weakness  all the low tracking guns have lower dps as the high tracking guns also if you manage to immobilize a target at 100m next to your capital gun you should be able to vaporize it as it is basicaly in the barrel of your gunsame goes for long ranged setups they already have about 12 the dps of the same class short range gunnow medium range guns like pulse lasers are a problem but they are again lower dps or should be than the close range cannonsso either the guns are not ballanced now and the imbalance will show in a proper tracking formula or we need to do a few tweaks afterwards but no imbalance will resultmaybe wed need to reverse the tracking boost on lasers 
they are but the short range weapons are by necessity not that far ahead that you can forgo tracking at short range as an advantagethis is a false dichotomy it is also possible that the guns are balanced now or require no changes in the formula to get right
valid approach to what close range ships are hitting just as much as they ought to be you dont need to hit all the time to win you just need to hit more than the other guy and if you want to hit more maneuver for less transversal
its the tracking advantage that this proposal is trying to fix  because right now they have a small tracking advantage but its still insufficient to hit at those close ranges reliably its like the missiles argument in nano age that they always hit  yes they do  for 01 damage which is 0 for all practical purposes  same with close range turret tracking the advantage in absolute numbers is still irrelevant 
if you immobilize a target then you wont miss it at 100m you will only miss if you are moving or you have failed to immobilize your targetif realism is the goal then yes closer should be easierhowever the goal is not realism the goal is game balance having a game balanced so that being closer is always better will result in people try to get as close as possible with no interest in range control beyond getting as close as possible that does not encourage diversification in range control it encourages bumper boatsgame balance dictates that being too close must be a bad thing so that people will attempt to find a comprimise between too close and too faras i have said before dont bother with realism in requesting game mechanics look for something that adds to the game no game mechanics have been added or changed to make things more realisticif you think that there is a problem with the effective range of shortranged weapons then look for some effective mechanics based on the merits of the mechanics alone once the mechanic has been developed then you can go looking for someway of describing it to sound realistic but that is by no means requiredrewriting the tracking mechanics is a massive change and would therefore require substancial justification however if the problem can be solved without rewriting fundamental mechanics those options will be exausted first regardless of what realism the other option might provide
actualy this has worked like that always the main factor being warp disruption ranges  a medium range setup is only usefull if you can hold the target at that range this dictates the need for a gang close range boats were always solo because they do not work well in gangs this was a balanced scenario now with hictors dictors and disruptor range bonused ships combat range can be more variable
supporting my beatch
needs to be tweaked but this has my support 
superb concepts worthy of the devs looking at in my view
absolutely 100 supportedthis idea could go hand in hand with the minianchorable idea that the csms have been talking with ccp about even more than billboards it would be nice to see things like deployable asteroidice belt structures and things of that naturealso there have been comments that while the new wormhole space as of yet cannot be claimed as current 00 they realize that we want to control that space too so they are looking into it it might be interesting if ccp would implement this new type of sovereignty into current 00 and leave the wormhole space completely lawless perhaps you will be able to eventually deploy anchorable structures in the wormhole space but you wont have the type of control over ithe space that we could see in current 00

long time ago i proposed this idea i guess we have seen some of it implemented although i would have preferred an hg sets available as well but overall we can never go wrong with more implants of various kinds so sure lets have some more implants so long as it is thought out supporting this in principle

most of you are aware that low security systems are usually less secure then alliance controlled 00 systems and while others proposal are based on npc intervention this is not my idea is to make low security more secure then 00 systems but also to allow players who wish to be pirates and law breakers to continue to do solets call it boosted player intervention bpibasic idea is to allow players who desire to be real anti pirates to be so and would be responsible for boosted security of low security systemsplayer would enlist himself via new option in stations similar to militia officethis enlisting will not be just for cosmetic purpose but will give player through time some boostsenlisted players will have few advantages and disadvantages lets start with advantagesplayers enlisted in bpi will get bookmark of fight in system in which he is at that moment whenever fight starts between targets which are not in warwith increasing rank he will be able to see who is fighting who on first rank he will only see that bookmark shows number of targets through time and progressing through ranks he will see ship classesup to highest rank which will give him complete coverage of pirates tactical abilities speed optimal etclike all bookmarks it will allow them to warp to that place 0100km distanceeach time he warps to location while fight is hopefully still in progress he will be able to use any resources at his disposal to shoo away pirates each time he is successful and manage to kill pirates double bonus if victim is still in its ship he will get few points depending on ship which he killed number of points will be dependent on ship class this is just examplebs kill will give player enlisted in bpi 100 ptsmarauder 200ptsblack op 150 ptsthis points which will be cumulative and never will fade will not be just ornamental they will be crucial to rank progressionand rank progression will give boost to player ship this is also just examplewhen player is enlisted he will got minor bonuses i used concord insignias as just example of ranks with idea of boost which will they grantlowest to highest rankupdatedscroll downsoldier rank 5 increased resistance of yours ship shield and armorpiranha rank bonus from previous rank and 5 capacitor recharge ratepanther rank all previous bonuses  3 bonus damage captain rank 10 increased resistance of yours ship shield and armor 5 cap recharge  5 damageraptor rank previous rank bonus and  10 reduction of any ewar on youcolonel rank previous rank bonus  10 increased speed  10 signature radiusofficer rank 10 increased resistance 10 cap recharge 10 dmg 20 duration of any ewar on you 20 cap neutralized or drained 10 increased speed  10 signature radiusgeneral rank previus bonus but 25 cap rechargestar rank 20 increased shield and armor resistance 25 cap recharge 10 dmg dealt 20 duration or effect of any ewar modules on you 10 speed 10 sig radius immunity to warp scramblingthis bonuses looks great but only best and most dedicated players will reach star rank and to reach it it will require example 500 marauders killed or 1000 bss in order that player progress from soldier to star ranknote this bonuses will apply to any ship which are you using and only when you using it it will not be applied in high security or in 00 sec systems while you are in bpi modus you will not be able to use fof smartbombs ecm bursts and only while you are in bpi modus this bonuses will applyplayer will be able to enter bpi as many times as he or she wishes when he or she enters there will be some bad sides attacking neutral ships will result in triple then usual security standing and losing a 10 of all points earned  if points reach 0 you will be kicked out from bpi program for 1 month
if you wish to ask what is point of all this simply to make low security systems safer then 00 are and not to ruin fun for piratesof course players will be able to see on map where is high number of players enlisted in bpi program and avoid or be braver to enter this systemthis will allow players to use more low security systems and this programe will not be able to remove or make pirates redundant because in more populated systems there will be multiple fights gangs who could take with easy most ranked bpi players but because of ability of higher ranks to avoid most of things that pirates throw of them it will be real chase of cats and mouses after all those who reach star rank will not be solable and will have ability to move without fear of scrambling even in haulers will you use alt and waste isk on 1000 bss just to get to that rank or will you start to proactively look for targetsits all up to you but even star ranks will be easy pray to well organized pirates gangs few last notes bonuses will not be stackable with active triage or siege modules  one time warning message will be displayed which can be removed after that when player enlisted in bpi is in system  killing attackers will not result in security penaltyit will result in security boost and pod killing same targets will result in 12 of usual security penalty  ranked players in bpi programe will have a slight chance of faction loot same loot list like in lp stores so soldier have chance to drop not only modules and his items in cargo bay but some minor faction ammo or newbish implantbut general or star ranked players can drop bpc but it will be a chance basedso if someone kills 10 times star rank probably will not get navy mega bpc but if that players is killed 50 times there is a chance for it to drop those faction items will be based on isk lost in destroyed modules just to prevent exploits those who reach higher ranks of course can be payed to look at other side and not interveneor just opposite to stay by yours side while you or yours alt p mine or run those super lvl 5 missions any idea which would make this more easier to implement is useful thank you for yours timesoldier rank 3 increased resistance of yours ship shield and armorpiranha rank 3 increased resistance of shield and armor and 3 cap recharge ratepanther rank 3 increased resistance of sh and ar 3 cap recharge and 3 damage donecaptain rank 5 increased resistance of sh and ar 5 cap recharge and 5 damage doneraptor rank 5 increased resistance of sh and ar 5 cap recharge and 5 damage done and reduction of effectiveness of ewar modules on you by 3colonel rank 5 increased resistance of sh and ar 5 cap recharge and 5 damage done and reduction of effectiveness of ewar modules on you by 3 and 5 penalty of mwd modules and 5 reduction in signature radius while mwd module is active officer rank 7 increased resistance of sh and ar 7 cap recharge and 7 damage done and reduction of effectiveness of ewar modules on you by 5 and 5 penalty of mwd modules and 5 reduction in signature radius while mwd module is active general rank 7 increased resistance of sh and ar 10 cap recharge and 7 damage done and reduction of effectiveness of ewar modules on you by 5 and 5 penalty of mwd modules and 5 reduction in signature radius while mwd module is active star rank 7 increased resistance of sh and ar 15 cap recharge and 7 damage done and reduction of effectiveness of ewar modules on you by 5 and 5 penalty of mwd modules and 5 reduction in signature radius while mwd module is active 2 warp strength
bonuses could be applied via ship module probably low slot which will be buyable in any stations to fit it player would need one of ranksfor every rank there will be one kind of module which would have assigned bonusesif player in bpi program attack neutral and his rank decrease sufficient number of points his module will go offlinethose modules will also automatically go offline when player jump to high or 00 sec systems price should be minimal and cpupowergrid need should not be problematic to any fit and if player in bpi is killed while having this module equipped in his ship this bpi module will always be destroyed and for rp sake they will get note in local  secret peace of equipment self destructs or something similar
i really like this idea a lot i actually like this idea a hell of a lottwo things first of all being i think that the bonuses from ranks would need to be nerfed down a bit not sure about exact numbers but those sound a bit extremesecond im not too sure how i like the idea of players dropping faction loot and such i think that if pirates take out one of these deputies they should just drop what they have and their ship should be salvageable
i agree and would add 1 extra point  can you please stick with a normal rank naming system pirahna and panther seem a bit out of placeand kind of silly p excellent idea though
see this is a problem for me suddenly in order to turn a profit the trader has to sign up to getting ganked everywhere he goessurely you realise this would destroy trading as a profession and surely you realise what that would do for the wider economy
theres two reasons why courier contracts suck one is that 95 of them are pirate scams transporting worthless junk with a massive collateral into low and null sec then the pirates are either gate camping or have simply locked the door to the stationthe other reason is because that other 5 doesnt pay worth  theres a lot of cheapskates who set up courier contracts with unreasonably low rewards ive even seen contracts with rewards so low as one thousand isk killing a single rat in high sec pays better than these contracts
this although i thought the locking the door trick was deemed an exploiti could be wrong thoughit bears repeating though far and away the vast majority of courier contracts are scams the legitimate ones pay so poorly that no one would ever want to bother most everyone at least has a hauler alt or can haul themselves few will ever pay good money to let someone else move their stuff
i wrote this in a stealth bomber boost proposal topic but it seems to me theres no much enough players who will read that one so the ideawhy not to give all missilebased weapons rockets missiles torpedoes bombs an ability to not disappear after its owner warped out or died or even used cloaking devicei have some reasons for this1 most missilebased weapons independent from its launcher operators exceptions are laserguided systems and some other they are commonly fire and forgot weapon2 this will give a new life for guerilla tactics just imagine a couple of stealths decloaks fires some missiles and warps out or lets take a look to pve when npc dies its missiles will be able to bring a surprise for a player3 how much players are using defender missiles atm but after implementing this feature defender missiles must take its place
i dont have an issue with this let that last volley of torps do something to the enemy after you die
1 ordinary missiles are not fire and forget only fof missiles are2 defender missiles are not used not because there are not enough missiles but because they are crapbut i agree with your basic point that at least some types of missiles should still hit and deal damage even if the ship that fired them dies cloaks or warpseither this should be true for all fof missiles or ccp should introduce a new special ammunition for stealth bombers smart missiles with autonomous targeting that stay active under the above circumstances
no you shouldnt be able to kill anything unless you are on grid missiles dont utilize tracking so you can shoot while aligning and never get caught
yes but the launch makes in the grid atm i have fitted a raven with fof missiles and rigs with maximal flight distance about 380km the eve blocked my attempts so i think there is no problemnext i used a bomber with a bomb have launched it warped out i was not in the grid when the bomb dealed its 8ks so we have a weapon wich able to deal damage without its owner in the gridthen lets talk about guns when you makes a shot eve counts a chance to hit right with this mechanism no rounds fired are lives more than its owner right gunners are able to shoot and warp out but missile boats are still vulnerable while their charges flows to their targets or they do 0 damage after warping outwho wants to tell me learn guns i have elite gunnery and elite missile sertificates on different accounts so im able to see difference myself not only with loud words
how do you balance the fact that 10 small ships should usually kill the 1 large ship every time will that still be considered overkill will the guy that took on 10 ships receive no loot because he was overkilling themonly major flaw i see in an otherwise interesting proposal
this could be fun for those people who like taking out larger targets with smaller ships
damage to loot due to weapons fire makes sensehowever its kind of a game design issue regarding the desire for more smallscale combat and less ganking opposed to the game mechanics forcing people into making playstyle choices and eve is all about freedom so doing that too much is badplease discuss this furtherby the way it might be slighty offtopic but consider module damage when the ship goes into structure as well people have requested this on occasion because it is odd that a ship operates at 100 efficiency while its with 1 structure left and spewing flames everywhere
i think it will be years before we see anything like this but i still think its a great idea
you mean like i blob the target with x small ships and i get all the rewards however if said target is killed by a solo bs that bs gets nothing there is no logic nor benefit to your idea your post lacks any kind of detail and i am able to think out quite many ways to go around the restriction 
incredibly bad idea
this wouldnt negate larger ships shooting smaller ships plenty of people still kill for fun out of boredom or with higher goals than profittherefore  its not forcing anyone to act in a smaller gang i would like to know if the system would be based on hull class as opposed to role ie an assault ship is still a frigatei think it would add an extra layer of realism to combat
only bump and if no more support will die
your village called they want there stockpile of tin foil hats backamongst other thingsas for the proposal i honestly dont know if its a good ideaor a bad one
bumpmaybe some dev will take this into consideration for the march expansion

ninja salvager should be agro to mission runner
the idea of a player elected council is great on all account however there tends to be bias for obvious reasons is this bad no where it does however become a problem is where the size of the council means that the priority list put forward can be skewed how can this be solved players needs to represent themselves to the csm this could be done on the forum it would however require huge amount of actual workbecause of that im working on a system to bring this concept to life every time the csm submits a list of issues to ccp much in the same way we prioritize issues the people should be able to compose their own priority list as well this has several interesting impacts1 we can show ccp what the players thinks not just the highprofiled players who gets elected to the csmeven if people who arent that wellknown have and can be elected2 we represent a broader audience3 we will get an idea about how well the csm actually represents the playerbase if the prioritylists made from this system is the polar opposite of what comes out of the csm we have a problemim looking for initial feedback do you think this brings value to the system and procedures as a whole
is that not the point of our current form of elected representative democracyanywho get ccp to add in the thumbs down feature in the assembly hall i think that might help towards some of what your speakjust realise that as long as 10ish percent of the player base seems to vote for csm or reads the forums nothing will be truely represent the whole playerbase just as in rl social political and economic issues there are many who cant be arsed to be a part of the solution and would rather plod along either ignorant or despondant
along with the thumbs down dont require posting as long as the player is logged in so other than having multiple accounts anonymous votes per player
basically you hit a button and all of your stuff not including carriers drugs etc and moves it to your current station each time you do this the fee for doing it would go up the fee should start at something pretty high like 100m isk and should escalate from there
considering that there are faction ships for each of the pirate factions that means they have to have some form of rd even if its a twisted form could be a path for faction t2 ships or less scrupulous tech to get on the marketdl
i agree with alex i too will support this but would be nice with some limitations attached as in one time name change with fee adding a investagation skill into character background would be awesome the higher the skill the more info you can get character name skill points even maybe current ship tie this into the locator agent option but require a skill set

any kinda of debate to boost minmatar bss gets my approvalalthough the tempest would certainly be nicer with that 7th high slot for another acarty
in the op i try to define the tempests role as anti support skirmishersniper or weapons platform similar to the muninnif you believe acs are lacking check out this thread
not gonna happen noone wants to get in a battleship just to shoot supportthats what smaller ships are for tempest needs to stay how it isu can change the maelstrom if u wantbut if u change the shield boost bonus the minmatar mission runners are gonna hate you
believe it or not but there are styles of game play that exist right now that you may be completely unaccustomed to but thats okim pretty sure theyd be happy with the passive tanking ac sponge of doom that 25 to base shields would give
ahh so just cos u want to use a ship for sniping you want everyone to i get you now
personally i have 3 races battleship to lvl 5 and if i really wanted my favourite ship to be boosted id be asking the ccp for a 7th low to the hyperiontheres an issue with the typhoontempestmealstrom and there roles and this is the best solution i can come up with without screwing up balancenow are you done trolling this thread yet
congrats so do quite a few peopletyphoon  turretmissiledrone gank ship  can fit a nice armor tank on ittempest  turret gank shipsniper  can fit decent plate setup onmaelstrom  mission runnersniperclose ganksorry the only ship role that needs changing is the maelstrom to be more of a sniper rather than a close ganker
i think youve just proved my pointthe tempest has roles which overlap with each of its racial peersin every case its a poorer alternative to them decent plate setup with 6 lows ganking with turrets who cares when the phoon does the most dps of any bs in the game and the mealstrom has more turrets and a better active tankthe tempest is pig in the middle im sorry to say with the tracking bonus and a new tier of artillery i ope to provide a clear distinction between it and the maelstrom for sniping with little changing as far as close quarters is concerned
seriously have you never flown a plated gank tempest before thats just like saying hyperion and mega are the samelets change themsame with the geddon and abaddonall dmg shipsbut no we cant have more of them can weso lets change everything shall we maelstrom is the only one that needs changing as its the one that overlaps the other 2 ships roles
interesting idea the tempest does need some work and the 1650s give the minnies some of that alpha oompf theyve been missing of late
i didnt read it all but if this makes my sniper nano tempest better i support
ill support on my random alt aswelltridane
along with your changes i wouldid increase pg of tempest so could fit 1400smwd without rcu like the megathron hence its 1400 performance vs maelstrom would improve but still 1650 would be the maelstroms strength the extra fitting would also help a little bit in close range but would only upgrade a gun or twomaelstrom i think the hp bonus with 7 mids  4 lows is possibly to strong mids for a shield tanker are a lot better and 4 lows is perfect 3 damage mods  dc for example the 7th mid could be used for boost amp hence giving it back the shield boost it had with the lose of a low that would only be a pdsnanoistab low value mod traded for more hp 74 with no tanking bonus would be balanced like 65 with tank bonus imo hence scrap the hp bonus and go for something else although im not sure atm slap whoever says tp bonus
what about the base hp bonus with the current slot configuration and if so a 25 1 lse or 50 2 lse
nice idea pattern its about time someone thought seriously about the future roles of the minmatar lost battleship tempestalso its about time that the maelstrom could be used as a proper sniper rather than just a second rate megathron wannabeyou got my vote on this
you forgot to check the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on thing before you posted
sure 65 layout with a base hp increasing bonus would be great 10k with skills lse increases to 13281 so a bonus to equal a lse would be 33 so probably 75 base shield hp per level would be best with nerfing of recharge so at level 4 or 5 its same as currently so gives a little more than a lse in a 7th mid without losing the 5th low which is low value close range but higher value for sniping rcupds without losing 3gyro and dc or a te which is better than tcps remebered to push support this topic button this time
and done
i approve d
how about you keep one of them an ac boat and one of them an arty boatwhat is the insanity that makes you want both the maelstrom and tempest to be ac and arty boats arent you always complaining about how terrible it is that the ships are not specialized all youre going to do is make one of them suck and the other one be better a mael with more hit points would be a fine sniper in its own right without adding another size of artillerycould use more fitting and a smaller signature as well the pest will never be a good sniper but is currently in a niche that your changes do not fix except to make fitting it for its intended goal edly easyjust because the mega is the rail sniper for gallente and the hyp is the blaster boat does not mean that the pest needs to have fitting comparable to the gallente rail sniperhow about thisyou increase the pests drone bay to 300 and its bandwidth to 100 this gives it versatility in drone choice as it has versatility in med slots and in high slots this is a slight damage boost and a large utility boost as different drones for different things can be carried other than changing the armorshield values you do nothing elseyou do nothing but increase the fitting on the maelstrom such that it can fit 1400mm arties an mwd and an lse with locus rigs without a fitting modto start its not like its pg bound on the autocannon side anyway so youre not changing its tankgank role in that manner at all but what you are doing is allowing it to more efficiently fit for tank range and damage which it is actually pretty good atminus the range all things considered
yup
if ccp removed the limit for how many terms a person can be on the csm and they didnt want an age barrier i would run againthe point is that we already raised this issue and we told ccp that it was an important issue the thread alone speaks volumeif i had my way ccp would redo poses with this concept when they revamp 00 however you have to realize how much work went into the pos system first time around is that an excuse not at all you do however have to realize how much work it will take to pull out the pos system we have now and reimplement this conceptraising this issue again wouldnt change a thing it will still be a huge commitment which ccp will have to make ccp wanted to do this themselves however theres just a limit to how many resources ccp can allocate to such tasks the pos system is a legacy codebase so its a large task will it have to happen eventually yes is pos due for an overhaul hell yes but ccp is well aware of this since we went down the list of all he issues from the last csm when we were in iceland just like with everything else its a matter of planning and allocating resourcesbut for now theres no point in us raising it again because we inherit the issue from the first csm its still something we are watching and if theres any update on it we will know so just because we dont raise it this time doesnt mean its off our radarthat wasnt ccp that was whoever raised it as an issue
i dont see the word funny in the first assembly hall post on this issue it must have been the csm member that raised it to ccp then
here it where it originates from having checked the meeting minutes you would have to talk to jade if you arent happy about the naming
well actually
thanks for pointing that out  so much for mature csm 
my point was that reworking local wont require artwork as you were also told during the csmccp meetings the largest bottleneck for ccp is artwork
then lv we need to make ccp commit to the idea of overhauling the pos they have plenty of resources no one ever said it was not a huge project what i am guessing everyone wants to hear is that ccp knows it is a huge and difficult project and they are working on it and will be working on it until it is done thus far ccp provided nothing well an excuse that it is too hard until then please visit your user settings to reenable images
csm was never made in order for the playerbase make ccp commit to them revamping entire systems at the time would the average player rather have for instance mining changed or pos i think the average player would benefit from changes to mining rather than pos which does work having a pos myself its workable sure its not fun but mining is less fun
so far you have said  re doing it would be too much work because they would have to make new graphics didnt they redo every ship in the game not to long agoit works even if they dont like it nano worked too even if they didnt like it whats the point of ambulation i mean we can talk to one another already why do we need to walk around to interact and why oh why did they redo all the stargates didnt the ones we had allready workevery arguement you make is a very bad excuse as to why they dont do it 3 years they have said it needs to be done 3 years people have requested it if csm brings it up again maybe they will get the hint that we really want it csm is suposed to represent what the player base wants and is feeling about things if the player base still wants this brought up then csm should feel obligated to bring it up no matter how many times it takes so long as the player base asks for it
most diffidently we need a skill queue in place at least 5 skills queued would be nice
weve needed this for years after 22 pages youd think there would be some response
you havent read the thread then there has been a response and there will be further info soon
carebear uses it when the big evil red crosses have him in a bind fw folks use it to call in reinforcements pirates use it to trick the kind hearted to help the poor tackled newbiesomething for everyone could be fun seems simple enough to implement as well but what do i know
i go u one step farther how bout a capital class miner with 6 or maybe as much as 10 strip miners required skills exhumers lvl 5 as prerequisite to capital exhumer also same skill set needed for rorqual as such it can only fly in low sec or null sec high high hit points but low resists or vise versa will differently need a large bodyguard fleet
so predictablehell no the hulk is already bad enough 4 strip miners why not make a ship that devours whole asteroids in one second per asteroid
great idea and then if can refine it as well and build small ships too
big no got a problem with your hulk add an orca still have a problem quit the game the hulk does way too well as it is its an effective shield tanker has an insane amount of mining capability though you may have to max your skills shocker and is very strong with an orca we dont need a better exhumer ship wow is isaac
even better you can dock frigates in it and it poops out cans filled with free isk everytime you enter warpwe can call it the carebear mobilelet it shiiiine

blackops will be getting a fuel bay and will be able to jump into cyno jammed systemsthis is scheduled to happen during big patch in march if not sooner
i dont know how many times by now i have had to say this but ccp is obviously busyas for the names you should know by now that you will never get themjust wait and you will get the report its not that hard  i will however shoot ccp another mail to ccp to hear whats up
exactly my point you get faction standing hits suicide ganking give security sanding hits so how a skill that decrease faction standing hits will help in suicide ganking as terra suggested
but you can get the skills right or reject the mission and go to another agentthe problem here is the way downtime interferes with mission objects i agree that is a problem but i dont see the issue with mining missions they are incredibly easy to avoid eh this only happens if you use a mixed combatcourier agent there is a system in place already for thisi dont understand why this is badagain confused why is this bad sounds exactly righthow are you locked out of the gamethen dont run missions for soe and anyway what is wrong with lowsecive rejected missions before i have never been forcibly disconnected and banned for 4 hours id suggest raising a stuck petition if that is happening to youhell no if anything it should work the other way if you have high amarr standing then the matar are gong to want you to demonstrate that you have genuinely switched sidessure why not whatevermissioning isnt supposed to be a zero risk isk conveyor you can already manage your mission types by agent department and faction selection i also never got the impression that it is intended to be outside and above of the standings system you have to pick a side and take the benefits and penalties
the biggest and best mission change that needs to happens is either spreading out the high quality agents more completely getting rid of the quality system somehow or allowing people to accept and run missions anywhere in that agents faction space
sounds like a good mission to reject then if what i have read above about not being given a no skills required gas harvester is true though thats pretty lame it doesnt seem very fair that a mission be given to a player who does not have the capability to complete the missioni havent done a mining mission in ages  but if this is true thats pretty annoying not game breaking though im not sure why it would be true  arent the mining missions acquire x amount of y from this special location does the y disappear from your cargohold during dt if so that sounds like a bugtheres a very good reason why an industrial agent might give a kill mission some local pirates  rival faction  drones are attacking his mining vessels and he doesnt want to wait for the paperwork to clear over in the security department makes sense to mefunny thing is there are people that have positive standings with all empire factions it takes some time and dedication but it can be donethat said when i started playing i had no understanding of the standings system and that i would eventually be unable to enter gallente  minmatar high sec space without being attacked ooops well at least joining fw didnt change my world muchit would be nice if when your standings reach the 1 mark with an empire faction youre sent an evemail detailing the dire consequences of your brutal attacks on the x empire just to give newbies who dont know any better a heads up before its too latei gave a plausible scenario for a mining agent giving out a combat mission heres one for the reverse the security agent is using his influence and control of the mission running budget to line his pockets with some ore that he needs to build a personal project  and paying you to do it is cheaper than buying it from the marketthere are also existing mission stories about a special ore  mineral with the potential to be weaponized sounds like a security thing to me not something i would want a standard mining pilot to handledo you even read what the agents tell youoverall though id have to say that the mission system is fine and please stop tossing out this stop trying to tell me how to play the game line it is old and tired nobody is telling you how to play the game  theyre telling you that the mission mechanic isnt broken because your massive crowd of agents isnt giving you the exact mission you want every single timeand honestly im really surprised to see the original post come from a csm member
1 for mr drake p
hmmmwe do need skill training queue because we all cant be online everyday as far as training all 3 character at once i dont think so alts should be on separate accounts
o7  proof that the cake is not a lie
i laughed
what is a charactor some sort of weird crossbreed of a charade and a tractor
no they have a large tracking advantage and its quite sufficient to get an advantage in short ranges so long as you do not refuse to use itthis is not true medium ranged ships do not always require keeping them at that range in order to be useful they are useful as ships close and the time that that takes extend combat range can be slightly longer now but only nonbattleships have a greater advantage than they used to and nonbattleships are easily engagable at longer ranges by blaster pilotssubbs almost universally will want to be hugging the target as well the lack of 90 webs and reduction in speed fitswhich negated all ability of blaster ships to kill smaller ships have shifted the balance towards blasterswhere as with 90 webs they could not achieve sufficient transversal to reduce incoming dps on similarly sized ships and with nanoships they could not engage smaller ones nearly at all
well i see many people talk about the use of blasters and they state that the effective range should be optimalsome falloff  however at these distances we start reaching pulse laser optimals  you lose dps due to falloff there goes the dps advantage to make your tracking actual work  so whats the point to use blasters  you cannot be up close because tracking will lower your dps and being at your effective range again lowers dps because you are in falloff  and you dont even have the range flexibility a pulse laser can offer 
sorry but this is completely untrue speed fit hacs were perfectly good targets for blaster battleships using null l prior to qr no you wouldnt always kill them but you could still do enough damage to drive them offlack of 90 webs with no change to short range tracking is not a boost apart from your fantasy hyperion vs abaddon 1 vs 1 fight that you like to roll out as example as i demonstrated before the qr changes came out a zerofit stabber within minimum skills can orbit a maximum skilled ion ii megathron all day long at 115km bar wrecking hits with no amount of manoeuvring to reduce transversal allowing a hit how you come to the conclusion this is somehow a boost quite frankly boggles
i completely support this have stopped flying megas and hyp blaster ships since qr
you dont need to orbit at full speed close to within optimal and adjust your speed so that your chance to hit is around 7560 his chance to hit will then be around 6243 your not going to negate his damage completely like you can against long range weapons but you can certainly gain a significant advantage if you can control rangespeed if you let him control rangespeed then he will push you out into falloff since he knows he cant beat your tracking but he can beat your range
you were not supposed to be able to hit a speed fit hacs with battleship turrets at close range that is why the changes were made in the first place
i was referring to the claim that blaster ships were unable to hit smaller ships in the nanoage and therefore we should view qr as a boost  as i said it was perfectly viable to land some read enough hits with null l as they generally stayed in the 20kmish rangewith the current situation however cruiser class ships dont even have to fit for speed tanking to avoid large blaster fire the stabber example from about page 12 of the 44 page blaster thread had no modules fitted cruiser level i and was orbiting at base speed while webbed thats a little ott in my opinion but clearly you disagree with that
i like your idea but it may be difficult to implament programing wise and if it was implamented major changes would need to be applied to the tracking of guns in order to maintain a balance between the sizes of ships as currently if a cruiser got close to a bs even orbiting it at a reasonably high speed your changes would mean most of the bs volleys would hit even with artilleryblasters need a slight decrease in damage and a slight increase in tracking to make them viable at their current ranges currently they lack the range for their tracking to be effectiveas for realistic tracking i find it strange how maintaining a consitent orbit around a target increases the targets transversal velocity
some of this licenses might not be easily implementable without large mechanic changes but a small area of standings where theyd be allowed to fluctuate configurable by the sovereign alliance say 20  20 where shooting their reds in their sovereign space would have a small standings gain again customizable  the really bad standings and really good standings would be reserved for the real villains and allies would likely be doablealso needs more standings slots to work i think the providence folks stated that they ran out of any of their spares a year or two ago just face it due to how things usually turn out this will lead into a massive red listand oh supported
very interesting idea i would like to see some in depth discussion but on the surface it sounds good
maybe one could teach me how to link properly
 looking at the shifty face of the original poster i am wondering what is his angle i agree that the jobs should not be able to be canceled by low ranked members but the input output targeting player hangers is usable for corp theft this is a proposed mechanism for corp theft in the guise of a security improvement there is no need for this as lower ranking untrusted members can simply be given access only to less important materials and bpsrecapping no need thumb down
i raised an issue about it just a few weeks ago when we were in iceland head over and find the minutes from that meeting
i totally agree for the price of a dramiel i can buy and fit two wolves or jaguars with rigging and still have some cash to spare even if a price drop to somewhere between 610 million were somehow implemented their worth would increase quite a bit
thank you both for support yes i do think that piranha and panther are little bit odd but i didnt want to ranks be same as in militia officeso those are example of ranks and progressif you or someone else post nice ranking system instead will use it instead of existing names but before i do that i wish to see what more people thinks about this
youre talking about giving inherent combat bonuses to people who choose to fight in a way that you approve of thats completely against every principle of how eve is designed sure i could see giving antipirates a sec standing boost for it maybe even concord lpthough probably not but 20 resist bonuses and a 100point stab over and above everything else thats crazy even if it was a 1 resist bonus for how you choose to play thats too much how you play affects what you get it does not assign global buffs and debuffs
first proposed bonuses are just example second 1000bs80100mil isk minimum not taking in calculation modules rigspeople should wastedestroy to gain star rank do you really think that you will able to do that in few years period i admire yours contribution to this topic but you really should read it all before throwing hot oil
you think i didnt read it all yes i know its a lot of work to get to high rank thats not the point here  the first rank is too good never mind the last the scale of the bonuses can be tweaked to be less obviously unreasonable but that doesnt change the fact that they shouldnt exist at all youre trying to give a buff to people who play the game your way and do it in a fashion that doesnt make sense from the point of view of either fluff or game mechanics
you would agree i presume that current game mechanic made safer 00 systems then low security also ccp tried to force people out of high sec 49 characters never left high sec space they tried with material redistribution seeding good agents in low sec systems it didnt work my proposal is not radical its perfectly balanced space sheriff style lonely wolf who is trying to cleanse systems from well organized pirates few bpi pilots can gang together but points gained for progression would be drastically reducedso you will 99 times should see 1 player in bpi program who fights with minor gangs and at the end its totally logical that empires which have interest in theirs territory supports players who will defend merchants industrialists and other axes of economy with modules which are still in testingto venture more deeply into space and game itself making low security systems safer then 00 are
00 is safer than lowsec because there is a group who owns it and will defend it lowsec is a hell of a lot safer than delve for you or ito pick one region of 20 thats true for but since the only people there are either allies of the sovholders or enemies looking for a fight its got a lot less random death yes one of the residents can usually mine or rat unmolested but its not safe for anybody else people will defend what is theirs against encroachment as long as its worth defending people will not defend what is somebody elses unless theyre either getting paid to do so or they enjoy the act of doing so irrespective of consequences if you want lowsec to be safer you need to give it an owner somebody who will defend it and make it safe for their corpies evenor rather especially if its deadly for everybody else you will never make lowsec safe for the unaffiliated hauler pilot  it will always be and should always be dangerous as hell for them promoting antipirate activities is a sideshow at best defense outside of highsec comes from allies not from randoms the best antipirate is a target who uses their brain and buffing the hell out of your preferred play style wont change that as for how much sense it makes i have to disagree empires do protect people to the best of their ability  if youre too much of a bad man they shoot you on sight if youre a bad man in front of their guns youll get shot thing is thats frontier space they cant protect it as well as they can highsec or else itd be highsec giving people passive buffs based on who their friends are is crazy being considered a good fellow by empires gets you the right to access their space work for their agents and trade with them at a discount it does not give you massive bonuses that stack with everything while youre working in space outside of what they can effectively control
dear lord dude you have to get off this notion of insane stacking boosts the op has already stated that different bonuses need to be applied to attain balancein my opinion its not even about the buff of the system but the bookmark getting someone who has vested interest from one of the major npc factions into a fight with pirate gangs would be awesomethis also isnt about the op wanting to force people to play the way he wants them to this is about adding incentive to lowsec if the buffs to the system are made in a balancing way pirates will still have plenty of targets but once in a while they might have to fight someone who is ready for themdont flame based on numbers numbers can be fixed and changed to create balance its the idea that counts from a roleplaying perspective this makes total sense given that the game has been running for 5 years or so empires are growing concord is under pressure and pod pilots step up to the platefrom a practical perspective as well though this will not kill pirating if you nerf the bonuses possibly no bonuses at all even these deputies will not be indestructible by any means like concord is or have unlimited spawns like concord does but they could provide a more dynamic environment in lowseci think ultimately its a good idea because its another reason to go into lowsec and it needs as many as it can get
despite appearances im not actually flaming on the numbers the numbers are utterly unreasonable but thats a secondary point  as ive said a couple times i object to the principle as much as the numbers also i dont see how this adds an incentive to lowsec it doesnt make it any more profitable and it doesnt make it noticeably safer all it does is take a rather silly activity one that is difficult to accomplish unprofitable and even harder to find playmates for than normal piracy and add a ranking system for it factional warfare has proven in part that a leaderboard makes people like things but i still imagine itll be rather a flop anyone who wants to be an antipirate is already there and people who want normal pvp i dont expect to be especially attracted to this at the cost of most of their targets and all of their softest targets furthermore if its about the bookmark go with the distress signals thread  that has an interesting solution that can play into this sort of theory and do it both reasonably and well this thread however is not the answer
i agree that there should something implemented which makes it easier for players to do antipirate stuff in low sec well implemented distress signal feature somewhere else in this forum would allready helpbut i am against giving them better stats not to mention these ridiculous overpowered stats
i agree as long as you let pirates get a bm to all active haulers and miners in system this system is so open to abuse its insane that you cant see that
bookmark will appear only when fights between targets which are not in war is in progress so if you or someone else is happily mining or running missions or plexes there will be no bookmark to yours location
finally got around to buying an orca i am totally disappointed was able to use 3 mining modules however there is a need for a a tractor beam which restricts you to only using 2 modules hangar can only be accessed by corp members fleet members in mining expeditions cannot refit or use hangars not very productive in a fleet mining ops only 2 low slots for a ship that needs pdus for shields cargo expanders are a must for the low slots as well for the going price of about 500 mil not an efficient mining shipwould like to see the following changes1 one extra hi slot for tractor beam2 two extra low slots3 members in ganged fleet have access to hangars and refitting when given permission to do sothats my 2 cents on it agree or disagree it doesnt matter
highlighted the funny partbut thats just the tip of the icebergoh and read the description on the ship again youll see that it is in fact not a mining shipits an industrial command ship or something along those lines its specifically designed to be used in a fleet an corporate fleet no lessbut since your just filled with fail im going to assume youll be ignoring me anywayps orcas make a mean salvage ship no less unintended side affect x o d
only part number 3 made any sense at all the rest was just plain wrong
you already have 3 right click on ship select configure ship and check the checkboxthis allows people ingang but not in corp access
they represent to me the latest statement in ore theft the high slots are for tractor beams onlywarp steal warp steal warp stealwhy is this in the assembly hall move it on moderators
liar  or almost clever troll  hmm i wonderits like saying a raven is not an efficient blasterboat duuh 
you are able to tractor containers that do not belong to your corp
you guys are reading into this wrong when he said 3 mining modules he meant gang linksmisunderstandingout of context ftl
let me respons to this without completly ripping of the ops cranial cavitythe orca was designed as many have said as an industrial command ship and in that role it does pretty well i currently pilot one and with 56 macks or hulks orbiting like drones it is a seksy beastnow as to your changes1 since the capaciter link is completly worthless in high sec cap recharge needed ofr 00 tanks you should only be running two links anyway let big daddy rorqual handle the 00 stuff2 i completly agree with you on this one more low slots is always good with this monster would mean les trips for me to the station3 members in your fleet do have access to you hangers if you set it up properly they can put in but they can not remove havent tested the refitting thing but i dont see any harm in allowing fleet members use the refit tool the user would have to have the modules in his cargo hold anywaynow if you wanted to add a 4th high for a salvager i would go for that hahahaha
agree with 1 and 2 but corp hanger is for corp duh
it seems the op doesnt want economies to exist all her suggestions are geared towards making life easy for pirates and mercs and screwing everyone else the op wont be happy til eve is space counter strike
not only space counterstrike its one sided space counterstrikefrom the way i read it the op only wants the corps that had a wardec imposed on them to be blacklisted from trade not the corp doing the wardecingwe need a giant gong smileygongggggggggggggggeither wayfail
try more the along the lines of ganking industrialists at little to no riskwho gives a flying rip about the wardecced corp in question
you read it wrongit would apply to all warring parties regardless of who started it
industrialists will have to be a bit more careful in their business relationshipsthat is all
flagging people for market interactions is a stupid and unfair as how would a small corp without industrial capacity face one that had a solid industrial base and also the people trading to the war decd people are still under protection of concord as they are not criminalsthe one change i might like to see is the ability to wardec individual people particularly in the case of npc corps as you may know who an alt spy is but be unable to do anything to deal with them if someone in a player corp was individualy war decd it should be the corps option to turn it into a full war the one problem i see with the individual player dec is that it can be abused by pirates and griefers
this issue is still unresolved  more votes needed
now that its possible to achieve certificates and medals you have the possibility for sharing it with the world but i have seen very few people who actually allow the public to view them i figured it would be an disadvantage for your enemies to see an minimum approximation of your skills what do my fellow capsuleers think of having an permission setting for allowing corpalliance to view your certificates andor medals
id rather we all quietly forgot the wasted developer time spent on the ridiculous certificate functionality which is at best pointless and at worst misleading to new playersbut thats just me
it would take a lot of ratters to make a lowsec system flip to highsec if it was possible  read some of my earlier replies and pirates would have time to kill them in the meantime bringing security back down it would also decay to less secure over time the point is it just really mixes things up and makes eve even more playercontrolled
ninja salvager should never be aggrod to mission runner mission runner should stop giving carebears a bad name and learn the deal with their wrecksjeez you guys make me ashamed to be a carebear sometimes
ooh ive got an ideax the mission runner should be aggrod to the ninja salvagerall mission runners upon salvaging a wreck should immediately be aggrod to any ninja salvager that are currently in that deadspace pocket this would be verified by the higher level of salvaging training achievedthus if the ninja salvager has salvaging v as i do they become the owner of said wreck and any attempt to tractor andor salvage said wreck gives aggro of the mission runner to the ninja salvageri like it what do you guys think
here is the article regarding new space and wormholes  makes for an exciting read i think
fixed to reflect ccps timetable
the problem with the csm representing the playerbase is in my opinion caused by two things voluntairy voting and numbers instead of percentagesbecause players can vote or not vote you will always keep those that dont vote now i am not saying enforced voting is the key here because i know from experience you will just randomly pick something then with a blank vote that gets added to the majority it could however work or simply add blank voting to the next csm elections as an option secondly since votes are numbers and it is a fact a lot more players take part in hisec activities rather than lowsec or 00 you get skewed results now i realize democracy  the voice of the majority but this is at the risk that people will simply vote for hisec stuff and wish to stay there ect while ideally you would have an almost evenly spread across all three security levels well excluding alts though which are prone to stay huddled up in hisec unless they got good reasons to venture out of thereit could be a good idea though to have monthly or so votes in which people can say which issues that have made it on the agenda they want to see adressed  from which viewpoint they are saying this if a majority from 00 brings up one issue while hisec players find this to be fine then you know there is in fact a problem in a specific area despite the total showing that a certain minority seems to find something a problem and the rest doesnthope that makes sense
that makes sense and is somewhat what i want to try and do with this projectevery 2 months when we talk to ccp all issues that the csm has voted in will be released to the public with a system to vote for the issues that people think are importantsay you have 5 issues a player will go to a website and they will assign all issues a number from 1 to 51 is most important 5 is least then all the votes are tallied up and the least points will become the publics top priority the same thing will be done by the csm and in that way there will be 2 priority lists representing both the elected and the publicthis way we can get a good view on how well the csm represents the playerbase too
and how are you intending to implement this system
thats the least important part but ill just throw up a page in railsaspnetwhatever language i feel like but it will probably be rails as its an opensource platform so that csm3 can use it if they like
as long as i dont have to count the votes  fine by me 
i like the idea of a skill set to get info out of characters such as an alias i think that maybe if it were to be implemented that way that may ease the minds of the players whom feel that someone can hide from them are there really that many of you that are stalkersi disagree with limiting if they charge real money thats a revenue stream for ccp which is good for them and what is good for them is generally good for the players if they charge isk sure have it double each time or something nice isk sinkill say it again the implementation should be left up to ccp or the csm there are balancing concerns cost concerns ect thats what they get paid to do can we just agree that the having the ability to change your character name would be a desired feature
i 100 support this nothing like trainin training training to get in ships to only have them nerfedgo pattern
supporting this
tempest of love
supporting thisalso lavista im not entirely sure youve ever tried flying a tempest against a mega if you think the tempest can beat the mega 1v1 if the pilot is good enough the mega has to be badly fitted at the moment pretty muchi did a load of testing on sisi with myself in a tempest battleship 5 t2 large autos full slave set strong exile booster vs a megathron pilot battleship 4 t1 large guns no slaves no exile and lost every time i tried plated i tried active repped i tried gank i tried full tank i tried ewar tds the tempest just cant compete with the mega
youre a bad liar or a worse pilot
can you even fly minmatar
i fly tempest most of my times im a 95 minmatar user and i can say this for sure your totally wrong about the tempest dark flare34 months ago on sisi i was testing out the tempest to see what it really was good for well i have used the tempest for years but i just did a very good test of the tempest there with the close range setupthis is the ships i was fighting on sisi that timei have been fighting 14x megathrons and won over 10 been fighting 5x ravens and won over 4 3x typhoons and won over 2 4x armageddons and won over all 2x apocs and won over them both 1x abaddon and won over it 1x tempest and won over it 2x maelstroms and won over both 1x dominix lost to it and 1x hyperion and lost to that one toso after my results that time its very good tbh this was also after the web and speed nerfi wouldnt call that for crap results darkif you just can use your brain a bit your tempest is more of a pain to others its more dangerous than it looks or after what the stats shows
well the only thing that could be erroneous about my test is that it was preweb nerf so it was impossible to dictate range
lol i have to agree with the goon guy ive had a navy mega in structure before i died and i had a hurricane on me aswell as the navy mega and no the mega wasnt poorly fitted
what minmatar also needs istracking enhancer also affecting falloff you can tracking disrupt falloff but not boost italso it would be nice if the tempst could fit 1400mm arty like the mega fits rails and had a bit more locking range would not hurtif you boost the tempest do not forget the fleet version p
bet he wasnt carrying nulla mega does more dps than a tempest and has more ehp and if it wants can field a better active tank
not many people carry null bcos they either dont have the cargo for it or dont use it bcos they think its crap but yes mega does have more ehp but doesnt mean the tempest cant win against it its all down to the pilots skill
double
not the mega you claimed in fact the pest you claimed you were flying did more raw dps more real dps with longer range more utility better tank and better raw hit points than the megathroni wont say a pest will always win against an equally skilled and fitted megaps fly a hyperion theyre better in every way and i also wont say it will always lose but i will say that if you in a slaved exiled tech 2 gunned bs 5 tempest cant beat a tech 1 gunned implantless mega then something is up
bump  some extra infoapparently it is now confirmed latest csm minutes that roughly 40 of the mineral market comes from npc loot instead of mining which might seem like a big surprise to some

drone damage modules should be in highslots imo or it would be too easy to superpower a ship
i definantly think drones need some work starting probably with webifier drones as they currently as not worth using as they are incapable catching up to many shipsthe addition of a light webifier drones with a 5 speed effect and a speed of something like 40005000 ms and a medium webifier with a 10 speed effect and a speed of 20002500 ms would be a good start as the current heavy drones are to slow to catch mwd ship 5 lights would reduce the targets speed by 226 and 5 mediums by 41 as compared 5 heavies current reduction of 672i do not believe this would imbalance the game though it is possible that the speed reductions effects may have to be decreased
so what ive gather so far from the reasons ccp havnt done this are1 its to hard2 this idea will require a lot of artwork and mechanics3 they dont have the amount of resources required4 shareholders who they have to satisfy11to hard how i know that changing it would be long and sumwhat annoying but its something that the people wantwe are about to get ambulation where we can walk around change cloths install bars buy drinks hire staff play mini games watch dancers have awsome shadows and yet changing poses are to hard just do it21tell me what kind of artist doesnt like to come up with new designs and models if they are good artists they probly would already been playing with the model and making it all prettyhell iam not that good but ive already added a evebackground and a skin to that new pos model31from what ive heard the people working on eve online has gone from 90 to 300 most of who are probly working on ambulation so after ambulation is finished there is no reason why they cant start on this41shareholders tell them to shove it this is what the customers want happy customers  happy shareholdersso thank you to the csm for all your work so far however you need to keep taking it to them even if they threaten to kill you you must die for this so now go and ask ccp when not can we 
incorrect nanos broke the physics engine any speed over 8kms ish breaks itthe point is that it adds more content to the game because gates were still running on the textures that was used before trinity it had to be reworked to the new engineyou are entirely missing the point here the issue is still an issue in our system we talked about it briefly at the end of the csmccp meetings ccp is well aware that the current pos system is awful raising it again wont make a differencehell when we discussed this very issue i actually said to ccp that this is the most wellsupported issue off the top of my head its really important
nope they are all working on apocrypha at present
oh reallysource warcry interviewwell quess we now know what to askbroad sweeping changes but only those ones that take little work
theres a large difference between forcing ccp to do it and suggesting that they should dowhat jinx is suggesting is basically that we tell ccp that they must we already suggested they should do this but they have their reasons not to
and what did ccp say i can see it now torfi wearing a brown robe with a hood pats csm on the head and says  soon young padawan soon until then we have to defeat count doku all jokes aside what did a ccp liaison with you actually said when you mentioned the most supported thread on the forumsand yes ccp has to be told that they must channel some resources to a problem that has been band aided to death for over 3 years or if you prefer pretty much since the inception of pos it has been a band aid on top of band aid but no real fixes
there is definantly an issue with missiles at the moment but they still do hit everytime i could see setting their explosion velocity to the average speed of their intended target class ie up cruise missile 69ms explosion velocity to 101ms the average speed of all battle ships without speed mods that would be a good test to start with to see if that it brought the issue under controli dont know if there are any skills or implants that increase explosion velocity which would make them overly effective smaller ships
please give me my cnr its power backsigned
all the way
00 should have something static that people would fight for to pull real pvp off of the gates and poss that would effect an alliances income or something like that currently the only way for small allainces to even make a dent in peoples isk making ability is by sitting in a ratting system cloaked keeping everyone docked safed and cloaked and posed
heres the csm minutes where this issue is discussed quite a bit
read the original suggestionsread the csm minutes on initial discussionsheartily approve in fact i had intended at one point to write on this myself but see most of these suggestions as being identical will save the efforthammerhead gave a homework for the csm brainstorming on this issueill start another thread for this homework howeverkrum
ccp is definitely drawing the surprize pictureas usual no comments petitions are being closed without any feedback and finally well get something awful that even joint couldnt help to recognise what it was supposed to be and how to use itplease say something 3 pages of supporting messages calls for reaction even yep we know this silence really blasts me out
a friend of mine use to hunt macro miners trick was to tip their cans and they would comeback to it and put more in it and hence were destroyed it was kinda funny and they stopped using that system or at least marked my friend as hostile so they macro could warp them safety the moment they entered the system macros can range in sophistication from crude to so brilliant you couldnt tell it from a human miner so it really is hard to tell who a macro and who isnt
heres your skill queue please enjoy and thank your csm representative
i thank ankhyes yes i thank you too liking it a lot if this is the way it will be implemented im one happy camper
i vote to lock this thread seeing that it will now be implemented come march 10 all in favor
op updatedrest in peace thread and of course thanks csm dudes this one was well worth the effort
this
me signals distress support
light a cynoaccomplishes everything you want to do doesnt require any changesnew codingetc and places a penalty on the person who signals for help to prevent abuse
i can see it oh no im being attacked in my mining ship good think i equipped this cyno generator
any mining ship would be dead long before anyone could warp to you anyway thus irrelevant
100 percent support here
supported cruisers getting away from interceptors w 2000 scan res ive been both the cruiser and the inty in lowsec is broken mechanic
must not be miners u shouldnt complain strip miners and builders are what kept prices down and if ul like than maybe could have a penalty for more than 4 miners ie longer cycle time and as far as one roid a sec thats a gross overestimation even with maxed skills its take hulk at least an hour to strip one belt in 05 sec space
started this char as a miner and i would agree with what was already said the hulk is already good enough and should be put as iv or v if youre a serious miner youll go for level v anyways for the bonuses so thats not a problem
not a good idea
any reply to your mail
the only reason i can guess about it not being possible is this one1 account gives you 3 characters if you want to do anything useful with more than one you need to split your training time on them more time needed training to achieve a desired goal means more money for ccp so thats it pure greedfor those naysayers get lost you are a plague like cocroaches no use whatsoever but the occasional sickness go compare your epeens elsewhere preferably to some far away place like czd get your ships busted and return to your beloved forum whining for nerfs practices if it where for you games eula would include the obligation of playing with just one hand at a time
wow called they want there subscription base backlook its simple very simple for the low iq crowd like the guy above including the opso simple it hurtsyou pay for one account they allow you to train one character at any timewhat would happen if you could train all of them at the same timenow you got at most 3 characters training all at once the same things so every subscription will have a buffed hauler a buffed miner and a buffer combat pilot and or any combonationthose who have been playing this game for years would frown on that something fierceif you want it that badly then pay for the additonal account or stfu and gtfothe only time i will support such a notion of multicharacter training is if theres a penalty for doing so such as a training slow down of 25 to 75 to balance it all outotherwise forget itwow is that way dont let the door hit you on the way outi dont like having to train only one char but ive learned to appreciate it considering how nasty it is to go up against a skilled pilot its nice to know i wont get trounced by some idiot kid whose only played for a couple weeks
you have two character slots one being taken up with your main character use that character to save up isk and then buy a character from someone else in the character bazaar or make a second account to make the toon yourself im relatively noob to eve being here about half a year and can already see this is just a stupid idea as well sure when i first started and was greedy wanted that training but that is just over powering and would diminish contracting and the markets considerably so we got a skill queue now and you want to keep whining cause you cant have an easy game to play please toss your character into the biomass and just gtfo
simple to understand blasters and acs are broke and need to be fixed
so in your world cruisers have to waste a precious med slot to survive  why do you not fit a tracking computer on your bs instead  your approach towards a new tracking formula sounds logical to me but it does not guarantee a good game play game play  realistic simulationdespite all emo  whine towards recent expansionpatch pvp works in qr you still see big ships annihilating smaller one what changed is respect and caution no megathron pilot can ignore a smaller ship anymore no vagapilot can generally laugh at a frigate preqr they would just crush a meaningless small worm now a competent enemy pilot asks for respect and if a bsbc pilot ignores it he may take his toll
i support this idea
as a player and corp that doesnt like pvp i would be more inclined to venture into 00 space if something like this was implementedthe main reason i dont go there is because of all the gate camping to get there and then having to deal with being bullied aroundid rather like to buy a license and make some stuff the alliance while being able to do my own thing with protectioni fully support this idea
to me currently 00 is a bit like UFFFD the empty set ill support anyone who suggests anything to make it a fuller experience
bump
see that picture of a world globe 5th along under the white chat box hit that then put your link in and then put what u want the link hyperlink to say
not that i have had any problems with eve connectivity evermost of this seems to be ispcore related and one could argue that the problem solving part aint ccps responsibilityhowever since alot of the worlds isps and core network providers have integrated traffic shaping methods into their networks the last few years and increasingly so the last yearmonths ccp might rethinkcould it be possible for ccp to change the ports used for eve to those for other popular services say wow if a isp decides to block those ports or ts them then there would be more enduser complaints than from just eve players and more commonly used ports are less likely to be messed withits been along time over 2 years since i last checked eve network protocols so im really talking out of my ass here but its a thought
you are not alone with these thoughts
i remembered something about changing ports in eve and yes there is a limited optionby doing this
i think eonawards shouldnt just be a really gorgeus thing that the guys from mmmpublishing sends you but it would be interesting if they could also come in the shape of a medal or an item much in the same way the alliance tourney medals came in the 5th tourney
if eon was run by ccp i would agree but as they are an independant publisher  no
i dont post here that often anymore but this does sound very whimsical
eve has gotten huges and the new bs are caps just about everyone and their sister has one the problem is moving them it just doesnt make sense that there is 00 cyno generators and not low sec ones have you ever tried to move a cyno alt around to pick up 900m in trit orders you should  youll want to self destruct yourself backgroundthink about it wouldnt low sec cyno generators lscg exist in low sec for the existing npc corps hows do the navys get around how do these outposts get fuel and supplies the fact of the matter they would exist and since they do wouldnt pilots have access with the right standing of course they would so where are they theyre coming and when they do they will add yet another exciting dimension to the gamenot only are they a great opportunity to help speed up the game a little they also will create more action and opportunity it just isnt realistic that in order to move caps around one need to fly a silly cyno alt around making lscg interestinghow would they work a cap pilot will be able to select station in their jump to menu that are in range and that they have appropriate standings for however there will be a 50 chance a jumping cap will land 10002000km from the outpost and there is a 5 chance a pilot will bump directly off the station itself sending your cap hurling into space so beware when low sec jumping also system pirates might keep some caps in the area to encourage a bump offs and remember using a lscg is by no means a walk in the park the system might have eager pirates just waiting for cap to bump and kill jump with carefaction countsa pilot and corp faction will play an important role the more lscgs an npc corp has the higher the required standing would be needed and cap pilots player standing would be automatically subtracted off corp access for example lets say u have a 3 personal standing for your low sec piracy and your corp standing is a 8 your effective standing would be a 5 if an 8 was needed for access you would be denied access until your personal standing increaseswith the addition of lscg we hope to see ccp adding new capital npc events that will randomly and periodically jump in and out of low sec systems for fueling outposts this will create an npc avenue for pirates and other entrepreneurs wanting to take on a npc cap and its support fleet beware the faction hit would be significantplease give this idea a thumbs up and add more detail how it would work
great idea i think this will actually help eliminate caps because people are inherently lazy and will just blind jump without thinking of the consequences also the faction idea is good put greater merit on it and rewards high faction good job
ccp might need to strengthen low sec nodes tho i could see hot drops on hot drops on hot drop fun faction wouldnt be n issue all ud need to do is fit a cyno on the carrier that did have faction then light it and the rest would follow then bob would do the same on top of you and next thing youd have is eve crashing great idealow sec node crashing for the win we recently did some low sec capfleet action did u all approve the ships loss reimbursements yet
cynos should be limitednerfed not expanded between jump clones jump bridges and cynocapable megaships the easy travel options are way too easy these days
good ideaa few more i would make the spawn just random ongrid from the station instead of a discrete allornothing system i also dont see the purpose of the sec penalty finally maybe it could be made such that you must wait 1 minute before and after jumping stationary in which time the cyno gen would show up on overview to everyone
cool idea this would be really nice and also save a lot of scrolling when counting wartargets supportedyou might want a new title  i have to admit i thought you wanted a spamlanguage filter in local
adding my support to put this back on the front page
sounds like fun
so youd rather open a way to suicide 44 with no sec hit as for the idea would just add more lag for something thats completely unneeded
im pretty sure this one would never work for the exact same reason splash damage was removed from torpedoes hitting other people in empire thus making empire a nonsafe place it is supposed to ofer some safety not max though imaging killing a ship in empire and some unhappy fella was passing by in his pod and gets blown up id be ed also there would be so many ways to abuse this who wouldnt kill a corporate battleship ie in front of 44 for the sheer fun of blowing up other people and harassing them now do that 10x times in a row you get loads of blown up ships at undocking point  pods for no penaltylossriskconsequences as long as you just blow up 10x battleships belonging to said corporation members who just insured their unfitted bses to blow up unhappy people at jita 44 or at gates etc abusing the splash system youre reffering tothat  sounds lame also one of the many reasons mines were removed aswell i think just cause they could hit people irrelevant to an empire war and that would cause people to whine as it did in the past with said mines and splash damage of torpedoes
pretty sure mines were removed mostly to the lag inducing effects they had since they never disappeared unless they hit something additionally someone who dropped a mine days prior in low security would get concorded if they were in high sec when the mine hit someonebut anyways not supported splash damage  bad
while it would be extremely cool to watch a titan go up and wipe out half of an inbound fleet im going to have to come down on the side of no in this casethe potential for abusing this system is so huge and not just from the ganking perspective consider thissome corp wardecs you and you conveniently catch them in empire space they destroy one of your ships unfitted of course causing splash damage to a nearby unaffiliated ship which you hired to be there they take the sec penalty for damaging an innocent and concord shows up to make their lives hellthe same principle can be applied no matter who takes the security hit for damaging the innocent ship all that would change is where the innocent ship happens to be parked
maybe an amp slot like the slot 6 omega onesso lets say there is a 11th slot you could get this implant that is an amp say 5  100 depending on how epic the amp slot is and link it to another hardwiring slot but not allow it to amp an omega implant for obvious reasonthis sound better or just meh
you can do this already theyre called jumpclonesi have one jc for industry with the appropriate hardwire slots fitted one for combat with combat implants and less expensive attribute implants just in case and i am working on getting together a set of implants for mining for a third jumpcloneviola 15 hardwiring slots
um thats not what i mean
you cant have your cake and eat it too
whats the point of having cake you cant eat ive never understood that one back to the point  i dont see a need for more implants
why i dont see the point honestly other than making ones character more powerful what would this change do to the game that would improve it what need is it filling as far as im concerned the current implant system is fineten more why not twenty or thirty or over nine thousand as they sayyou may be able to convince me you just need to work harder for a thumbs up
this would reverse the most evil nerf to shaqils implant i dont think ccp would allow people to bypass their nerf im afraid such a feature would allow people to have more fun than ccp wants people to have
hellowith contracts and direct trading like now theres way to scamm people  but with t3 will it get nerf i dont think it shouldso this is issue  keep scamm with tradecontracts on t3 ships no rest for idiots
support my thread
how about waiting for the damn patchexpansion set before you become an idiot yourself
my you are rude have you bought my raven for 300m
too late
a friend once told me you cant fix stupidguess hes rightyet i keep tryng  o 
you pay me 150 million and ill think about it
one issue that seems to come up relatively often is how cheap wardecs happen to be conversely i find there is an issue with how cheap it is to create a corporation alliances cost about 1 billion isk to make but corporations are just pocket change i suggest the start up cost of a corporation be raised to between 50100 million isk this will prevent to some degree corphopping at least in the instance of creating a new corporation to avoid a wardec the same for disbanding and recorping macros for the ones that use player corps that isan additional consideration could be an application processing fee of say 1 mil per pilot that joins as an overhead for all the database changes npc facilities would have to make and relay to recognize the pilot in that new corp this would also reduce corp hopping by making it costly for entire corporations to switch around alt corps im not suggesting this to be pro wardec as i think those prices need adjusting i am however anticoward at least to the degree of leaving your corp during a war and coming back when its over too many corps starting up and closing for no purpose and i believe this would help solve the problem
once again supporting my own topics the least i could do for myself
wardec the corp that left the alliance aswell problem solvedpeople leave said corp and join noob corps that are untouched by war decs welp life sucks but it still goes on kill them in empire with suicidecaracals what could though be implemented would be a timer of sorts ie how many times you can joinleave any corp in say 1 week that would bring a solution to the problem you are stating but it would cause so so so many others i guess mainly of the cheesewhine category ones if you get my drift
it seems the main point of my problem was missed due to my added ideals of what it would fixthe problem is making a corp is far too cheap regardless of anything else and the cost should be raised significantly
so what i dont think itd be a nice idea for lets say a group of 56 new players to have grind their buts off in order to be able to create a corp all together just to enjoy having their own corp for themselves and have their laughs and giggles alone etc and its not really a problem dont think anyone really thinks its a problemi think eve already has plenty of timeisk sinks and it wouldnt really need more since low cost of corporations isnt really a problem for anyoneisnt that why you really started this be honest youre pised because you declare wars on alliancescrops and corpspeople leavejoin others to avoid the war 00 mate problem totally solved no wars and stuff there just you them and some guns and maybe spirits and an exotic dancer in your hold
no it isnt actually ive never held nor been a part of a wardec voteinitiation in my entire eve career i proposed this because making a corporation is far too cheap thats my primary concern the addons were incentives that this would provide to inform others who might take a liking to this ideaim not trying to make it into an isk sink im trying to put some sort of value on corporations your suggestion that new players shouldnt have to work a bit to make their own corporation is inane at best as the same thing could be said for 23 10 man corps that want to make an alliance which costs 1 billion isk so either the price of one needs to come up or the other needs to come down for either of them to be justified where they are at as for your 00 comment thats where i am right now so try not to make assumptions in regards to driving forces behind ideastbh 50 mil to start a corporation is more than reasonable while 100 mil to start a corporation is more in line with alliance costs
nopeyour proposal is good in intentions but it changes literally nothingyour proposed prices are chump change even then because most corps victimized are noob corps to begin with stifling growth of new teams is stupidly wrong and just flat foolishall your going to do is encourage npc hidingthe only way your going to encourage growth and prevent corp hopping is to have the war dec carry on for the pilot in question for a week or moreand raise the prices of wardecs by a factor of 10 if not moreor have wardec prices dependent on the number of members on a percentage curvewar is never cheap and in eve it most certainly is for most anyway which is one of the reasons a lot of smart corps join alliances to make it expensive and a risky proposition at bestyou could even have it based on sec ratings or the number of recent poddings or something things that usually highlight a griefer corp there are such things as war crimes are there notwardecs need to be more interesting all they do is allow you to shoot one anothervictory conditions as well as a forced cool down period would also help greatly and thereby remove the need for hidingadditionally while your throwing a fit here isnt corp hopping considered an exploitit should be
i believe there is already a thread about adjusted costs for wardeccing and this isnt it while the matter goes relatively hand in hand this was a post about corp costs and reasons for why they should be raised not about reasons why wardec fees should be raised which they should but again as per title thats that the proposal of this thread
coulda foold me take your own advice
full support insurance shouldnt be payed by concord to those who are destroyed by concord
yeslets war dec those in ncpc corps whoopsnice one smart ass
can we please have killmails generated for ships that self destruct when under fire currently some corpsalliances have the habit of self destructing to avoid loosing their ships to enemy fire when tackled and outnumbered this makes their kbs look better and stops some of the embarassment they should feel when doing something stupidif someone does this the km should still be generated but the person that self destructs should show up as doing the remaining damage to their own ship
a killmail is generated for the person who self destructskill it faster why is you having the kill mail somehow more important than them making sure you dont get it seems you both have equal footing additionally you dont know for a fact theyre self destructing to prevent the kill mail they may be doing it to destroy all their factiondeadspace loot that they dont want you to get system is fine as imho
ive thought for a while now that its totally incongruous to need weapons that can reach the pos itself through the shields in order to take it down and how cool it would look for the fire to be absorbed by the shield itself until it goes down not to mention the fact that it would allow drone boats and small ships to get in on the action defences not withstanding which would make hisec pos takedowns at least a little less boring also the ability to use short range weapons  and so short range dps  means that itd take less time to take a pos down which all contributes to minimising boredom again especially for hisec pos warfareheres how i see it workingim assuming that the shield is classed as a special collidable object permiable to ships with the correct credentials as such targetting a pos with active shields would trigger a fallover to make the active target the shield itself distance is then calculated the same way as for the bounce of the ship off of the shield surface and the object is destroyed when the shields fallif this is not how the shield works then its much harder to implement of course but a boy can hope
so i get at least one support
the shield as you so put it is not that bubble around the tower the shield is a self contained defense barely past the edges of the tower that large bubble you see is a forcefield designed to prevent ships from getting within a certain radius of the tower itself also preventing a lock of the entities within the fieldwhile the rest is speculation i would assume that the tower itself is targetable because of the massive energy it would need to give off for this forcefield as opposed to the untargetable mods and ships inside
fix it mofo
done
youre the best csm ever
so i read the recent csm notes bravoglad to see ccp interested in our collective input on this topic and evenre colonieshammerhead gave a homework for the csm brainstorming on this issueso lets get started first i perceive sov offlined 00 pos pos management low returns from 00 and a variety of other issues as all linked in other words a good solution to sov and hence the nature of 00 in general will address all these concerns at oncemy 2 isk recommended approach highlevel since thats what devs want is as follows1 implement planet colonization divided up by zonecontinent and transfer sov levels 2 to planetary and nearplanetary space objects a planetary colonies require purchase of a general charter 00 use or specific faction charger lowsec use for each zone to be connected to orbital structures b planets are connected to orbit via space elevator structures around which main defenses should be based c planets consume trade goods and raw materials possibly some new like iron and other elements and require colonists of various types based on their charter which are purchased from empire primarily d planets produce trade goods including refined colonist types sov points and planetary defenseassault items2 reduce pos to the maintenance of industrial space production moonmining and for the larger pos creation of shielded safe spots pos in general can be greatly weakened3 implement playerplaced objects inside environments detectable via probes soon to be made more accessable in apocrypha and producing some semipassive resource stream research service or other valueadd4 implement a logistical system control bunkers for highersov systems whos primary purpose would be providing coordinationscheduling for small destroyable npc transports for items inbetween system deadspaces pos and planets other possible purposes could be to address cloak detection in the system or coordinate defense npc ships and scanning features5 trade goods and smuggling must be addressed to seed empire buysell orders for planetary colony goodsincluding illegal goods sold in empire6 apply refined npc ai to 00 system rats have them target player structures including offlined pos and attempt to destroyloot them and otherwise conduct themselves in a rational manner permit hiringluring of npcfaction agents to outpostsstations in accordance with standing of the sovholding alliance and other factorstldr version  planet colonies good pos bad playerplaced structures good better npc ai and 00 agentsremember empire is the source of all isk and if 00 is going to become a true colony as opposed to just a source of capsularproduced resources and godlike wars it needs the huddled masses of empire to go out and assemble all those consumer electronics and such that the folks back home demandthats been the pattern for earths colonization episodes and should apply in eveplease discuss and brainstorm morekrum
they do need to be boosted atleast back to prenerf status i had another proposal that died for bringing back their dual sensor strengths that they used to have
interesting idea i dont think i support the idea of bookmarks and bonuses just because they seem really artificial and a bit too special but a special group which can attack pirates in lowsec without sec hits would be nice maybe something like attacking up to 1 sec status in 01 2 in 02 until only 5 are kos in 05 but i do like the idea of a special concord militia and of course you would get antipirate pirates kind of like the militia pirates which would be very interesting supported
kaya i know you are a goodhearted carebear albeit a gallente scumbag but ill have to side with herschel yamamoto herethe proposed system will undoubtedly be abused and exploited in ways we cant even see now and i already see 2 ways to do thatand yes its not the specific bonuses that are problematic after all its up to the devs to decide on the specifics its the simple existence of those bonuses benefiting only one side that im not comfortable with as well as the bookmarksbeacons without explicit authorization of any party involved in the fight see the distress signals threadbtw an unlicensed fight in lowsec doesnt necessarily mean that one party is pirates and another one is a victimalso as it has been mentioned above safety comes only with control over certain space and from what i heard there are plans on the drawing board for some kind of space holders system to be instituted for lowsec it wont be tomorrow but im keeping my eyes opentwo sidenotes1 antipirates are pirates in disguise more often than you would think2 5 reduction in signature radius while mwd module is active is probably the silliest and the most useless bonus one could come up with
i love itwell saido7
one idea i had was to change the strength bonus to a range bonus on the other recon ships meaning an arazu could damp a falcon at range
forums are not a democracy my hypothesis is that a well supported thread have a chance to get attention from csm representatives nothing more and nothing less
space is not too crowded in general but with the more efficient ways of travel superhighways jump bridge cynochains jumpfreighters and most importantly warp to zero the population can move around alot faster this leads to empty swaths of space filling up in minutes and then clearing as fast againits not a big hassle to move an entire fleet from tenal to period basis nowdays stain is a region which still behaves somewhat like oldschool eve when it comes to travel but in most other regions we see the ease of access quickly turning a previously empty stationsystem into a major battleground within a few hoursthis might be good or it might be bad it depends on who you ask but it clearly has made eve smaller from a pure interaction standpointpersonally i think this needs to be addressed either by increasing the size of the known galaxy by huge amounts of new starsystems as well as separating the high sec areas by losec00 andor removing the superhighways its no small wonder that jita is always crowded when it takes 10mins to get there from the rest of empireeconomical fees based on market sizes or turnout would be another way to break up trade hubs into multiple smaller centers of trade wich is good for market pvptheres no real exploring left in eve since the starmap tells you everything about every system aside from the new wspace systems and the possibility for small groups of entrepreneurs to set up a deep 00 business project is extremely difficultwhen ccp opened up the drone regions it really got alot of new folks into 00 that later changed when larger entities integrated those areas under their domains but in the beginning the area was teeming with explorers and luckseekers who lived from poss and traded with each other in spacemy 2 cents
you mean these minutes
glue applied because of meeting minutes
i cannot believe that you guys did not bust ccps balls over their stupid idea to distribute sov over multiple contention pointsnearly all of which dont require or support player interaction and benefit entities that reduce player interaction the most
cool  thanks
this round of the csm needs to be told thattheyre doing a good job very professional outward at least
im jon mccane and i approve this message
not supportedbetter would be a per item or by weight option make some use of those npc convoys we see going around with scheduled departure times etcespecially a fedex of space fast but expensive but not prohibitively so
supportedhowever the items would be flown around by npcs with papertanks shooting one would only spawn the faction police not concord
the idea is to get everything you own into a nice tidy pile so you can clean it up i imagine it would remove millions of records from the eve database and would be a boon for players to get everything in one spot make it take 24 hours make it so it cannot be used as an inexpensive way to resupply yourself in 00 or station war situation npc couriers dont fly to 00 for single fedex items the contract system is already in place face it flying from station to station across eve with a freighter sucks it should be expensive
too much two simple things are needed allow covert cynos in cynojammed systems give bo a separate fuelbay or a much bigger cargo bay or reduce cost for jumpingbridging  comes all to the sameand that is all the fixes needed for the ships to do their intended job but those fixes are needed they were suggested in this way by the csm and also acknowledged by the devs in zuluparks qa threadyet i have the feeling that they are forgetting about it once again and these long overdue fixes wont be included in the march 10th expansion which is something the csm should address imho
supported on two conditions1 history of names is part of employment history log or similar but this seems a good place2 maximum 1 name change per year or other arbitrary period designed to avoid name skippingpeople who buy characters want to change their names fair enough people who change corps or play styles may want to as well i know it would annoy people who have enemy fcs on their buddy list hence the extended period of the name change limit people should rarely need this but for those who genuinely want to and have good reason to for their own game play satisfaction the option should exist

no waaaaaaaaaaylogistics and carebearism do not have to be simplified again its against their gameplay  would you like a single module that would tank you boost your dps mwd your ship  a dd cloak you and cynoing all at the same time its simplifying industry and some people actually play 100 of the time as industrialistsindustry shouldnt be made easier for pvpers it should be made deeper for industrialists and im a pvperin general industry shouldnt be as easy as it is now in term of sp because pvpers tend to be able to cover their own needs and in term of gameplay because its all based on waiting times if youre talking with industrialists they are saying  no more 1 man job please we want our fleets too and our hardcore specialized wings more depth and more useness for a carebear corp in 00currently since all new easy logistics we have jump freighters pos jumps rorqualorca and so on logitics in 00 can be made by a few personsif you remember well in 20062007 it was freigthers convoy with a defence fleet and it added carebearpvper cohesion sort of the ones needed the othernow 00 eve is turning like 1000 pvpers need only 10 carebears it is not fair colonies administrated by a few person and the others having to die in boredom resupplying it because it is not their favorite thing to do is not fairit should be 20s of true industry players thatd have to admministrate this thing a planet like earth is administrated by how many persons  resupplyed give them i dont know ministries  health politics education trade  with skills to train and something to do there so you wont have a single omnigod player playing with this whereas 1000s of people would die resupplying it and envy the omnigodit should be the opposite one resuplyer dozens of administration playersabout colonies fuelings poses again no im 100 sure you dont have to simplify logistics anyway its allready sure count how many jf freighters and rorquals are killed per day vs how many are safe i dont want them to be safier by warping to 0 to pos then dock to 0 to substations and nothing morecolonies should produce either npc goods or new materials to play with for t3 modules maybe or a new way to produce poses with actual bpo instead of bpc or implants or i dont know but a whole new industry treeits not only that a new industry would be an interesting thing for industrialists it would motivate 00 alliances into considering their carebears other than resupliers and sov holders considering them as a true strength of industry playing and serving to the alliance like never using empire for things like bpo implants poses skills and so onanother exemple a pvper could dock a fittedrigged ship there ask a special reprocessrepackage very very small made by another player and ask a package on another colony when the special repackaged ship have been moved by a player in a carrier or another shipindustrialist should be our fulltime gardian angels now they are just semiusefull carebears to any current 00 powerblocthey are more usefull as pvpers than as carebearssoz for engrish
the pest used to have mad alpha and it was cool then bs hp was boosted it makes do as a fleet ship but is inferior to the competitors its terrible for theorycraft solo and inferior to other ships for practical solo oh yeah and autocannons suxxor same falloff on different tiers but a useless optimal increase seriously
totally support this stop hating minnie ccp
changing drone bandwidth would be sweet i 3 my tempest already and i am looking into a mael 
i dont even use drones and i agree they should be buffed made more central of a weapon systemthe unfocused aka i just shoved 5 drones in my ship for the lil extra should keep their current ability to use and employ drones but we need to add that other level where a ship is centered around drones as the primary method of dps instead of a boost like 99 of all ships use it now

executor corps in eve should have to make a vote notified by evemail to the ceos of all the other corps in an alliance whether or not they will disband if the alliance doesnt pay its bills an evemail should be sent to all ceos telling them of the potential delinquency everybody should be able to see who voted and how they voted alliance bills receivablepayable should be viewed by all ceos in each corp other issues to include on rightswar decsalliance hqsovereigntyoutpost upgradesbasically if an alliance is going to make major political changes either for within or for external reasons it should be the concensus of the entire alliance leadership however limit the roles to the ceos for a speedy process and not every director in the entire alliance or every political role givenmin timer on all votes 24 hours 1 daymax timer on all votes 168 hours 1 weekperson does not vote then they automatically abstain majority yes  action is executedmajority no  action revoked for 24 hoursmajority abstain  action revoked for 24 hours
lol a little disappointing at bobs disappearance i for one welcome our new goon overlords
i have to agree and it is not sour grapes about bob on my part no doubt they would have done the same to goon if they had the chanceit is just a bogus game mechanic and it scares me that one person can get a bug up their ass and wipe out everyones work with the push of a button so many other more mundane things cannot be done by a single person without backup from others this seems spectacularly powerful a thing for one person to dodisclosure i am not nor ever have been a member of any bob or goon corpalliance i have no dog in this fight
yeah eve is brokenone disgruntled player can ruin years of effort by many thousands of players at the push of a buttoni guess ccp never saw this comingfix the interface to require votes and rollback bob into existenceif you dont then its gonna happen again and again to different alliances until players realise there just no point in doing the alliance stuff if it can all be destroyed by one ass hat
argh support deniedthe entire reason we formed an alliance is to be able to avoid the stupid vote for wardec wait 24 hours put wardec through wait another 24 hours crap
alright well lets roll back maximum yarrage and every other single alliance that was stolen this way as well just for the sake of fairness
according to the mittani i think it was him who said it in his interview this has happened before just nowhere near this scalewellit was done as intended under current game mechanics a roll back would be too much i think just fix it for the future
there is a big difference between making a war dec and dissolving an alliance of a few thousand people instantaneously because one disgruntled person got a bug up his ass about something or other
should treat your directors better andor not put ultimate authority in the hands of someone you dont know if you can trust or not maybe seems like sound practice to me
this has no bearing on what side you are for in the massive threadnaught called b0b is fail i really dont care about the politics or the bribery or whatever excuse somebody wants to give this thread has only to do with mechanics of the game no one person in the alliance whether or not its the founder of the alliance the ceo of the executor corp or some random director in the alliance should ever have that much power to completely erase 4 years of thousands of players hard work in one fail swoop that takes 30 seconds whether you agreedisagree with the current events i dont care please vote if you agree on some of the things mentioned here if not please be constructive and state why ok so i could concede the wardec thing
going to point out that majority abstain  no is also terrible due to the fact that sometimes things need to get done now well what if a couple of your ceos are on vacation and suddenly you cant do anything because they abstainyou need to think this through some more
i am not sure a specific mechanic need be decided here just that ccp should put some tripwire in place maybe have a 24 hour period where nothing happens once the dissolve alliance button is pushed and another director or ceo can unpush the button have an automated email sent to all members that says alliance will be dissolved in 24 hours from the time of this notewaiting 24 hours for an alliance to dissolve is not that onerusim sure people could put forth lots of mechanics point is to have some ability to stop one person who got his panties all in a wad over something or other from being a you lose button for a few thousand people
why they havnt done anything about it happening in the past why is it special now bob are not special sorry
the misunderstood thing here is there is no dissolve alliance option all the corps need to be kicked out or leave on their own accord yes executor corps can kick out member corps with no regard which is how it should be the same way a ceo can kick out a member without needing to vote on it either additionally all ceosdirectors in alliance can pay alliance bills they just dont have access to the alliance wallet and have to do it from their own heads of the alliance are there for a reason they arent there to get everyones vote theyre there to provide the decision making process for the alliance as a whole usually thats why theres one holding corp for alts so everyone can keep up to speed this voting process is removing power from those who it was willfully given to in the first place
it is special because of the scale of the thing this affects all of eve when the alliance was on this scale of course for those of us on the sidelines it is all fascinating to watch and even an opportunitybut one guy should not be able to wield power on this scale there is supposed to be balance in games and this is not a balanced mechanic it really makes no freaking sense itd be like the president of the united states hands over a substantial portion of us military equipment to the russians turns off all the nukes and radar defenses dissolves the united states entirely then goes to bed just absurd
real life analogies dont apply to this situation well read the post above yoursid post more but work is over and im going home now ciao
sure fail mechanic needs correction
it does not make sense in a game either i understand what the guy above me is saying and it makes sense nevertheless allowing a single person that kind of power is silly its called game balance the issue here is irrevocable and profound changes to all these people not just kicking one corp here or there if the executor corp holds that much power fine with me but then the directors should come to some accord or have a veto option or somesuch so no one person can undo everythingi strongly suspect if it happened to you then you would not be so keen on this mechanicno one is calling for a roll back except that one guy just plug this glaring hole in the mechanics
actually ive had an alliance stolen out from underneath me before i said welp and wardecd them shot them for a while and then moved alonglike i said this isnt special just because its bob or just because its big it has happened before it will happen again
i agree
an interesting idea given that ccp are now looking at the book mark my ship optionessentially youre just asking to be able to drag the bm to a chat channel including localsuch a functionality would be useful for other reasons too  eg covert opsalternatively a new option on the ship or channel menu could be send distress call which automatically flashes up a help me message in local makes your pic flashy green and enables people to warp to you this would require more coding but may not have the same overhead as bms mightpotentially a spam problem and extra lag but worth looking into perhaps
ships that decloak after jumping into system can not be locked for a few moments the targeting attempt will fail even when the ship is clearly on the overview and there is no sign of elevated lagi found that with a interceptor specifically built to catch things at gates sensor booster  2 signal amps it is still impossible to catch a good number of ships for this reason impossible is not an overstatement most frigs are in warp before im even allowed to start targeting them some cruisershacs are also fast enough for this

homophobia from greek homUFFFDs one and the same phUFFFDbos fear phobia is an irrational fear of aversion to or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals quote taken from wikii noticed that some entities like alliances have in theirs description homophobic statements which are insulting to members of glbt community myself includedand even if this issue was reported to gms nothing is done to prevent or punish those homophobic statements or and descriptions i am using assembly hall as resource to give this issue a more visibility
i would give your post aa thumbs down if i couldsomeone making a statement does not equal discriminationit has everything to do with the fact that you are overly thin skinnedif you do not like what is being written by people then dont bloody read it and ignore it
ill reinterpret the topicwhy is homophobia so discriminatedi am a free man with my own views on homosexuals as dead end of civilization but every homosexual will claim ccp to ban me for my own thoughts you who is homosexual cry a lot about your own rights and propagands your life style but you makes all possible to suppress my own rights to propagand the natural sex wheres the truth
thats life chum especially in a world of computer gaming geeks go to fanfest youll find that the reality of the people behind the keyboards is that theyre a nice bunch generally a lot more friendly and pleasant and intelligent than they appear in game and those who arent look like kids that everyone pushed around in the playgroundpeople who get discriminated against in eve gays pirates scammers carebears furries goons bob oh no wait russians dont take it personal and if you do find someone or someones bio that is outright offensive then yep petition away
heterophobia is a term used to describe irrational fear of aversion to or discrimination against heterosexuals quote taken from wikii noticed that some entities like alliances have in theirs description heterophobic statements which are insulting to members of the straight community myself includedand even if this issue was reported to gms nothing is done to prevent or punish those heterophobic statements or and descriptionsi am using assembly hall as resource to give this issue a more visibility
you guys are wasting your time talkingjust read the damn eula  ccp states its illegal to use antigay namesso gaya divines statement is wrong ccp does not tolerate homophobiaif you believe a gm is not enforcing the eula just write an email to the customer supportfly safe anyways
homophobia can be manifested by individuals that may be denying certain tendencies of their ownwhat was that senators name that got busted in an airport bathroom
phobias are uncontrolled fears and should always be tolerated a true phobia is not a choice made by an individual would you also say we should not tolerate those with a fear of heights or a fear of spiders or a fear of public speaking if you are opposed to intolerance  say so if you are opposed to people with phobias  thats silly
someone call a whaaambulance
your attempts at political correctness are more offensive than the impropriety of those you complain about
if i were to go about life getting upset and ranting about all the things i found offensive the i would be consistantly shouting 247please leave realworld issues at the login screen and enjoy eve its not directed at you personally neither is a corp name geek squad or similar something that i would take offence at you might call me a geek but its only a label so why should i care and tbh i dont give two hootsas i said leave the rl world and its crap at the login screen and enjoy eve in whatever way you wish to do so
sadly i did something similar even if i admire gms who are ready to share theirs time for benefits of eve community some of them do this with some discrimination i do support efforts for greater good but only efforts for greater good of all and not only majority players should be aware even if i am not directly insulted by some statements that this game are also played by kids which will link eve and rl as one and will think that its ok to insult those who dont have same values or life style as them i do believe that homophobia is not natural way of seeing others but was implemented to mind by influence of social circlessome of them can be close family others can be more complex but influential like games
more like why is this thread tolerated510 for effort on the troll opthis has nothing to do with the csm though so no points there
qft we dont need internet white knights curbing freedoms of the community due to the actions of opinions of a fewthumbs down
you dont have any freedoms when you play this game fool  only those privileges granted to you by ccp via the eula that you agree to when you first log onget it right
sometimes i think this topic gets brought up simply so people can vent there negative crap about other people and force others to have to endure itand it goes both waysalthough i dontjust wanna clarify thathehehehe
well captain pompous you said i am using assembly hall as resource to give this issue a more visibilityso lets start there shall we youre on the wrong board so before you start calling other people fools take a deep breath in between your furiously typed diatribes to look where youre postingalso though youre citing the eula the terms youre citing are here at the terms of agreement namly rules 2 and 3 rule 2 which is ignored by almost the entire gaming community so i wont even touch that onerule 3 is what youre looking for as it explicitly states that corps and alliances are not to be named after or advocate a laundry list of offensive things ive never even heard of an openly racist or antigay corporation or alliance if you know of some why havent you posted any of them herethats kind of the key to your argument anyhow so if youre going to clog up this board with crap like this you should at least point some fingers like a good whineredited to remove anything that could be considered too offensive for your vomit inducing politically correct sensibilities

geez you guys are a bunch of hypocrites if you and ccp were to switch shoes all of the sudden i highly doubt that you would reveal the names of those responsible why because if you did reveal them you would be violating your company promise to its customers that would make everyone leave you because we the customers would no longer trust ccp with information that is supposed to be incredibly secret if a bunch of ppl could demand transparency on this banning what is to stop the next group from demanding credit card information from ccp it shows weakness and loss of integrity do not kid yourselves ccp will never reveal it and i hope they never do for if they did i and many others would quit eve immediately and remove all information that is important to us such as credit cards because we would feel it is safe any longer get over yourselves ccp is not gods and neither are you mistakes were made and we are all human its has and it will happen again nothing i repeat nothing will stop another t20 incident or pos exploit there is simply no way to do that you are asking the impossible they will try their hardest to avoid another incident but it will happen in some form or some way it is human nature and it is how life goes isaac

this guy is right names will never be made public
thanks for the replykeep on them if its not out soon
no thats not what people are saying at all im equally tired of reading posts that deliberately misunderstand the request in order to knock it down with a strawman argument but it doesnt seem to stop it happeningnobody is asking for more missions per se or the ability to cherrypick or that if the system changed that we should automatically make more cash from it what is frustrating is that the mission system is so random offering you a series of missions that you cant possibly wish to take without any thought at all and can end up leaving you with no missions available from decent agentsas a personal point id argue that if its already the case that by doing missions in empire i pretty much screw my chances of doing pirate faction missions in 00 id at least like to be able to keep my empire standings reasonable without twiddling my thumbs every time an agent says hey the gallente have turned up again inside our space go shoot them dont worry somehow it wont start a wardisappointing that so many posters read missions and then fill in the blanks with their own bile and hatred instead of reading what i thought was quite a balanced post from a csm member
first off i hope this is a joke  but youre a little early for april fools dayi would like to reiterate that with many of your posts they are your personal problems and personal issues that you have with eve as always you attempt to bend the universe around youthere is nothing wrong with losing standing for example if you run a lot of gallente missions youll take negative caldari hits did you know there is a simple solution to this yes  simply go and run some caldari missions to increase the standinga lot of people run missions because they are vs missions and i think even the most hardcore missionrunners would find it mindnumbingly boring and tiring to just haul this here fetch that refine 300 units of do you actually find that fulfilling and worthwhilei have never had an issue with missions or agents if i do i simply find another if you think and adapt you can keep your standings fairly balanced between empires but god forbid youd have to thinki hope the other csm delegates can keep you in check and actually realise what you are proposing is for nothing more than personal gain packaged up in a little box pretending to benefit the community stop just stopi dont disagree there are improvements to be made to aspects of the game but these proposals are just totally offthewallif you dont fill your car up with petrol and fail to get to the destination who is to blame1 you2 the car3 the car manufacturer4 the petrol stationclearly its you the driver so if youre having problems with missions then you need to adapt the way you run them and put some thought in before jumping right in exmaple fill up the tank before you set off speaking of jumping right in you might also want to consider your posts and your proposals more carefully in future continued posting of such utter nonsense will only end up being counterproductive to you and to the csm you will end up turning into a lame duckif you really do have this many issues with eve see minutes votes past proposals then maybe you should consider a game which is more suitable for you youre here for the eve community not for yourself  rightyou are on the csm to serve the people  so lets see some service please ankh i dont mean self service try selfless service for the community to which you claim to cherish
while changes along these lines would be convient for me i cannot recommended them without bias
nope with the way it was balanced all three ideas they cruiser hulls would have to use that midslot if they wanted to obtain nearimmunity otherwise dont attack that closerange battleship solo unless specifically fit for the task i repeat the test i was referring to was a moduleless stabber with minimal skills ps a single tracking computer 30 makes little difference when you consider the 400 change post qr the proposed changes would be more of a meeting half way between qr and preqr in terms of hitting ability but as webs are no longer the equivalent hitting the brick wall you still have the option of disengaging
well i know all that  the point is you need to get that close and this means generaly web rangescrambler range which means lower absolute transversals as most probably both of you will be webed  this significantly lowers your ability to use the tracking advantage also  and the closer you get the less dps you will deal to your targetwith growing effective sig both of you would have the same sigresolution ratio if using same gradetier guns but the blaster ship will have a tracking advantage up close  this is what the proposal is trying to achieve 
no the closer you get the more extreme your damage advantage becomes drop in closer so that your chance to hit is 40 and his will drop to 20 you would be dealing more than twice as much damage as your opponentif you let him control range you wont win if he pulls away until you lose damage due to falloff if he pulls in closer he forces a draw because neither of you can deal sufficient damage to kill the otherhowever if you can keep yourself inside of your optimal12falloff and keep things moving faster than about half of his tracking speed then you will out damage him the closerfaster you go the greater the ratio between your damage and his you just need to keep your damage high enough to break his tankrecap for those how have lost track of this subthread this comparison is between neutron blaster cannon ii and mega pulse laser ii 
youre making contradictory pointstracking under a certain speed threshold is effectively the same tracking above a certain speed threshold is effectively the samethe current tracking with 60 webs is within the thresholds that means it makes a difference if it didnt no one would be complaining about missing targets at close rangechanging sigwhich is the same as changing tracking will increase the threshold where tracking is effectively the same on the bottom end this will bring the tracking of pulse lasers and blasters closer together effectivelyps use the hyperion 2 webs easier to create and reduce transversal
hmm tracking formula is fine the same ppl who support this changewould come whine that the enemy bs easily hits their cruisersfrigs when they try to orbit itmaybe it should be changed similar to missiles that the target ship sign would mean much more  like bs chance to hit a cruiser with 150m sig would be maximum 150m400m regardless of trackingit is more realistic as it doesnt matter how good your skills with aiming if your weapons disperion is greater than the target size
dear alli have understood that ccp is not wanting to let alliances to join factional warfare as such due to the obvious dilemma of bigger 0 space owning alliances to start using fw as their playground i think i have a solution to this problemalliances that are part of factional warfare cannot have sovspace in zerosec their sov is where their factions sov isthis would effectively bar the big alliances to start coming in and making the  hit the fan of the whole purpose of fw however it is possible that this measure is not enough thus im proposing a possible more ruthless way to approach the issueonly those alliances would be possible to be in fw that are formed with corporations that have been part of fw fex 2 months  or based on their total victorypoints  or similar meter the alliances formed this way would not be sanctioned by concord but the faction they are in  this would limit their possibility to have sovereign zero sec space also this would be a good way to hinder the possible avalanche of large pirate alliances to infest the fwgameplay i realize the latter proposition would make it hard for current heavy rprelated alliances to join factional warfare straight away but i think this would be a good way of approaching the issue without having too much impact on the fw idea and this would allow those corporations within the factions already to start having the useful alliance interface towards gameplaybest regardst 2
with ccp doing a lot for the new player experience i think one of the best things they could do would be to remove the epic waste of time and hugely boring timesink that we call learning skillsi cant think of a single person that thinks they are in any way fun to train and everyone tells new players you need to train your learning skills now essentially keeping them from training more fun things in their first month or two of game play i imagine many people have decided eh forget it and quit the game over thisso id like to propose a removal of the learning skills if possible vets should have the skillpoints refunded and allow them to place it wherever they want if that is to technically complicated then just remove themboost everyones attributes by 89 points and be done with this terrible timesink of a skilltree
kill them with fire i dont care that ill lose sp they are the biggest waste of time and a completely arbitrary timesink that discourages new players new players should be discouraged by the fact that new eden is a cold harsh world not because you have to spend a month essentially training nothing so you can be competitive
the decision to train or not train learning skills is up to the individual i know i didnt max them out first thing and i still have a some to training to do to make them perfect after 3 years playing the best realworld analogy would be the learning skills are like saving money the sooner you start saving the more the interest compounds over the long term however you cant have any fun with the money you are saving make a decision leave it alone leave it a decision for each pilot not supported
i thought it was funnier the way you put it on shc tarm 
if i never see my sp again so be it
so what youre saying is that a pilot fresh to the game should save his money and not have any fun with it essentially encouraging him to quit because the game is boringterrible reason sir
reasoning is too weak for this proposalnot supported
i hate having to tell new players to just sit on their asses and train learning skills so yeah remove them completely and give everyone the attribute increase i dont care if i loose sp or if it gets refunded would be nice of course but it would truly be better for the game if there were no learning skills
exactly how is learning skills are not fun at all add nothing to the game and actively discourage new players from staying weak
so say youre going to an amusement park you can either enter the theme park now but you have to walk half as fast as you normally do to the rides and pay twice as much for food or you can wait outside for 6 hours and be able to walk normally once you get in and pay the normal price for foodnow are you more likely to1 go in immediately2 wait outside3 find an amusement park that doesnt arbitrarily punish you for wanting to ride the rides
trying using that gray matter in your skullso you eliminate learning skills nothing changesstarting skill points get boosted for the char that gets started whoopee rightleaving them alone harms no one eithertoo weak of a proposal there are more important matters to resolvenot supportedthis is the same arguing if theres a point to have rookie ships or not useless to everyone cant reprocess cant sell back only gets used when you start the game rather have just a pod or something or better yet a shuttleits an argument that goes nowhere real quick because its a waste of everyones bloody timeyour just sore because you want more skill points for free or little timethats the truth of the matter hereif you dont like them then dont train them duh
thats not at all what im saying im saying its an individual decsion i said that i still havent finished all of my learning skills i like to balance saving my money with enjoying it so to speak those who choose to invest should be rewarded with the gains those who choose to party should be rewarded with the fun taking away the decision is not eve
look ive been playing this game for three years now i got my learning skills out of the way a long time ago and i dont care if they remove them and i never see the sp again check my character out in game if you dont believe me this is about the new player experiencelearning skills are a horrible waste of time that only discourages people from playing because they arnt training the fun skills that allow them to fly new ships or use new modulesrookie ships serve a purpose because you have to start somewhere learning skills serve no purpose other than you have to train this skill to be competitive but it doesnt help you in any other way nor is it funtry again
terrible reasoning every rookie that joins the game is told you have to train learning skills or you wont be competetive so everyone does because no one wants their character to fall behind and everyone wants to advance as fast as possiblebut these skills are not fun to train and discourage people from staying with the game
your argument is completely based on discouragementfine take it furtherhow long does it take to train up to an hulkhow about a marauderhow about a black ops shipa carrieroops did i strike a nervehow about you plug your brain in before you start spouting offpeople leave this game for weeks on end for those skills learning skills being in or out changes nothingcome up with a valid argument and youll get my support otherwise go bug someone else
obviously not everyone does i didnt yes i heard that advice i made my own decision im not a sheep eve is about hard decisions that have real consquences taking away from that would be bad im sure there are other pilots out there who dont take all of the advice given to them i highly encourage more people to try thinking for themselves from time to time 
facepalmyou dont see the difference between training to be able to fly a ship going oooh i can fly x in another 3 days and training a skill that lets you train betterif you cant see the difference youre not worth discussing it with get out
this doesnt take away from the hard decisions of eve learning skills are just a useless time sinknew players shouldnt quit because of i have to train for over a month just to learn to train skillsthey should quit because man this game is harsh i just lost my 3b isk faction battleship
get rid of them its one thing to add in timesink skills for veteran players to open up highlevel ships and equipment but the whole learning skills group is tedious boring and scares away new players
they dont have to train the learning skills first man newbies shouldnt have 3billion anything ships eve isnt supposed to be that easy
i was obviously using hyperbole to prove my point dont take the arguement litereallyyes they dont have to train them first but with almost everyone telling them they should and telling them how youll fall behind if you dont train this useless timesink of an unfun skill most of them do or quitthats the point
as an 04 player and thus one who may lose out from this i still heartily endorse thisfor a newbie having to train to be able to train properly is so ed that it drives a great deal of friendly newbies away 
support added its a stupid idea and a real turnoff for newcomers to the game
learning skills are boring but id like to see those that spent a lot of sp in learning skills get a refund for them
you sir have the worst logicthe point being made is that new people are forced to train for skills which do nothing apart from making them able to train other skills at the same rate as people already in game if you dont train them you fall behind as a newbie if you do train them youll be able to train skills quicker later on but for your first month you are unable to fly anything other than a burst its a lose lose situationit is completely not the same as training for skills that let you use new guns and ships because these skills actually lead to an end product rather than an acquisition of attributes and thus the new players can think oh hay ill actually be able to fly that cool rifter soonnothing changes for the new players apart from they do not have to get bored out of their wits for the first month i know personally of friends who left the game because of this ed mechanism they were even told that you dont need to train learning skills for the first month just to try out new ships but the fact kept coming back to them that eventually theyd have to train what is for all intents and purposes a skill designed to waste timeand to those saying you just want to gain some sp i have no qualms with me ending up the worst for this by receiving no free sp i do not care if my skills just magically disappear and get replaced by attributes because after years of playing this game the effect is not great in the grand scheme of things and the effect is certainly alot lower than the positive effect to newbies
i agree eve is already overwhelming enough to new players training many noobs in the past one of the primary goals of mine was to keep them interested in the game especially through those first 23 months when it can be at times a difficult learning experience telling them in addition to a steep learning curve they have to spend 23 weeks training essentially nothing doesnt help anyremove these pointless timesink skills give everyone an 89 point attribute boost and leave it at thatsigned

reimburse if practical but remove them either way there are no words for how dumb the current system is
support for this issue being investigatedperhaps a compromiseso as not to shaft players who have recently started change new character starting skills to lvl4 basics lvl1 advanced learnings at the cost of reducing the amount of lvl4 and lvl5 skills that new chars start with possibly by a greater amount than you give the learningseg 800k sp is what new chars start with6 basic learnings  lvl4  6x 45255 sp  271530sp5 adv learnings  lvl1  5x 750  3750sptotal in learnings  275280speven if starter total was reduced to 700k or 600k i think there would be plenty left for enough skills to have fun withthis should allow new chars to advance their skills reasonably quickly so as to be able to do more fun stuffeg as is what happens with new playershelp my capacitor empties too quickly in missionstrain energy systems operation to help thatnow with low attributes energy systems operation 1 takes nearly 20 minutes say to learnwith higher attributes it only takes 10 or lessso a new player can then get back into their mission and play sooner rather than waitnow you can make the choice to invest more into the learning skills but its not such a stark choiceedit eve has plenty of long waits in the higher gameplay is it too much to ask that you dont expose new players to the waiting game before you show them the fun stuff
thats not logic by your logic if you train learning skills youre at least as fast as everyone else in the game not factoring in all the people who didnt train them right away or who have implants or who have different character buildsthis whole debate is nonsense no one is forced to train them there are more important things to worry about no support
dont be an idiotthis is completely different to extended training times for advanced shipsby the time you are training for capital ships and the like the skills for which take weeks on end you have ussually years of experience and so can fly numerous other ships while you wait you also know the fun of eve as you have played it and enjoyed it for a whilewhen you are wasting time on your learning skills you are just starting out and are training them because you have to in order to keep up with your friends and others a few months down the linebut as you are just starting out you cant really fly or do anything at all so unlike these prospective cap ship pilots you soend your weeks training doing nothing and wondering why you joined a game which seems openly hostile for new playershaving only played a few mmos in my time eve is by far the most hostile to new players of any obviously with the game being so complex ccp cant change the rediculous user interfacebut things like learning skills which realistically are a requirement mean that new players really dont have a good time as they are stuck unable to do anythingnew players are important especially to ccp who would be blind not to do something about this if they want new money and fresh new population for new eden they need to get their act together and make the game easier to get into and the removal of learning skills with boosted attributes is a good startthe game doesnt need to be easier as a whole just a little bit quicker to start at the end of my 2 week trial my character still couldnt fly anything other than frigates with minimal modules as i was waiting for learning v if my friends hadnt managed to convince me id be just another player to have never fattened ccps wallet and left for something stupider but more welcoming to new players like wowsupported
more important things to worry aboutyoure saying that hitting delete on the learning section for ccp and popping everyones attributes up by the appropriate amount would take a huuuuge amount of ccps valuable timeand yeah youre not forced to train learning in the same way youre not forced technically to train for better ships and modules you can fly a rookie ship for years but you need better stuff to be good enough to have funyou need the learning skills to competitive and able to have fun
the true problem seems to be the manic groupthink that everyone seems to thrust on new players its like a chant you must train learning first you must train learning first you must train learning firstperhaps we should slow down and actually give the newbies a real answer and educate them about the learning skills if you choose to invest training time in the learning skills you will reap the benefits of improved training speed in the longrun if you choose to invest time in the practical skills first you will build more wealth initially and have more fun up front you do have the option to go back and forth train a litle learning train something funits a decision it has consequences welcome to the galaxy
or we could remove a pointless timesink of a skill and not have to worry about it oeveryone pretty much has to do the learning skills you cant change the culture of you have to do the learning skills or you wont train as fast without removing them from the game everyone likes to get the most possible out of their characters as fast as possible hence learning skills are pretty much a requirement not a decision with consequenceshow is it going to hurt you to remove these skills exactlybecause you suffered through training them you think everyone should
i support thisjust boost everyones base stats by 10 points each the same as 55 training skills and distribute the lost skillpoints amongst the lowest trained skills remainingthere might be some people who have trained their skills to lvl5 and dont have any skills to increase in that case either give them isk or give them some randombuthelpful skill instead
its not that it would hurt me however this turns out ill be hurt or benefit exactly as much as everyone else i just disagree with the premise behind this proposal i dont think its a good idea i apparenently see a lot more choice in the whenandhow people train skills than you do i see the choice of ifwhenhow fast people choose to train these skills as important decisions a person makes in the development of their characters as ive said i still have a couple of the level 2 learning skills that i still need to get around to finishing off some day i chose to go back and forth between learning and other skills many times over the years as a result im sure i have less total skill points than i would have had if id trained all learning first i enjoyed or put more priority different skills at different times im pretty happy with the training decisions they worked for me others choose different routes to use a different realworld analogy some people go to college right after high school some people go back to school late in life after making some money in the business world some people pursue a on and off education of technical courses and certifications some people go right to work and never look for more education i think the learning skills should be seen for what they are  a useful set of skills and one more option for character development
you guys make it seem like someone is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to train learning skills as soon as you log on the first timeand if your advice to new players are that they should train learning skills first then youre also the ones holding the gun rolls eyesif a new player asks me for advice on skill progression i advice them to do what i did and what pilot santiago fahahrii said before meyes learning skills are nice to have however train skills so you can fly a fun ship with decent modules first then train some learning skills as you feel like it they are nice to have but they are also not mandatoryand about the proposalin some ways it feels nice to not have a cookie cutter character that its nice to have some individuality even in how fast you train your skills in the end it doesnt really matter unless youre a munchkin
theyre not mandatory but a lot of people feel like they are because they dont want to feel left behindthere would still be plenty of character individuality in how you distribute your starting sps and what implants you decide to plug in personally ive been flying with 3s almost my entire career because they are a pirate set i could train faster by plugging in 5s but the pirate set gives other nice bonuss that i preferthat is a decision with consequences learning skills are not theyre simply a musttrain skill that sucks the fun out of new players first couple of monthsill say it again you cant change the culture of you need the learning skills advicegiving without removing them from the game
i bolded the parts you need to reread you are using rhetoric to dance around the central issue learning skills provide a cheap means of increasing attributes over the top of base stats and implants which costs sometimes hundreds of millionsits a choice its a choice its a choicehow many times must you read that before you understand it its not a must have you can get along just fine without ever training them youre trying to paint it as something you must do because other people pressure new players into it its not and never has been you cant make your opinions facts by yelling them over and over again it its your opinion that these skills must be trained in the beginning not a fact
and its the opinion of a lot of other people too that is my entire point are you not even listening or do you want to try some more poor logic on menew players feel like they have to train these skills to stay competitive the learning skill tree is boring to train but most people feel like they need to train these skills early on or they will fall behind there is no point to these skills except learning to learnits a timesink and unnecessary and drives new players away
hardly the first time this has come up but definitely supported learning skills  noob tax they are effectively mandatory in order to compete id much rather see them combined with other skills eg take something like navigation 1 make it a 2 and give it a 1 perception per level as well something that people do train but that actually provides some benefit
17 supports on this thread 250000 subscribers i see nothing unnecessary about a cheap alternative to implants that is still optionalill keep saying it until you get it it is a choice just because certain people are being made to feel as though they have to learn these skills they do not have to are not forced to and have a choice if it drives them away you can blame that on the player base aggressively telling them to train learning skills not the skills themselves implants  expensive as sin but instantly implement attribute boostlearning skill  cheap as sin but take increasing amounts of time to boost attributesi think thats a reasonable duo we have going i have not yet seen a significant reason to have the skill books removed if they were forced on new players in any tangible way or if not training them was a significant detriment to anyone i would support it as you do not i do not support keep yelling ill keep rebutting repeating opinions do not make them facts the fact is its optional and you cant dance around that forever
i support it only if those who trained the advanced learning skills to 4 and 5 were justly compensated while adv 3 and below were given the setbackalso warn people of when this implementation will happen so any new pilots who join wont waste time on those skills
oh look more terrible logic let me address this point by pointfirst off quoting subscriber numbers means nothing especially when a huge portion of the subscribers dont visit this forum and a huge portion of those that do are currently enthralled by the bobgoons dramaexspense has nothing to do with this arguement either and i laugh at you thinking implants are pricey implants used to cost a lot back in the day these days pretty much anyone who tries even a little bit can run around in a set of 4syes i know its a choice i have never disputed the fact that it is a choice what i am disputing is the necessity of such a choice the learning skills do nothing for a character except make them train or level up in other mmo vernacular faster everyone wants to level up faster newbies feel it is necessary to train these skills but they are not fun in any waylaughable you can have a set of 4s very cheaply these days price still has nothing to do with this anywayssee above price nothing to do with this arguement etcwait by your logic training 50 slower than everyone else if you dont train these skills isnt a detriment then i have no idea what is by your definition of the wordyou keep repeating this like its some sort of mantra against having to make a rational arguementtheres absolutely no reason to have these skills in game they dont provide a real choice with actual consequences and benefits just train these skills or you will train slower than everyone else therefor your character is worse
i have yet to see a compelling reason for the skill books to stay discourage new players to log in is not one
that was a nice tryyoure talking about noobs well noobs dont have the 500 million isk to trot around with buying up 4s so throw that crap out the window its not laughable at allagain  not everyone has to train these skills and not everyone does making blanket statements like if you dont train these you skill up 50 slower than everyone else is laughable as you put it since you have no fraking clue what everyone trains youre using rhetoric again to try to skirt the fact that its an viable option but still only an optionthe reason for having them  as i stated and you ignored is to have another option outside of implants that costs less isk wise but more time wisethats breaking it down for you barney style if you cant figure out the dichotomy between learning skills and implants you probably shouldnt be on here arguing about rational arguments at allalso its not a mantra its a promise i can keep posting here every time i see it on the main page if you like i will continue to stress that its a choice since youre only argument against it seems to be that its being forced on everyone or that its not necessary well neither of implants so the only way i support the upset of the current system is to throw out both implants and learning skills since neither is more absurd than the otheryeah theres a swiftian turn for you its a choice not a bad one either but as long as its not forced on anyone i think it deserves to stay
then you didnt readunderstand my post they form a dichotomy with implants that shouldnt be tampered with unless scrapping all of it implants learning skills anything that boosts skills more options  less options
youre not even worth argueing with any more efrim ill just keep collecting support itt thanks
in the end they will still have to train the learning skills they are a useless time sinkso they either get their time sink done first or get it done laterit sucks its lame its bad game design it does not encourage people to play the game
quoting for truth and supporting this thread since it was said it needs pylons
good luck with that if you can not work through my arguments it proves youre relying on hollow rhetoric it also shows how well youd be able to take on counterpoints from ccp who would probablyagree with me the skills are not useless they provide an alternative way to increase attributes youd rather scrap that and make the only way implants meaning the only way to increase attributes is to grind for iskso unless you support them both being scrappedi disagree with youre flawed argumentthey are useful they are a cheap option and they arent forced on anyonemore options are better than fewer options
isnt this the problem here you are playing the game and encounter a problem the solution to the problem involves waiting for a skill no big deal but without learning skills the solution takes quite a bit longer to arrive this is most important in the first few hours of gameplay isnt it having people twiddle their thumbs while waiting is not attractiveshirleys suggestion sounds ok i think basics to lvl4 adv to lvl1 for new characters reduce some other skills to compensate still have the option to invest in long term but in the short term skills will be a bit quicker which means more people are likely to get hooked in the trial 2 weeks no
supporting thisalso efrim your argument makes no sense at alledit reread your posts efrim i didnt train them so i can train skills slower to be different yeah smart move
first of all i never said that i dont know who youre quoting i did train the learning skills with every character ive started i enjoyed that it chopped off training time for other skillssecond of all if you dont have the mental capacity to understand my argument thats not my fault if you do please point out an inconsistency and you may change my mind
no he wont and no one else will be able to either because youre not looking at it from the right perspective if you dont have the mental capacity to understand that thats not my fault see what i did there
remove learning skills no base attribute bonus beyond implants no 10 in place of learning skills reallocate learning skill sp to other skills no more discussion on learning skills
yeah i see what you did there its not a matter of perspective its pretty cut and dry you offer no new alternatives while removing an option thats been in the game for a long timeso youre removing options without providing any viable alternatives and im pretty sure that perspective has nothing to do with thatsee what i did there
learning skills just discourage people give everyone lvl 4 basics and lvl 23 advanced learning skills for free when the people who stand to lose out are supporting an idea its the only real choice
because what this game needs more of is terrible options that arnt really options colbert
i was quoting you the direct quote is in some ways it feels nice to not have a cookie cutter character that its nice to have some individuality even in how fast you train your skillsi just translated it
i love paying for a game then being put on hold for two months to get on with it in a productive mannerlearning skills are just a gimp to new players i want to be able to play to the best of my ability right from the get go and no i dont mean i wish i started with level vs across the board this is just a time sink everyone has to go through christ anyone that chooses not to go through this rigmarole is just going to feel cheated later on in the gametldr get rid of learning skills
please put a checkmark in the give support box when you post more support  more attention 
definitely remove them give everyone 10 by default and refund all existing sp that people have trained
refund remove 10 across the board it
get rid of them 9 or 10 gogo
scrap all learning skills boost all character attributes allow player to redistribute skill points invested through some fancy web interface
since they are implementing the skill queue come the patch in march they can integrate redistributing sp on a modified queue systempossiblyedited to show support

adding support for this idea
but i did i just dont agree with youanything that acts as a deterrent for new players to continue playing is bad even if it means more options
this tbhthis game has huuuuuge number of customisable options and huuuge scopelearning isnt an option everyone has to do it at the expenense of time on other skillslearning is a very good example of an extra dynamic added to the game which simply doesnt need to be there it serves no purpose as everyone trains learning ot the same level anyway the only part which is optional is implants as some people choose not to expend the money and take the podding riskno need for learning to stay in the game i would have alot of respect for ccp if they were to trim some fat off the gamecan you really say without the complete nonchoice that is learning the game would be worse offand wouldnt have enough choices and scope
so the steep learning curve current lack of an avatar excel in space interface and lack of any grindforskill system are all bad things they drive away plenty of new playersif we weed out everything that might deter new players wed just get another generic mmo im sorry but part of what makes this game unique is the number of options you people supporting do not seem to really think of the implications of removing the current learning skills and just giving everyone 10 points across the boardthis would leave only one way to increase attributes implants basically if you grind for money you train skills faster otherwise youre screwed so my proposal is pretty simple if youre going to be so brash as to tear this down tear the entire system down remove implants as welloh wait then you lose a major isk sink and the economy starts falling apart stupid logic

kudos for thisthat would also be interessting for all other chanwindows to have an overview how many corpmembers allymembers allyfriends etc are in
big things go boom little things with lots of ammo also go boom arent the explosions satisfying enough id rather not have a bunch of liveumbombs flying around me 
even nuclear ones are kinda boring in spacejust a flash that youd literally miss if you blinked and a few panels going blinky red if it wasnt close enough to kill you
nothis would be tricky for frigate duels as they end with low hp generaly for the victor 
why not may be destroyed ship will make an explosion with radius equal double of its signature and explosion radius as bombs has equal to its own signature and damage of explosion equal to its structure hpsthis will make a little damage from a little ships and will damage close targets only
yea just think a titan explodes wow all the ships will be dead might as well selfdestruct instaid of dd
i support this idea for one reason which nobody seems to have pointed out people are always complaining about the blob this would discourage that by forcing people to space out after all nobody will want to get in real close unless theyre built to damage and tank the resulting explosionand i dont see where the lag comes in i mean do we not already have aoe weapons its just a matter for one large aoe to trigger when the ship is destroyed
if this was to be done right which seems unlikely we could just compute the relative speed of parts dispersing into space any piece of debris travelling at velocity x that intersects the trajectory of a moving body travelling at speed y is enough to cause a lasting impressionmass times velocity will take out just about any ship in the inventorynot practical on the one hand debris from ships would count towards damage but bouncing off of asteroids as the mining ship flies to zero or hitting a warp gate or even a can would not count its a gigantic headache that we can do withoutplus it would be impossible for mining vessels to find a fitting that would help them survive impact damage and still be useful as a mining vesseli appreciate the imagination and the creative thinking but ill have to pass on this oneabulurd bonifaceme meceo

gaaaahhhhhwrong thread cant wait for forums overhauldelete this please
i highly disagree other csm members post with their characters on noncsm topics as well and this does not detract from their duties also the post you provided the url for might i point out the title of the post sad panda foom has a broken epeenif this misled you to believing there was csm relevent content in caod nontheless then i think there are much bigger issues at stake here than isslers posting abilityobviously you are trolling to gather more negative attention for issler the simple fact that youre an alt in happy joymaker corp founded by happy joymaker is proof that you too are trying to recover some of your lost epeen i find it very unfortunate that she is being targetted along with her alliance which according to foom they had no problem with its just her right thats why the wardec is on the alliance however this is eve and i dont know about everyone else but it would be boring without this level of gameplay politics and occassionally forum whoringi wish you the best of luck in recovering your epeen id like to remind you that your erm happy joymakers since youre totally not his alt death was in vain i would also like to point out that the largest thing detracting from the csm is this post getting in the way of the other much more relevent topicsshame happy didnUFFFDt get her pod  because podkills were reimbursed
this guy summed it up well
i support this product andor service
ridiculous proposal this person was elected to the csm in a fair and democratic vote and retains the position until the end of the term posting rubbish on caod is not in and of itself a eula violation and shouldnt enter into it
oh i almost forgot010 troll
mcskanky dude chill outissler is doing just what we want mkay she cannot help it it is her nature she is making a big enough arse out of herself with her lame posts any sort of a slap on the wrist from the csm wouldnt do anything at all csm is just an advisory group to get player feedback at ccp and the folks at ccp are i would assume wise and knowledgable enough to take any advise given to them in the appropriate contextissler will continue to make lame posts and will hire some mercs that we can eat up for the fun of it while we get ready for wspace and the interesting times ahead with that no biggie and quite fun actually oh and dude if your going to try to flame at least do it with an npc corp alt or your main in the goons goons are supposed to be good at flaming after all
so a few general comments when i decided to volunteer to participate in the csm and was surprised by being elected i did it to represent a part of the player population i hadnt seen represented before the semicasual but committed industrialist that may or may not be in a player corporation and likely lives in empireish i think i am doing a reasonable job doing thati never agreed as part of being a csm member to quit enjoying eve the way i always have in fact what i personally decided to do was increase my involvement as for some of the claims that i whine about war decs i think history and my actions show that simply isnt true as a csm i have never suggested or tried to eliminate that element of eve my only issue with the goon war that recently ended between beep and the goons was that it seemed initially to be an attempt to effect the csm process despite that complaint beep did what they could to participate in that war and in the end we are better for itas to offering to hire mercs in the beepfoom war i did it as being officially a carebrar corp this is what carebear corps generally do in this case we are also going to fight and i expect fight well the merc offer was also because i know a lot of folks had issues with foom andor bruce far more than have ever had issues with tada o or beep and that some of those folks might like to have a reason to join the funso that may be a bit of a ramble but the key points are being part of the csm i think i do the most good participating in as much of eve as there is to enjoy and for some that has a forum component nothing i do in the csm has anything directly to do with my aliance or any organizationsindividuals we encounter good or bad im not sure how i could use being in the csm to any advantage as mostly it make me and my associations targetsfinally i want csm members actively involved in eve when they are serving that is the best way for them to understand the issues facing the playersand ill close with this you have to wonder about fooms leadership the issues between myself and bruce were over early in their syndicate days and such a small footnote in the rise and epic failure of the alliance in the end we left more resources in bruce than we ever took and have made it a point to go our own way since how they could think we or if you believe some of thier posts me were worthy of so much effort is simply a mystery id say if the gripe is about me in the csm then here is an idea run a candidate and participate freed could run on the bitter players with long memories platform i know hed get at least 4 or 5 votes based on the forum postsissler
and yet we have a goonswarm csm proudly admitting he and his corp were behind the metagaming hack that dissolved bobnice one you idots will just pull the wool over your eyes until the game is ruined should rename yourselves gfngood fornothing
changes to tracking formula on the agenda pleasei dont think ill be doing the mission topic either itll have to be split up into several or itll wait till march 10 so i can analyze the epic mission arc game mechanics and integrate them into my proposal i think the quality of the issue is better served by delaying it for that last month
how is it that the dissolution of bob is only a day or so old and already other alliances have sov in those territories i thought that if a corp changed alliances it took 7 days for sov to take effect have these corps been able to somehow circumvent that ruleshow me as confused
shameless bump
show your support encourage the csm to vote on this
id rather go with something like thistempest 5 rof bonus per level 10 falloff bonus add drones or something to compensate for dps lossmaelstromgive it an apoc like treatment x shields as base stat and not as per bs level5 rof bonus per level or damage75 tracking or optimal per levelnow you have tempest as ac boat and mael as a proper sniperthe way you suggest it youll have tempest as a shot range sniper with good tracking and mael as a long range sniper that couldnt track a mwding titan while both would still perform nicely as ac boats
that would work except the additional  x shields as base stat and not as per bs level this should not happen or give my rokh a built in resist bonus and change resist bonus to another optimal bonus or just a flat out 30 cap increase like for the apoc
im not sure these changes are the right way to go mission running with a maelstrom means a boost bonus is fine keeps it different and will not be a problem if one of the other minnie ships can be used when its not apropriatetempest needs something people dont bring bs to a gang for a slot of unbonused ewar 6 lows and less armour than a raven is not a good start by all means keep it different to othe bs but make it good at somethingfor all those people who keep saying the tempest is fine if you know how to fly it i say the probe is the best fleet ship in the game you just need to know how to use it
supported
it certainly is its an amazing cyno ship
sure
drones can has lovin
dont let the dream die
jinx does not suggest that ccp must do something he just does not like that important issues are not even properly commented on by ccpif they say no they have to come up with a very good explanation and this is one of the most popular issues not a fotm nerf otherwise we will ask again and again
i think it should take more than one person in a high role to completely screw over years of work of over 3000 people corptheft and so on is fine imo the problem is that such a major decision as disbanding an alliance and permenately losing sov takes only one guy deciding to screw everyone overbob is dead fine whatever but fix this so that it cant happen again can you imagine the goon whines if one of their leaders decided  it i am disbanding goonsawrm neener neener this is only being hailed because everyone hated bob and it was done with a spy
uh goon wouldnt care theyd just shoot each other like theyre want to do anywaysnothing wrong with this mechanic a single controlling ceo of a real corporation can drive it into the ground just as easily corporations in and of themselves can maintain around 1300 people depending on the ceos skills should the ceo have to get coapproval from his directors before booting people willy nilly i think not
in most cases this button would usually be the i win you lose buttonor better yet potential for blackmail signed
the reason bob disbanded ceo was stupid enough to let it happen
thisalliances are fine how it is adds to the risk part of the game
the whole purpose of this thread is for people to discuss falty alliancecorp game mechanics and hopefully respond with suggestive ideas of their own the majority of the posts on this thread are constructive great however if youre going to state why not then please post your reasons hopefully ccp can sort out the logical from the illogical by the time their grand expansion comes out in march for corps to leave an alliance they should be able to whenever they please however if a corp is being kicked then a majority vote should be cast i think this would be the so called tripwire the only deviance that should be accepted is to ask yourself the question what if this thing with b0b happened to my alliance how hard would i be screwed i know my original proposition needs some more hamsters spinning the wheel of thought but hopefully more can contribute and this formulate into something definitive for ccp to implement or thoroughly hashed out so that game corpalliance mechanics remain the same
to those who think the current mechanic is fine as iswhy do you think it is fine as is what in your world of fair play suggests to you that a single person can undo an alliance instantly how does that make sense to you on any level no bob had it coming stuffthis is not about that it could happen to you just as easily why would you be ok with that how are you comfortable knowing that some few in your alliance with appropriate roles can pull the plug on all you and hundreds or thousands of others have done and worked for overnightespionage is fine corp theft is fine but one person for whatever reason and there could be many flipping 3000 people in minutes is hardly good game design i am just not seeing it so please explain how this is a good game mechanic how if you were designing a game youd make sure such a mechanic existed because it made the game better somehow
a ceo with a corp of 1300 could do exactly the same thing an alliance is structured exactly like a corporation just a tier above it as for one man destroying an entire alliance from the inside and how its fair it isnt and thats the point its not fair its not supposed to be fair if you want fair play hello kitty online i dont remember at any point in time where ccp said this game was fair if this game was fair it wouldnt be fun this is far from the worst thing ever pulled sure it was massive but definitely not the worst thats ever been done in the history of eveif it happened to my alliance then thats life or should i say thats how the game is you accepted that that is how the game is when you agreed to the eula and paid your monthly fee and if it happens to you you either strive on or you emoragequit to the tune of can i have your stuff
no need for a lecture on eve being a roughandtumble place one of the reasons i play it too and i am cool with thatas for me being emoragequit please point out where i said or implied any such thing if not then stuff that crapi am not nor have ever been on any character i run a member of bob or goon i noted above i have no personal stake in this one way or the other i have lost literally nothing over this if a dev wants to come by and tell you i have never been in bob or goon ever they have my blessing i am arguing purely from a sense that this is a bogus mechanic you have not made a case for it being a good mechanic at all saying eve is a tough place is not an argument for it maybe someone is playing football and pulls out a gun and shoots the other team to death saying football is a rough game does not make that oki am all for the dark side of eve but there has to be balance in games and that much unchecked power in the hands of a single person is too much it makes the game not fun for all of eve since we now all have to wonder if it might happen to any of us on the whim of one personand note this is more than your case of being a ceo of a big corp the alliance holds sovereignty and along with that comes a whole raft of other stuff furtheran alliance is a group of corps it is one thing for you to screw over your own people it is another for you to take other corps down with you on a whim want to take other corps down fine great evenhave at it but you should have to work for it and not make it a matter of 10 minutes of work
i didnt say you were emoragequitting just said those are the two options if i havent given a reason for why its a good mechanic in that same stance you havent given a reason for why its a bad mechanic and if you consider what you listed as reasons for a bad mechanic then those in the same breath can be used as reasons for why its a good mechanic one man with the power to screw over alot of people puts alot of stuff in perspective doesnt it as for your comment on the whim of one person that really is what eve boils down to i could be suicide ganked on the whim of another player wardecced decieved scammed etc all at the whim of one person it doesnt change as you go up or down the ladder 1 person always has the power to destroy the many in one form or another its a mechanic of persistence applicable to many situations not just one i think its a bit exciting to know that someone could go ballistic in my alliance and screw everyone over thats why i keep my stuff in npc stations
i never knew that an alliance could just be disbanded like that im surprised that the capability to disband an alliance can lie with one person seems to me that an alliance shouldnt be disbanded unless all of the member corporations leave much like closing a corporation it is active until it is empty
stupidity  game mechanicsdont give people roles they do not need
me thumbs downyou reap what you sowif your not smart enough to make sure your alliance is strong healthy and happy dont expect it to lastcountries have fallen over night no one said the member states would be left alone now did theywhat you propose would change nothing just delay the inevitableno support works as intendedits just a corporate sabotage on a macroscale you pick a stupid ceo you get a stupid event same goes for directors and what notand sorry to say this screams bias towards what took place stop crying over it herewe got better things to do if anything its disrupted the status quo and now things are getting a bit exciting in 00why the hell not i welcome the change course i would have prefered a slightly different outcome but oh well
lookthis is a game as a game it is supposed to have sensible and fair rules not fair in that no one can ever get you one way or another but fair in that you have the ability to protect yourself to turn the tables and so onimagine the world cupsuperbowl is taking place and the team captain on one team ed off because the coach chewed him out forfeits the game his choicenot a damn thing anyone else can do about it take your ball and go home youd be ok with that you think that makes sense somehowthis is an alliance you simply must consider the scale and scope of what that means it is not emptying out one corp hangar of all their ships it is not turning off the cyno jammer to one system it is not ganking one ship you are affecting literally thousands of people in a profound manner because one person decides it is a good ideait is not game balance when you have no recourse no protection it wouldnt be if it was just you and me and it especially isnt when it is thousands who get the rug yanked out from under them and not a damn thing to be done about it
love this thread so much
it would certainly make a lot of sense to have those numbers near equal
my alliance i guess could fit the bill of what this person is sniveling about membership in celes means you voluntarily agree to be racist against everything sexist vulgar anti or pro gaywe require our members to engage in the most profound forms of sexual harassment cuss like a hillbilly and generally be as politically incorrect as possiblewhy because this is a game first and foremost where we go to act out and have a good time secondly because tolerance is a lie in california for example you are actively encouraged to be gay do drugs prostitute yourself and all manner of things in the name of tolerance but if you smoke cigs you are a bloody outcast so yeah i think i have made my point feel free to report us though if you like
we deny gays rights in vawhyfor starters its a disgusting and unhealthy lifestyledont take my word for it go look at the health statistics for yourselfi dont believe tolerance is a virtue so youll have to tolerate my intolerance
its like religion we see all these christian advertisements on tv and on bilboardsyet its practically shunned to do anything like that pointing out that there is no god
i seem to remember there being slaves in this game too if you want happy happy land then you wont have to wait long for hello kitty online
you just officially made me feel stupid for forgetting the slaves drugs and prostitution which is rampant in the gallente federationxd
yup happens on a semiregular basis hereannoying yeah unless someone is persistent and being really obnoxious about it not worth getting riled up over everyone gets the occasional comment thrown their wayif you do see something that you cant ignore and the gms dont seem to care then you may want to consider sending that person an evemail some  not all but some  are reasonable and will remove the content on their own volition if they do make sure to thank them
its the internet where everybody can act like s and dont care about collateral they are untouchable
this political correctness bs has got to stop i am so sick and tired of this crapi have the freedom of speech you have the freedom not to listenyou dont have the freedom to tell me what i can and cant sayi dont have a problem with anyones way of life unless it breaks the law or directly causes problems for mineall these political correctness advocates have to much power way more than they ever should have been given and its destroying this countryyou dont have the right to tell me what or what not to say or how to live my life thats my choice you dont like it to freakin badlive and let liveits a game you dont like what you seeread then turn it offsit down shut up and hold on fly safe
this thread is pretty gay
a step up from the hulk should honestly not yeild any more the problem is not the yield amount but mining as a whole a step up from hulk would be larger cargohold and possibly a tanking bonus but no more yeild tyvm
no buy implantsplay the gamethere is enough isk drainshow can you enjoy a game if you dont even know how to play it nope it will be unfair to all players as you gametime will determine you character progression you dont need a character marked if the change is made you need an isk market oopsrich in rl  uber in eve bad for gameplay mkay
ehno
im gonna say what 99 of eve will saywow
very against idea so if u are the head of an alliance like goons and aaa u are guarenteed uber toons that u can turn around and sell or isk sellers all of a sudden have more customerstoo abusive
worst idea ever xdno wait isnt the worst one
this is a super idea thats why there is only 3 supports for this and 2 are alts oh and everything should cost 1 isk like in sisi and you start with all lvl5 skillz that would be awesome
armaggedon day was fun thou p
i never really do thisbut i cant hold myself in this case youll have to excuse meyou freaking rtard the heck were you thinking with this ive never in my entire time in eve heard something so stupid as this it would only cause the game to turn into one massive iskgrinding fest and people would stop doing anything but grinding isk in order to become better faster sheesh
unsupportedi only had to briefly scim over to know i would never support this it doesnt matter how costly it is how much of a currency sink it is it doesnt matter if you have to complete a 100 hour mission to unlock or anything else to make it difficult or content richthis is 100 against what eve has been from the beginning we play one of the few games where patience and determination are rewarded this will break that entirely the only thing that making that feature expensive will do is make the richfriends of the rich all that more powerful than they already areon that note i also 100 do not support any sort of sp liquidity once your sp are spent theyre spent reskilling is for wow
perhaps sovereignty would be better served if it was determined by the corporation rather then the allianceso a corporation can claim any space and start gaining sovereigntynow if several corporations ban together as an alliance they can combine to also form sovereigntyie  one corporation can drop 3 stations in a constellation for sov 4 or3 corporations in an alliance each one dropping a station can do the same thingalliances can also create jump bridges between there corporations just like now etc etcbut this also means if a corporation leaves the alliance the corporation keeps there sovereigntyit also means if they join a hostile alliance the lines on the map may be instantly changedthis system would give more power to the corporations as it should bealliances are corporations who decide they want to band together to create a new greater powerto take it back to the feudal system which is what 00 really iseach lord has his own estates corporation holds its own systems and stationsthe lords ban together under one king corporations ban together electing one corporation as the executor of the allianceso like any feudal system if one corporation decides to leave the alliance it doesnt forfeit its estates but rather transfers its loyalties to another alliances or flat out goes rougethis is the way 00 should be not the current system
maybe this sounds interesting but theres a lot more pressing things to change with the sovereignty system this being included at the end of the day could work but its not really worth bringing up on its own
i believe that the current foundation of the sovereignty system is the problemhaving sovereignty controlled by the alliances is flawed to the coreif sovereignty was based on corporations then pos warfare would not be the only way to take over spaceall you would have to do is get the opposing corporations to join your alliance and now your alliance has new space with long held sovereigntyalliances would be in danger from within just as much from there neighborsyou would see civil wars appear as corporations struggle for control of more territory or even for just control the allianceright now all you can do is take over someones space and you start from scratch every time you do itit makes a lot of people say why botherand i am just afraid that if ccp changes sovereignty keeping the alliances  the core even the new system will fail because it is fundamentally wrongbetter to change it now and be done with it
for great injustice  seriously nobody bothered enough by it 
after 1 year of mission grinding l3  l4 my standing with gallente fed is only 560the reason this goddamn storyline mission materials for war prepi used to get it 80 of the time perhaps morethe rewards are a bloody insult to the work i put in to get acces to a storyline
thumbs downit isnt the tracking formula it is the tohit formula it encompasses everything and no its not realistic its not supposed to be its only supposed to be balancedthe changes to webs fixed a game balance issue ship size imbalances and you wish to reverse it and unbalance it again arguing about realism get over it
you are splitting up range and tracking or rather hit formulathe closer you are inside optimal the worse for you because potential transversal grows you have to keep in mind this balance it does not matter that your damage potential is the same inside optimal there is alway same hit chance affected by rangethus if your optimal and your tracking do not match you are always getting a damage reduction even if you are in optimal because you have less tracking than you needthe proposal only fixes this reduction based on transversal as the growth in effective sig would in part negate the transversal increase this enables you to be up close withou needed 3 webs and still hit wellpulse lasers are actualy not important in this discussion as they have the longest possible optimal of all the short range guns so they should have the lowest tracking and dpsid argue that acs need the best dps given their short optimal shortest of the bunch blasters 2nd and pulses last same with tracking speedbut this is up to discussion i admit i dont have all the details worked out i still need a lot of math and graph work
you completely missed the point of what i was saying yes i know that higher angular velocity is worse than lower angular velocity in an absolute sensethe point i was trying to make is that the tracking advantage of blaster verses pulse laser is significant you as a blaster fitting pilot could try going for a near 100 chance to hit but then your opponent fitting pulse lasers would also have a near 100 chance to hitto use your tracking advantage you need to give up a bit of your eft specified damage your tracking advantage gives you the option to give up 25 of your dps to take away 50 of your opponents dps push things a bit faster so that you are giving up 50 of your dps and your opponent will have lost 75 of hisunless you are shooting at a pos you should not expect to hit for 100 dps anywaysevery type of turret is important to this discussion as all are affected by the hit forumlawhen i see a forumal that gives a siegemode dreadnought a 100 chancetohit against a maxspeed intercepter orbiting at 500m i say bad idea or did i misread his proposed forumal max1 1exprange2000  05   trackingpenalty  sigpenalty  2  optimalpenalty  falloff  falloff  2as a fotenote i am note entirely certain that blastersac are fully and properly balanced however if there is a balancing problem it is a lot more subtle then the op makes it out to be regardless of there being a problem or not i am certain that the above forumla is not workable nor is the approach taken by the op to make a realistic game mechanic desirable if anyone still believes that there is a problem with the balance of blastersac i would suggest that he write up a detailed case showing why they are unbalanced dont worry about finding a solution to the problem ccp has stated that they dont need the csm to propose solutions just raise issues
shameless bump then well wait another year and see what happens
i prefer the existing ideas that ccp has said they are working on specifically to either impose a higher entrance requirement on alliances to enter fw or to allow individual corps to join fw possibly with a higher standing requirement without having to abandon their allianceyour suggestion continues to lock rp alliances our of the rp war weve been fighting since long before fw was a twinkle in a devs eyesorry t 2 but not signed
jsut the sov part is enough imho gaining soverngty over a patch space therefore becoming a sovering entity yourself and then going and claiming alligeance to another nation is contradictorylike becq said the other condition basicly locks out people that have not been in militia
ccp still plans to have alliances in fw its just that theyre very busy on apocrypha as we all understandwhen they introduce alliances it is likely that there will be a standing requirement so that only serious corpsalliances will be allowed entry
what about the compromise shirley posted earlier lvl4 basics lvl1 advanced trim some sp from other starting skillsthat way those that want to invest in the long term can still do so but people in the trial account can experience more of the fun stuff before committing to the waiting game
the point is and ill keep this post short so that you understand it that there may be a choice but it is a mortons fock neither option is an equality of good vs bad both options result in disappointment for a new player
i saw it and i might think about something along those lines the problem is thats not what this thread is proposing the proposal in question is the total elimination of learning skills leaving no alternative and to that i firmly point my thumbs down if shirley starts a thread i will be one of the first to support it 
probably and that is why most of the things you mention will be mended this year so again why keep a feature that scare away new players eve will still be unique even if learning skills were left out
not true only the avatars the interface will probably always be extreme there will never be a way to grind exp and as far as i know the learning curve is still pretty ridiculousso i dont know what youre talking about this is more than just some random option as ive said its part of a dichotemy that shouldnt be tampered with without a real solution ive heard one or two promising compromises the ops suggestion however is not one and thats the cause for my dissent
kill learning refund skillpoints give me gallente battleship 5 i like this idea and so should you
pylonnuke em could care less about my sp i lost a couple of rl friends when they realized that they would be behind if they didnt train learning skills
remove the skills are completely pointless they essentially force you to decide if youre going to be playing the game for more than x amount of time
signed
im agent unknown and i approve this message
glad someone here can see reasoni reiterate you want learning skills removed remove them they dont need a supplement get rid of the skills get rid of the attribute points that go along with them dont replace learning skills with free attributes everyone gets to train as slow as everyone else
no i dont want my time being wasted by training them i trained them a long time ago it didnt bother me i just trained up for a certain ship then trained learning skillsas i was flying my new ship my learning skills were training its a question of wether the noobs can be bothered training them or notthe learning skills help to train faster in the long run therefore training the skills you want to train fastereve isnt supposed to be easy alot of people started off this way why should it be any different
so your reasoning is because i suffered everyone else should too 
dont worry there are others if you read back ive been argueing with these people all day they need to just merge this thread with this thread then they can all play wow together
its a tradeoff thats up to the player you could train something other than learning skills at the start like i did then when the larger skills came up i trained a few up relative to what i needed to shave some time off its not like its killing you to train up the t1 skills to 4 anyway and the only thing that really holds people back from the t2 is pricein short leave them be theyre fine
well yeah noobs have to make their own isk just like everyone elseso why shudnt they have to train the learning skills like we all didnoone forces them to train them straight away its their choice wether they train them or notalso all the while i was training learning skills i was paying so yeh i wud rather not waste 12 months money for nothing
thats right i recently started a corp and brought 7 people into the game i told them all about learning skills from the beginning only one of them used it in his overall skill plan one other uses them sporadically and they are all playing happilythe myth that all new players will be driven away bychoices is utterly insane
no one ever said all nice attempt at a strawman though
i am in ur threadsyou told me dont derail themi did anyway
while youre at it why dont we just remove all other skills so anyone can fly anything and use anything within 1 dayor howabout everyone who wants to train the learning skills can train as fast as nearly everyone else
your sarcasm isnt really an extension of my own as its a blatant disregard a better comparison would be we remove all skills but no one is able to fly the ships anyways since everyone wants the skills gone and a modifier added to the baseline in place of the skillsyou second one is a bit better but it makes it sound like you think i actually think this is a good idea there are benefits to learning skills im just trying to be fair and say if you want em removed then dont try and supplement them with something else nice one though
i already made my official argument a few hours ago if youd like to rebut thati dont need a strawargument you dont have any hard numbers on players turned away by learning skills anyway nice try at being clever though
i see youre still around bumping my thread to keep it on page one for more support thank you
or for less support
im staying active on here because im a voice of dissentyour idea is stupid and would severely cripple a feature of eve plenty of people like and use i wont just sit here and ignore that
theres been hmm 3 or 4 people speak against it vs 47 supportingseems like more people like it than dont vov guess its not such a stupid idea
personally i think you are spamming this thread with incoherent rambling because you are an idiot troll ideahow about we stop feeding him especially kalryan your thread can survive without such vigorous defense
try 9 not including myself want to play the numbers game here is a thread that doesnt even propose a game change that has over 1000 supports and i doubt it will even matter muchi dont care how many people and alts support your stupid idea its a stupid idea and i will continue to argue against it
lol yeah removing a month of not training anything interesting would cripple eve and make it horrible to play 
no  idiot you did not read my previous postsbut instead of linking or explaining them ill just point out you dont have to train them all at once and they are optional
uh people arent required to train it all it would do is remove options not requirements
supporting ops post learning skills can be established at character creation not by wasting time and isk training them in a game where you are trying to gain skills suited to your career path
ok i think we need to get to the root of the problem here first because it seems people are demanding 2 things as if you cant have one without the otherfirst off ok you dont likewant to train learning skills because its a timesink even though its a timesink that makes other skills less of a timesink so it basically nullifies itself out to being beneficial instead of a sink like putting isk into physicals assets that appreciate over time youre spending the isk and not seeing any returns on it until later in the future as an investmentbut well just say learning skills are a stupid timesink that no one should have to do alright thats settledsoooo where does this attribute boost come from this is a completely separate issue especially considering it would be far more fair and balanced to not give anyone an attribute bonus to replace learning skills so either youre asking for a replacement or a removal of this skills a determination which needs to be made but why give the boost lets just make this simple drop the learning skills done everyone now trains at a relatively similar rate minus implants and everyone should be happy yes timesink learning skills are gone new players arent forced into training learning skills first anymore this is a win win situation but apparently 2 isnt enough and we want a 3rd win of getting attribute points this is like having your cake and eating it too with another one on the table and is excessive to say the leastso whats the justification for the points everyone trains faster how is that relevant or necessary considering most advocates for this want it to be fair and remove the timesink so its fair to new players not being behind older players and the learning skill timesink is gone but whats this cries of outrage that all skills now take longer to learn since were running on base attributes well thats a sacrifice to be made you wish to take away what is a choice not a requirement so now everyone has to take longer to train all their skills in this scenario the wasteful timesink of learning skills doesnt sound like so much of a waste anymore does itpersonally i dont advocate the removal of the learning skills people just need to be better educated about them but if they removed them i would be wholeheartedly against an attribute boost in its place so if theyre gone then thats it everyone gets to take longer to train everything end of story
other than a complete arbitrary it should be done this way because it makes a proposal i dont like look worse answer the why behind not boosting the base attributes after removing learning skillsedit for more relevance the entire point of removing the learning skills is its a huge timesink of a skill that discourages newer players removing them and then not boosting attributes leaves us in the same position more or less your arguement has no merit
not supporting this unless its guaranteed we get an sp refund me and many others did take the time to train advanced learning to 5 that takes a long time and is a real investment in the future and im not letting that go to waste just because some people get bored easily i do agree the learning skills were a bad call from the start though
i love training skills that dont let me flydo anything newits just so exciting
learning skills had me within a hair of not playing after the first 10 days theyre a horrible terrible mechanic when youre trying to get new people interested in evegive everyone 44 basic  adv learning skills at the start and call it a wash let the bitter vets cry salty salty tears
from shc
normally i would offer to champion this issue but it was discussed in iceland off the agenda as part of our discussion regarding the skill queue and its already on the drawingboard and being looked at raising it as an issue at this time would be pointless as ccp are already discussing this and other options including the other topic currently active in assembly hall regarding the learning skills
thats good news
i fully supporta removal of learning skillsb giving everyone 10 to all base attributesc refunding each pilot an amount of skillpoints equal to what heshe had invested in learning skills
id take it you dont read dev blogs and patch notesthey have a team working on the gui they have for the last expansions enhanced the tutorial introduced welcoming pages and other things to lessen the learning curve for new players but i guess thats just as bad as removing other dull and stupid elements such as learning skills
as someone you manages 700 apps a month i can tell you only 30 of them people will remain in eve my brother  i have had a lot of experience with newbies  learning skills are one of the main reasons they quit the game they need to go away give everyone 8 to there chars  erase the skills
this is good to know thank you oz learning skills should never have been put into the game in the first place but now that they are here currently i think there should be some smooth way to withdraw them and streamline the new player experience a little better the learning skills were the most unfun portion of the game to me back when i started i brought three people into the game with me and we all used to complain about the learning skills when we were hanging outmore noobs to the fire theyre all the same under my guns
i think this game would be way better without them to the point that if that meant losing the sps i had invested in them then regardless i still think they should go
totally agreed and even if only for sympathy ill support this thread learning skills are horror as much as pos warfare and implementation of capsupercaps specially titans a big mistakeps i would even go agaisnt implants but thats an other issue
why dont you just give everyone every single skill to lvl 5 that way noobs will be able to anything yay for noobs doing anything within the first few days seriously vets trained the learning skills and we are still here only the lazy noobs leave the game bcos its too hard
kill them with fire and then throw the ashes into the sun
i look at the learning skills like modern day educationi can choose to go out into the world with a high school diploma or your equivalent and get a crapppy job or i can invest in the huge time and money sink of a university and when i get done get a much better joband like eve i dont have to do all the learning at once i can go to a junior college for two years and then go to work for a couple of years to get practical experience then i go back to school for another two years and get a four year degree and then go back to work finally i can get an advanced grraduate degree and then again go back to workeve is the same way i can spend some time training my learning skills then train the nonlearning skills to gain experience then go back for more learning skillsadditionally if youre working on rank 1 or 2 skills at level 1 2 or maybe 3 the difference between having a learning skill trained and not having them trained can be measured in minutes if not seconds so the idea that new characters need them is ludicrous to begin with you wont need them until youre ready to start trainng rank 4 or 6 skills anywayit would be more effective to tell people to stop giving noobs bad advice on when they need to train these skillsnot supported
there is a major flaw if ccp was to refund people training skill timeif persona only trained learning skills for the first few weeks without training anything else its clear how much they can be refundedhowever personb trains learning and other needed skills back and forth his break even point is much farther out than persona with rough numbers it has been proven and shown that if two people both have lvl 4 in all learning skills one of those people then train the basic learnings to lvl 5 they both will reach the same ammount of sp in a few months time the break even point for training the adv learning skills from 4 to 5 are a little over 2 years if i remembered correctlyso long post short if your seeing if eve is for you you dont necessarily have to train the learning skills one can just train the attributes they are seeking gun and ship skills for example to enhance their game play however if they know how much or how long they want to play it would be a good investment to train in the learning skillswhat can not be seen is that if you do train the learning skills in a few months time you will have more sp minus the sp from learning skills than if you didnt train them
support
great idea the learning skill grind is a horrible thing that new players have to go through and im sure its resulted in a lot of people quitting i know i nearly did and i put it off as long as possiblenuke them entirely or give everyone maxed learning skills whatever just take them out of the game
exactly this
this big timebut dont expect the op to have the iq to understand such things as rationality and discernmentits like talking to concrete
how cute another realworld analogy that doesnt apply to a gamealso keep insulting my intelligence guys it makes me laugh
i know im a glutton for punishmentthann starlinbowi think youre misunderstanding my point i didnt have to train those skills i could have just left well enough alone by choosing to train them i accelerated my overall training plan was it fun meh  fun is a subjective measurement to a lot of people mining isnt fun but they do it because its profitable so was training the learning skills if you dont find them profitable dont train them
i realize what youre saying however that doesnt make them any less unnecessary if they were removed from the game and everyones base attributes boosted it results in the same outcome minus the i have to train learning skills part which a lot of people find boring and dullwhat part of that is badand please dont come back with choicez its not a real choice
i still dont see the argument behind boosting everyones base attributes tbh at one point there were no advanced learning skills so why not just boost by 5 at one point there were no learning skills so why boost at all if youre going to remove them your logic is you want to train faster without having any sort of work that goes into it
no simply no
am i awake did we just go back in time to 2004
worst idea ever i quit eve in 2004 because of this
bad idea this will make the m in mwd mean mandatory again
why should ccp make it easier for you to shoot me down in low sec isnt it your job to make it easier for you to shoot me downnot supported
terrible idea i do not want to go back to having to fly x km every time i warp to a gate making travel take even longer than it already doessupport denied
full support increase the scattering from 2500 to 15km and make eve seem big againit would lessen the pressure on jita make blobs alot slower make scattering increase for bigger fleets bonus for smaller ones depending on skills and generally improve fleet combatcons are that blasterships and stations would need serious loooove to prevent nerfing to blasters and mad bumps at stationsedit by a increase in scattering the instas would be useless as it raises the risk of you ending up even further from the gate
i hope ccp will take note of what happened to bob and implement some fix to stop a disgruntled director form killing an alliance as easily as it was done what solution could be implemented to made what happened to bob more difficult to doyour ideas below
i dont see anyone ing when say a hisec empire corp gets cleaned out because the ceo gave too much power to one who couldnt be trusted why should 00 alliances be exempt from this
what happened to bob has left a power vacuum but thats the way eve is i lost over a billion isk from a highsec gank a week ago but thats also what happens eve is rough and thats one of the appeals as thats how new products get sold
corp theft is one thing this is a whole other it is like comparing someone stealing your tv to russia taking over the us in one night because the president got ed and pulled the plug world of differenceganks are fine as a concept espionage is fine theft is fine a single persononehaving such power is game unbalancinganyone in any alliance is at risk of this perhaps it never occurred to anyone before but it has now anyone in an alliance has to now wonder if all they have done might go poof because one guygal gets a bug up their butt about something or otherbob got caught under current mechanics seemingly fairandsquare fine but ill bet dollars to dimes ccp plugs this particular mechanic in the near futurebtwalready another and longer thread on this here
while i dislike what was done it is hard seeing how it can be fixed1 director ejecting corporations from the alliance it is a needed mechanic but it can be abused like in this situation it cant be limited by a alliance wide corporation vote or some similar mechanic2 director closing the allianceok this is a bug it should be limited to the ceo of the executor corp but it would have changed almost nothing all the other corps would have been outside the alliance with all the negative effects
maybe it needs a secure mode the approvation of half the director of executor corp for example or just 23 something to prevent the fool action of a singleanyway i agree with op
im with bunyip on this one a fine comparison he has made
the events in delve indicate a material weakness not only in the corporate user interface but more importantly in the way corporations and alliances workthe dissolution of an alliance should either happen as the result of a voting process or by individual corporations opting to remove themselves from the alliance the decision to dissolve an alliance should be made on the ceo level and not on the director level in the case of the normal eb and flow of the existence of an alliance director input is of course of vital importance this is not an argument against directorsthis attack on band of brothers was masterfully executed by the goonswarm who made expert use of the game mechanics it should stand by all means however it should never have been this easyjoining an alliance is a conscious collective decision it should not be possible to undo it by the acts of an individual agentthis is not an argument against corporate theft or highlevel alliance intrigue these are what make new eden such a rich and daunting place to reside in it is the thought process behind corporatealliance mechanics that needs an overhaul along with the user interfaceabulurd bonifaceme meceo
ccp has asked csm to discuss this topic so any and all input is appreciated before the meeting on sunday
i suppose that the best compromise between speed and security is to request the approval of the ceo alone or 2 directors to expel an alliance memberfor disbanding an alliance the approval of the majority of the executor corporation shareholders should be required it would require some better system for the management of the corporation shares forced buy back from leaving members that can be a big problem but i see little need for a rapid closure of a alliance so speed dont seem the most important factor edit support to the discussionfurther editif the ejection of a corporation from the alliance require the approval of 2 director it should have a time limit and a cancel option from the ceo to avoid situations where a disgruntled director can start the procedure against several corporations and the leave it pending forever note that the ceo would not need a second director to approve his action for a simple reason he can always nominate a new director so this limitation would not have effects on him
i really dont understand why people are so aghast at a single person changing the patch of an alliance all it takes to destroy a nation in rl is a single person the second world war was started by a single person and a single politician drove germany down a dark and bloody routeeve is a cruel and unforgiving place it is not ment to be any easier and rl if it was there would be no suicide ganking corporate thefts would not happen and scamming would be banned i do however fully support an overhaul of the corporate ui which is quite frankly horrible total pain to preform almost the simplest of tasks and very easy to miss the details i love the way the roll fields stretch wider that most of ccps user screens  theres also the question of how much power is actually needed for individual tasks a director no questions asked should be a powerful position the problem is rolls are currently bundled together under one umbrella mostly and given how poor the ui is its often easier to simply press the director button rather than attempt negotiating those windows pos fuel technician was introduced to help alleviate some of the strain of pos fuelling which previously fell only to directors the same with pos gunners but still some of the simplest things eg the ability to createedit titles require directors rolls i think the real question though is improving the corporate ui part of the planned ui improvementsrewrite ccp have mentioned several times in past dev blogsposts and more over will there be a review of the rolls alogne side it can we please please have a simple visual indicator of which member has what rollspowers rather than the horrid horizontal checkbox listing that stretches beyone so many users screens
as i said before you reap what you sowno one said anything was fair in this gameadapt or gtfoalthough i agree overhaul of the corp ui is needed but a fix to the mechanics no
wwi was started by one person sort ofif you want to extend your analogy goons are one country and bob another their leaders steered them down a dark and bloody route and they took to beating the snot out of each other great all well and good in eve if rl was like eve in this case then basically winston churchill would have decided he was ticked about something or other and handed all the british ships and planes over to the germans turned off all their radar and listening posts shut down their large ship industry and dissolved parliament and the country and all that in about 20 minutes of workit does not make sense in rl or the game and yeah i know comparing to two is dodgy procedure around here but works for illustration purposes
screw it death to bob 
bob is not special bob is not special bob is not specialthis has happened before to other alliances
yeahand it should have been fixed then that does not mean it shouldnt be fixed now
theres nothing wrong with the mechanics dont give ultimate authority to someone you cant trust
everyone has their price and history books are replete with instances of people who were thought to be trustworthy going turncoatif you have a magic trustometer we can use share it otherwise this is still a bad mechanic
so what youre saying is because someone can be bought out and do a lot of damage ccp should change the game mechanics to limit the damage hell no these are the kind of things that make eve interesting and unique this event even gave ccp free advertisement in the form of an article on slashdot
alliance interface needs tightening up to prevent this happening to othersalliance security is more vital since the introduction of sovereignty but has not being upgradedi propose that alliance structure is altered from having 1 exec corp to having multiple exec corpexec corp have 1 vote each on issues affecting the allianceissues which require majority vote includeaddition of member corpremoval of member corppromotion of member corp to exec statusdemotion of member corp to associate  standard  statusdissolution of allianceeach director of each exec corp gets a vote which in turn decides the vote cast by the exec corp as a wholei think this is a way of implementing an alliance system that does not place excessive power in 1 players handswhat has happened to bob will happen to othersesp now that this mechanic is so widely knownwhen it has happened 10 times are people gonna bother with the ingame alliances mechanics anymoreor are ig alliances just gonna be limited to secure alt alliances for supercap production etcwith the real alliance being maintained through mutual standing and oog means as before the introduction of the alliance mechanics in the first placekind of means all the work done on the ig alliance system was in vain and alliance systems just becomes a burden that needs to be negotiated via metagamingwhatever happens something needs to changea director should only have enough power to betray those who have placed trust in him  his corp mates corporations of an alliance place there trust in an exec corp not in an individual member of the exec corptherefore at a minimum it should require the betrayal of a majority of the members of an exec corp to bring down an alliance not 1 player
it is not a lot of damage it is complete damage scorched earth they went from a multicorp 3000 player alliance to noalliance in a matter of minutes there is no check there is no balance there is no undoing it eve has always been about letting players at least have some option or means to protect themselves they may get outplayed they may get tricked and that is fine but thisthere is no way to stop it any person with similar roles in an alliance anywhere in eve can dissolve their alliances right now they can do it so fast even if the ceo is online it is doubtful that person could be stopped before it was doneagain not a good gameplay mechanic
you really need to rethink your position if you think losing a name is scorched earthwhat did bob really lose in this whole thing sov some dreads and a little isk and a namethe real damage in this entire affair has been pride plain and simple with the sov damage a close secondno ones account got deleted their pos are still in placethis is not the big deal you are trying to make it out to be yes it stings but its hardly the end of the world even the bob members are saying as muchstop rabblerousing
youre missing the point we are talking about a game mechaniccan you name any mmo where a single person can wield this much power unchecked power at that where one person can wtfpwn a 3000 person alliance with the press of a buttonon what planet does that make any sense at all
seconded moreover it is even inconsistent with other game mechanics it takes 24 hours to declare or stop a war it takes 24 hours after someone has dropped all roles from a corp to expel them from a corporation it takes 24 hours of being without ties to another corporation before they can be allowed into another it even takes 24 hours before a corporations addition to an alliance comes into effectapparently an alliance can be disbanded by a single director without approval or cooperation from any other executive in the alliance an action that has such dramatic consequences on the ongoing operations of thousands of individuals is mere administration by a single agentthis mechanic is flawed the design of the interface is so poorly conceived that it cannot assign limits to responsibilities for executive officers which in the new eden universe is nothing short of amazing naivety at the same time someone with the role of personnel manager whose job it ostensibly is cannot even remove a person from the corporationat the very least the other executive officers and the ceo and in this case the alliance chain of command should be notified of this kind of activity and have an option to reverse itwhy the interface was not designed with these checks and balances builtin is ours to ponder but it bespeaks a limited understanding of how the functionality should be implemented to serve the needs of an alliance that is building a lasting presence in a persistent universeabulurd bonifaceme meceo

please read the csm minutes its being discussed
theyre aware of the issue with interbus and i hammered on it quite a lot personally
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
well i can sympathize and it does not deserve a ban but pretty unintelligent thing to do just the same
first off dropping tons and tons of ships on a grid does create lag so youre dumb secondly youre further dumb for posting the communication from a gm which is forbidden on these forums thirdly this really isnt a matter for the csmin short get out
youre not going to get any support from the community for dumping a 100 ships in a busy systemfind a less obtrusive way to recruit andor assist new players
tell me one
maybe try using a little of this plus a tiny bit of this and plenty of this and this if you think about it i am sure that you can figure it outyou also have this ingame option

much argument about removal of the learning skillsperhaps a compromiseso as not to shaft players who have recently started change new character starting skills to lvl4 basics lvl1 advanced learnings at the cost of reducing the amount of lvl4 and lvl5 skills that new chars start with possibly by a greater amount than you give the learningseg 800k sp is what new chars start with6 basic learnings  lvl4  6x 45255 sp  271530sp5 adv learnings  lvl1  5x 750  3750sptotal in learnings  275280speven if starter total was reduced to 700k or 600k i think there would be plenty left for enough skills to have fun withthis should allow new chars to advance their skills reasonably quickly so as to be able to do more fun stuff in the early gameeg as is what happens with new playershelp my capacitor empties too quicklytrain energy systems operation to help thatnow with low attributes energy systems operation 1 takes nearly 20 minutes say to learnwith higher attributes it only takes 10 or lessso a new player can then get back into their game and play sooner rather than wait which is most important in early gameplay in getting people hooked and signing upnow you can still make the choice to invest more into the learning skills but its not such a stark choiceit also does not heavily penalise those players who made the decision to invest more into the learning skills training them to va change of 275k sp is not a big dealeve has plenty of long waits in the higher gameplay is it too much to ask that you dont expose new players to the waiting game before you show them the fun stuff and get them hooked
no learning skills are optional i can understand maybe letting them put their 800k starter into learning skills to the exclusion of the ship starter skills but that wouldnt be a good idea because then they wouldnt be able to do anything
i didnt bother to read your wall of text it contained maths and lots of wordseasy fix start everyone with all learning skills trained to 4 refund some moneys to bitter vets problem fixt

sounds like an issue with your computer first thing id guess is video drivers has you updated them sir
snip cranky im asking this because i have tried absolutely everything thus far im waiting for a ccp response if they dont treat this like every problem they have  ignore it rather than helpps sorry to the genuine trolls but im going to be ignoring everything except blue posts from here id offer to stroke it for you but i simply am too busy
heres a stupid suggestion for you go to the right board you appear a bit slow so ill help you out by providing the linkage

the title says it allwith tech 3 right around the corner now is as good a time as any to end the unfair advantage that older corps have with tech 2 bposwhy because it unbalances the game and gives certain corporations an unfair advantage over others because invention works and there is no reason to keep this older system going onbecause i dont have any what do you all think 
how did issler even get on the csm anyways
by the time honored process called voting
they do appear a little pointless on the face of it  why not just make the main skills a little longer to train  i ask myselfi must admit that im not actually bothered by them an the handy little evemon tool tells you when its a good time to train one so they are no real hinderancelike the original post says it would be annoying to have new players in the game that instantly have learning skills of 5im not sure its a problem ccp can or even need to solve its a mild annoyance at worst to me
i cant really see why anybody sees a problem with learning skills im glad that ive got my 13m sp from which 2m are learning skills i am now after a few months of playing learning my charisma adv skill to 4 maybe ill take the rank1 to 5 dun know its all my choice someone could chose not to make skills that high all except charisma i got 5 rank 1 and 4 adv skills that was a pretty long time you know but i didnt train them as a start first i trained some small skills to be able to fly a cruiser and use some basic dronesi know that now id love to have those learnings skills all at 55 but it was a choiceif all noobs got 55 learning skills instantly it would be a great hit for all other players 2m 3m sp in learnings would have to be transfered to other skills at the same time youd have to give the older players all the sp that they would get if they had all skills at 55 from the beginning those are tons of data to process and its pretty pointlesslearnings skills are sort of a basis of the entire system you can also live without cybernetics skill without implants but its good to have it again its your choice that when you die you lose 70m or more in implant value
and there you go folks the goons have gimped the csm process everything they do is done to fk over the eve population when oh when are you dolts going to wake up
as per ccp request alliance executor mechanics to be added to the agenda
bumpya with all the bob petitions i suspect ccp is still not able to spare the time
opps you did say next not this week patience young one patience
exactly
i heard somewhere that bob went down because someone from goonswarm got hold of a director level login for eve and removed all of the corps from the alliance and then did something else to do with the towers that meant that after downtime the sov was gonesounded like a shallow victory but they went about it in a very well thought out way so i guess you could say that they were skilled in their executionnot sure i understand it as i am probably too new to the game to understand the ins and outs of how all that works
precisely right it seems rkz was a backup alliance with at least 1 pos in each of those systems very clever move
oh my god if you change your name youll possible lose all your internet rephow am i suppose to hate some internet dude that might of quit and sold his character if he changes his name aaaaaaaaaaaa
i dont know the story about why they dont exist but im going to assume it goes with the nature of the gamebut i was thinking what if there was a name change log similar to employment history that way you can see he was named bill from 1010 to 1012 and in the corp stewie from 1010 to 1011 so he is obviously a spy scammer or etc
minmatar needs a changethose three things i would like to be changed1 minmatar is the speed  agility race and yet there are some ships from other races that are lighter and faster eg compare claw mass to crusader crusader ends with more speed and more agility in the end2 you can tracking disrupt falloff with range scripts but you cannot boost it with tracking enhancer using a ranges script serious flaw in design3 the bs line of minmatar is the weakest ingame in my opinion the phoon is nice but it uses drones and missiles the less base dmg of ammo and falloff mechanis makes it worse i think the falloff mechanis needs a change the dmg drop should not be linear and the large ammo could need a raise by 1 point of dmg change point 1  2 and i think those bs will be much better then
i suportsince i just cross trained minimitar and had a maelstrom now
please guys when you support a thread click on the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on tick box above the post reply button
yeah but looks like this thread doesnt need supportnor ppl wanna support it
i like your sig la vista let our voices be heard yet again and this time present it not as the funky pos thing but as the dead horse pos thread and really talk about it again i dont mind if you guys bring it back 10 times it just shows that maybe ccp should reconsider it since so much of the community is interested in it
here is an idea we will get it eventually just let ccp finish what they have already promised first ambulation has been in the works for too long as has some other thingspos do need a renovation but they were not promised to us they can wait dont worry they will come eventually but let ccp catch up with their mile long to do list abit first
eggsbreadtoliet papersockssockssocksbeeroh sorry i was out of paper and was making my grocery listi have to agree with this dudedirectors should not be allow to kick corps nor should ceo be alow to kick corpsit must be voted upon also directors should not be allow to kick members nor should ceo be allow to kick membersit must be voted uponalso random people shouldnt be appointed as directorsit must be voted uponalso random people shouldnt be able to start corpsit must be voted uponalso you shouldnt be allow to postit must be voted uponeverything must be a voted upon
i do believe this was an oversight by cpp
but itd be prettier  not gay
the freedom of speech does not mean freedom from judgment if the freedom is allowed for someone to make a hateful comment on a group of people based on really bad logic and incorrect statistics the learned in a sermon but waves the flag that they are tolerant then someone else has just as much right to cal them a hateful ignorant bigot and vice versahowever ccp determine what is or is not allowed if someone has a problem with policy or implementation i would contact them directly instead of the forums
the problem is the gay community equivocates to oppose homosexuality means youre homophobicof course equivocation is a fallacy but hey  this is the politics of sexual moralitypersonally there should be no sexual references as far as im concerned in this game such a prohibition affects heterosexuals as well as homosexuals however without such a prohibition you are going to get people such as the op expressing a preference  and others pointing out that such a preference is immoralthis is freedom of speech
the problem is the op is posting in the wrong forum
ummm get over yourself get on with your life stop acting like a victim you wont get anywhere unless you stop acting like the world is out to get you you dont like what someone writes dont read it anymore
bad idea
rich players get rich faster new players learn frig iv a bit fasterrich player gives alt 1bil alt trains for rnd agents and uses money he earns to maximize him self rich player now has two awesome chars and uses them to make 4 awesome chars and so on broke eve
way op id agree to pay isk for accelled sp gain so that the rich cant make cap pilot accounts in aday say for instance a 15 duration on skills for 100mill per 30 days again would be a nice isk sink and limit people from ubering up so fast or you could have it split up slightly like 20mill gets you 3 40mill gets 6 and so on
since ccp threw out ghost training cause they want money might as well just throw money at them to get a few months of training done so i dont have to be bored and drunk as much if ccp does this change they could help stop my liver disease
it would just increase the gap between the uber and the newbies even more unless there was a restriction on how much sp you could buy per month
so would putting down the bottle once in a while but thats a personal problem and not worth breaking the game overno matter how much you make this cost no matter how much you trim it down no matter how low you make the acceleration rates this will kill eve the alts that have been in game for years will suddenly have six or seven alts with nothing but level 5 skills sell those for isk wash rinse repeat pretty soon everyone in the game will have all level 5 skills and at the point why playemphatically unquestionably not supported
look at how dumb you areright now youre already paying for the skills just right now you have to be there to click the stuff the gap between new players and old players is very extreme in all honestly i think they need to make it so clones could only hold up to 40mil skill points that would be a better solution but this would anger to many people letting people buy up to say the 20mil skill point mark wouldnt be that big of a deal and forcing them to watch their skills slowly train after that
seems to be a resounding noand i agree this will destroy evepeople who have been with the game for years have earned their place to fly the bigger ships people who cant better start training and stop complaining that it will take them too longedit this idea is gay
i like this idea sovereignty needs a good reworking and this could help it drastically supported and ill champion this idea at the next csm meeting
cool idea
im sure you agree to almost everything on here bunyip  but it sounds like a good idea to me
i suppose its not a bad idea wander how this would affect server load  prolly only at downtime
00 revamp coming next on ccps list after apo possibly after ambulation possibly beforebut it has been saidor at least i think it has been by ccp that the big sov 00 all encompassing revamp is coming next either after apoch or ambulation not sure which but it has been saidcase closed
keeping this on the front page until dev blog appears
for those of you that werent watching the alliance tournament coverage a ccp employee apparently thought wed be excited to hear that hey whenever you lose a tech 3 ship you lose a tk3related skill level i detect high levels of timesink in this sector captainplease dont jerk us around ccp if you want to keep us in the game do it by releasing engaging new content and not by utilizing copout mechanics like this one to keep people perpetually training the same skills over and over does anyone else take issue with this mechanic
if this is true its a terrible mechanic
im reserving judgement till some details hint ccp dev b is released
this
utill more details are released on t3 i will have to say the losing sp mechanice is lame and not needed
provide a link to any proof that you didnt simply pull this out of your rearedit alright then  i totally disagree with the mechanic supporting the tentative resistance to it
whats there to wait to hear its a cheesy timesink
i highlighted the problem we dont actually know anything other then that you lose skillpoints from certain set of skills what i would vote for is clarification on the mechanics since i have a hard time seeing ccp adding skillsinks to a game that already takes decades to max your skills inwe need trustworthy info from ccp not more speculation on the little info we have
respectfully you dont make any sense youre questioning whether its true a ccp employee said it he said you lose skilllevels from the tk3 related skills when you lose ships provided the ships dont spew isk out their exhaust ports or have sixteen highslots and hardpoints im not sure what will balance out this irritating mechanic
at fanfest iirc they talked about a system of experience for the techiii ships exp lost when ship destroyedrepackaged perhaps this is itthe ship train a specific skill and you lose it along with the ship
well after this im pretty sure ive had it with the entire notion of t3 they werent even able to pump out ambulation in 2008 like they originally planned quantum rise was a joke and honestly considering the host of other fixes the game needs obscenely expensive t3 ships just seems sillyid rather have the option to introduce basic color patterns and paintjobs to ships before t3 xx
donotwant
the problem i see here is that it makes no sense for us to have to lose sp for losing one of these ships they are going to be very difficult and time intensive to get or expensive because of the time people put into them isnt that enough of a loss whenif you get popped i was excited for the t3 but if im going to be losing my sp then im not interested however im still interested to hear ccps discussion and comments on this issue i impatiently   await your dev blog on this monday morning hint hinteditif this is what we lose then i can live with that i would find it pretty neat if we gained extra exp on our ship for each successful engagement but lose that when we lose that ship as long as i dont lose my ability to use large gunslaucnherswhatever module i trained a long time to train
this i just hope it wont be too late
i recall a old spaceship game from fasa where if you were using the same ship and you scored kills with it you would learn the individuals ship strength and weakness becoming capable of better redlining it for maneuverabilityif it is something like this getting extra sp tied to the ship you are using and losing them when the ship is destroyed or repackaged it can be reasonable but i want to stress the extra part something over and above what you get from regular training
yes and ccp chronitis or whatever the hell his name is implied that well have to retrain our own skills when we lose a tk3 shiplame
if this is true then risk v reward is throughn out window examplea player in t3 ship enages a lets say mael mael calls backup they gank t3 ship you loose billoins of isk and sp gankers gain isk and gain the enjoyment of making someone loose sp without catchin there pod risk v reward broken as gankers will loose nothing yet gain alott3 ship enages a lone mael mael has no backup and looses t3 ship pilot gains maybe 50100 mill yet could loose sp  billions of iskrisk v rewards there for brokenccp rethink what you are doing o and another thing for risk v reward is missionersthey have isk to buy t3 ships they fit and buy they mission reward no risk you carnt gank these in high sec since they will be to overpowered with concord on there side it would be like ganking a titan in high sec with concord on its sidethis feature is very very bad thought through and who ever made it should be fired right nowsigned for getting rid of it if it is true
while i have seen nothing to suggest that this will happen it is a stupid idea because it will just keep people from flying t3 shipsi know i wont be flying them if this happens as i know they will be called primary whenever they show up in pvp because lost sp hurts more than lost iskeven carebears wont fly them assuming they can run level 4 missions as they will be targeted for suicide ganks in high secthis had better be fake or a joking ccp employee
if theres like a profficency boost the longer i pilot a specific t3 ship without loosing it hell yeah im all for itif i need to train skills to pilot the ship skills wich i lose when i get podded not that great but hey its evejust need to wait and see what ccp has in storage for us
yea im about the same thing though anny sp lose i wil not be happy with and i wont be flying t3 shipswhat i can understand in crew sp lose say your t3 ship comes with a crew wel ifwhen ship goes pop crew dies so you need to get a new crewnow here is also a new market option depending on how imported crew is and what type of crew your wanting to use  not sure of types but hell say a carebare trains a crew and is then able to sell the crew to a other player to use in his ship that player will then get a rank 5 crew and the seller wil start to train a new rank one crew so what im hoping is that crews wil be the same ass mod ya can buy them sell then and the t3 modcrews you can also train them
open questions that need to be explained in the dev blog1 what happens if i eject if you lose sp when your not piloting the ship does that mean that the person who assembled the ship loses sp say if you dismantle a pos and a number of t3 ships appear and there destroyed can you remotely remove someones ps even though there offline2 is this really endgame content ie no noobs aloud3 by adding a new risk metric which cannot easily be compared with traditional isk for a hull size that generally explodes on contact with asteroids along with components which have unmanageable and unpredictable risk attached to there acquisition the reward for flying them would have to be unbelievably high  4 if this is end game content considering your mo of spending more time on things a greater chunk of the community would be prepared to use wont t3 in that format this be a total departure from that direction and how could you justify denying further player requested end game content any further
really we have to wait for them to be put on singularity on monday then we can make our decisions on whether it is a bad idea or not it is possible ccp has made a ship that no one will fly but it is also entirely possible they have thought this out more than it may seemwe do not know the training time on the tech 3 skills we do not even know if they are like regular skillsi personally am going to wait until i have some solid facts before i decide if this is a bad mechanic or not
remove it remove it now fire the moron who proposed it and forget this entire disaster ever happenedsp loss on ship destruction is just an incredibly stupid decision congratulations now youve just created a set of skills that nobody will ever train past level iii and rarely past level ii because ships die more frequently than you can replace the sp to level iv or v
i think what was hinted at is ship specific sptake for example and this is just wild speculation but while you own the tech 3 ship you are doing separate skill training that the ship itself does that you do at the same time as your normal skill training effectively your ship is training a different set of skills like tech 3 gun firing 123 and if you lose the ship you lose these extra skills you dont lose your gunnery skills or the skills required to use tech 3 ships or components or any of your normal skillset but you do lose the extra spiff attached directly to the ship and have to retrain it once you get a new ship this is my guess of what would happen i personally find it interesting if this is the case but it ads a new risk that gets progressivly bigger as you train your ship more but then again it also gives an emotion attachment to the ship its your ship you made the components you raised it fed it noobs watered it you dont want to lose it but whats the point of having it if you never use ittldr versionit will almost certainly be a separate set of skills that you train at the exact same time as your normal skills aka train 2 skills at the same time 1 normal 1 ship specific or something like that
ok to make the game more realistic the topic of ship explosion damage has been discussed and is a serious consideration to kaae the game more true to life yes more lag but isnt that being resolved for walk in stations and planetry exploration etcramming speed  your battle shipbc or cruiser just been ganked by 12 cowards your about to go through hull theyve taken your cap you cant target  wheres the fun and honour in that sitting bored waiting for your prized ship to go pop with no chance of fighting back sooo  call down to scottie in the engine room full speed ahead ramming speed  then you line up and take out that real juicy looking ship  yahhoo revenge damage would depend on ship types sizes weights and speeds but a hell of way to go out eh 
no your justification for the idea is to make it as real scifi as possible ccp makes the game as realistic to its own ideas not to all scifi come up with a better justification for this idea and maybe ill support it isaac
thisthis is a game not a scifi simulatoryou idea sounds good right up to the part were you try and add it to the game
the trouble with ramming in eve compared to other scifi is that ramming is generally pretty fatal when death holds no fearing then ramming because too easy and too powerfulnow if a ramming kill involved automatic death and automatic sp loss for the rammer then i might support this
yes this sounds legit and useful
sounds like a very well thought out idea
just get rid of them give everyone the 12ish points you would have for max learning skills and then only character creation and implants would affect your attributesoh and please find a way to give the vets a way to get the sp back
i support this idea get rid of them give us the points instead and figure out a way to give older players their sp back
i support this proposal
absolutely 100 support this i had a friend that tried a trial account and the whole concept of the training skills just drove him nuts remove this tedious waste of time i hated training them have one character maxed and one not quite maxed and i dont care if they train faster or not
that seems to be evidence that it is indeed a choice i made the same choice
i see both points of the issue and really see both as a good and a bad thing i cannot personally see a reason to remove them nor can i see a reason not to remove them they encourage an older and more mature player base who is willing to tough out the time it takes to pick them up but they also discourage people who may have toughed it out if they realize how much fun the games is after that boring timei do like the idea of being rewarded for being patient and willing to take the time to learn them but perhaps they go to far maybe the first tier one attribute specific learning skills should be remove and players just recieve 5 more points on there attrubutes but keep learning and the second tier skills to reward those who have the patience to be rewarded this would mean new characters would not lag so far behind if they trained up enough other skills to have some fun before they realized the benefit of the learning skills
its more than that though the learning skills provide a specific alternative to implants ie invested time over instand gratificationthere are more arguments to keep the skills than to remove them
qftit all matters in the long run as another poster said that when he added additional learning to his que his training time shortened
i support this fully
give us old and new 10 to all attributes to make up for the loss of books and im all for it
can we all just get 20 seriouslythey raise the cost of the game might as well make everything train faster
the arguements for removing the learning skills no matter how deftly worded all seem to boil down to make it faster make it easier still not supported
agreed
having slept on the topic i would be willing to offer support for an idea that i think someone else suggested earlier in this thread remove the learning skills from the active part of the game and make them part of character creation but without raising the total number of skill points new characters getit seems like an adequate compromise old characters dont lose what they have already invested and new players dont have the dreariness of actively training them what this would basically do is move the choice of whether to train learning skills into the character creation process at the expensive of some of the more advanced skills that new characters get once they enter the game those skills are then fixedthe idea of moving learning skills i would be willing to support as long as old players have enough warning to train them before they get shifted the idea of just dumping them i am still against
faster may be a correct word to use but easier is not easier suggests that it take alot of effort to click trainbut nitpicking for the sake of it aside most of the arguments against it seem to revolve around the keeping of choice even if thise choice is in fact a mortons fork both outcomes of learning skills are undesireable and are only undertaken because of only having two choices this is real fun gaming material
this idea comes up every few months and no matter how the new person spins it it always boils down to i want it noowwwwi simply cant condone this behavior i had the patience to train them thousands of other people have had the patience to train them and those that dont leave good riddance sir
personally it bother me either way ive done the training its in the past that said i can not see what the learning skills bring to game other than tediumsomeone said earlier that all skill training is boring not true waiting for a ship skill to complete has a sense of anticipation something that draws people in the learning skills do nothing in this regardthe only caveat is that if they are removed then anyone that has them trained needs to have the ability to reallocate the sp
this if it was going to get taken away then the balance along with game mechanics should not be messed withsps should not be raised nor lower as a result of them being removedotherwise your screwing with players who have put the time in for those learning skills regardless of what you can dream up for an excuse to have them removed
qft
its interesting you mention this because they do something in that regard they shave off time from every skill they are related to i have friends who are all new to the game and they love training one or two levels in learning skills to speed up lvl 4s and 5smost of the people in this thread arguing for the removal of the skills either dont understand the balance they form attribute wise or they are simply looking for an easier game
to be fair ive only gone through this once as i dont use alts too much back then i had to do basics 5 to get the advanced skills might be less tedious these days
yes the first time they changed the skills because of the tedium they made the adv skill requirements basics lvl 4 so yeah it has gotten way better you can get a good 8 in any skill with way elss training than it used to requirei feel as though the learning skills have been messed with enough to remove them entirely or nerf them further would upset a balance
you keep saying this like it means something because youre to stupid to actually think about what anyone else is saying if they remove the learning skills and boost attributes at the same time then its the same thing as not having to train those learning skills to train another skill faster and shave off timebut keep repeating it maybe you can convince people by repeating it over and over like greme said earlier the learning skills are not a real choice theyre just something you lose out on no matter which choice you make its like making a choice between getting punched in the nose or getting punched in the gutpersonally id rather choose to eat ice cream
youre a myopic imbecileremoving the learning skills and simply boosting everyones attributes is just as pointless as removing them and lowering everyones attribute points if all you want is a short easier game  perhaps you should go play something elsewhether you like it or not the skills and how they are trained are a choice its a choice between timeinvestment with the skills and cash investment with implants you can dress it up all you like and say its not a choice but thats arguing semantics not realityyoure a fool and trying to argue with me just shows all the little leaks in your failboat
im still inclined to support this but i agree that it may not be worth the development time involved certainly theres more important concerns
its over 9000 pwn4g3
and youre an idiot look you can keep tossing insults all you want and so can itraining the learning skills may be a choice but its not a real one as much as you keep trying to convince yourself of that why dont you go for some more ad hominem arguements i hear they work real well in proving your point oh wait no they dont
its funny you start throwing latin at me like some pseudointellectual dipstickeven more ironic is you dont seem to know what that means youre the one arguing against the source without evidence i produced a logical dichotemy as to why the skills shouldnt be removed you just ignored iti point out its a choice you say its not a real choice your vapid empty rhetoric just makes you look like a bumbling fool also for the record you started the insults several pages ago astonished that anyone could disagree with your poorly executed and poorly thought out suggestionremoving skills and boosting attributes as you say would only leave the player with fewer options of how to develop their character while simultaneosly crippling half of the attribute gain system leaving only implantsi will not repeat this argument again for you if you dont get it this time im going to chalk it up to inbreeding or a fault in your education
try again you failureits not a real choice as was pointed out to you several times you just choose to ignore it the choice you so espouse is merely choosing one of two undesirable alternatives either 1 train learning skills which are widely acknowledged not to be fun or 2 train slower than everyone else thereby falling behind thats not a choiceif player attributes were boosted when learning skills were removed it wouldnt matter or is that to complicated for you to understand this statement is merely an extension of your previous but its really a real choice arguementoh look more ad hominem attacks how cute
yeah i had to quote myself since your wall of text did exactly what i said youd do you ignore the core of my argumentalso  you began in the insults hence the irony in your little ad hominem bsagain  the skills give you an option of how to develop your characters attributes  a choiceboosting all attributes removes the choicehow long do you want this to go on i can do this all year
hey so can i its not a real choice its a choice from two bad optionswant to repeat how its a choice again
here is the page where i made the argument the first timei wont repeat myself just because you have trouble making sense of it
its because your arguement has no merit vovchoice from two bad options is not a real choice
what makes those options bad is subjective  and not everyone agrees they are bad optionsoh and by the way  bad options dont nullify the choice
they dont nullify the choice they just make it a bad one and the majority of players in this game all hated having to train the learning skills
bull youre pulling that out of your rear because you got a few supports
actually personal anecdotes ive never talked to anyone and ive been playing this game for three years now who has liked training the learning skillsbut thats kind of why i started this thread to see how many people think the same way sok though ccp are already working on this issue vov
cool story brah dont care at all ive been around quite awhile and ive had the opposite experience the only people who didnt appreciate the learning skills didnt even have the patience to get into battlecruisersand in any case this board is about matters for the csm i dont care what ccp says its doing i will argue against this issue and vote against any csm rep who supports it
same
in the real world we are no where near space age but we can make navigation systems so good that automatically landing airplanes yes it is automatic has to be randomized to prevent ruts from forming in the runway from the planes landing in the same exact spot over and overbut this is eve not real life i counter with to opthis is eve not scifi
why not just remove warping from the game it would make eve big again
they gave the option to warp to 0km to stop bm copying back when it was warp to 15km everyone set there bms beyond the gate and warped to them instead of the gate so they could land on it the problme arised when everyone would have sets of bms on tere profile and when someone new joined the corpalliance they would copy them a set the problem of this is bms are saved on the server and people would be copying hundreds at one time if they made the bm copying system different it would work maybe a bit like bp copying but faster so you could limit to x bms at one time and x slots per station but then noone would still revert to the old days where you warped to your bm instead of the gate
the only way i would entertain anything on the topic of wtz is if the old bookmark system got a serious and gameentertaining overhaullinking bookmarks in a macrolike manner to create routes would create a lot of interesting game contentthis way the bookmarks could be traded and linked into your routeplanner then locations of gates and stations should shift slightly over time and your navigationskills would compensate for the drifting so to speak in effect your calculations would be wrong if your not skilled and if to much time has pastcalling up other players to get refreshed bookmarks would then become a game mechanic and you could even make a biz of plotting and selling entire routes of safetywith this a route plottet the same day would become ungankable unless the pirates used interdictors or warpdisruptionsuch a system i believe would also bring a false feeling of safety to pilots and thus help roaming piratesnb to my knowledge we have all been wanting a more exciting way to get the gateparking a bit out of the game this might do that or at least help it
nope just make tackling gear better reach further if you have to fix all ship turret weapon ranges to accomodate then do that tootackling is the single most important aspect of pvp not guns or warp to zero and ccp nerfed it with the speed changesmy opinion is that statsis webifier needs a boost and ship agility needs a further nerf
no
things like this should not be possible it doesnt have anything to do with eve being harsh or not that is a hollow statement because it does not create harshness it is simply edit could be compared not to a highsec gank or a senior officer who steals money from a corp it could be compared to senator joe man disbanding the united states simply by sending unfriendly letters to all the states and telling them to frell off then disbanding the union and everyone would have to go along with it because he does it on a sunday evening when everyone is at home with their familiesit should not be possible to disband an alliance with the same simplicity as you scrap a frigate even switching a character from one corp to another is more complicated than that
i had to think about this for awhile and take bob out of my thinking i just dont see the joy in here anywhere even for the button pusher who ends an alliance i read the  analogy above and it just doesnt pass the muster test  never acted alone he had a giant organization following him and it only went down with most of the world arrayed against him i mean is there anyone here who seriously thinks goering could have disbanded  germany deuschtland this is just complete sophistry i absolutely endorse a reworking of the alliance mechanic
ok your complaint is that a guy with ceolike powers used them to his advantage as though he was a ceo hmmim sorry but i sense a pattern ceo ceolike powersconsidering that the executor doesnt have to give out director powers and that he himself can disband the alliance with 1 push of the button says thatit works as intended unless game mechanics are changed for the ceo i do not support any change to directors you dont need them do not like how much power they have do not promote them easy as that our corp has like what 2 directors were still managing just fine too whether its changed is up to ccp as i see it this feature works fine as intended if i heard the bob representative on everadio correctly this person was not supposed to be a director in the first place basically it was a mistake and bob paid for it isaac
i believe espionage and theft are good for eve there is nothing wrong with theft or offlining a poss and cynojammers or numerous other espionage activities the problem though is the ability to utterly disolve an alliance within the course of an afternoon by kicking all member corps is a detriment to the game i can see crippling an alliance but not disolving it perhaps a limit on the number of corps that may be removed per day or a delay like there is when removing a member from a corp would stop this or requiring the confirmation of a second director to complete the actionfor corp a form of limited director with only access and the ability to grant access to certain roles and divisions could be very useful to reduce the risk of it being completely cleaned out in the course of an afternoon by a single individual it would also be useful for the directors to be able to propose a vote to expel another director rather than just the ceo as there are times a ceo may be gone for a few days and must be removed from that role
it isnt a matter of stpping corp thieft or spys from doing damage this is that they must have forgot to add something to the cancel alliance option everything else in alliances needs votes or has timers hell even leaving an alliance has a 24hr timer but the fact that 1 director has the power to close an alliance kinda sounds strange it should be the ceo of the holding corp and even then there should be a 24hr timer and if there is more than 50 object from the corpsshare holders then it cancels id also think there could be an impeachment option if a corpalliance feels that there ceos or directors are making bad choices or are corrupt they can vote to overthrow them
i got a crazy idea how about only have people you trust be a director if they decided to screw you over not much can be done but strip them as fast as possible
in alliances especially big ones holding corps are usually an alt corp inwhich all the ceos of the alliance have a directors lvl char so that they have equal rights as each other to be fair so imagine if one of the say 10 corps in the alliance have a fall out but dont want to leave they could just boot everyone else out and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them except boot them out firstalso i recon its about time they expanded to the next stage of group progression factions would cost 25bill to create a faction factions are made up of multiple alliance the big bonus to factions would be factions can deploy system defences senty turrets at gates and stationsoutposts they would use fuel and ammo and require sov 4 max number of 4 per gatestation depending on what size turrets you want can be set to auto hit based on faction standings immune to all forms of ecm cannot be anchored at moonsfuel would be very little amount ie the biggest sentry would only use 14th of what a small pos uses
quick fix would be a 24 hour timer and messages sent to all alliance ceos and possibly directors saying who carried the action out so they can reverse it and stop it from happening again
how about1 leave directors abilities to expel corps2 except the executor corp this requires a votecan anyone see any issues or possible exploits with that
if the ceo has a 24h window to overturn the directors expel then yeah that way if 2 corps fall out one doesnt kick te other unless ofc they are the ceo in which he can do whatever the hell he wants
exactly  every character being turned to the biomass has a timer turning an alliance into nothingness should as well merely kicking out corps should have a shorter one of course or the option to skip the timer by a second director countersigning the decision
priceless please make sure to provide a transcript of csmdelegate darius johnsons take on this
it seems like a very strange situation though one that allegedly has happened before be it at a much smaller scale when compared to what has happened it does appear silly that removing roles and subsequently kicking people from  leaving a corp as well as a lot of other things have a cooldown period of 24 hours having to vote on every second decision where one single director could do this seems equally sillyi honestly am unsure what would be the best course of action  it boils down to what mechanics ccp thinks should and shouldnt be possible i do feel that the entire way of corp and alliance management should be analised and possibly redesigned for better and easier usageedited for clarity
the issue is that the method of band of brothers disbanding was completely and entirely preventable but also completely and entirely unstoppable there are ways you can stop spies there are ways you can stop disgruntled people but what we had is a director who disappeared for awhile so they just assume hes gone or something then simply logs back on his old char and disbands the alliance boom pearl harbor x10 something like this should not be possible at an instant atleast they had no defence nor way to stop it in this reasoning it takes only 1 person with directorship to disband any alliance while eve is based on risk reward and consequences these consequences have to be controlled as to not be out of proportion while i agree he had ceo like powers dictator like powers no 1 man should be able to undo the work of 3000 on a whim what if this happens after a drama fallout or 1 directer just gets  drunk has an argument on vent and disbands the alliance in anger woke up the next day sober and too bad he screwed an entire alliance royally1 man should not have this kind of game mechanic power unless he is the prime executer of the alliance the primary issue i think is also the whole warning thing there should be a 24 hour warning or wait before an alliance disband it seems to be the way eve works it is already an exsisting solution to many thingswhile it is cool and all to have realistic consequences for actions or lack of internal security this was neither this was a disgrunted employee who just nuked band of brothers this is neither a fun nor cool way for an alliance to end no effort was expended to get him to do so it was just a press of a button no big infiltration schemes nothing gone poofi would say change it it just seems unfair and blown out of preportion sure 1 man can  someone royally in real life if he is in the right position but as far to cause the immidiate disolution of an organization i dont think soimagin the president of the united states turning rogue he would do alot of damage but he couldnt disband the usa he couldnt nuke the world there are things inplace to prevent thatqueen of england prime ministers of countrys leaders and dictators highest men in their government they can sure cause alot of damage if suddenly set against their parent countries but they cannot disband and utterly destroy it very easily or instantlylets look at ceos they can do alot of damage to maby even drive a company into the ground but even at the highest position possible their is a limit to what they can do effortlessly and instantly in eve it appears their is no such limit it can be done without effort or any invested time and that is the problem
in empire npc faction space asteroid belts have npc pirate rats opposites caldari mostly have guristas amarr have sanshas etcin 00 pirate faction space asteroid belts have npc pirate rats similars sanshas have sanshas guristas have guristas etchuhhow is it npc pirate factions dominate npc pirate faction space and npc pirate factions dominate empire npc faction spacethis means if you run empire npc faction missions you can reenforce your efforts by ratting because ratting contributes to your faction standinghowever if you run npc pirate faction missions you cannot reenforce your efforts by ratting in fact ratting works against your faction standing please either make the appearance of npc factions pirate or otherwise more evenly distributed in all parts of space  or permit the npc empire factions to invade npc pirate faction space so you can find amarr rats in sanshas space with bounties etcplease even this up it appears like the empire factions cant police their own territories and quite frankly its not balanced or fair
no it doesnt faction standing is changed by doing missions  standing gain for completing storyline standing loss for killing mission npcs ratting only increases your security status and lowers standing to pirate corporation not faction
youre missing the pointif in sanshas nations space i find sanshas nations ratsin guristas space i find guristas ratswhy dont i find caldari rats in caldari spaceor amarr rats in amarr spacethe point is  in caldari space i can rat against pirate faction rats which i also find in the mission but in pirate faction 00 space if i rat  i lose faction because the rats belong to the faction im running missions for  i am talking from experience here  ive built up sansha nations faction  but loose it every time i ratdo you recognize this or dispute it
then stop killing sansha rats o  not that hard to figure out

hi i dont know if this is the right place to post this problem in but i didnt find a better one i wanted to use the buddy programm to invite a friend but it seems as the program didnt worki didnt get an messagt that the mail is send or anything is this program still available are some problems known how can i use it correctly hope you can help me thanks
thanks 2nd post
than youve quite simply become my favourite csm well done
ill be honest i havent read this entire thread as ive already read several started by tchella thought just occurred to me that i think is original how about no flagging but salvagers do not work when the wreck is being tractored by someone elsejust stops this salvaging out of your tractor beam crap that seems to annoy so many people
eve isnt about fairness im afraid old corps have a right to have an advantage over new and startup corps thats the way it iscomplaining about it wont get you anywherealso what you want to delete t2 bpos from the game
you are confusing eve the game which is not about fairness and the game mechanics of eve which are about balance or fairnesst2 bpos unbalance industry ccp nerfs or balances without any apologies for ships and modules so why not in industry someone who skilled one whole year to exploit speed before the speed nerf isnt going to get any sympathy from ccp so why would we make an exception for those corpos that have tken advantage of t2 bpos for the past few years so yes simply erase them
while i would like to see t2 manufacturing evened out your comparison between training and t2 bpos is poor firstly those skills trained will benefit any pilot speed is still an important factor its just not the win button that it used to besecond t2 bpos do not turn an instant profit unless youre lucky enough to have actually won one in the lottery you have to recoup the bpo cost and this takes time certainly longer than a year in many casesthird balance changes do not remove anything from you youre talking about stripping away assets worth billions
personally it bother me either way ive done the training its in the past that said i can not see what the learning skills bring to game other than tediumsomeone said earlier that all skill training is boring not true waiting for a ship skill to complete has a sense of anticipation something that draws people in the learning skills do nothing in this regardthe only caveat is that if they are removed then anyone that has them trained needs to have the ability to reallocate the sp

as long as our elected officials actually represent their constituency i dont know whether this is a good ideathe constituent has the first responsibility show up make your voice heard a vocal citizenry is the cement of a viable society the challenge is that many people do not know what they want cannot voice their concerns  needs in an effective way are ignorant of subject matter and do not have sufficient information to make a sound decisionthe representative has the second responsibility to faithfully represent without bias the needs of their voters the challenge is that any political official anywhere politics is used will have to find a means to be fair and balanced in a dynamic social context they can be ignorant too they also do not have all the information they need and in the great custom of human politics they can and will be corrupted some of them will join the process with a private agendaccp has the third responsibility to further their business goals and trust me that these needs will prevail always over any other consideration they have to listen to player representatives who may be all of the above they have to keep the single paying customer in mind when making decisions and continue to be a viable player excusez le mot in a dynamic global market in a declining not to say crumbling global economy they have their agenda too if we see ccp as a benign disinterested party which we would be absolutely stupid to looking out over the further horizon of what new eden will transform into with advancing technologies changing needs of capsuleers and competition once this is seen as a viable business model we can only hope that they adopt a greater good stance that will try and make the best product for the most amount of people if they succeed in that the only thing left for the capsuleer and their representative is to make the best out of what the environment has to offerif the representative in the mean time actually represented the wishes of their voters it would be more of a democracy than what we see in most of the rest of the worldabulurd bonifaceme meceo

supported im happy with my name and wouldnt change it but can certainly understand others wanting to change theirsi have plenty of faith in ccpcsm ability to work out the balancing details so no conditions on my support here
i can say the ability to change a characters name once a year would be a good thing though you would have to be able to search fo a character by their old name or it could be ruthlessly exploited even only once a year as eve is a social game currently there is the issue that each name in eve is unique and hence a character whos name was changed would take up two spotsso unfortunantly i cannot fully support the ability to change names currently but do believe it is an issue that there should be discussion on how to answer
i want it to happen because i hate roleplaying actually ive been called gay for making a girl character and giving her a real name so im thinking this will be a great solution to my problem

t3 exhumers 
what about a 2 stripminer barge with an extra mid and low slot plus a slight buff on the armor shields and structure a ship designed for working in more dangerous space
ummlol what would be the pointisaac
not gonna happen some people in this game have infinite amount of isk and nothing to spend it on if they can buy skill points thats just lol stupid
i know what im smoking and this idea is still stupid
while this is still on the main page i would urge the 99 of people who have opposed this idea to stop bumping it its taking up a slot on the front page just because its so ridiculous that people keep replyingi would have edited my previous post but i dont know if anyone would see it
friendly bump or is ccp just hoping all the attention is averted to the bob incident and everyone forgot that our t2 market got hit hard so they dont have to reveal the truth
if they were banned they arnt customers anymore are they 
my proposal is to give the interdiction field of generators or probes a strength of 1 or 2 like in the usual warp scramblers if more fields are used the effect could stack i cant see why those fields have to be all mighty also it makes no senseits my believe this would encourage more players to solo pvp because they have a chance to escape from the usual gang bang scenario the gang bangers would have to use serveral interdictors maybe 23  you see my pointregards
they are designed to stop capital ships normally immune to warp disruption effects they are meant to be strongest warp disruption and thus they wont changeix
not a problem to respect thatleave the effect on capitals to be all mighty reduce the effect on smaller vesselscant see why it has to be the way it isalso if it was specially designed to stop capitals why does it work on small vessels at all does not make sensean easy solution to this would be a new interdiction field generator item to stop capitalsit would be almighty the usual interdiction fields would have then strngth 12regards
its already extremely easy to got through any low sec camp
since hes talking about the fields i dont think he means low sec
no hics are fine quit trying to solo in 00 lol isaac
why does a rocket launcher work on humans if its spec just for vehiclesthat is what your asking here its dumb smaller ships are weaker so for the specialized warp dis on heavy int find it very easy to grab hold off one of the small ships and its average for it to grab a cap its commen sence tbh and my next question isdid you make the threahd because one caught you and killed you if so door is that way 
no one likes running into a hic or an interdictorbut this proposal is wackednot supported
and by that you mean jump into low sec uncloak and warp to the next stargate has nothing to do with pvp or leaving a zone of fully engaged combatand your argument to proof that would be  void atm i will never stop soloing in low sec or 00 for that matterstop watching tv a rocket will not trigger on a human the rocket will fly through the body thus maybe killing the victim but thats not the effect you would be looking for at allalso there is no need to be rudemaybe but again not an argument someone try a litle harderregards
let me put it into words your small 3rd grade brain can understandadapt or diethere are plenty of ways to get around a hicif you cant figure that out then you have no business making proposalsthis is nothing more than a child whining for retribution for getting ganked
hello hics get a 90 penalty to speed and 80 penalty to thrust when their bubble is up if you cannot outrun a hic for a few km in order to warp out then you fail at moving your shipbubble camps are needed in 00 in order to defend an area of space 00 is not happy free for everyone land that is called high security space if you want something in 00 then you have to take it not whine for mechanics to suit your no risk carebear attitude
supported until more information is revealed
then ill clarify my position  if i have to chose between skills i should never lose or skills that i will lose when my t3 ship explodes i will always chose the skills that i will never lose  if these t3 related skills are trained alongside the regular skills i will want to see the specifics before i decide
they are going to be expensive enough without this welcome suicide gankers dream if t3 ships really do this never owning one release more engaging content rather than more time sinksas it stands mission running is arduous and boring mining is just annoying maybe focus on more dynamic stuff in these areas other then go here and kill 40 ships over and over
while i would like to see official confirmation of this im not going to waste any time saying this game mechanic s u x  bung i dont care how you justify it within lore or whatever loosing a trained skill level with the loss of a ship is as redolent as rotting cheeseak
blah blah blah  wait and see what it actually is before lighting the torches ya damn unruly mob 
i hope those ships are amazing if you lose sp for dieing in them
more details are needed but it sounds like the crappiest idea ever a ship with exp
i dont even know what im whining about but im whining anyways 
if losing sps is true i wont bother sitting on one period
if you can save your sp by ejecting then i wont have a problem with it still i need to add that these ships had better be very powerful to justify such a risk
im not going to condone supporting something that doesnt exist yeti think we should wait before jumping the gun
zapatero eon issue 014 page 54from that it would seem that the skill is lost with the ship but not with the capsuleer it seems that when the same configuration would be reassembled and used the new ship would learn the same skills over timethat would be acceptableabulurd bonifaceme meceo
does that mean that ships will be earning xp that is great i will just pimp my battleship in missions without any risk of losing sp while it becomes more and more powerful sarcasm i dont think that we should lose sp that will reject even more players from using that ships in lownull sec and t3 ships will be still damn expensive not to mention with t3 fitting
actually this is a glimpse in the thought processes on t3 space frames it is not actually a discussion of how the feature is supposed to work its something under considerationnow from a users perspective this would not bode well if ccp are indeed and we dont really know still debating how the functionality is supposed to work then were looking at a feature that is not yet fully developed inevitably this means that the implementation will suffer discussing how important new features have to work 2 months before rollout does not inspire a lot of confidence it may lead to some frowny faces in the short term i dont doubt that when the developers know more about the impact of the new features in a live environment they will be able to tune it more to turn it into a seamless experience the trouble with that is that it will cause unnecessary angst and elevation of blood pressure in some part of the new eden constituencyfor developers who have access to a fullyfeatured test environment where new designs can be tested live that would actually a sub par performance they have room for trial and error and to get things right the first time when it is released to the general populationim giving ccp the benefit of the doubt here designing ships with interchangeable components is an exciting twist to the new eden space frame inventory and there is no reason why it could not be a fabulous addition when done right on the other hand there appears to be some speculation in the article i quoted previously about whether ships like that could have rigs since they can be disassembled the workaround seems obvious one or more components could be fitted with rigs and be shipped in an assembled state one assembled component it would be full size including the rig it is only when the component was repackaged that the rig would be lost otherwise it would be possible to swap out one component to make a different ship only that component has a rig attached to it why that appears to be such a big leap of the imagination i cannot fathom but i would hazard to say that if i can figure out a better way to make their new functionality work than ccp does and i doubt it it does not inspire great confidence in their creative process somebody at ccp figured this one out by now its a natural progression i would expect it to work like that and it would be consistent with the environmenti cant wait for march to roll aroundabulurd bonifaceme meceo
this seems like a really good way for ccp to prenerf t3 ships to the point of nobody flying them i dont mind paying a few hundred mill every time i die because i can keep an isk buffer and be back in another ship reasonably fast and during that time i can still be training skills i dont like the idea of being set back a week in both skills and isk every time i dieon of the main things that keeps people playing the game is the almost endless skill tree but if you can be set back weeks or months on that tree with a single loss people will certainly stop flying t3 ships in any form of risky situation and a small minority not me may even just give upso yeah signed
sorry guys this issue was voted on and rejected with just bunyip vuk and me in favor of it
one thing that hasnt been addressed this whole time is why boost the attributes im going to keep harping on this one until someone actually gives an answer ive seen reasons on both sides in regards to removing the learning skills which i dont support but not a single one why to boost attributes once theyre gone so why if you want them removed so badly dont you just ask for them to be removed and be done with it
they want the attributes boosted to basically take the effect of all learning skills lvl 5ie they want no options to expand your attributes other than implantsby boosting everyones attributes everyone would train even fasteri see why a lot of these people want the skills removed i just dont agree with it and i think it would take away part of the game thats very necessary
fully supported
isnt it funny how the op cant resist responding to every postguess he has inferiority complex issuesoh and mr op learn to read an encyclopedia or a dictionaryno wikipedia doesnt count especially if it can be edited by anyone and everyoneits sure as hell no authority
a decent middle ground would be removing the advanced learning skills and refunding the sp invested in them and increasing all base attributes by 5with this the learning tab would be maxed out with 1536000 sp instead of the 5mil it currently isa new player would have to spend only about a week to get nearly the same attributes that a player with v basic and iv advanced skills has nowthat said i still dont see the point of having learning skills at all
supporting this its a needless timesink putting off new players
it isnt needless it only puts off players who are too impatient too all the people saying training learning skills is not fun do you think training skills to lvl 5 is fun noone forces you to train the learning skills if you dont want to train them then dont you just want and easy game
if they win this little whinefest the level 5s will be next target of an improved skill training thread make level 5 skills faster to train or remove them even better they take too long it discourages new players and makes them quit sure its a choice to train to level 5 but its not a real choice its some kinda kitchen utensil nobody wants to take the time to train level 5 but nodoby wants to feel like they are falling behind we should have level 5 skills now still not supporting obviously
i am going to support this
i fully support this learning skills take loads of fun out of eve for new players
the reason this dont happen is because of 2 years ago when you used to warp to 15there were litterally billions of bms and when someone copies 2k bms it caused severe server lag especially in low sec think about it ccp put wtz for a reason carebears got a boost granted but it was benificial to all cos peeps will always find a way around it welcome back the bm spam and the nano spam is what will happenworse idea eva
no i like to fly solo and dodge gate camps low sec is alive with low sp pilots in fw being able to dodge the gate camps we can even use afterburners do not support
issue is this for a long time now ccp have made piracy less viable as a profession and less enjoyable as a game style nerfs i can think of since i originally started playing and pirating hitpoint buffs agility buffs jump freighters further hitpoint buffs rigs allowing ships to tank a lot more further agility buffs making gates incredibly massive blockadestransports being made very usefuli think the players who started pirating and well any pirate who tries it and decides its not worth the trouble should be given the option to reset their security status with some restrictions such asa only one reset to 00 sec status every year otherwise people will just use it every time they need a new ship from jitab it should perhaps some ammount of isk but not so much that it removes this option for newbie piratesc any existing kill rights are given an extra 3 months before they expire and said killrights include podding rights perhaps make said killrights resuabletradablea lot of people dont pvp in lowsec because the security hits that can occur can cause too much hassle later on in the game if it were not so hard to try this playstyle and back out of it if it does not suit  lowsec might be a bit more excitingnewbies who try pirating currently have a very hard time raising their security status especially if they have to do it in the same space where they are most likey to lose it  lowsecurity space with really really crappy npcsccp are giving players stats roll backs soon as mentioned by the lead producer on eve tv during alliance tournament today  so why not help out people who got stuck in a profession that has only ever become less profitable and less enjoyable
supportin dis
not supported  get out to 00 and kill some rats
simplest way would be to give better sec repairing rats in lowsec without the higher bountiesnone the less i support such an endeavour
hahaha last time i saw you you were camping molden heath with an army of alts hapily ganking haulers now you are done and need to get back into empire you want the easy ride if the rest of us can work our sec status up i did from 9 in a week or two why do we need a change you commit a crime now pay for it
last time i was attacking ships in molden heath and getting security hits for it was over a year ago i am already back in empire why not show info me ingame figure out who my alts are and check them too
this
word isaac
bob and everyone else this week have learned a powerful lesson about world government
tldr version  dont pick an moron to be a director and if he goes missing yank his powers and put someone else in chargeduhsecurity 101you leave the bloody door open what the frakking hell do you expect the inquisitionim sure 24 hours of delayed inability to do anything would be quite easily forgiven as opposed to leaving the alliance wide open to sabotageyes the system is unforgiving and probially not fairbut so is over half the bloody game get used to it i had too with my corp this is just a much larger version of losing control of your own team metaphorically speaking of course
this time it might have been preventable but in general it isnt it is not rocket science to make a new alt and infiltrate a random corpalliance in time you can become a director and you can screw them over without any risk to your main because you used an alt anyway24 hours is required to kick a single char from a corp in the alliane but you can disband the entire alliance in 24 seconds just put in a 24 hour timer in place or voting for such things
now that its been been done against bob to our advantage i support changing things so nobody else can do it to us to our disadvantagegreat idea op
insightfulpoint is sanshas space has sanshas rats does caldari space of caldari ratsi think this is the point of the thread
no its very simplerats are pirates caldariamarrminmatargallente are not piratesmake sense yes nolets not forget which faction declares what to be a ratthat one being one of the 4 empire factions and concord most of allyour trying to make a system far more complicated for the sake of making it easy
the miningday devicefitable only on titans can mine out an entire belt instantlyit would compress ore to about half of its original size and would quadruple a titans cargoholdit would prevent warp for 5 minutes and would drain the titan of all capedit fitta is a bad word
after a long thought and consideration i have decided to show support for this topic
oowhat drugs are you on again
sorrybutthis is totally unneeded we have a rorqual for a reason isaac
want to try again with the isd news link xhagen all im getting is a site not found when i try
not to mention that t2 prices will skyrocket to unseen heights if all t2 comes from invention
how about getting a clue about game mechanics 
the other day we killed this ship
supported with all my lifeforce
thats the saddest thing ive read all day
lol man its true though

bump
sorry i dont agree with this something has to be done but this is massively overcomplicating the entire system i preferred nyphurs solution
signedi would like to see that to do list this would give us more info on what they consider important or at least what they intend to work on
ambulation is a marketing issue pos overhaul a gameplay issuenobody requested ambulation it was a decision from ccp pos overhaul is long being requested by the playerbase 
csm doesnt seem having any balls and are looking like puppets of ccp its something going on for years keep hammering ccp about it if they see us as spoiled children so be it without us they would be out of the jobcsm reunite and go with pitchforks and torches to the next csm meeting just bring it up time after time after time until they get crazy
will there be a chance that in the revamping  well actually see empire faction rats distributed in 00 npc faction space
stealth bombers that cant warp while cloaked dont sound very stealthy to me  the enemy will always see you warp in unless youve just been sitting there the whole time by yourself just sayinof course i suppose it would be a bit overpowered to let a bomber warp in cloaked drop a bomb cloak immediately then warp off  perhaps there could be a warp delay after dropping a bomb but not a cloaking delayi have also never quite understood why a missile  bomb would fail to detonate when the bomber cloaks  warps away  explodes seems rather silly this should be fixed for all missile ships not just the bomber
id like to see sb missiles hit after the sb cloaksid like to see sb actually able to kill frigates again
a single director can not force a corp to war but disband an entire alliancebad game design
already expressed my reasons in another thread supported
what if i want the ability to disband my alliance imagine if i am alone in my own corp as ceo and my corp is the executor or my alliance the alliance was formed under me and i am king do i not have every right to kick corps from my alliance then close it myselftoo much power maybe but what i created the alliance myself id argue that i alone have the right to control the status of my organization and can disband it as i pleaseccp should examine other forms of alliance organization other than executor control high council democracy etc without removing but rather including the option of the current dictatorship modelfor example types of factionsnpc faction amarr caldari etcplayer allianceplayer empireplayer federationplayer democracyplayer tribeeach with their own mechanics that govern power structures so that players have choices instead of being forced to work around fixes
sure you should just have to wait 24 hours and if no other director cancels it then you are fine in this case there is no other director so thats thatsorry if waiting 24 hours seems a pain but you made an allianceyou can deal with that hassle and is no worse than a lot of other things we have to wait for in eve
it sends shivers down my spine to agree with a goonbut he is right
supported minmatar tourists will have a better life serving their true masters
what she said would be fun if slaves could be turned in to the minmatards for an lp a piece and if nonslaved could be turned in to the amarr for the same reward i suppose this could open up a true slaver profession
this one has been up so many timesmy take is do it already ccpmake it a cool rp feature and mission based or similarlp yielding and we have a regular american revolution state boiling
something needs to be done yup this bit made me laugh though
woahno so fast here folks lets think about this for a secondthe ability to free slaves  means slave availability goes downslave availability goes down supply goes downsupply goes down  what happens to the aggregate supply and demand modelthats right  price goes upwe start freeing slaves and we could be playing havoc with the whole finely tuned market system we have no idea what impact that could have globally  not to mention empires that rely on both slave labour and slave tradenot such a great idea now  is it
slavers should clone themselves and make slaves of their low grade clonesthat would be poetic justicenon serviam
while id argue that low sec isnt low secits less sec than much of 00treating 04 differently that 03 has never made any sense to me
yea and why cant fighters be deligated in a 04 or has that changed now
i think the reason it works this way is that the game is programmed to only allow low sec only activities in a 04 and below thing is the truesec of a system is always something above 04 like 0413 or something as such the game sees that as above the 04 cut off and you need charters and so onat least that is what i was told once upon a time could be totally wrong and in the end doesnt matter because i agree with the op it is stupidsupported
supported moon mining refining arrays etc should all be allowable in 4 spacei thought this was the case as well until i tried to anchor moon mining arrays in a 37 sec systemsee i thought that the security restriction 4 information on the info box meant anchorable in 4 and below not cannot anchor in 4 and above silly me i should have known better
how exactly to you propose to solve this problemperpetual gm audits of all char bio and corp dataccp reps in every system and created channel to enforce the current chat rules it isnt possible life is hard deal with it people shouldnt be discriminated against but there is no law that says you cant offend people
so if someone says all jews are scum or something in their bio you dont think there should be taken any action
let the community take action but when we start crying to the devs every time we see something we dont like we pull resources away from other areas of the game newsflash people do things like that because of the reaction it draws if it becomes to much of a hassle for ccp they will just limit players ability to effect the sandbox not police the sandbox
not supported would prefer old player and people who buy isk
nonono no way real life money should impact on players more than it already doesnot supported
not supported
just smoking i think he was experimenting with better life through chemistry in a variety of waysno not supported need a thumbs down for this one
between this and t3 on sisi im getting the feeling theyre hoping it drops off the radari hope im wrong though
thats supposed to be an argument if your are not able to supply one you should realy not reply to this or any matterits easy to turn your argument around and say your just convenient the way it is that doesnt mean its good for everyoneor a larger part of the players or eve itself sure its easy to outrun a single interdictor but that is not whats happening the moment you single encouter someone you get gangfleet jumped and are dead within seconds without a chance of retreat it should be possible to solo pvp 3 enemy vessels and at least have a chanceits easy to prove ccp is on my side with that or a ship like the golem would not existi am just wondering if they are aware of the whole solo pvp issueregards
theres nothing wrong with hics and its nothing to do with hics if u get get gangbanged a hic is there for tackling if it tackles you then it most likely has backup somewhere as they dont do much dmg on their own
bubbles are a part of what makes 00 what it is it is very possible to beat a bubble camp even a very large one with the right ship and experience pilots in unfriendly 00 space who are not in scouttype ships andor do not know how to beat a bubble should not move solo larger slower ships should always have a scout flying and jumping through gates ahead of them it is the scouts job to find out if theres a camp with our without a bubble on the other side of the gate i know this because i am the primary scout for my corp its a very fun job i run into bubbles and camps frequently and i really dont see a need to nerf the heavy dictors
if this made any sense at all i would gladly respond but you fail to understand english as well as game mechanics the golem was designed for pve not pvp its also called using a scoutmap but i guess basic military strategy is completely lost on you omg i just responded to random words that made no sense god this thread sucks
hics are probably one of the most balanced and best designed ships in game great for lowsec and tackling supercaps rather bleh for everything else
actually bc are the most balanced and best designed ships hics are just t2 cruiser that make one useless mod even more useless
pot calling the kettle black much ships are designed for what you use them for yes there is a tractor beam bonus on marauders but their intention was extended stays deep in enemy territory using the rats to supplement their supplies in enemy space along with their sizeable cargo ive seen many many marauders used and quite effectively in pvp situations
one of the problems eve has is the excess of isk in circulationproposalnewbies can only stay in a newbie corp for 3 months after which they are kicked outplayers with no corp can be wardecced for a nominal free  this lets us hunt the solo carebearsadditionally lower corp and alliance wardec fees to increase the number of empire wardecsresulta more fun and exciting eve d
scaling tax rate in npc corps please the longer you are in them the higher your tax rate gets with something like a 50 cap
why 50 a 90 cap makes more sense0 for the first 3 months while you get started 10 tax increase every month afterits silly that people can hide in npc corps with no risk  at least this way theyre forced into the real world of eveedit your idea is a better compromise than mine  but a 50 tax cap is too low
this is the weakest incarnation of this idea ive seen yet most people hiding in npc corps do not make their money from bounties since the bounties in high sec are laughableas for driving people out of npc corps i disagree with anyone who trys to force people to play the game the way they want in any case even if you impose penalties youd just have a rash of people paying the cheap fee to start 1man corps like we dont already have enough of thosenot supported the first 8 or 9 times this was suggested not supported now
hide where you are aware that you can kill anyone anytime anywhere if you wish to invest sufficient isk in that what better isk drain do you needor you wish isk drained from others and not from you
no waybring back the ability to join npc corps i would so join quafe
hahahahahahahahahehehehohohohohohahahahahaare you seriousseriously is that the best you can come up with for justification of nerfing npc corp isk circulationwell gee golly wiz lets get goonswarm in here and ask them how much isk they have in there coffers hell the alliance tournament one of the corps literally jacked the market to help win the tournamentthat has to be the most hilariously stupid idea ive seen yet for justifying npc corp nerfingand thats just the tip of the icebergim getting off this boat before it sinks
into the breach once more my friend
i second the original post whether it would be a gaming penalty wardec or tax penalty npc companies should alway be a second choice to outright pc corps otherwise it would violate the sandbox idea of eve
hey theres room on the lifeboat dont get sucked down in the sinking ship
well frankly ideas like this which are tried and fail are a nice breather at least after the debacle of the abolish learning skills crapin any case the last time this was proposed the idea was more complex allowing people in npc corps to pay a monthly fee in higher and higher increments to stay in an npc corpall of these ideas fail in the sense that you cant force people to move into 00
ho another whine thread for easy targets
you cant force people to 00 true but you can force them into a real corp
you can also eat pooh doesnt mean you shouldforce is a bloody bad way to do anything especially when entertainment is your goalthe incentives should be that playing in player corps is way more fun and a way to reach that goal would be to remove the covering under npc flag option switching corp is all good but jumping back and fourth to npc and pc corps is a gameflawfix standing issues and aggression and make solo play fun but not financially viable
this
confirmed on eve tv by lead game designer that if you lose a tech iii ship you will lose one of the skills required to fit the upgrades similar to if you lost a shield rigged drake and lost shield riggingthe skills are going to be only rank 1 but still i think it is a stupid ideathey claim the reason being is that isk is no longer an issue so they need to add more penalties to dieing well you know what thats stupid because not everyone has bottomless wallets like they say and if they did the better solution would be to make it harder to make isksigned ccp you ruin a good thing
again devs stated in the forums that this functions is subject to change or removal depending on feedback and until weve seen it in its entirety how can we really judge if its a good or bad mechanic
no way im going to risk losing skills even if the battle advantages are better im already quite angry as it is when i lose a ship because of dcdesync
skills already take to long to train there isnt even a way to grind it out and catch up with older players do not want loss of skillpointsskill levels
im not willing to pass judement on this until i see it some pilots are willing to pvp wearing expensive implants while using factionfitted ships some pilots are unwilling to enter 4 or lower space at all theres a huge variation in the amount of risk people are willing to take in this galaxy on the surface i dont see a problem with adding a new highrisk level for those who like to push the envelope
we need to object now loudly and vociferously while it still can be changed or ccp will just get stubborn and dig their heels in and start their techno whine about how difficult it is to change
loud noisesps i love lamp
on evetv the dev said that if you eject from your ship then you sidestep the skillpoint loss as it currently stands so if you know your ship is going down bail out and youll be fine spwisefor those who did not see the interview some things are worth pointing out1 you will not lose skillpoints out of your current list of skills you will only lose skillpoints in the new and relevant skills to piloting a t3 ship2 you will step back one level in your highest skill from the above list3 he said these skills would be rank1 so train fast and at worst you lose maybe 5 days of training4 ccps reason for this was to give you another reason to really care about your ship beyond its monetary valuemake of all that what you will i am not supporting the op since we just do not know and have to wait and see how it works in practice
omgthat sisi patch is 1gb in sizehohum long download
on 3 that is 5 days of training maximum per time a ship is lost i cannot afford thaton 4 that is an insane idea of course i care about my ships a ship that has these consequences to a loss and indeed we have to reserve judgement until we have more hard information is not one im going to buy unless the advantages vastly outweighed the costcaring about losing a ship if that is truly how ccp thinks about it bespeaks a material weakness in how the eve universe is built it lacks good ideas and comes up with nebulous concepts to fill a philosophical goal never a good signnew eden is a real harsh universe i have a rich history of ships that have been reduced to their component parts to prove it it must be possible to devise a coherent and internally consistent rationale for how things work and why things are done a certain way if we go beyond that were in the magic realm of fairy tales and mushrooms ships with interchangeable components great awesome idea a vague notion of why skills should be lost or why it is important to care more about the loss of one ship over another is pure nonsenseand again until we see it with our own eyes and get a real appreciation for how things work in the harsh light between the stars we cant make a final conclusion but i certainly love to speculateabulurd bonifaceme meceo
agreethey turn an awesome idea modular t3 ships into crap
well5 days if you have it trained to l5i admit i do not relish the thought of retraining a skill that said it might be interesting l4 is almost as good as l5 and l4 can be trained in a day or so on this it could be interesting that the pilots you face are not simply done with leet skills no matter how many sp they have maybe they got popped a day before and have lost a bit of that edgejust thinking out loud but it does seem to make the playing field a bit more flexible or at least interestingcould be i think in this age of pvp ships are being largely viewed as disposable due to the massive income earning potential consider how many cap ships bob and goons go through not to mention subcap ships even with bob errthe allilance formerly known as bob having the rug yanked from under it and having 20 cap ships stolen they seem to be hanging in there fine yeah for some people selffinancing or buying fancy faction ships and mods things get pricey but on the whole losing ships is more an inconvenience than anything elseccp i think is looking for something else besides your pocketbook to make you care if you think about it this is functionally no different than say ships having a crew which perform better with experience so if your ship pops you lose that experienced crew and the next ship is staffed by a noob crew lots of games have something like that as a mechanic and you care more about your units or whatever that have levelled upagain just thinking out loud and playing devils advocate as food for thought i do not all know what is in ccps mind of course and i have no clue how this will really play out as you say we kind of have to wait and see i am with you that on the face of it this seems like a bad idea but who knows
if eve were a game where losing a ship simply meant respawning and getting a new one for free then losing a bit of skill every time you die wouldnt be an issuehowever this is not the case currently we all lose isk and if previous new ship releases are any indication these ships will be horrendously expensive the loss of sps on top of losing a horribly pricey ship is a bit much for me at least in my trusty ole deimos and updated clone i wont have to lose precious training time
well i hope these new ships will be better bang for the buck than lolblackops or pvemaraudersespecially when losing skill points i dont mind losing some sp its not like you gonna fly them everyday and lose sp everyday just dont screw the ships before they are in the game
justificationmmmm with gun modules that replicate fall off accuracy range  optimal range firing rates etc isnt that making the game as realistic as possibleso ramming would just be an another realism enhancement  loss of sps cannot be a consideration but loss of ship insurance yes you deliberatly destroyed your ship so insurance is null and void just like in real life that would put off most who would abuse this and gank everyone  they would run of ships very quickly as for you being killed that would depend on ship explosion radiusdamageits an idea that many would like in the game 
rightmany people must be mutes and cant type as i really dont see any support for this topic howeverccp judges what is realistic and what isnt obviously ship ramming wasnt considered realistic to ccp so they didnt add it i feel there is a lot more important issues than being able to ram your ship into another disregarding the complexity of this idea and the fact that suicide ganking would triple in highsec if this were releasedso no isaac
well basically a shielding strong enough to stop the weaponry ingame should have no real problems stopping collisions
i could also agree with a skill that while we could just have 11 itensships on build simultaneus it would allow us to place 11 more in quew to be built as the others would finish
im all for it although i agree with the poster above that it would be too easy for a few players to dominate all the slots in a given area so more station slots and go with the op as well that or increase pos slot usage if you have gone to the trouble of having your own pos then it seems there should be some added benefit
perhaps this has been brought up before and if so i apologize for repeating it i have not seen it but that does not mean anythingover and over i find the 1500m range at which you can access items to always be just shy of what i would like when looting a can being tractored behind me it tends to float just in and out of range i am moving around quickly tooyes i could stop or slow down but it is a hassle in particular though when running my pos no matter how i configure the silosreactorswhatever it is almost impossible to sit on one spot and access all of them as such i have to move 20m one way then 40m the other to access all of themi am not proposing a huge change just make it 2000m and i think itd be fine i understand it should not be too large a range but i do not see that as unbalancing
supporting my own idea
give them an inch they take a footnot supported
lolwell at this rate i can ask for another 500m increase in 2015
well i know my timing might be totally off because ccp has most likely invested a ton of time and money in the new tutorial systemwhen a new player logs onto eve or any player for that matter the first thing he sees is a list of job offerings this list is the eve personal adds with jobs and other weirdness these are bought weekly by corps at set prices xml like format preferablythe player sees an opening for miners and clicks to see details about the corp offering the jobhe then goes to character creation and creates the needed miner he is then directly injected into the player corp and a notifictation is send to ceo and hr membersthis way the tutorial would not really be needed as players would teach new players all they need to knowmy honest impression is that eve is to different and strange to actually create any menaingfull tutorials rather have ccp created or supported really good instructional videos for players to watch
i gotta disagree  a tutorial where you actually do the stuff that is being taught is far more effective than one where you watch a video of the stuff being done
nothe last thing we need is to force new players into a corp where they should be free to make that choice on there owntutorials should be showing you how to play the game not bypassing the npc corp system for the sake of some unforeseen reason by a very obvious biased hidden opinionhowever the system you propose would be most useful if it was completely isolated and treated as a separate feature but it should never be forced upon the player
i am simply stating that i know players that leave the game to early because they never get a grasp of its workings also a lot of players really hate tutorials i do however agree that it might be preferable if its optionalentering eve hasnt exactly become easier 
i know of players who leave the game due to greifers not because they dont grasp the workings of the gameim quite sure they understand all to well how eve works on the surface they just dont take the time to dig a little deeper and sorry to say joining a corp wouldnt change that all they would have to do is join a noob corp and then they get wardeced and your right back where you started
oh but trust issues and griefing aside my statement was about players that find the experience of eve a bit overwhelming as it stands eve is rather tough to enter and if you look at the player base its kind of elitist the age and geekyness in here is considerable and without a few aids it wont change and get the appeal to a wider audiencein all honesty us geeks might have only one character flaw we are not good at sharing our toys we like to keep them to us selves and those that cant hack it are just to dumb however in this case i think in the long run eve can cater and serve a wider range of players and the trend is already on the waythis suggestion was directed at that issuegrief and wardecs belong in other threads and i am not disregarding your claim
problems still here petitioned got a reply working slowly on solutions now havent logged into eve the past 3 days
just wandering if it would be possible to make thisit cant be that hard and its really nice and usefull in channelsmaybe put it on the list with afk and similar status settings
my suggestion is to make defender missiles more useful by making them more versatileright now they make little to no sense yet they could be much more useful if they were not just useless against missiles but useful for anything else drones for example is there really a difference in the eyes of a defender missile between a hostile missile and a droneif defender missiles would be useful way to defend against drones in the immediate vicinity they could end up being used at least by some people
yeahmaybe you could make suggestions on making them more useful otherwise this thread was more pointless than me typing a reply to it isaac
read again read again and then read again you might find a suggestion hidden in the epic masses of my post okay i should not have written so much i knowi think what i really wanted to say is make defender missiles a viable weapon not only against missiles but also against drones
problems with defenders are that they are not viable against missiles  and for drones theres always fofs but really would you sacrifice a high slot only to take out your opponents drones reeeeeeally slowly
hmm i tend to agree that more defense like these could be neededdefenders are missile to missile if i am not mistakenthere could be the addition of point defense gun ammochaffs for bomb launcherdrone scrambler for the scanner launchermany nice new ways to defend
i had an idea for a defender missile fix last summer and it seemed to go over fairly well basically itd make them more versatile by letting people defend each other as well as smoothing out the numbers so you have reason to defend with things other than a rocket launcher the thread is 90locked now but maybe youd be interested in incorporating some of it into your suggestion also thumbsup for a generic make defenders not suck
empire is full of labs  manufacturing facilities with no slots avail not all corps or people can build their own pos yet there is a need for more slots fix it so a corp with a pos can allow remote access to their open slots this would help make pos economically feasible and help those without reliable access
i bet its just too much work though
sounds like a good option
this issue was already raised with ccp and is on the drawingboard
i seem to recall ccp saying it couldnt be done if it can im all for it but dont get your hopes up
tack on rental fee and you got my voteif its doable
i can has linkage
bump
i think and at least hope this will be part of the whole cosmo overhaulso i can be patient till all that magic gets here
i know this has been brought up beforeit would really make a great gamemechanic if we had an incapacitated state on shipsso when you would normally be destroyed the ship would simply be incompliant and unable to move target or anything for a period of time i would suggest something size based for incapacitation times thus a frig would be so for 15 minutes and maybe a titan for 1050 minutesonce incapacitated you would in rp sense be making emergency repair and be able to limp from a battlethe opponent could always simply keep attacking and thus end you the point is to get better negotiation and prolonged combat optionsyou could still have highpaced killing you would simply have to retarget and make the coup de gracealso this would make it possible to maybe save and intervene in combat in a rather interesting fashion
was hoping this would come into playwhen ccp give us if at all subsystem targeting
huhweb  scram  ecmyes it can still use fof missiles and drones sort of but these mechanics exist
i would support this if the ship was completey dead in the water and unable to repair itself without external assistance
it is a cool idea but its not vere evely it really doesnt seem to serve a purpose if i were engaged in small fleet combat and a ship was incapped i would order that a point and web be put on him and just kill him after we do away with his friends the only real thing i see is the victor may be not have lost as many ships which is allways a good thing would need a game mechanic reworking and a little bit more substance
there is also the potential in there of actually capturing shipsand warfare would maybe end up differing from pirating with something like this
meh just blow the ship up this extra not dead stage only gives you longer to cry for blob backup while dyinginstead lets go the other way when your ship is dead your pod dies instantlyfair tradeoff noyeah well dont want your idea either
interesting idea likening to ion cannons in star wars disabling the ship to capture or just hold it hostageproblem with that is no one would ever use it or care about ittoo easy to demand the pilot to eject and take the ship anywayi would only support it if there ship was completely incapacitated for a limited time with only 2 functions available eject or self destruct for obvious reasonstop that off with the fact that a friend could jump start a ship or something
was exactly the point incapacitate for a set time or reducible by a remote hull rep or similar also the option to leave ships lying around for other players to scavenge by repairing and picking them upand yes only options in an incapacitated ship would be eject or self destruct or wait for time out to jumpstart it your selfoh and they could be salvageable in this state so you would first salvage them into a wreck and then salvage the wreck after that balanced ofc
helloas we are a corp that does extortionmerc work ive often had the following question what guarantees do we have that if we pay you will stopthe answer should be the cease fire agreement pact surrender button where the two ceos meet in the same station and open a tradecontract thingy where they agree to the terms of the cease firethe attacking faction should declare for how much time it cannot go back to war against that corpalliance maximum a couple of months and what it asks for as in a contract it could involve isk or stuff that the guy surrendering has said could be used instead of isk or whatnotthe surrendering faction should then review and accept the contract wich would automatically transfer ownership of isk corp wallet to corp wallet andor assetsthus the carebears can feel completely safemaybe only in high sec where the pact prevents the war from being declared for x time but leaves people all the non war ways of killing in accepting a surrender stop killing us plz we pay and we pvpers have a nice way of imposing their demandssupport or no support
id agree to this would even give wis a use
a declares war on bb surrenders gets 8 weeks immunity from aa forms new corp c for one million isk transfers assetsc declares war on btoo easy to work around
other than the obvious flaw its a good idea but the glaring flaw makes it hard to support
yeah sure why not give everything to everyone for free right nowlike someone rightly remarked next the lvl 5s then anything over rank 8 so best do everything in one go right nowno more waiting for skills to finish only fun left no postponed rewards just instant gratificationvery bad idea imo not supportedif possible vets should have the skillpoints refunded and allow them to place it wherever they want if that is to technically complicated then just remove them thann thanks for completely disregarding the months i put in training them ofcourse vets wont be upset if you just take 5mil sp away and give advantage to people who did not have the patience and longterm planning to train themedit and this
gona support this
do you even know why they made warp to 0 bms  lag from what i heard anyway i didnt start playing till warp to 0 was an optiondo you know how many people would make bms to warp to 0a shyte ton thus meaning it would be 4yrs ago again in eve eve is not a scifi movie tis a game and if a ship were to exit out of warp right at the station chances r ship ends up in station and not to mention that eve is a game and not a movieedit i do not support this
this is why warp to 0 was implemented
this highlighted the important bit  signed
do you have a source for that
signed
supported more as a there has to be a better mechanic that ratting for this suggestionnot the wording better not quicker or easier i dont like the idea of paying your sec clean but id like to see the csm investigate the sec status mechanic more closely and see if a better solution can be derived from their discussions
i fully support this
it surprised me greatly that a director in the holding corp could disband the alliance it just never occurred to me what happened happened within the game mechanics and is over and done with that said i feel there should be an apparatus similar to unlocking a bpo in corps a 24 hour wait on confirmation if you will even with that there would be a possibility of someone erasing an alliance but the possibility would be there but the probability would drop greatly
from the mitanni mp3theres no bob towers which means theres no sovereignty for bob so complete regions are wiped out in an instantthey just lost every jumpbridge that they havethey just lost every sov for a capitalthey wont be able to have a jumpbridge for the next monththey wont be able to have a sov 4 for 3 monthsthey wont have any cyno jammersall at a click of a button i think everyone is fine with eve being a harsh world or go find another game tbh the above seems out of line with this though it takes months  years to build something up it takes months to go to war to take that away from an alliance with logstics planning resources etc all required but all of this can be bypassed by one person by one or two clicks with no time period and no one can intervene votes as with most things should be neededthe irony of this people complain about an entire fleet being wiped out by a single button when talking about titans notably goonswarm doing the complaining but they cheer the wiping out an entire alliance with a single button the mechanics are very different but the concept is the same so i am suprised to see the alliances in here defending the ability to wipe out an alliance are the same ones who want to see titans taken out of the gamebob goons tcf ra etc doesnt matter the alliance that it happens to there seems to be lacking a balance to this ability even if the founder of the alliance goes off the reservation all ceos of the alliance should get the vote
actually it is 2 x  of corps in the alliance but that still pretty easy plus a few more for looting the alliance wallets and the holding corp wallets and hangars though this probably still didnt take more than 30 minutes a mere pitance in time for the devastation it caused
you seem pretty clueless  but on the assumption youre not trying to be a troll if rats are pirates  then pirates are taking over empire space because you find them in caldariamarrminmatargallente spaceseems caldariamarrminmatargallente cant control their spacebut rats are also found in non caldariamarrminmatargallente spacemake sensedidnt think so
i have to addmit too that empire or high sec starts to be to crowed not yet over but soon i dont know that is in the game that kind dynamic system that solarsystemUFFFDs security level is not stabile i think that sec level should be dynamic like when 05 system has lot of ppls and there is 04 side of if that 04 should rise to 05 in time areas where is no ppls for a long time should drop alsoat 00 this should be faster because now some corpsalliances just keep 00 areas and collect fruits from there so getting higher sec level spawns complex and so on would get worse and not so good so that way habited areas would go deeper and deeper in time if more ppls starts playing high sec area would expand but also get small if ppls just stop playing or being in that areaimho in next upgrade 05 sec level rise to empire solar systems so in there those place what are over 45 should turn to safe space and would also give more space to ppls everyone can not go explore 00 or these new wormhole placies but getting some new 05 for live would be nice also those who have pos in high sec have to get more standings or find new place for pos from lower sec system these pos in 04 system should also give huge boost to system sec level so it would turn high sec even faster
why was the lotto dropped in first place i worked for a year to improve my lotto chances only to have the lotto dropped i really get upset over this there are those with t2 bpos that have an advantage i will never have even a chance at its not right invention costs to get a bpc and the bpo holders pay nothing to generate bpcs i hate it when games eve isnt alone give unfair advantage to older players by nerfing stuff for the younger ones while leaving it intact for the older players to use the ship analogy how would you like it if they nerfed armor for instance but only for players younger than 2 years
if you want to have such a forum for players to prioritize go for it  it will see use and itll have some merit but be aware of the reason why youre elected representatives instead of just random players  forum whining has proven to be a bad system if representatives carry through on the platform that they were elected on then voters have to make one decision per election period and have the ability to go back to their games knowing that someone who thinks like they do is in charge the more input you offer people the fewer will take advantage of it and the more you wind up heeding the opinions of the loudmouth geekslike me instead of average players voter percentages may be low but theyre way higher than youll get for something like this youre opening yourself up to a loudocracyfor lack of a better word again  players may want to vote once per six months when you advertise the crap out of it but how many will vote when its poorly advertised on a small forum and is three times as often youll get some hundreds but thats not the several thousands who voted for you to represent them it narrows the decisionmakers severely which gets us back to the old system in some ways that isnt a criticism per se  i think that this would probably be a good thing on the whole but be aware of the drawbacks  we elect representatives so we dont have to do everything ourselves be careful what you delegate back to us  accountability is good but a tsunami of minutia is bad this is on the right side of that line i think but be cautious

pos are owned by a corp with an alliance affiliation if the corp changes from one alliance to another it takes 7 days to gain sov if a second alliance had a pos and the major alliance lost sov it would take 7 days for the secondary alliance to gain it the numbers just dont add up for me maybe ccp or a knowledgeable csm can respond
srry i meant i hate roleplaying now
fully support this
not sure if i should take the risk and buy me a nag or nid just because i love the shipslook and pray they buff them or just cross train and get thany or moros instead nid race bonus does not make sense at all for being a matar ship ccp crew drunk or smoked pot while doing this this should been fixed when they were looking over nags slot layout
what i like about online gaming is that you can easily type three letters and avoid chatting if you are busy afk can be invaluable at times and that is why i have come up with a couple of improvements to this functionthe first being when you type the letters afk i eaither caps lower case or any part therof it will place a symbol beside your picture for all to seei know what you are all thinking this is a waste of time we do not need it but that is quite to the contrary think bak on how many times you have logged in and tried to talk to a freind in one of many channels heshe uses and had no response then think of the options available to see if they are afk you can hail them ineach windowsend them a message or hijack them into a new chat al of wich take time and the last two of wich can be irritating if they are in the middle of a missionthis function i propose would enable you to immediatly see if the person wants to be contacted if it was placed in one chat box it would automatically appear in all of them by your picture andwould be removed upon talking with audio or typing in a chat boxof course there would need to be several options available to configruee this to suit you but i think i will leave that part to eveif you have any comments regarding this post please let me know i would greatly appreciate itmany thankssilverswann
like supported though i think the topic has been raised in the past
back to the top until it gets some csm support lost more kills because of this issue edit tired grammer mistake
i agree it pretty much is a massive disincentive insofar as you almost must fit a a scan res mod on to stand a chance and are even therefor gimped in combat nanoships like vagas should be close but double sensor boosting shouldnt be a necessity to initiate pvp in low or highsec
1 this isnt discrimination they are meaningless insults and trash talkthis isnt going to change ccp can go bat crazy trying to ban any of this in that they start losing tons of cash and working much harder then they need to because those insults will simply evolveinstead of calling you gay or a moron theyll call you a furry or invent something new to be insulting and offensivetoo which you come right back complaining about the new offensive thing you cant win your offensive political correctness crusade until all offensiveness is removed from the game it cant happenso go back 2 hello kitty
im going to have to side with the mob here on this one you choose to become offended by looking at offending material my corp has heterophobic statements in its corp description but id imagine thered be as much scorn and derision to any petition regarding that as youre receiving besides people are mostly using stereotypes in an incorrect or characterized context such asyoure gaythats gaygayif you want to make it your personal crusade to inform people of the correct use egregious violations like corp or character names such as gaysmustdie you can petition successfully but seeking to use ccp as a sword against intolerance is a line most people would not willingly cross
the day ccp starts kicking people around for the op is the day i can petition to have the op permanently banned for being a total idiot and prejudiced
approximately 40 of the mineral market stems from recycled loot drops these figures do not include reprocessing of playerbuilt items which are not a source of minerals ie a point where they enter the game for the first time this robs miners of a significant share of the market making mining in most cases a poorlypaid and somewhat redundant profession a more detailed breakdown followssource

i spoke to diagoras yesterday theyre hoping to have it out later todaytomorrow he was suggesting that it is the largest dev blog ever written for eve
thanks for the update oz
i dont care about individual names but i would like to see which corporations and alliances were involved
dev blog is up
that still violates their rules so no live with it the dev blog was as thorough as i had hoped and i applaud ccp for being as frank as they could have been thanks as i also suspected this pos bug didnt hurt eve as much as everyone said it did a testament to the game thanks ccpisaac
is any of this stuff going to make it into apocryphaits been a loooong time since there has been any word on this
no
youll force them into 1 man corps that they will simply leave the moment you wardec themyou cant force people into pvp they will find ways around it or leave
make it cost isk to make corps 
then you make it harder for people to form corps this argument has tried and died it just doesnt work sorry
i want the tax for newb corps to be similar to real lifethe more isk you earn the more tax you have to pay
yes lets punish the corps even morereal smart genius real smartnot
alright i stay in npc corp because i enjoy helping other people what youre implying is that new players should only get advice from the rookie help channel filled with spam players who just joined a few months ago and alts whose only purpose is to stay there for help reasons no thanksthe wardec fee is already laughable and you want to reduce it even more wardec individual players can you say gameending griefingtake a reality pill and stop forcing people to play the game the way you think they should if you want a higher tax in npc corps remove another penalty we already have such as the inability to erect a pos or the crappy fleet mechanics
interesting idea allow a form of war dec of individuals in an npc corp of a certain number of kills then the war dec expires and cannot be renewed for a certain amount of timethisa gives the ability to deal with alt scouts a major issue in high sec conflictsb removes a degree of protection from those in npc corps without leaving them completely open to harassmentc gives the ability to strike at a mission runner or trading alt if you figure out someone you are in conflict with has onethere is of course the problem of it allowing more harassment of individuals other than that i see few other problems except the difficult of implamenting in a programming sense
threadi wish csm had moderation rights here to cut out this kind of crap first post in features and ideas and if the idea gets some attention and favorable comments then come to assembly hall
you want more targets we get ityou think every ship that mounts a mining laser is a macro miner we get ityou think everyone who plays this game should play it the way you do we get ityou think that posting the same suggestion 23 times a week is going to make ccp look beyond their subscription numbers and make a radical policy change we get itwtb a sticky thread listing the dead horses the have been been beaten until nothing but a faint bloodstain is left with forum bans for people who insist on indulging in public sadistic equine necrophilia
actually he doesnt want everyone to play like he does he want everyone to line up in mining ships while he shoots everyone without any risk involveduntill wardeccing is more than pay to grief i wont support any boost to ityes it is pay to grief how many wars are started for real reasons even wardeccing miners so you can prevent them from strip mining your belt is fine for me if you want to stripmine that belt yourself but right now the reason for 90 of the wardecs is easy targets
i reckon youd be surprised by how many wardecs are genuine attempts to hamper what are thought to be logistics corporations for larger political entities i dont in any way attempt to deny that a large proportion of wardecs are done to milk tears from carebears but to use the term griefing is a blatant attempt to invalidate this playstyle  a playstyle that has been validated time and time againwardecs perhaps need some love but not as a priority the entire corporate side of eve needs work
youd be surprised how many of them are greif warshang around rens sometime youll find out real quicktheres always something going down in rensfrarnand surrounding systemsbrutor tribe treasury is always station campedyes im quite sure there are valid wars but those wars are overshadowed by greifing ones
in every 00 corp i have been in wardecs were issued against us once in a while to disrupt our logistics of course not they just hope to get some player autopiloting through high secdisrupting the real logistics of a 00 or low sec alliance so not just killing random player of that alliance hauling his stuff that is not possible grab a cov ops go to a jump bridge which is part of their main logistics route and watch all the neutral freighters coming through either they all went nrds or do you use alt corporations for their logisticsof course there are real wardecs but i think that right now by far the most wardecs are just to get easy targets
you completely and utterly missed my point wardecs on alliances are usually done by headstrong pvp corporations who are willing to risk the wrath of the blob for the chance to gank a few lone haulers and other ships in lowsec pipes as the individual takes their stuff out or back from 00 space what im talking about is alt logistics corps running fuel etc for 00 alliances sometimes even getting standings with enemy alliancesthe hunting of these corporations is and always will be a big thing as anyone with half a brain who is involved in serious alliance warfare knows that if you want good logistics keep a portion of it neutral it is these neutral corporations  or more accurately corporations that are suspected of being involved in alliance logistics  that are often the target of independent mercenary contracts and hence receive wardecs
a lone hauler is not the same as logistic operations of the alliance what you were talking about risk of the blob you mean safety of the station no one who isnt really bored actually bothers to fight those wardeccers because they just dock up anywayand wardeccing their logistics corp so they corp hop to another one or just to an npc corp
change the wardec mechanic so an individual can be wardecced and problem solved
youre preaching to the converted a change to the entire corporation mechanics  interface is required including revision of wardec mechanics i just thought that id mention that again so you know there can be no confusionerm please quote me for clarity purposes i discussed logistics corporations from the getgo and you started focusing on war decs on alliances now were talking about lone haulers my god get a grip man  that was a rebuttal to your lack of initial understanding and you manage to move yet further off on a tangentagain comprehension for the win its the corporation who declares war who risks the blob you nit as eventually in these situations one of two things happens the wardec expires because they didnt get any kills at all as their target wasnt as dumb as they thought or they get too many kills the alliance sees a trend on their killboards and organises a fleet to go blob them into surrendersee abovethat qualifies as disrupting logistics standings need set assets need moved from corporate hangers etc etc that causes a nuisance and that falls well within the boundaries of disruptioni really cant decide are you stupid or just trolling
sorry i misread your first post you were indeed talking about logistic corporationshowever what remains is that those wardecs are only a small minority of all the wardecs and it isnt that much work to set some new standings in providence new standings are applied every day changing a new hauler corp to blue isnt much workand while i cant speak for all 00 corporation the ones i have been in all had it pretty simple during a wardec just stay outside high sec they wont come anywhere where someone might shoot them so you are safe in low sec and 00 from them hunting them down is discouraged because it only results in less people defending 00 and more people who watch docking games in high sec attacking them doesnt work they dock up everyone just waits out their week of wardec when the wardeccer will switch to deccing another alliance
what seems to me if they undock you can force them to pvp you just target them then start clicking on all those shooty things in your high slots and voila they are forced into pvp
what makes you think theyll undock they can just spend a week fiddling with the market or playing a different alt or playing hello kitty island adventureyou havent forced them to pvp just forced them to not play that character keep it up long enough theyll decide to spend their money elsewhere you can call that a win i suppose but youre hurting ccp more than you are your erstwhile opponent
while that will work for mission and rat farmers it does not work for trade alts the corp does not tax sales from income generated from items being sold
a clear why dont we have that as a feature in npc and pc corps
the thing that prolly bugs me the most is ideas grow and not all programmers are gamers does this skill loss thing stop here does it creep down the line in a few expansions into regular skills also ccp needs to understand that the player base as a whole does not want to lose skills
lol
i guess well see t3 in empire only huh the way i understood it was the skill is in the ship not the person so the longer you pilot the ship etc the better you will becomethere is only one way ccp could fix this if it is still training dual skill training for t3allow us to still keep training our skills like we normally would but while were sitting in the ship it trains up the t3 skill as welldo that and i can see people using them more often
we wont see t3 in empire only there will be pilots who choose to take the extra risk in order to take advantage of the extra edge these ships will almost certainly provide
at the sticker price these things are probably going to come to the market at it might be better just to use a carrier for that edgethe first few of these are going to be in the billions because they will be rare as more and more come into play they will drop down in price however unless the drop rate is incredible like say salvage then these things will be pricey at best considering they are targeted to be the middle ground between t1s ok at a lot master of none and t2 master of this but useless everywhere else i doubt the average pvp or fleet ops will have these in runningimagen taking a bugattie to the local biker bar sure youll see some pricey bikes at in the parking lot but youll stick out like fat man at an anorexic bikini conversion
this is odd id never thought ill be asking for something that is not yet on tranquility but i ask the csm representatives to please support this thread if they agree with me and many othersplease give us the option to retain the current soon to be the old fitting screen that psd example from korbin looks easy to implement so to include t3 requisites but it is light years better than the new fitting screen in lots of ways please ccp dont give us pointless bling bling while sacrificing all usability that is expected from any windowi raise this question to the csm now because it is surely going to take ages if ever to be attended andor acknowledged as the grave mishap this change is to become
well other than the subsystems hard pointsand i dont know what those arewhat is any different about this old fitting screen
huhwhere what changei dont see whats so different then the subsystem thing
so how does this have anything to do with the introduction to the gamehonestly forcing them to join a corp head on right from the start is like shoving a kid who doesnt know how to swim into the deep end of the poolits implied even if you say its not forcedthis is also a veiled route to avoid npc corpingyou really arent thinking this through and thats for suredont get me wrong i see whyand i understand your intentions but this is the wrong way to go about itrookie chat is more useful at that rate
the number of players that lose interest in eve because they dont get used to the social aspects and the importance of support in learning the game is bigger than most might thinkto many people i ask to try it out wants to try building alone sure that is their option but they should be advised even pushed a bit to enter a real corpthey can always leave if they decide to try their luck alonewhat i am saying is that you can play eve solo but learning eve solo is next to impossible and when trying the steepness breaks many a spiritdraco tbh eve could really benefit from nudging the noobs into the social aspect its the only way to actually give the full experience of the game
add 10 skill loss upon being podded and ill support it as well
nothe system in place is an ancient greek style of democratic congress everyone is allowed to propose debate and support ideasthe csm acts as a governing body above the congress picking the ideas that seem to be the most supported and then pressing them upon the oligarchy that is ccpnot supported the only thing missing from assembly hall is a thumbs down feature
going to put a small comment on this onei admit i am rather fond of many features from ircis there any reason not to add more of these in ingame channelsi would also find it rather nice with being able to get user enters and user exits in chat preferably as an on off feature to avoid weird flooding in very used channels
ok so i was thinking everyone is moaning and sayin just kill it off but what if ccp likes it and keeps it or maybe all we need to do is to think of a solution and iv made one or sort offok so i came up with the idea of a skill that can anti the sp loss a certain reduction in the loss of it all and its pretty simple no ties to it no other stuff and a extra skill and sp requirments could be learning skills have them up to a certain standard and then have this skill in the learnings catagory this way the learning will allso have more of a use towards something and it will help with the problem a little the percentage would be up to ccp deciding how much it reduces it by its not a big solution but its something that will be effective and ccp dont have to put alot of thought into it since there concentrating on all bugs with the expansionjust a thought on matter sorry if i havent given more info but its late and im tired lol d

what is the status of the small freighter project at this point last one said about it was that it is under developmentin reference to this old thread csm  ccp meeting 001  0036 small freighters
the orca is the ship designed to fill that role
thank you i was reading the orca dev blog and was a little confused because the ship sounds more like a hybrid transportmining support ship rather than a pure transport ship
orcas overall carrying capacity makes up for the freighter short fall
tldr nerf assembly hall boost features  ideas discussionthis little gem of a quote appeared in the nerf npc corps thread and i couldnt resist hijacking it as its a cracking idea in and of itself i cant remember who this is accredited to but ill post up the name in my own supporting post beneath this onei think this really hits the nail on the head  allow only the csm members new topic rights on this forum or create another group for this purpose and have ideas posted into fi then transferred across if the idea receives favourable responses theres already a significant amount of cross posting and lets face it why would anyone post an idea in fi when theyll get exactly the same feedback and a much higher probability of ccp feedback by posting in the ah
the original post can be found here by hugh ruka
other ideas of moderation have been brought forward before
make them so if you have a locked target they act just as normal missiles do if you dont have a lock they act like fofs but you have the ability to choose their target but this means you have to be really quick and the missiles might hit before they change target or run out of spoom obviously if ur torps only go 40km and ur 30km from the target and they went 15km in the opposite direction the torps wont hit
youre proposal failsif youre jammed you cannot lockif your sensor dampened below locking range you cant lockif you can lock then you dont need fof missilesi much better idea is to have fof for short range missiles not just long range missiles
the idea is for convenience  this way you can use fofs without having to spend 10 seconds swapping missiles every time you gain or lose lock a rather ingenious use of t2 status and i like it im not a fan of the ability to pick a target without lock but the basic ability to be either a normal missile or a fof missile is good
make them useful fit a rocket launcher ii and load it with defenders
i think one of the reasons why defenders have largely been neglected such as shared defense is not so much the coding issues as it is missiles are already a poor pvp form as is and further use would just nerf an already gimped weapons system
linkage
just like it says in title give us the option to add bookmarks to the overview and an additional option to show the bookmarks in space as celestial beaconsthis will make certainformsof exploration much easier and more enjoyable
it is original but i dont like it besides that will it also stop those from looting from inside a tractor as well
while i have run many missions ive never seen a ninja salvager but i do have to say if that i am the one putting in the effort to do the mission and then someone comes along as i am killing the npcs and starts taking the salavge which i earned by killing the ship i would be rather annoyed now tbh i usually bring my alt with me into the missions in a salvage ship makes things go fast and simple and in the end i sit with the big ship as the alt finishes up the salavaging goes and deposits they stuff and comes back ready for more worse case if i am on my own i take some secure cans pop on a salvager and tb and shove it all into the secure can so after i can go switch to a hauler and come get it i would have say i am for aggro rights on ships i have nuked if someone tries to take the salvage much like if they tried to take the can i am curious to know if in the event the op enters a mission area and is asked politely by the mission runner not to salvage because he will be doing so would he leave would the op or any other ninja salvager ask when they arrive in an area if the mission runner is going to salvage would you still salvage if the mission runner says yes i am going to salvage but i have to switch out ships to do so not everyone can afford two accounts or wants too
so what eve needs is more carebears in 00 and custom paint jobs i love the use of the word cater there it really shows your gross misunderstanding of eve eve doesnt cater to anybody period it presents opportunities and challenges and allows the players to make the most or least of bothif you want easier access to 00 as an industrialist you need to find a way to make your organization valuable to the entities living there or you need to add a combat division to your alliance in general the entities that live there now have already solved the issues you would attempt to solve for them that is why eve doesnt cater to industrialists who want access to 00 it expects them to use diplomacy or combat to get there and its not eves fault if they cant or dont want to do soyour hatred for bruce has blinded you from the beauty of what it provided sure in the end we failed but up until then we accomplished many things eve presented us the opportunity to try those things and it also allowed for us to fail when we made bad decisions or faced a stronger opponent that is how it should be the game doesnt need to cater to anybody it provides risk and reward and manages them quite well
sorry ex thought you were commenting more in general terms about the options rather than giving a specific way of doing it and yup the alternates were extremely see what i did there  helpful for this meeting
its very simple and is a known feature since ages backindeed it takes 7 days for a pos to start claiming sov but once it has started claiming sov the corporation owning the pos can switch to a different alliance and at the next dt the pos will have claimed sov1 exactly what happened herethe poss in question were already up claiming sov for bob in the various corps names when the alliance vanished when the former bob corps merged in a new alliance their pos some who have been up and running claiming sov for years triggered the sov system after dt thus giving sov1 to rkzthis mechanic has created a great deal of confusion in the past during large sov fights where sov seemed to switch randomly to the untrained eyewhat happened in several of those cases was that the tower count was rather equal say 5vs7 in favour of alliance a all towers in the system having been up for atleast 7 days yeah these things took time when 20dreads was alotalliance b then decides to go blow up 3 pos from alliance a instead of spamming 3 new towersalliance a fails to understand the mechanics and are generally ed screaming devhaxx and whatnot when sov changes over dt instead of the 7 days they thoughtso old mechanic yet again creating havoc
i have to agree thos of us with tons of stuff aquired over the years that we are too cheap to throw out needs a sorting mechanismi support this completely
its indeed pretty weird i use the asset manager app to locate stuff because i put everything in containers to sort it
just do the same for ships would be handy if i got tabs there too
this is very good criticism and i support your viewpoints you came up with very well thought out points of logic and i will most likely change my outline accordingly i suggest more people give me this kind of feedback
signedcaldari are now the joke race not only do caldari ships have to rely on mid slots for tanking reduces tackling ability but if they decide to tackle as in webscram so ur missiles can actually do some damage they loose their tanking abilitythe missile nerf went way toooooooooo far they should at least reverse it partially
oops forgot to check support so here i gothe main concern from whiners is that noobs do too much damage with missiles so even if they dont want to reconsider reprogramming the whole thing add 25 or more dunno how much is decent to every skill level for target nav prediction instead of 10 and 10 instead of 5 for the skill reducing explosion radius same with the missile implants
actually i would fall on my knees and kiss ccps feet if my large guns could hit a ceptor with 116 of their dps d

this that said however i like things the way they were missiles vs turrets actually provide for some diversity in the game mechanics even if my large turrets do 0 damage to interceptor
would like to see cruise missiles and torps generally hitting bs for full damagewould like to see hamsheavys hitting for mostly full damage against cruiser targetswould like to see rockets and standards do the samewould also like to see hamsrockets be worth using compared to their long range counterparts  a blaster does 60 more dps than a railgun a ham does 25 more dps than a hml
i support the concept not the actual methodi would like to have the option to set my status to afk or do not disturb additional options like chat welcome and invisible could be nice to even though i can already hear those scream who think of the addressbookbuddylist more as an inteltool
posting for general support of afk notification in chat channels im not too fussy about the details so long as i can manually set myself afk when im leaving the keyboard and clear it when i get back at a minimumit would definitely help avoid general awkwardness when chatting to someone whose status you havent yet established
have you thought about how this gives out more intel or can be used to fake flag afk as a trap
thisnot supportedwould be abused too easily and its just too easy to type afk in chat anyway
wellid say as soon as you do anything in the game any clickanythingmaybe even just move your mouse the afk tag should dropid also add an automatic afk tagging if your client detects no input whatsoever for say 30 minutes the tag gets appliedalso i personally would never ever assume a hostile with an afk tag was actually afk and id act as usual
yay for more support you guys are restoring my faith in the community to get more specific what i am proposing is that the second you leave highsec you can moon mine anchor anything with the 03 requirement ie no 00 only stuff delegate fighters not be subject to a charterstandings requirementas far as the comments about 01 pirate playgrounds and the like that is an entirely different subject personally i would like to see sliding scale sec hits between 04 through 01 but seriously totally different subject the point here is to eliminate the 0403 distinction and i still havent managed to find even one logical argument for said distinction so keep up with the support and lets get this bad larry escalated and on the damn table
general signage 04 is indeed lowsec
gay used to be a way to describe joyous happy lively ect these days its grown to be a slang term i think youre being a tad too serious bastard used to be a really aweful word probably the worst insult you could use against someone these days it isnt seen like that anymore i doubt a lot of people who call things gay really foster a great hatred against the glbt community they may not agree with it and that is their full right if you see real discrimination then report it and else lighten up a bit
as the subject says the majority of players fly t1 ships of bs size and smaller  lets have some more variety please areas which specifically need a lot more attention are destroyers and battlecruisers
id like to see 5 more frigates for each race as well why not
i would love it if faction ships got splitted into common and uncommon faction ships whenever i fly an angel mission i pop dozens of dramiels yet when i want to fly one i have to pay about 5060 million for it i wonder how the angel syndicate is able to afford that sure they build them yet they could make more money than with crime if they just sold them themselves makes no senseso why not turn ships like the dramiel into something slightly better like an archangel dramiel with some minor buffs and unique features or as a tech ii version of the dramiel and at the same time make the basic dramiel a ship that can be bought and sold on the market for a reasonable priceim only using the dramiel as an example of course and i got one already or two i dunnothen there are all the other pirate ships that players cannot even fly at all not even as faction ships who cares if these ships are crap or the hottest stuff ever make them available in one form or anotherthe addition of 12 extra destroyers per empire faction would also be cooltech 3 gives big time candy to the big skill and money players give something to the lower end of the scale too
i couldnt agree with you morepirate ships provide a unique set of bonuses you cant get with the standard races and have some of the best looking hulls but a relegated to underpowered except sansha and incredibly expensive faction ships besides what sounds better than a domination macherial or dark blood ashimmuid love to see a khanid set of t1 ships for amarr except for possibly frigatestheres definitely room for 1 more destroyer per race though fixing the existing ones should be a higher priority and 1 more bc per race one more bs and cruiser couldnt hurt either
destroyers are due for their second tier
more ships  good
totally agree eht3 is interesting and all that but just sounds like theyll be too costly to use anywhere other then your lvl2 missionssome variation in the affordable range would be awesomeand i want my force recon drake damnit
eh why notsigned
destroyers really need another tier or 2 as that is what new players get into quite early on and can be in a long time another bc wouldnt hurt either
signed  lets have some stuff that really matters to new players more little ships please
true but also even if you just introduced more frigates it would add a dynamic to the current system
how about a third battlecruiser i love bcs in many ways they are the poor mans bs there are three bs classes why not 3 bc classes
i would really like to have more variety so there isnt just tier 1 2 3 of a ship class where in general tier 3 is the best and only one worth using
great idea
like this idea
as with my corpies above i like this idea and am supporting itpersonally id love to see this implemented in any future sov rework  or at least something similar too it both as a preventative measure in regards to what we have seen recently as part of the bobkenzoku thing and just because from an outsiders point of view for the moment sov itself is a broken mechanic and does need fixing  as to how it needs it ill leave that argument to be presented by people with more experience of it than i have
reprocessing is like refininglootings is like miningso if you wanna change reprocessing you have to change refining you want that no40 of the minerals in the market are fromr eprocessing good that means miners can only supply 60 it would be more if they could supply moreit isnt broken perhaps the loot drops are there wouldnt be as much reprocessing if the drops were worth keeping anyway nothing needs to change
the only change id make would be to reduce all empire refineries to 38 instead of 50 well that and removing unnamed t1 drops from missions
thisremove unnamed t1 loot from missions and not only do you reduce what many view as free minerals on the market and depressing prices but also open the door for people to build t1 items which is a great stepping stone for new buildersa loss associated with reprocessing should always existyou never get back as much as you put in
this a good step toward general transparency in dealing with violations
just as i expected not even worth expressing frustrationswhen will the current ccp game design team will retire it seems there is some kind of dev rotation schedule at least we used to have some good devs before the current ones took over
quit crying about it the expansion is huge but not related to ship balance unless your willing to take over ccp you have no reason to complain about it isaac
they have more than enough people to work on 2 things at a time and they had months to add the fuel bays  at least sorry your excuse doesnt fly in real business world
actually and i say this as someone who is no friend of ephemeron but he is correctremember when amarr were hoplessly broken for 2 years people mentioned what was wrong and nothing happened then a amarr whiner single handedly created a massive amarr campaign informing the general eve public approx 86 of eve was nonamarr at the time of exactly what was wrong with amarr and with thousands of posts in a short period of time ccp relised that amarr had a issue and then fixed itaparently it turned out that ccp was balancing amarr vs other races with damage modules etc but forgot that amarr lacked infinite cpugrid to fit said modules in a noncomedy setup even laser thoraxs performed better than laser amarr cruisers in every single way added to this was things like eanm effecting changes to real world setups etc etc but that a long story and you can read up on eve search about itso what is the lesson if you dont tell people something is wrong then you can be waiting for 2 years with nothing happening and no recognition of the issue if any company does something wrong how on earth can they fix it if they do not know how can someone make something a priority if people do not express the issues regarding itas it stands black ops is hediously broken and in my opinion needs to be taken to the drawing board and compleatly redone as a small gang ship baised on real world pvp all the last csm crew did was to use black ops to boost a transport shipephemeron if you ever run for csm then you got my vote since i guess most of the previous csm have probebly never solosmall gang pvped unless its market pvp or mining pvp gotta mine em all
even if i had the time i wouldnt make a good csm candidate i dont really enjoy having long meetings and talking in circles about some simple issue also it doesnt help that i lost confidence in ccps performance on issues of game designhonestly i just want to see the current game design team to be replaced so we can have a fresh new start maybe we can get lucky with devs that actually care and dont suffer from goumindong logic syndromesorry for being overly negative lately
no problems sorry for getting antsy about it indeed a large proportion of wardecs are like this and have been since the fabled privateer nerf way back when what the privateer nerf showed us was that there was a genuine scalable way to provide serious disruption to alliance logistics through wardec mechanics and that as a work around for this problem that ccp then later took a different approach to remedying that of scalable war dec fees was that logistics pilots would simply enter npc corporationsits this scenario that i feel requires the most attention im not against the multitude of mechanics on offer to evade pvp as many people do im against it being possible to have a predominantly pvp playstyle and have logistics alts directly helping this playstyle including my own hauler alts to be fair entirely safe from all but the suicide ganker it is for this reason that i support discussion over npc corp tax mechanics and indeed any discussion over the npc corporation problem
because you could not make profit in lots of scenariosthere is no way to tax the profit of trading by an automated system how should the client know how much of the stuff you sold were win and how much actually the cost associated with getting itthere is a tax already on trading say somone sells an item for 1m his profit is only 10k per item because he has to pay however 990k then he has to pay 1 in corp tax  no profit made lets say the tax is 10 then he would not win anything even if it costs him only 900k if the tax is 50 he needs to sell the item at double costs to come even without any profityou see the problem
taxing trading would work just fine scale the broker taxes based on the corporate tax rate
you read what i wroteif there was a way to determine profit it would be no problembounties and mission rewards are pure profit minus ammunition but thats a very small cost while buy and sell orders are not so traders that are in corps with additional taxes would be in a major disadvantage leading to more traders in npc corps or 1 man corps without taxes if npc corps would get it too
i read exactly what you said yes im afraid you missed pretty much the entire pointthisitll lead to traders eitherliving alone in their corp dogged by wardecs and constantly moving aroundbanding together with a few other traders in a lowno tax corp to form a group that can more robustly defend itself and makes a name for itself thereby reducing the number of incoming wardecsjoin a large lowno tax corporation or alliance to benefit from the security through obscurityany way you look at it it nerfs npc corps without affecting the possible profits on trade for the individual willing to play the risk vs reward game which is sadly quite absent from market pvp compared to other forms of pvp the only difference is that it would scale the cost of trading based on corporate taxes note the wording there based on taxes not at the same rate as which in turn would render moving out of the npc corp for a trading character a more appealling ideato clarify lets say a corporation has a 10 tax rate and a given sell order has a 10000 broker fee in a zero tax corporation that broker fee would be 10000 whereas in a 10 tax corporation that fee would rise to 11000 the percentage is applied to the existing broker fees not to the sale value of the items broker fees themselves may of course need reevaluated but thats something that could be done in tandem
my object is that eve is a balance of risk vs rewardnpc corps give almost 0 risk yet have very high rewards i do not believe this is a good balance
almost 0 risk yeah makes sense nowcant do squat other than soloing yep makes sensetry plugging in your brain before you make such statements
you forgot to put on your helmet
yes but thus a trader in the corporation makes 100 isk less that the other trader can cut of and sell for less thus having more customers thus driving the corporation trader out of marketone man corps for traders constantely wardecced yes until the trader leaves and makes a new one or plays market games the whole week long without leaving stationthere is no real way to tax traders until it is possible to define what is profit for him which is impossible sry and taxing npc corps anyway why just that they need to join pcs that you can wardec them hell why not leave them alone its a playstyle that doesnt want more pvp than the occasional suicide gankerjust because they dont want to play withagainst you does not mean they should not be able to play at all i dont really know what you have to moan about with carebears anyway they do their stuff you do yours if you are a lowsec pirate and moan about noon coming there think about it why would i come there if you just shoot my down in a gatecamp thats the impression anyway even if its not trueif you are a highsec pvper and moan about npc corps think about why they dont join player corps because they dont want to be wardecced but why do they have fear of that becuase you can wardec without a reason just to kill them and thats why they wont leave npc corps so they want to use existing game mechanics to protect themselves as you use game mechanics to kill them isnt that legit you wanting to change the mechanics so you can kill more of them is just the same as some of them wanting to change the mechanics to not be killed by you id call you pvp carebears i think because you are too lazy to use the game as it is and just want it easier
you and i need to meet in game and have a drink  o 
sorta kinda thisbut the impression is good enoughpeople should never be forced to do anything in particulari would classify 3 groups in npc corps1 noobs  people who have no bloody idea whats going on for the most part2 small fry  they know enough to realize that without a ton of isk and man power some jerk is going to wardec them3 alt  likely the alt of a player in a player corp snooping around or doing business normally not possible on the maini left out 1 group corp jumper thats likely the only reason this stupid proposal exsistsand until you recognize and respect the first 3 groups you got a snowballs chance in hell in getting support
well put also im online  and you owe me a beer
right tax the alliances for the moon mining products and the titans they own
troll 
yeah you quote his quip but not his several paragraph long dissection of your argumenttry at least acting like an intelligent person if youre going to shamelessly bump your own topic
sorry at work x o dill look you up when i get back tonighto7
you dont notice a logic fallacy there if you tax the activity in a npc corp you damage the people playing while in it but you dont effect in any way the hauling alts they dont need to get paid to work for the main they can accept cargo contracts at 0 cost the player can use a corp affiliate character to buy and sell without ever leaving the station and give the stuff to the hauler character only when he need to move it taxable isk moved in the hauler wallet  0 zero nothing nada so it will do nothing to deter hauling alts but will damage people that play and want to stay npc corps
has already been brought up a few hundred times go read the other threads why the answer is no
the other threads have weak arguments its mostly carebears whining about wanting to be safe 
yeah and whether you like it or not there are more people in empire space than 00the minority will never rule the majority so while the entire corp system needs an overhaul pathetic attempts like this to forcegrief people will not fly
i would like to propose a different solution to the problemmaintenance feesyoud like to own and operate a titan great thatll cost you 14 million isk a week in maintenance in addition to the stuff you pay for already of course frigates will cost you say 500 and we scale up from there that covers things like keeping the rats out of the wiring ground crew salaries etc etcoh and docking fees that would be another good way to soak up excess isk because after all thats what this thread is really aboutrightvel
your joking rightdo you even know what it takes to maintain a titan hell even i dont know i know they aint cheap thats for surebout the only thing that made sense there was a docking fee but what happens if your bankrupt oh im sorry you cant leave because your brokewell frak that guess i better beg for iskoh wait they dont like thatcome on people lets try to come up with rational ideas pleaseand stop treating this like an isk inflation problemyou want a source for isk inflationkick the macro miners in the groin theres your problem right there
lol drake i was being sarcastic because we all know this thread has absolutely nothing to do with too much isk in the game and everything to do with someone wanting to be able to hunt down nonpvpers and squish them
i dont want more people in 00 i dont care if people are in highsec i just want them to not be in npc corps when in highsec
yeah im sure you want lots of things so do iget over it youre not going to get a new way to grief people by veiling it thinly behind a proposal thats been dredged from the failbin at least 20 times a yearjust give it up
war dec mechanics are meaningless to me as im a low and no sec pilot so i shoot anything regardless of the corp its inmy own reasons for being interested in finding ways to reduce the npc corp population are simple i dont really like the fact that in one of the most interactive games where so much of the game is made by the players weve got a huge percentage of players still residing in npc corporations when i feel the reasons for them wishing to be there are a result of flawed game mechanicsnerfing npc corps might help move some people out but in the end it wouldnt change things all that radically a complete redesign of the corporation mechanic is in order to do that and i think that should start with your choice of home corporation being included in the new player experience
disagree if things are implemented the way they are currently believed to work and you lose one level of a rank 1 skill that is guaranteed to be t3 subsystemspecific then this is a really good idea
if these skills were on a seperate training timer i would have supported it but training skills for something i wont lose or training skills for something i will losenice for bored veterans perhaps and even then im sure even they got something left to train they can keep
after seeing the new one i feel your pain but the ui has gone through tons of changes and i doubt thats the one that will stay they will have to make some serious modifications so that you can fit without it taking up the entire screen
wow that is an ugly idea for the new interface
the new one is not that bad you can close the sidebars and then all you have remaining is that ring around your ship the sidebars are not needed anyway unless you need some specific information about your ship
actually that looks kinda coolbut then i have a 24 inch wide screenx o dcourse that may not look so hot on my macbook pro 15but still its not that big of a deal
i have an idea and not sure if this is the right location to post it i believe its an original idea its an idea to have a class fight frigs cruisers battlecruisers and battleships with 1v1 i like to best compare it to a boxing format where you have lightweight heavyweight etc there would be weekly fights and tournaments the title matches could be exhibition for the alliance tournaments i believe this would add a new side to the realm with a real live sports and betting parlor if you will ive read some of the chronicles and still working on it and i believe this could really help the pc side merge with the npc not that you folks havent done an absolutely beautiful job in the first place  im willing to discuss this with someone as i do not believe i could do this on my own i would need assistance from ccp
i thought the first rule of fight club was to not talk about it o pcouldnt resistidea has merit but youd need to refine it a bit more there
lol beautiful response anyway i am still working on the entire line of how this would work but i have most of it down it would be set up with a ranking system so everyone knows where they sit there would be weekly tournaments fights in which you would have roughly 3264 participants from each class obviously there would be many more than this and thats why you would base it on a weekly event this way everyone gets a chance to test their metal and still have the opportunity to make the rankings when it came time for the title fights this would consist of your top 8 or 16 there would be a license fee for those that want to be in the fight club that would in turn be the top prize for the title fights nobody would have to leave their corpsalliances to purchase a license the weekly tournaments you would have an admission fee with winner take all or however it would be divided i havent really worked the total divide out as this is still a raw idea back to the rankings you could do it many different ways you could earn one point for each placing through the weekly tournaments or you could set up a board that submits their own rankings and you consolidate similar to the ap polls in the usps i did a similar event on ultima online back in the day we ended up with over 100 members
when is the next electioni wish to correct the council
you wont get any votes nobody likes you
i will vote
only if i get to vote for your removal from the game  o p
the problemthere is no way to organize your massive pile of junk and we all have at least one in eve this is because containers cannot contain other containers or some other organizational methodthe solutionscreate a set of containers that have the same internal volume as their external volume ie the volume they take up create a method for organizing items into folders in containers andor cargo areas
better solution  the ability to partition the hangarie right click items create new tab name rinse repeat no cargo limits no need for the cluttercant support this because it just creates russian egg syndrome containers inside containers inside containers
a ship idea has been floating around my head for a while now and it seems even more relevant with the impending expansion of the galaxy exploration command ship an orcalike ship designed to support a small fleet 515 ships on extended forays far from support infrastructure poss or stations the ships role would be to carry the extra ammo drones probes and other supplies needed for true deep space ventures that could last for weeks or even months it also provides repair facilities via the corp hangar as the supplies run low the cargo hold fills up with the finds and riches of the exploration  loot salvage etc kind of an orcamarauder without the combat ability of the marauder obviously idea a ship that doesnt have to return to dock for a very long time and can support a deep space exploration team possible features obviously it cant have them all 2 warp core stregth of a deep space transportcloaked speed bonus of a black opssome hardening  tougher than an orcaprobing bonusesanyone like the concept
ehhh i can see a lot of issues with this shiplooks like a big fat meaty target for pirate gangs to me
itd definetly be a meaty target  part of the exploration fleets job would have to be to provide adequate scouting cover for this boat im thinking the goal would be to get this thing way out beyond where most pirates roam  very deep 00 and extended explorations in wormhole space
i dobut well here
nice ive been thinking through ways to use the existing orca for this purpose and thought it was worth tossing an idea out there for a variant more tailored to exploration and deep space survival id be interested to get that explorationorca pilots opinion on this
a tech 2 orca would prob be the best way to go about thisand then give it some hardened bonuses for dangerous space
i dont really know if its necessary in terms of what it can take just devote the rigging to resistances the setup i linked is a good starti just dont think another extremely specialized ship is what we needim still kind of torn on the whole marauders thing
given the lack of information beyond the vague onesentence response in zulus qa i assume that this has at best been relegated to the soontm category for implementation by the next generation of ccp devs after the current batch retires if were lucky
alliances in fw was on the list for q1 2009 when asking about it in iceland they had looks on their faces that said guys lets pretend we havent completely forgotten about this if we dont see anything done for fw towards the end of my term ill make sure theyre adequately poked before im out
if you read the recent dev blog you will have read about the bug hunters are full of fail and aidsin one of the older cases the user petitioning was asked to file a bug report but the resulting report was closed after the bug hunters were not able to reproduce the issue at the time no procedures were in place on our end to ensure that reproduction steps were included nowadays our bug hunters will contact the player submitting the report and request that the steps be added if they are missingif you have ever made a bug report you will have gotten asked for a log server dxdiag or better reproduction stepshell ive posted a bug once which had a picture dxdiag and log server it got filtered asking for dxdiagive had many bugs filtered asking for dxdiag despite my not being on windows at the time and thusly having no dxdiagthis leads to bugs not being fixedproposalmake it so the bug reporting system is entirely based publicallyfor exampleall bugs are public now obviously this wouldnt work greatly for eve because exploits then become quite publicso thusly my proposal is to make it so filtered aka dead bug reports are made public and any account then can go post on the bug report
supported because bug hunters are made of so much fail and aids
reopen report use it public bug trackers are only relevant to open source software
i kicked in the beta test for premium graphics on the mac and turned in a bug reportonly to find out the damn idiot knew nothing about mac systems and only saw as far as the game in itselfasked me for log files which where irrelevant and completely turned me off when they wanted a separate bug report for every stupid little thingall they had to do was read the stupid reportso yeah much fail hereheck id get more information just reading the mac forums than i would from the bug hunterseven the devs are smarter than that professional it techapple professionalgaming wackowith enough sense to understand programming mechanicsdatabase mechanicsand other fun little things
i wonder how much of this idea is get them into orps so we can wardec them i like the tutorial and corp chat as well as help channel helped me if someone is discouraged by tutorial andor asking people then he will be discouraged by getting wardecced and killed tooeve is a harsh difficult game anywaylearning curve is steep and if one is not willing to learn the first steps in tutorials or by asking in he help channelnpc corp channelrookie channel he wont get far in eve anywaybtw let them chose their career after char creation  tutorial
this forum needs three things1 it needs a couple of people with moderation powers who can delete the blithering idiot posts entirely so that posts with well thought out and constructive content dont shoot to page 3 after a few hours2 it needs a thumbs down option so that you can disagree with a really bad idea3 it needs to force you to choose thumbs up or thumbs down the first time you reply with the option to edit it later if the op makes changes that effect your decision
not so i see many posts from people who are clearly insane i myself am a criminal and there are women posting here
i third thisthe assembly hall is pretty much where i come to judge the mood and heart beat of the playerbase without a free forum in which suggestions can be aired csm members can quickly lose touch and forget who they may be working for which would be a tragedy to say the least
the argument proposed here is that the features and ideas discussion forum should be this forum with the assembly hall forum to be used for the exact opposite of what you suggest it lets the playerbase see on a daytoday basis what the csm are thinking is worthy of bringing to the table with ccp from those ideas which are posted in the fi forumsi think weve simply got two forums doing the same job at the moment one of which is vastly inferior to the other we need to give them distinct roles
i am as persistent as the lag is
too reasonable for the flamebrigade
you can always take single comments out of context to distort reality i have no desire to make eve carebear heaven i do however see that much of eve is empty and this tells me something should change ccp recognizes that and some of those comments were part of the brainstorming conversations that occured in the ccp meetingswhat the folks that think pvping is only about blowing someone up need to realize is that pvp can also occur in the markets and be every bit as brutal in its own way one thing eve has that is truly unique and clearly a major focus is its economy even to the point of having a full time economist so sorry big badda boom types but eve is also about mining and building things to make a profit you might want to call folks the focus on that carebears and pretend they dont matter but clearly ccp has always felt otherwiseas for missing the point of bruce we liked everyting about bruce but the leadership sadly there is no game mechanic change that could address thatissler
could be worse 4chan could start an eve alliance too
i found it rather scary that this was asked for six years ago
horrible idea only useful for thieves and people who screw over 4 yrs of an alliances hard work with the click of one buttonif your worried about people holding a grudge and tracking you down for the rest of your eve career then maybe dont do itwill not support a get out of jail free card
such a heart wrenching argument so you petition every character sale eh
is there an update on this
war dec the corp are you that lazy
clicking my support into this should be a tie in to the salvaginghacking profession really
thank you for being so short sighted 1 opens up a new miniprofession 2 removes another timesink from the game3 frees up availiable moon minerals4 makes people really care for their poss a little more while yes you could war dec the corp  spend hours on an abandoned tower  or you can use your capital fleet in 00the point is that the mechanic doesnt make sense the towers been abandoned for years it should unanchor
need for speed and all look after your junk or let someone else do it for you if it helps cut down on database strain all the better
tempest is cheaper to use as a sniper practically the same dpsalpha as a maelstrom6667 more dpsalpha from a maelstrom larger cargo baymore room for stuff and frankly its bonuses are a minmatar trait i wouldnt like the tempest changedyes this isnt really based on a logical argumentthe maelstrom was born from the need for a gunship for caldari all tier 3s were supposed to act as the sniper for the race initiallyabaddon and hyperion deviated from this this intended role for the maelstrom is reflected in the grid capacity cargo bay speed targeting range having a rate of fire bonus and a shield boost bonus both detract from this sniper concept id propose changing the maelstrom to give it the main thing that it needs to differentiate it from the tempest as a sniper volley damage instead of having a rate of fire bonus on the maelstrom make it a damage bonus thereby increasing the volley damage while retaining most of the dps potential as a bonus this also makes the maelstrom more efficient with ammo when using autocannons a good thing considering the smaller cargo bayfor the other bonus that detracts from the sniper role shield boost amount i have not really given it much thought perhaps make it also apply a 75 increase to shield hp on extenders or even just general shield hp increasethough that might be considered as being a 3rd bonus idk in closing i would support asking the devs to reprioritise overall ship balance issuesthere are other ships that could also use a look lachesis anyone but your proposals for tempest and maelstrom i dont like so this particular thread wont get my support ps i should prolly note that im maxspecced for minmatar before you disregard this as an amarr defensive whine
i support this minmatar needs a sniper the range of the minmatar sniper is horrible and most fcs dont wanna bring minmatar snipers if they can be avoidedalso the pest needed a clear role
sorry ill keep my drone bandwidth  active tanking boosti like the idea of building a 1000 dps ac setup with my maelstrom and i would never support a buffing of the tempest since it does just fine being a cheap alternative in most situationsthe only buff to tempest that seems passable would be the power grid buff beyond that youre just pushing the tempest towards the maelstrom and then why have 3 bs tiersnot supported
are you friggin kidding meyou wanna keep the useless shieldboost buff why1000 ac damage is ridiculously bad if you compare it with a 1400 dps typhoonalso the only thing thats cheaper with the tempest is the initial price after insurance comes back there is not much difference with a maelthe tempest is crap has no role so people say yeah but its versatileno versatile are the typhoon and dominix not a tempesthorrible sniper if you compare it with the resthorrible mission boat tracking is needed and dps and tank is subparclose range pvp bad tank again to little low slots dps sup par can fit 2 neuts but so can every other bs remote rep is exactly the same use a typhoon if you really wanna use a minnie ship better in almost every way then a pestnow what can it dobut i has killed megathrons in a pest yeah prolly the worst fit ever or it was done on sisi with you having all slave implants and the opponents didnt or they where screwing aroundalso the shield hp bonus is far far superior then the shield boost bonus for pvp
please revise possov relationship
with poss even more important with the coming of t3
oh noes my cit torps on my naglfar wont hit a frigate going 5k a sec wtf ccp on another note my nano mach i spent 3 bil on only goes like 18k with snakes
get over it already
looks like you fail in pvp then and in trolling too
supported better late than never
automatic afk can be easily countered by using a macro or such that taps a key at a certain interval which means that afk cloaker in your system can pretend to be there
bad idea
nobody is asking you to trust the afk symbol and no one should do it unless its a known player ie a corpie friend or whatever so there you go no exploitation is possible unless you are a gullible pilot that wants to belive on the other hand among trusted pilots it could be useful as the op said
bad idea keep crap like that for lotro and wow
how about if the afk ticker only shows in corp and usermade channels in local it does not show at all so everything remains as is on that front
id support this  id also include any fleet channels you belong to ostensibly your corpies and your fleet mates you should be able to trust at least a littlei would also say include an option that lets you disable the afk display for those people who dont want to use it
the ability to convert personel types ie slaves to freed slaves virtually anything to slaves freedom fighters to corpses has been discussed quite a bit while i agree it would be nice to have its certainly not high on the devs to do list and probably wont be added
homophobia is not tolerated by ccp its in the eula if you feel that someone is abusing you verbally so to speak in eve put in a petition ccp are legally bound by mutual contract eula and tos and local laws where applicable to take action where deemed appropriatecertain countries have the term gay to mean bad but i take it with a pinch of salt im too old to care about some narrow minded people i just take it in my stride
hahahhahahaha oh man you are ridiculous equal rights on a mmo youre betting a thousand
you get a gold star for a very basic and incomplete attempt at being eves answer to michel foucault however any such argument falls down once you make it a moral argument

just to remind ccp that blasters need some love    even more as webscram have been rebalanced   as i said previously  no complaints mean no problem
or just give megathrons bonus to mega pulse lasers and we are good who needs blasters
same situation as many others only using drone boats now and feel many sps are wasted on blasters
while not as big of a deal as people were making it out to be prepatch  it is a significant issue with the gallente race
not supported blasters still fine imo my astarte popped a player frig orbiting me even when beeing tracking disrupted
not supported do we really need csm agendas dealing with balancing minute let them deal wwith issues directly impacting ccp and playerbase interaction balancing the game should not be their role deal with things that can make the game better for everyone imo
not supportedhowever i think it would be nice to build and use hardwirings for boosting different attributes that affect skill learning by 51020 and those hardirings should only last for a week it can also be a skill how long they will last say lvl5 is a week as maximum building them can use the dnas drop in missions
ok considering i generally reprocess about 150200 different types of items infact due to recently getting orca i suspect that  to rise quite significantly per reprocess jobbutyou want to change it so im horribly boggled down have to install each item by itself to a maximum of 11 fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffhow about simply remove meta 0 from missions thats a huge part of the minerals also from the removal meta0 builders have to start building meta 0 from scratch this increases demand on mineralsthe overall problem with changing the system insurance will become ineffective meaning noobs and pvpers cant afford to lose ships so they stop paying market epically floods builders and miners lose lots of iskwho inevitably wins the big win drone regions

reading is kewlhuge groan on making a simple procedure into a tedious pos based one protip people hate hate hate pos mechanics and the extremely boring and ed nature of pos and do not want to have to use a pos and the terrible interface and the godawfully slow mechanics you are proposing for what should be a simple actionhuge no on this and also im adding a you dont know wtf you are talking about dear op too bad there is no check boxes for either
get over it already
since this post is actually related to the issue being raised  the csm did bring it up with ccp it is being looked at its just not coming in apocrypha as for they can work on 2 different things at the same time you do realise how big this next expansion is right they had 11 different teams working on things they just couldnt fit the blackops review into this expansion in a meaningful way so it was bumped
alright lets say you are rightdo you know how long it would take an experienced game dev to add fuel bays 1 daysure it may require 3 days of testing lets say that if all the stopped working on expansion pack and focused just on fixing game balance issues  the simple fixes nothing majorthey could do most of it in 1 week they could delay release of expansion by 1 week and put a lot of fixes to game balance that so many people want its easy but they are not going to it would be against their spirit to let the player be happy i suppose when ccp was a small company they had the spirit of going against mainstream they had balls but now that spirit is probably buried under layers of bureaucracy  even if there are devs who want to make good game changes they become incapable just cogs in profit making machine at least  this scenario gives some excuse for their bad judgment id hate to think they actually do this on purpose
i seriously doubt it will take 3 days to test develop and get the fuel bay out there is numerous balancing issues the code writing needed to do it and make sure fuel bays wont break the code on the game and that they will actually be recognized in the game also you have to do numerous debugging checks as well as an amateur code writer i know for a fact that the fuel bay idea is not simple even from a coding aspect if it took only three days to introduce fuel bays then the next expansion would have been out already since it hasntim more inclined that this idea is not so simple especially since theyve released it on the test server and i heard there are several problems with features in the expansion so what are they incompetent after all these months or are they humanisaacps ccp used to be more cavalier with their ideas in the beginning the only problem is it ran them into numerous problems neither way of doing things is perfect but at this point ccp feels this is the best way id suggest next time you comment about game issues dont attack the company its pointless and makes your argument look weak because your attacking the company not the issue at hand
i wasnt so negative about the company before the quantum rise patch i cant forgive them for going through with that horrible nerf they showed total lack of understanding the core game balance issues and did not respect the eve spiritits like if you took mona lisa painting and decided that it needs some improvement so you paint over it to modify the face to look prettier sure to you and your beer buddies it may look like a great improvement but to people who understand art it would be horrific travestyi know ccp used to be great but they changed they still make great progress with technology but their game design side is only diminishing more content  better game
i think you need to stand back and look at this objectivelyif you discount people hiding in noob corps  especially the alts that run missions or remote rep and the isk farmers  how many people are actually an interactive part of eve
ok lets look at objectivelyfirst of all they arent hiding they just arent in player corps just because you cant paytogrief thats just the way the game is its never been a problem beforeas for interacting all of those people whether in player corps or not trade run missions explore and mine they contribute greatly to the overall market of evei think you need to look at this objectively youre desire to be able to shoot at anyone as long as you put up a down payment does not overrule the desire of the majority to play the game they wantalso youre not providing the numbers in order to be objectivehere they are incase you couldnt find themthere are around 400000 active charactershalf of them are in the 45 npc corps the other half are in the 34000 player corpsevery solution you whiners have suggested would just catapult the already insane number of small corps even higher and in the end people would still keep alts for trading and mining in npc corpsthere isnt a way around it that doesnt penalize new players and those who prefer to play alonenot supported just like the several dozen times i havent supported it
ignoring my personal views on pvp for a moment how do you justify the lack of tax and lack of risk due to being immune from wardecs while being able to run missions and trade as they please
the risk is inherant in the game they can still be griefed no matter where they areas for your little tirade about taxes high tax rates wouldnt effect traders in the least nor make a real dent at all in the amounts of money that mission runners makeif you cut out missions rewards people would still make money from mining trade and salvageyour argument could be valid your solution is laughable
how would taxing trade not help
because taxing trade would simply discourage trading as a profession and would hurt the overall economy
or it would make you join a real corp with a low tax rate
or it would make everyone form 1 man corpsand no increasing price to create corps wouldnt do restricts new playersno no no no no
1 theres already a trade tax its called a sales tax2 join a real corp what kind of an answer is that what is a real corp anyway if your so keen on such a thing then why are you hiding your corp or posting with your alt for that matter not very professional of youtax this tax that enough alreadytaxing anyone or anything in this game good or bad is a waste of timeyour going to have to realize that isk is just too bloody easy to makegranted as i say that i dont have enough to buy the toys i want but its easy enough to make a few mil in one sitting as it isso taxing joe gamer in npc corp is nothing short of a yawn and a pathetic fix to your so called holy grail you oh so want to achievethe only way your going to avoid the npc corp is to fix war decs note i said fix them not kill them not nerf them fix them or improve them so its not a griefing toolend of discussionstart there first then worry about npc corps sorry to derail your topic but the issue orbits around that very problemand stop with the one liners how about putting a little effort into your defense ehefrim black has it right as i spoke to him tonight  o   eve has the unique distinction of freedom of choice in this game it would be best to keep that aspect otherwise people will not play itthe sandbox mentality needs to be balanced to all partiespirate industrialist the dreaded carebear and the 00 alliance enthusiastif you push the balance too far in any one particular direction you screw up the game royally
you dont want to take the chance on losing sp related to the t3 ship then dont fly one problem solveddid you even get on sisi to test them out or did you just hear from the tourney and run straight to the forums to complain
ive had it with ccp gms taking days weeks months to respond to petitions there needs to be a new guaranteed minimum response time and a clear escalation path with penalties to ccp such as free month of play if  72 hours without a response 2 weeks without a resolution
thumbs down forcing gms to respond to 1000s of petitions daily within a certain amount of time is asking the impossible if you hate it so much want to take their job over i thought so come up with a better idea with handling petitions
if the new interface can be moved closed etc by the time it goes live on tq ill have no complaints the present sisi system is lame though it makes for really nice screencaps but it isat present a pain to use that said its early in a sisi patch im not going to go crazy just yet
signednew fitting screen is ahhhhhhhhhhhful
how about instead of going crazy over something that is not even done yet you offer suggestions on how to improve the new fitting screenthe time you spent typing up this worthless rabble you could have typed up something worth while for suggestions on how to make the new fitting screen wintry again
the new fitting screen looks great actually its a welcome change from my part
well the fitting screen is probably one of the things that appear to be almost 100 fully implemented and ready to roll just by looking at the window seems easy to understand the motivation and philosophy behind its actual design and it is there where all the flaming across the forum boards comes from and being such a radical design change is probably not going to be pulled out as software companies hate to invest resources implementing something and not milking it later some way or another time will tell
i like how it keeps your ship in the center showing it off making you grin and giggle with glee when you fit that big fat laser cannon on it
your tracking advantage in case of blasters is only relevant inside your optimal in falloff you automaticaly start losing damage potentialnow pulse lasers dont need to worry much about that they can change optimal quickly and they have the longest from short range weaponsyour tracking advantage is also not usefull if you cannot translate that into effective damage applied to the target or effective damage denied to the target by you being faster than he can track both are only realised in a very short optimal window with blasters the same for autocannons does not make sense as they are almost 99 times in falloff and lasers 99 times in optimalanyway pity the csm turned down this one i hope ccp realises the importance
i expect that a large part of why this got turned down was that the proposal is completely broken the proposed solution would ensure that all shots from all turrets would hit all targets within the ranges 1m to 1386mif you still think that blasters and autocannons need a rebalancing then write up a proper case for it and resubmit it for review by the csm and ccp in writing up your case dont bother to include a solution to whatever problem you find you dont want your case shot down because of a flaw in your solution like this one was
this tbh  i didnt agree with the proposed solution which is why i voted no
pity this case is not only about blasters and autocannons  this can be extended to proper rebalancing of all turrets however nobody does see it this proposal is introducing a very important behavior into the tracking mechanic
its effect on other types of turrets is one of the main reason why this is such a bad ideadid you not bother to look at what this would do to every other type of turret like i already said this change as proposed would cause every turret to always hit for ranges under 13km it would be impossible to miss your turret could have an optimal and falloff of 1m and you could not miss a shot at 13km tracking would be irrelevant seigemode dreads would hit interceptors for full damage scoutheavy drones would also never miss they all operate within 13kmit would reduce the game to bumper boats fit the biggest ship with the biggest guns drive up to your target and stay within 13km hoping that your damage will break his tank before his damage breaks yoursit short complete stupidity
i noticed in the pos exploit explanation dev blog that they claimed 30 t2 bpos were removed from the gamethat on top of the fact that t2 bpos only existed in limited numbers to begin with and over time other t2 bpos have been lost pvp inactive accts etc  made me think of a questiont2 bpos that are removed from the game put an extra strain on the market  owning one of those bpos even postinvention was a significant advantage being able to create the shipsmodules for cheaper than inventors  or just copying bpcsis there a system in place to get lost t2 bpos back in circulation or are we eventually going to be playing in a game where no t2 bpos exist anymoreif so what kind of system would be in place i recall the origional t2 lottery system wasnt very popularedit  fixed subject title typo
theoretically yeah it could happen practically valuable collectables will never go out of circulation until the next fall of western civilizationor in this case final shutdown of the eve servers the number lost is tiny and the people who own them protect them jealously id bet theres a good number that have never once left station and never once will and no theres no mechanism to get them back into circulation they could theoretically restart the lottery but thered be riots
well my daughter inspired this one when she asked me if there was a way to tell how old characters were if there was a way to tell what character was the oldestwould be a neat little feature if the model could somehow reflect the age and maybe have screenshots from each yearwell at least some weird feature to show avatar developments
hmmm my char is now 4 years older than he was when i created him i doubt that there are big differences
and i bet he didnt even change his clothes yuck
no need only a new body every now and then d
gernal thumbs up for being able to make small changes to our character images over time
the characters are immortal due to clone technology so they can have the clone every age they want you can change avatar piucture for money so that would reflect a remodeling of clones i think which lets aging have no meaning for capsuleers
i think it would be cool if the avatar could be changed at any timeno not facial structure but clothing hairstyle backdrop light position of head target of eyes and makeupsame character different mood and id really like to switch my makeup style every now and then
cool but really annoying right now you can see who a character is with a glance at their avatar if this proposal came in that wouldnt work any more most people wouldnt use it and the few who did would just cause confusion
you could probably run such a tournament yourself if you were so interested maybe not you personally but the player base as a whole could ive seen some get run at times in the past its probably more work than its worth for ccp to host such a thing unfortunately
my only concern with this is the safe passage in and out of the fight locations if i had a safe area i could do this rather easily myself
do it in highsec flip cans before the fight alternately if it gets big enough make it a condition of entrance that everybody will be on hand to provide security  64 battleships is a lot of guards
wow i dont know why i didnt think of that to begin with what a noob am i 
hey it had to be said just in case you actually were a noob seriously though ccp doesnt have the time or manpower to administer tournaments all that often certainly not as often as your proposal suggests thus we get to do it ourselves unless you have a concrete proposal for what ccp can do to make it easier that is actually worth their time there isnt really anywhere this thread can go
im feeling the love already 
tracktor beams keep wrecks and cans at 500m and when fitted into a nonmarauder class ship they go at 500ms 1kms for marauders thats your speed limit right there if you go faster your trackored item will lag behind you until it gets out of range and deactivates or you stop and wait for it to reach your ship again you can limit your speed to just 500ms by clicking inside the speed indicator
item tabsthis
im going to agree with him isaac
in short make it so you can train skills on more than one character at a time it would be nice to experiment with different play styles but lost sp is to be had with the current method of course keep the restriction of one login per accountobviouslyanyone support this although i havent thought much of the consequences considering my brains shotperhaps its time for sleep too
1 character training per account  20 or whatever the sub fee is3 characters training per account  203 accounts training 1 character each  60do you see where this is heading
if you just price the additional training slots the same as a new account its of no benifithow about something like this1 account 1 skill training  301 account 2 skills training  451 account 3 skills training  60id be willing to invest extra money to skill more toons with this structure it saves me some money yet benifits ccp as well
if they did that  sure im all for it
if you mean sov mechanics need a bit of adjustment then i agree if you mean that it should be made more safe to encourage more carebears out there then i disagree that space is empty because somebody who used to live there doesnt anymore most of the time they dont live there anymore because somebody else kicked them out empty space in eve is an opportunity waiting to be filledim well aware of what goes on in the markets many of my fellow corp members have gotten rich beyond my wildest dreams doing market pvp theyve even explained it to the rest of us to try and help us make money like they do market trading is arguably the most profitable activity in the game that doesnt require poss or living in dangerous spaceheres the issue though i hate trading i hate it with the fire of a thousand suns ive dabbled with it and i just hate doing it my brain gets angry whenever i buy or sell anything for a purpose other than building a ship or clearing hangar space for cash so i choose not to do it the result of which is that im not very well off im unlikely to move into cap ships and i dont own any neat faction shipsdoes that mean that i think trading should change just because i dont enjoy it no i dont its well balanced and functional for lots of people those people will continue to get richer while i get by on datacores and missions i dont have access to riches like theirs because of a choice i made and i can accept thataccess to 00 is no different it takes sacrifice and commitment to live out there it takes strong leadership and hard decisions to survive in that environment those who choose not to play like that have made a choice that will deny them a reasonable chance at living in that space i dont see why ccp should change whats been working so well just because some players want reward without any risk
no it doesnt need to cater to anyone it needs to provide challenges and rewards opportunities and consequences the things that keep people interested in trying and help them learn when they fail catering is having things handed to you eve doesnt operate that way
im not really sure in what dictionary catering is defined as having things handed to you but its not a very good oneto cater is to provide or supply something desirable to people anyone whos hired a caterer for a party knows they dont just hand over those giant cheese platters for nothing hooray for monterey jackif eve didnt cater to subscribers there wouldnt be anyone posting on this board about catering or anything else

crime and punishment called they what there troll back
you want to learn things faster do learning skills think of it as university  people that just have high schoocrap learning skillstake longer to do stuff too bad if you dont like learning skills they add a flavor to the game you idiots wont be satisfied till eve turns into wow for babies
thats not enough blackops are still battleship hulls and need at least a higher sensor ressolution  or some way to negate the cloaks ressolution penalty  to be usefull in combat for a pure logistics plathform an industrial hull with no weapons would have been enough
sounds like you should be playing second life not eve 
heh it wont even be eve as we know it way ccp are going they dumb this game down anymore it will be a space version of wow nearly at that point already tbh

or worse 7chan or possibly sa oh wai
i am mainly aiming at the option to reassign attributes every 6 monththis has several impacts1 it devaluates attributes altogether suddenly it does not matter much what your attributes are you can just adjust them to suit your training why have attributes then in the first placethis also makes race choices mostly irrelevant except for appearance2 it basically forces players to train in 6 month cycles eg 6 month of percwillpower based skills only followed by 6 month of intmem based skills etcjust so they dont fall behind because they train not with maximum efficiencyit is also not great for new players since the you have to train learning skills first tip gets replaced by the even more tedious and limiting tip of you need to train intmemory based skills first starting with learning skills after maxing your attributes to that fieldit takes a lot of freedom out of the training and lets face it freedom is fun having the impulse of hey i should train for xyz now been immediately curbed by oh wait my attributes are aligned to another field for another 3 months is just not good and fun gameplay3 it increases overall training time while this is an odd thing to complain about on the first glance granted it means that the accomplishment of older players gets diminished and is also bad for ccps business in the long run unless they introduce a lot of extra skills to train as people reach points where they run out of useful skills to train fastermoreover this puts those of the new players at an disadvantage that are not able to plan ahead and many of them wont quite likely and organize their skills in 6 month brackets people that play on a whim and easily give in to impulses will be frustrated by their slower then average progressioni am not arguing against a onetime attribute reassignment but the option to do it every 6 months does not seem like a good ideaalternativesa make it a one time only option two times for new characters first time to get out of the evenly distributed starting attributes and another time considerably later in their career to make up for early made mistakes just like the old players are allowed to correct theirsthis allows people with gimped attributes to fix that issue and chose a more balanced attribute set without leading necessarily to the minmaxing enforcement the 6 month cooldown does as outlined aboveb make it only possible to switch a single attribute point or at least a severely limited number each time the timeframe could be shortened instead eg allow reassigning of 1 point per month or so there could even be a skill introduced that reduces the cooldown of the reassignment eg from 2 month to 1 month with lvl 5 or similarthat way characters can fix their broken attribute allocation over time or gear their character slowly towards a new career again without allowing for the minmaxing that an instant complete attribute switch every 6 month would bring
attributes in eve are a little bit at a tangent to those you might expect from a more classic mmo as it is not very obvious how each attribute will actually help a new player with their desired role or career path in more classic mmos a player often has the choice between magic strength speed etc that have fairly obvious outcomes eg if you want to be a warrior you beef up your strength i still today could not tell you off the top of my head what attributes to go for it you wanted to be a miner or a pirate or a freighter so i guess ccp want to allow newer players to be able to change their choices if they turned out not to be good ones or if after a few months they decide to change their career path in gamethat said i see really no reason why a year old player should have the ability to tweak their attributes according to their current training set like amy says this almost makes the attributes and their choices pointlessmy suggestion would be to allow players under 1 year old to change their attributes every 3 months but not then after a year
honestly when i frrst heard about it i was of the mind woot finally can dump that charisma i put 3 points into when i first startedrespeccing does devalue the attributes because you will get people respeccing every 6months so they can plan their skills accordingly but in the end id rather have no attributes at all level them all to a standardized amount and leave the skills to train based on rank then i had the thought  what about specialisation with respeccing it means i can max out certain attributes specialise in an area i want and if i decide later that i want to specialise elswhere respec and move to that area i wont lose the skills i already have but because i have respecced to maximise training elsewhere it means if an expansion happens in the middle of the respec cycle i cant just go back to my old specialisationim waffling but i guess my point is that attributes are currently a hindrance to open gameplay so respeccing should help fix that
i believe adding the ability for a well skilled hackingsalvaging spec pilot to be able to hack and unanchored such towers to be a great ideai also believe it really should be possible to do to active towers but make it very easy to disrupt the hacker ie make a modal that could only be put on say t1 industrial ships or other large sig radius hacking ships that would be capable of offline guns for active towers and then a structure that would need to be anchored for 24 hours or more if needed to unanchored and scoop up the towerthe hacking structure should be expensive large and week say a fleet of 45 frigs could destroy hacking structure in just a few minutes if was not protected also both the modal and structure should be considered aggressive acts and send a evemail to owner corp and alliancethis would allow alternative ways to fighting poss other than just fielding dreads and would make things much more interesting and fun
i disagree here  if the shield is up no change to current mechanics is required if for example though you can get someone inside a tower when a pos comes out of reinforced you could hack it and online it yourself rather than simply blow it up as i see this mechanic hacking an offlined tower would break the structure meaning youd have to go through the entire setup procedure as if youd simply ejected the items into space this would make for a huge change to pos warfare as youd only require the firepowertime to knock a towers shields out not knock out both its shields and the towers hp this would make smaller and more timezone specific alliances more capable of assaulting towers and should thus make for more fluid gameplayanother tactic often used is to placehold moons with offlined towers in cynojammed systems to prevent others from taking the moons this mechanic has the potential to render that mechanic entirely obsolete forcing any deployed pos to be kept active or not kept at all  something that i feel could only do good things for alliance warfare theres also the possibility of being able to hack a tower into reinforced mode even when it still has fuel forcing the owners to come to the pos and remedy the problem  yet another method for picking a fighti would be happy with being able to only hack unanchored towers and maybe cans hmm of course  thatd be a huge improvement over current mechanisms  but being able to hack any defenseless tower would be filled with so much win that words simply cannot describe it
i smell a new subprofession
really  im both surprised you liked it and surprised you understood it i will expose this to my hardcore irl carebear silent on the forums mate im sure he will come with dozens of ideas and they will be better than mines  for education ministry i had a few ideas i came a long time ago about skills masters the thread is here its locked anyway maybe it would be a cool thing to have skill books produced in 00 its not a perfect idea i recognize it but maybe this mechanics could be of some use therethe problem is doing only this gameplay is boring because its time based again  i wonder how could we change some industry activities to be fast paced anyway time based or not what if you had to grow trees to produce books  p im sure a lot of things could be made to enhance this systemfor health trade or other minitries maybe you could make a parallel soverainty system ie  with the classic one you control the stations and with the colony one you control the station services so if you want to fully occupy a territory you need 1 pvper for 1 industrialist or 2 for 1 or 5 for 1 but not 10 for 1 as todaysame here  configuring the health system once would be boring because you dont have to come back when its done maybe you could control more variable than this  station services  colony output maybe or something more on topi dont knowtheres a lot to do anyway with planets i loved the first prealphaconceptart ui screenshots ccp made in fanfest 2007 with countries on the planets it proposed any character to be a local hero so any character would have the feeling of acheivement do not forget pod pilots are suposed to be at the very least rockstars or the richest guys in this universe we are special because we can pilot pods and not anonymous in eves backgroundfor fast paced gameplay im thinking maybe of something like this its a crap idea but im devellopping here lets imagine for exemple for political ministry a gameplay with something like a 3d rubbick cube timed so you cant pause the game and enter the combination in a computing software and with balance gameplay what is balance gameplay  its like fitting your ship  tank or gank so solving the puzzle is fast paced asking to make choices over other solutions and i hope not boringthis could be used for controling global things for exemple truesec trade fee or various system bonuses even environnements so you want to give bonuses on health ministry  solve the puzzle with these choices trade ministry  go the trade solution the best you can etcor  a better ratting system would be at the expense of exploration or mining belts for exemple a better trading system less taxes would be at the expense of something else docking fees  not a single perfect solution but lots of compromises you could configure your territory sure there would be better place as today to rat mine or moon mine but with this you could make a better place to live there this is what are suposed to do carebears no maybe its crap ideas anyway i will give your feedback to my carebear friend im sure he will be glad and have ideas for me to tell here edit im thinking about the oooooooooooold idea of ship crew what if some colony output would be guess what  ship crewwhat would be ship crew i let this to the dozens of people that had good ideas on that imho it could be used for some kind of heat resistance the problem of heat is that it depends to much of module activation lag a lot of people had better ideas anyway

i agree with him raw dps isnt everything the maelstrom is an incredible close range small gang ship capable of tanking 1000dps and dealing out 800with guns alone crossing 1k with drones the phoon might deal more damage but the mael is going to tank considerably more minmatar bses really do need a look at as the tempest really is worse than the mael in every way apart from the price but i dont think these changes are right

no not quite im suggesting that reprocessing could be done by item group eg drones ammo shield modules armour modules and so on with greater efficiencyspeed if you reprocess items of the same type and reduced efficiency if you mix things upim not suggesting making them mandatory im suggesting putting them there for people who want to invest time and isk into a profession and see better returns for the extra work it would tie in with the bit above about reprocessing different item groups separately for better yieldsthanks for the link  i knew id seen the table before but i couldnt quite remember wherebear in mind that adding a jobbased refining system would also have the effect of making it harder for macro miners to operate as theyd need to train lots of characters to manage all the jobs which incidentally would leave a helpful audit trail also some of the higher tier refining skills could be made untrainable on trial accounts
i like the idea as long as it dont touches what hics are doing atmalso cant see why ppl continue to babble about their precious 00maybe they should read the whole thread

cba to repeat the good points made above so no
these things need more than just a fuel bay they need a reason to be used in a gang hacs and recons have specific areas which theyre better than cruisers ewar or usually rangedamage but theres really no reason to use a black ops bs outside of jump bridging dststhey need something i personally like increased range tracking or the ability to bridge any ship smaller than a bs
basically what the csm guy was saying is that ccp cannot be arsed with making black ops a priority vs the other exciting things they are doing given that there is possibly only 10 serious black ops players in the whole game i doubt they would see it high on the list of items anywayhowever it does take time to plan things even small changes might need to go through various teams etc in order to make it to implementation so while the coding time might be 20 mins their could days or weeks of red tape and ballancing changes coding is usually the smallest part of things like balance changesso ephemeron the question you should be asking is not it wont take long to fix but rather how far has ccp moved along resolving the issues with black ops are we still at the drawing boardbasically ccp have relised that black ops is a mostly waste of crap they do not even have a common design to go around them  the entire black ops system was created by somebody who took tier 1 bs and just added a jump drive this is apparent due to the complete random nature of black ops  a ew ship a droanboat a jumpdrive typhoon and a laser boat that lacks the cap to mwd out of a bubble but is commonly used as a jumpdrive hauler its just a bunch of random ships with random roles so you see ephemeron the entire black ops line was possibly developed by some guy who probebly never solosmall gang pvped and probebly took 5 minutes in balancing the ships by just reusing the stock tier 1 bs ccp really need to scrap the entire black ops concept and go back to the drawing board and redo them ground up as pvp ship
i have a name you know im not sure about scrapping them but a serious look about what role they are supposed to fulfil and adjusting them based on that is definitely needed that is however not a small task so while it isnt high on the queue of things to do it is on the queueat this point there is no reason for csm to reraise the issue as ccp already know about it we can however keep bugging ccp to look at them and as a sin owner i do want them fixed so i do point out their lack of use when i can
the concept of a battleship with cloaking bonus is a good one its something new and it does go well with roaming pvp in hostile territoryi would prefer to see some improvements in their ability to fit tank and gank in a way they would be an alternative to maraudersi dont think ccp would go that way tho they dont have clarity of vision nor the will to make bold moves in game design granted they are good at pushing tech
them selling plexes directly is dumbalso calling them plex is just as dumb
didnt feel like making a big long post nor do i want to argue if having a ingame item that affects your account should be in the game or if i can scam or steal these items from peopleit just seems like every game that a company begins to sell ingame items for revenue starts to degrade its standards now its simply account time but in the future maybe the only way to get a t4 ship will be paying for them of couse to make people want to spend their money on said item they must be vastly better then other opitions then the game goes down the horrible path of look at that cool ingame item too bad i got to spend more money to get it
yeah plexes should at the very least have their fitting requirements doubledhmmm im worried that you wont understand my sarcasm just to be safe your post is very stupid
reading your post makes me feel dumbwow is that way 
fixd
i dont think plexs are dumb at all in fact from ccps point of view its good business sense now people who are really good at making money in game but may be financially strapped dont have to stop playing thus reducing the flow of revenue to ccp they can buy a plex which someone else already paid for meaning that in a sense someone else paid for their game time players get to stay online and ccp continues to make money at the same rate approximatelyof course all of that may be the 34 of a billion iskies that selling two of them put into my wallet talkingvel
plexs are pretty much the same as time cards but time cards you are not allow to scam from people i assume we can steal and scam plexs from other playersthe issue im more of concern with is if ccp starts selling one in game item for real money why not sell another one it makes good business sense and im sure all of us seen this in other online games i dont want eve to go downt hat road where ccp needs money and they decide they should sell ingame items to make revenue i dont think theyre going do this today or tomorrow but in a few years this could be a reality there is already a way to buy gtc it works fine they added a way to make gtc into plexs a ingame item thats alright why do we need the ability to buy plexs straight from ccp why do we want to send a message that we will buy ingame items straight from ccp

war deck mechanics are arguably one of the most important things that need reworking war decking needs to be looked at first and the following are some things that i have just popped into my head since i have read the thread these are just some rambling thoughts how about coming up with some mechanic that allows highsec corps and alliances to create some form of soverignty that effects high sec pos operations nothing crazy but something to fight over  allow players to join any npc corp create a npc corporate interaface including fleet mechanics that you can utilize if you choose to be flagged but many things need to be limited for example no corp hangers allow npc corps to compete for this but they flag them selves as active for war decking if some entity wants to diminish the local npc corp soverignty holders other npc corp memebers that do not want to gain the benefits the active npcing offers recieve a slight tax as any other player corp would and it goes towards the upkeep of the active npc side i think this has some crazy rp potentialbut then again the above would be lofty at best for i know little of programmingslade
eject  tadaaa no sp lost
agreedsp should not be a commodity like isk
level 1 ranked skillswahoh noes i blew up my ship and lost just a few days worth of training oh boo hoos whatever will i do you guys need to take a look at this from outside your tiny box that you seem so stuck in and no im not going to humor you into why im saying this if you cant figure it out for yourself then maybe you should go try hello kitty online or better yetgo check out neopets that might be more to your liking
i really hate this idea a lot all it serves to do is encourage use in pve and discourage it for pvp which is utterly not something eve needs right now on the off chance people do decide to risk sp while pvping it actually discourages skill training since you risk more sp when youre better with the ship either way its not making the ships any more precious and in fact makes them less desirable to fly especially when large scale combat in eve already makes losses essentially up to a coin toss of whether the game responds to your commands before you die
no its bad
those who dont want to risk the loss shouldnt use the ships i dont understand the problem people who dont like to lose implants dont use them in combat people who are unwilling to lose expensive rigs dont use them in combat people who are unwilling to lose faction mods dont use them in combat dont use them if you dont like the risk vs reward ratio i plan to try one at least out probably with expensive rigs and faction mods  risk is fun
this pay close attention to this one class
ejecting is fail just complete fail as a solution for preventing sp loss imo t3 as it is implemented is going to be for epeen wars in empire and maybe to fotm for the next alliance tournament not a regular line ship for most pvpersrisk vs reward could have been handled much better tbh see here for an idea which could have been fun nondisruptive to skill training and yet maintain consequences for flying and losing t3 ships

nope the last thing you want to do is start offering free play time if a petition takes longer than a set amount of time to get a response then the gms will see a massive flood of petitions come in as people try to abuse the system for free game timenot a good ideabesides  i have never had a petition take very long with one exception  a bugged pos that needed some investigation by well whoever goes and investigates those things and i specifically mentioned that it was a low priority item and they could take their time
the petitions ive submitted have always been handled in a relatively short amount of time i think the longest was about 72 hours for a noncritical issue and it was over a weekend i dont see a need for this one  no support
terrible idea working in customer support is a thankless job as it stands and you want to put more pressure on themi for one think that the gms are excellent and have responded to my inquires and petitons within hours of opening a petition
i feel your pain and frustration with long petition responses i too had to wait a little over 2 weeks for a response to lost implants issue here is volume with the ammount of petitions filed in obsurd to put a time limit on them suck it up and let them do their job
well i can see the issue in general and to a extent i agree however to put in penalties to gms is wrongnow penalties for people putting in petitions purposefully to either waste time or multiple petitions for the same reason seems adequate to try and cut down on the amount of petitions they getalso im a advocate of trying to get gms to actually read the petition from the pov of the petitioner in the first instance andor get the people handling petitions some basic ingame knowledge  i know a lot of gms play the game but i also know a lot dontso i vote no to this but would vote yes to a petition system overhaul to a reduce the amount of petitions b get some sensible answers from gms regarding petitions c improve how the gms deal with people ive received some very curt replys in the past bordering on abuse of powersd improve game knowledge of some gms e have some clearer guidelines and answers to the more common reasns people petition and finally to standardise handling  differant people get differant answers on the same type of petition depending who you talk to

t2 bpos are really interesting personally id see them taken outt1 bpos should still exist  they are more open source and should only require a onetime license to run productionhowever in rl the hightech items require an ongoing rd department if you want to produce t2 there should be a cost associated with rd and requiring invention fits that modelsince new technology isnt created in eve once you get a t2 bpo you never have to worry about research too simple imo it really closes off a big profession
as i see it there is not problem current t2 bpo holders have a slight advantage yes but one can only hope that over the next few years these bpos will also get removed by mistakes of there owner as for just simply removing them thats not a option it would cause the owners to riot and rightfully so they have paid great deals of isk to get them usually and i do not think ccp should ever just remove items owned by players unless it was gained though a exploit or cheat witch these bpos were not
removed them already you given t2 bpo holders long enough to realize invention is how t2 items will be produced

the current rate is 1495 usd per month what if we went with 1995 usd per month for 2 characters training and 2495 for three this way ccp would still get more money per month and the characters would train upthe only problem i see with this is implementation of the gtcs but we could just have them worth a general amount 60 day  2995 game cost so a 60 day gtc for an account training two characters would only be worth 45 days of game time or 38 days for three characters does this sound like a reasonable idea for both the playerbase and ccp

sure why not lets fire up the way back machine and set it to fall 2006i had just started playing eve and had a few aquiantances that were helping me get started we decided that we wanted to join a player corp together and so one of them went hunting after a week or so that person discovered tadao and we all decided to join tadao was a member of the bruce alliance and as they were war decced by mc we ended up joining a week later when it endedinitially things seemed fine and with how green i was i wouldnt have really noticed if they werent tadao wasnt really organized in that they had no real forums and a public yahoo group containing little information was the only out of game resource i assumed this was normal until i found the link for the bruce alliance forums and signed up what i found was that this corp was the member of a very active up and coming alliance within a week or two i had absorbed everything i could from the alliance forums and began participating in alliance opsit didnt take long to notice that tadao was in the alliance but didnt really do anything sure they offered reasonably priced ships to alliance members but that was pretty much it most members sat in high sec and mined nobody went on ops except for a few exceptions i was always the only tadao member participating with the alliancea little more time went by and the issue became even more obvious we had a spy issue that spy ended up being in our corp during war decs the people getting popped due to carelessness were mainly in our corp after a particularly exciting pvp op that i attended with xenios alfar and katamarino of blazing angels i decided it was time to move i joined blazing angels so as to remain with bruce but also to be in a corp with people who had the same goals as the alliancethings seemed quiet for a while but it didnt take long bruce moved to syndicate in the pc9 cluster and was doing well tadao had grown and seemed to be improving at least slightly then one day it happened at least half her corp rejected her management and left to form happy hour mining and industry homi which then joined bruce it was sometime around then that bruce leadership discovered that issler had paid huzzah to allow her to move her freighter around syndicate huzzah were our primary opponents at the time major red box action i dont remember if that was the final action that got her kicked out but it wasnt long after that when tadao was ejected from brucesince the freespacers were essentially part of tadao they were ejected too several members got together and decided they wanted to stay in bruce so we brought them over to blazing angels the pattern repeats itself because issler either doesnt want to lead or cant lead i dont know which one it is i dont actually hate her or anything im just frustrated by her ways she says she parted ways with bruce long ago but if you evesearch issler bruce youll see her mouth had some difficulty letting it goeve is a game where any action you take can be a catalyst for some other action even naming your alliance something you find funny can bother somebody else and make you a target from my point of view she fails to understand this concept or at least that this concept is by design when we war decced the accord she tried to paint us as pirates to the locals which failed in truth we were just a corp with a beef and we used the war dec system to pursue itissler made a comment in local while we were there along the lines of i give my members ships and leave them alone why is that bad my answer to that is its not bad but its only part of leading a corp id recommend taking some of that money and doing some agony pvp classes together as a corp not because you plan to pvp but because in eve somebody elses plans may force you to

i absolutely support this idea on two conditions1 character names can only be changed once2 there is a fee associated for the change similar to changing portraitsif those two conditions are followed that should significantly limit the usefulness of this change to scammers but still give serious eve players the opportunity to correct a foolish name on an otherwise good character
i want to raise 2 points from my industrialist friend he thinks and i think hes right that since elite pvp alliances have access to dyspropromo moons giving 10s or 100s of b per monthes bob  more or less 450bmonth with that ressource only that these alliances can remove their industrialists unless they produce capital ships for free using dyspropromo isk because its a passive incomeisk should be made activly by industrialists if you understand what he means his first reaction reading colonies was noooooooo not a passive income for pvpers again  second he would like that full carebear allaince to be a viable solution in 00 currently the stronger pvper allainces are succesfull at the expense of dozens of hard working carebears alliances carebears as in industrialists not pveers its not balanced  pvping is the royal way carebearism could be the royal way in colonieshe means that carebearism could have some critical use in 00 today there is none colonies could save this my point of vue is still carebear and pvpers interactions there is none so the two communities never have interactions but the way eve is made every pvper stil need a ship and weapons and every carebear in 00 need peace defended by weapons they makes so  in 00 id really love a lot more pvper need for carebears because carebears need for pvpers becauseyou know what i mean  dialogue mutual help and mutual understandingwhat colonies makes output for carebear and pvpers or maybe 00 living conditions could help thisid love a unsurvivable 00 without carebears like it was in 2006  as it is now for unsurvivable 00 without pvpers for carebears

there are 1650mm arties i dont get iti wouldnt say so they are different boats its like comparing raven to rokhso you want the tempest to have less dps but more trackingso tempest hurts already because of 6 turrets4launchers you also want to put more drone training into it is the typhoon in need of friendsseriously though why not just boost projectiles trackingnow this is the real boost if you compare rokh to mael the tanks are 100 identical except mael has to have an active booster to be the same which in this ehp eraso ya the base shield is really effective i fear though that 75 is too much then again i just crunch the numbers and it brings the mael right in line with the abaddon except the abaddon is super cap dependant while maelstrom could almost laugh the cap away add a vulture and you will be epic pwwwn5 per lvl would be more reasonable

so everyone fears losing an unupdated clone is there any reason anyone should ever be without a clone no can it make you so mad you wanna quit the game if you dont remember to get one of these clones and die guaranteed i dont care if your a buddhist masterwhy not get rid of the sp penalty completely or just automatically charge you if you have to punish that player for getting podded i am willing to bet all players would eagerly trade a few isk for potentially alot of sp so why not a automatic fee are there people that dont use clones or wouldnt want toif there were a way to actually earn sp it would be one thing but you cant so a potential loss of sp means you lose both your time and your money and all because you were trying to play the game instead of stopping to do paperwork for a cloneand what happens if theres an error with this system when you get a new clone what if it doesnt update properly then lets say something unintended did happen who would you turn to and would they even be willing to help you rofl and btw no i havent lost a clone before making this thread i just dont think i should have to worry about it and eve is just too plain buggy to have such a potentially devastating feature that doesnt enhance gameplay
i havnt lost a clone either like that and i think its a pretty crappy feature in the game so support givena feature i would like is being able to edit your basic atributes which you first picked when starting a accountnot the ones that you get bonuses to from your blood line or anything like that but the ones where you had 5 points to spend on picking atributes
interesting idea but were at the technological level when a store should realize youre out of groceries and send you some why doesnt it do that choiceif you automate the process you both lose the choice of which level of clone to upgrade to and you minimize the risk of this game risk is one of the primary facets of this game and it creates the onedge attitude that pervades it even in highsecurity spaceyou have to turn on autopilot for it to automatically travel to a given destination you have to turn on your guns and ewar when being attacked you should also have to choose to upgradei can agree to an evemail that saysbut what you ask removes a lot of elements that draw people to this game sorry i cannot support itedit and odetta that feature is being released in the next expansion apocrypha and is already on the test server check it out for yourself
a popup after cloning to remind you to update your clone should suffice imho
step 1 check chachter sheetstep 2 check your current sp count against your clone sp countif sp  clone spupgrade cloneelseresume pew pew pewnot supportedand while i may appreciate such a feature i think there are far more important matters to fix
not supported while ive made the mistake of letting my skills exceed my clone before and i could have benefitted from this feature i am not in favor of ideas that take responsibility and the ability to screwup away from the players forgetting to update your clone is supposed to be a painful learning experience
you know my cell phone company will automatically charge me for my bill every monthyou know they will charge me extra automatically if i exceed my minutes not shut me off or take back minutes from me and make me repay for those same minutesthe cost for a clone is negligible in relation to similar clone grades so choice is microscopic to say the least and as for a danger factor to a player shouldnt that be factored into the deathgame itself not a potential loss of memory after the fact on the next death for fluff purposes this is absolutely insane to include in the game for gameplay purposes do you really enjoy losing your hard earned sp because you forgot to dot your i on your paperwork thats threat wow gg rofledit and id really like to meet the guy who came to this game because he saw someone who lost sps from losing an unupgraded clone eves sense of loss comes from the ships you lose or other material goods maybe even implants but sps which you cant get back through gameplay in any way is just a kick to the pants
taunt someone forgot to upgrade his clone today tauntgrow up get a better cell phone and adapt or diewhats next automatically have your clone stalk you as you travel to the other side of the galaxy
did you actually read the postand um what
all i see is your pathetic attempt at pitywhats really sad is your the first believe it or not poster ive seen complain about something so seemingly simple that its utterly insane to even bother complaining about itif you cant take the time to exercise your brain cells to figure that out well then were done herebecause i get more complaints about wardecs and greifing then i do over someone forgetting to update there bloody clonehell ive done it fortunately ive not be podded when i forgot but its unsettling so once a day when i log in i check to see my current spits not rocket science and asking the good folk at ccp to program you a omgwtfiforgottoupgrademyclone button is nothing short a foolish waste of there timeby the way cell phones are variable monhtly fee basednot one timeclones are a one time fee they grab a corpse clean it up and leave it in a vat with your imprint its not thier fault you forgot to tell them to get a new onethats your faultthe penalty for forgetting to update your clone is completely based on the fact you forgotyou you youstop shifting the blame
hore on forum troll hore on
this is exactly the kind of stupid user trick i get asked to program around everyday at work its annoying there and its annoying here just check on your clone once in a while and you wont have a problemnot supported
yes please
if you want to look for a gimp system try projectils till then count your blessingsedit btw not supported
isk is not xp points
i like where youre going kazou but i think some additional changes would need to be met to further make this idea workableboosting overall total yield amounts in the low and middle end oreschanging the ratio amounts for specific roids that are master of nonechange mineral volumes reducing trit in size over all and increasing its capacity to be hauled uncompressed while vastly increasing volume size of high endsremove all t1 loot periodchange the mineral ratios for all meta items so that more trit and occasional high ends occur than mid ends
aka nobody then mixes anything up forgive me because i cant seem to see where it says you are going by group originally even thenthis doesnt seem to be a group deal but rather a limit of the amount of volume you can put into those 11 slotsso those of us who grinded our standing with a corp just for the 0 tax now get nerfed because you think so even if its ore how yaay so really you propose a mining nerf alsoand still this only screams of massive slot waiting time which just hurts the miners more than mission runners who just save up lots of mods and such refine in huge batches and wait the days the miners then have waitson top of that what if you just finished a mining op or tritanium is skyrocketing and you have 100mil veldspar to refine you cant refine it now like you can now you have to waitsorry but if its not broke dont fix itthe dev who posted the details even said that mission runners account for very little minerals per capita
first line of your post and already you say something imprecise great way to shot it downfrom chronotis postcare to explain what rat give out ships beside the mission reward in the non repeatable starting missionand what missionrat loot drop morphite as the drone alloy are in the drone compound columnand all the modules used for mineral compression are included in the loot part editread this post tooherewording is a bit unclear maybe the server ate part of chronotis post but it seem to mean that from the table the 1 morphite in the loot column is coming from reprocessed shipsitems coming from the market or player production and that 4 of that 18 zydrine come from the same sourceapplying the same rapport it mean that 95 of that 42 of tritanium come from mineral compression and player build items probably even more as ships and compression items are tritanium heavy
a loss associated with reprocessing is good for a rp point of view but must be applied in all spacereducing refining in empire space alone is the stupidest thing to do it will hurt miners much more that people reprocessing loot and it will not resolve in any way the problem of people that consider minerals and loot they get free
another way to read that post is that 1 of the loot part 4 of the zydrine come from reprocessing ships the bolded item on the original question but then we are totally lacking the data on the modules used for compressing minerals for transportation a very important part of the reprocessed t1 modules especially for the low ends
weve all seen the awesome videos where the ships are in a fleet formation then crashing into each other however in game were just a massive blob of ships orbiting around each other why not implement a fleet tool that organizes up to the battle grid and let us upload coordinates to other ships in a fleet that way we can arrange tanks snipers  tacklers and ecm or support ships in a certain order  kind of like the medieval army set ups only withspace shipshere are some pros i can think offleet flights would be more interesting and there would be more tactical thinkingeasy to implement make up a code for ships to align to a certain order and when we click the battle grid thing we can pinpoint the exact location altitude and position we want other ships to align to update 1 more idea synchonized warping  weve all seen that some ships warp to destinations some faster than the others why not implement a synchronize to slowest warper feature in the fleet tool of course only the captain can use this or the gang leadersalso during that warp we will maintain the same speed and warp into our predetermined positions in the grid
its called bms bookmarks etc fc makes a bunch of bms and copies them then gives them to player then every1 warps to the bms in a set distance
lol please stop wasting everyones time dictor are fine the way they are if you dont like getting stuck in a dictor bubble dont go into other people house simple as that
getting dropped out of warp or stuck in a bubbleget a got damn cloak already
hictors do need a nerf and boost1 devoter and phobos need a boost phobos needs 50m3 of drone bay devoter needs 5 bonus to medium energy turret rate of fire changed to a dmg mod instead rof hurts cap2 hictors need their sensor resolution bottomed out like mad they were designed to come in to bring balance to low sec moms thats the only purpose 110 their sensor resolution aka around 25mm or so
one of their functions was to provide a method for tackling lowsec supercaps that is not their only function
hics are fine as they arei take it youre just crying because your stabs wont work around them
this is what i do not get why is it that whenever a introduced feature appears to be broken it is placed in the queue as opposed to on top of the queue where a broken introduced feature belong
as they stand they are the eve equivalant of a broken leg all that has been suggested so far is basically putting a band aid on a broken leg as its not really solving the issue rather its transfering the the problemthe sacriledge was redone three times before it became useable each time they compleatly scrapped it and remade the ship the apoc was the worst battleship in eve until they compleatly scd its role and remade it with fleet pvp in mindnightmare is another almost broken ship that had the clean sheet of paper treatment now a nightmare is no longer a expensive low quality typhoon but rather a intresting and useful shield tanking laser shiplots of concepts get updated with modern eve play or changes in real world pvp the black ops concept would have worked in 2004 but its 2009 now and the type of role for black ops just does not exist anymorebasically what i am saying is forget what we know previously about black ops and start again with a clean sheet of paper and redesign these ships with todays styles of pvp in mind
i can only explain from my perspective of what weve been told but even with 11 different teams working on things each team has a speciality if the broken item falls into field x and the team that handles field x is working on something else its moved down the queue from that point on lead game designers decide what is next in the queue and that is what that team handles next so with that in mind csm did bring up the issue to put a higher priority of fixing prenerfed which black ops was things into mandatory review in the pipeline as you can see from the minutes ccp generally agreed with that idea and were hoping it gets implemented asapas for waratron  i think were generally agreeing that blackops need to be redone its just a question of how far they need to delve into whats wrong with them that is adding to the holdup completely scrapping them and rebuilding from the ground up will take time whereas trying to find a simple solution to making them work might be less time consuming
what he said runescape that way
plex  gtc  less complicated tradingif plex are a problem then gtc are a problem are gtcs a problem i dont think soand no just because ccp sells plex directly does not mean that they will sell other items for money it is pretty obvious what doing so would cause and ccp would have to be braindead not to know that yet if wed just assume that ccp was indeed braindead they could abstain from selling other items ingame and still send the game down the drain swiftly braindead people have this ability to always find a way to screw upgot it unless there is a problem that could not be possibly fixed anyway there is no problem at all conclusion no use to make a fuss one way or another
roflmao you win i cant stop laughing have a cookie   isaac
you suck at reading and didnt reply to anything its not about paranoid its simply logic if you let case a thru then there no reason similar case b shouldnt be doneisnt runescape one of those horrible games where you buy ingame itemsi got no problem with plex its dumb that they dont just sell 30 day tc but whateveri find the problem being that ccp is selling the plex straight to people ingame while it somewhat dumb thus why i didnt make a serious write up i do believe it might be a gateway to selling other items ingame in the futurethere really no reason for ccp to sell plex straight to users it take less then a minute to buy a gtc and enter it and get the plex yet there is a risk if players respound postivity to this then ccp may decide it be better to sell other ingame items as well there really no reason a corperation wouldnt try to add to its revenue stream in such a fashion
paranoia is a thought process characterized by excessive anxiety or fear often to the point of irrationality and delusion ok punk you want it here it is i did read your pathetic little post and yes by definition it is paranoiano a does not have to be followed by b and if you want to break it down barneystyle i can for you there is no evidence that selling game time in game will lead to selling anything else plexs are just game time period you are afraid of something you think might possibly happen if they do what they are doing id be suprised if you refused to go outside ever for fear of being hit by carsyou dont have any evidenceargument or reason for your entire ed topic youre wasting space on the assembly hall for people who have legitimate ideas and issues no one here has a serious problem with plexes and no one here is enough of a lunatic to agree with you so go take some happy pills and get the frak off our board oh yeah and for insulting my ability to read ill continue the tradition world of warcraft 
your topic title is misleadingand your proposal is a 2 liner which tells me 1 of 2 things1 your just a child with no care or concern and just want things your way2 your got scammedif you had bothered to put a little more thought and effort into your post you could have gotten somewhere all you did was show a severe lack of thought and maturity on the proposal itselfand trueutter paranoiaso chicken little time for you to go back out into space and to stop saying the sky is falling because its not just the debris from your ship
finally a rather good idea needs some work but it shows promise
youre right there needs to be no limit on wardecs and the fee needs to be loweredgiven how easy to mess around with docking games hide steal loot and all wars should be made easier and more accessibleif you want wars to not be a griefing tool you need to sort out everything else that is wrong with pvp
no limit on war decs and the fee loweredso what your saying is you want wardecs 247ok warhammer is that way now how about rejoining reality pleaseand post with your main
yah yeah manthen we can make it mandatory that new players come and die and we get ultra loot then we can have an ultra wardec where we pay 50000 isk to wardec 50 corps at once and then they all have to fight each other and usthen we can have ultrafrigates which kill regular frigates but only people with 10 security status can use themhell yeah mother erslaps himself oh yeah i forgot im not a douche
i thought you were at least willing to discuss things sensiblynow its obviously youre just a jerk who thinks his way of playing it the only way
i did discuss things sensibly with you for a page or so that was before i saw you were just proposing the same tired proposal that all griefers propose nothing new youre the same tired old whiners with the same old garbage it got old a couple of years ago man
frankly this is where you lost any chance of discussing this seriously if there was ever a chancethe argument you present here is exactly the same argument that has been proposed in those threads if you had actually read them youd of course know
a better idea would be to charge people in npc corps twice the subscription rate of people in player corps
wouldnt make more sense to charge the player corp people extra after all you keep saying those who stay in npc corps are missing out on half the game
anything would be better than the ops trollermimeanideas

ah sorry bout that mateim too used to lashing out at trolls wait im a troll or am iouuukittens twitch
this is a bad idea that will lead to more bad ideas letting this get into the door will lead to more of this crap mechanic being added to the game its a bad idea its bad for the game its bad for ccp to even let this go anywhere they need to reverse course and get this mechanic out of t3 ships right nowi will not even consider flying a t3 ship until this mechanic is gone
if you dont want to lose sp if you die eject or dont fly it
i could not care less if i lost a days training over a t3 ship if anything it is the financial loss that will keep me from them as i imagine they will be extremely expensive in the beginning
while the loss of sp for a level 1 skill is nothing staggering it will make training the subsystem skills at more than 3 not worth it unless the effect of training them is very largethere are several other factors that can make the t3 ships very rare in particular the time required to gather the materials to build one against the possible sell price
supporting only because i think its the wrong approach per se the usual suspects are busy arrogantly whining about both sides of the risk vs reward equation like this is some mathematical principle that they personally laid down but i think theyre missing the pointthe t3 manufacturing process will befind wormholeenter with enough ships tokill very tough sleeper npcsmine the new gas forms in wspacehope you get out of wormhole again with loot  gas intact and not jumped by some other hunting group and dont end up in the middle of delvereverse engineer the components to create a bpcreactionfind enough bpcs and reactions to actually make a t3 ship partrun said reactions in a pos in lowsecbuild t3 ship part  again can only be done in a pos though that can be done highsechope that enough other people are selling the other parts that someone can actually build a shipid say the above already covers a fair old risk and timesink t3 ships are still being balanced so its hard to predict how much more capable they will be at release but the above process alone may discourage large scale manufacturing except by those large groups who really dont need more power handed to themsure its only a rank 1 skill and sure you can fly a t3 ship with them at 0 if you want but this is directly interfering with the training system of skills in a way never done before in eveif as is alleged ccp fear that some groups in eve have too much money and that isk isnt a barrier any more perhaps they should consider how those groups got too much money in eve and fix that problem rather than a quick hack to introduce an alternative penalty
i have an idea i was sitting in the bath and as it came to me i cried eureka and jumped out logged on and im wetting my keyboard and can hardly see the keys because of soap suds so i beg your pardon for any spelling mistakeskamikaze tacticsnow if theres one thing which is very unrealistic in eve its the fact that you bump off anything you fly into ok off course it means you cant have any nasty accidents but it also means you cannot use this kamikaze tactic to ram a hostile say as a last resort bumping ok its used tactically but it is stupid only reason it has been implemented as a tactic is because it happens to be a part of the gamepicture thisyoure in structure yet firing away all guns blazing but in danger of being popped as reds clamour in to gang bang you two ways from sunday your target is also in structureyou cannot do much whether you disengage or not its far too late youre going to get popped by his red mates before you can finish him off  but imagine if you could just aim right for the fatherless one ram him  blowing both up in the processor imagine this kamikaze method used as a fleet tactic imagine ramming a good few t1 cheapo noob frigs into the creme de la creme of the hostile fleet mauling him quite badlysuch a tactic would add another dimension to the game a complete new dimension and look at a tactical and strategic approach people will have to rethink their entire fleet philosophy to cater or counter such a tactic such a tactic is also realistic as far as realism goeswell heres my idea i reckon a ship should have the potential to ram an opponent providing the opponent is or has been aggressed and is hostile damage could be dependent upon ship size velocity angle of approach and level of impact and location of impact and what is actually in the cargo holds ie a load of explosive missilesat all other times things should stay as normalsome drawbacks could include an automatic podding as a consequenceany comments
this has been posted elsewhere and while it might be interesting its way overpowered and doesnt fit into ccps vision of its game so not supported isaac
i agree awesome tactic would be fun but i can just imagine the gankfests that would take place20 some odd rookie ships all plowing into a freighter in jita yep fantastici would love it but it would be easily abusednot supported until theres some refinement in the idea
my initial response to this is that i like the concept of what youre talking about  it has that dramatic last ditch effort feeling very romantic in moviesunfortunately i have to agree with drake this would be so abused it wouldnt be long before no one would undockthe only you could possibly fix this is to add in the stipulation that kamikaze pilots die they dont get zapped into a clone they dont get pushed out the door in a pod they the character go poof permanently and irretrievably in the same cloud of flaming gas as their shipeven that isnt perfect there are scenarios that could still result in serious abuse of the mechanicnot supported
ok so the penalty phase may have been a bit much but im a bit frustrated in that i have a genuine problem and its been since 100209 and ive not gotten a single responde theres no button to escalate no response after 48 hours or no other options i just gotta keep hoping someone will say somethingive had another petition that after weeks of ignoring they responded with a question then closed it i have no way to reopen a petition that was closed  by the gm and not by me  because i was out of town and eveless for four days they took a week to respond but i go out of town at the wrong moment and they close the petitionapparently my quiet little corner of eve where i have sent a whole four petitions in the four years ive owned this account ive been flagged as dont respond to this guy ever because it took me two years of playing before i ever petitioned anything  and it was a game bug not a waaaah my ship got shot kind of thingas far as the other how would you like that i would love too ive been in customer service for years id even be willing to work on the weekend or evenings because this is the kind of job you can do from your home and dont have to drive in yes theyre quite thankless and there are a lot of heads out there that like to badger however ccp themselves have admitted that the pos exploit was petitioned years ago something is broken with the customer interaction portion of eve
while your banging your war drum remember they have to answer out of a possible 50000 players or more at anyone timei dont care how many people you have staffed your not gonna get to all of them in one business dayguess you didnt think about that did youim quite content with ccp so far yes its not perfect but then ive not had much to complain about either
just an idea i had would it be nice to have some kind of dog fighting stule in eve perf in frigs and cruiser class ships as the go with the desired speed anywayinstead of just orbiting an enemydiscuss
the only way youd be able to get that kind of thing is to do first person prespective via cockpitunfortunately that is impossible and not likely to happen due to the fact that you are in a pod and your camera drones are your eyes and ears unless they slap one on the nose of your ship and you decide to stay in that viewpoint
unless we could change the view point then yeah you are correctstill i dont think its a bad idea
go to your options and activate advanced camera options its very possible you set your target as main interest and manual fly via double clicks i do it all the time
always wanted this but ya eve is kinda set in its path with no hope for changemaybe eve 2 and maybe we can get rid of this gawd awful skill point system too lol
oothat skill point system you oh so hate is the one thing that makes this game uniqueits not wow in space pal its eve online  o p
well if there were a way to progress your character yourself in anyway that would be one thing and i wouldnt be making this postbut putting everyone on a timer means the worst player that ever played the game that started early will still always have more skills then a skilled or intelligent player almost no matter what you do thats ed tbhnotice im not playing wow and thank gawd to that but i do have to say wows leveling system is alot more desirable at this point in time due to it being not completely static and immovable
no one said you had to play eve online either
i think its past your bedtime
wow that the best you can come up with
plz guys dont derail the topic
the only good part about this new interface is the fact that once i have struggled through a fitting i can save it and reapply it without having to use it again
been away but this part simply isnt true as the tracking speed isnt modified so your tracking speed still has to at least match or be greater than a targets angular velocity not that it matters now as this has been voted out but perhaps i should have made it clearer i did post example numbers which seem to have been overlooked this proposal does not mean automatic hit it simply boosted the hit chance from 50  turret tracking speed  target angular velocity to 100  turret tracking speed target angular velocity when inside 14km
uh yes that is exactly what it does i didnt notice it at first or else i would have pointed out that flaw earlier but when i started to review your formula that is exactly the result you getmax1 1exprange2000  05   trackingpenalty  sigpenalty  2  optimalpenalty  falloff  falloff  2look at what happens when you drop in a value of 1386mmax1 1exprange2000  05  max1 1exp13862000  05  1now you tell me what 1anything isas long as the trackingfalloff part can be resolved ie no divide by zero due to range the actual result is irrelavent as the final result is 1 ie always hits
ah it should have been a multiplier not to the power of ie 05 up to 1 x fraction due to trackingangular velocity so that its not possible to spit out a 1 unless target is stood still oh well my up but i stand by the general aim and the flaw in the current formula
i also stand by my earlier suggestionfirst prove that there is infact a problem with how short range turrets are balanced and not with how you are attempting to use themthen look for an adjustment to attributes before rewriting mechanicslastly if attribute adjustments cannot solve the problem look for a new mechanic based on the merrits of its playablity indepent of any resemblence to reality
more build slots please
so is there a way to get around the valid issues you described its good to get some constructive criticism too 
im in favor of pretty much anything ccp can do to allow me to skill more than one player per account as long as its not approaching the cost of another account fee to pay the second character skilling feeim sure they could put an option at activation of the 60 day code which would allow you to get 45 days for 2 accounts skilling or 30 days for 3 accounts skilling ive not done the math how that works out but you get the idea how it could be done with gtcsor you could sell 60 day 2 character gtcs and 60 day 3 character gtcs they used to have multiple gtcs available before so it shouldnt be hard to do thisor ccp could benifit directly by making it possible if you subscribe directly through ccp and not include gtc acctivationsid rather not cut out this player base and i see no reason they would have to but im just throwing out options
the unfairness issue of t2 bpos aside the introduction of invention benefited most eve pilots more than introducing a few more t2 bpos into the game would ever have hulks became affordable for all old mining guides used to angonize over whether one could recover the cost of a 400 million mining ship invention opened up the supply of hulks and cov ops cloaks and many other items plus even though the research points will never yield a t2 bpo at least there is now a market for the datacores so its always passive income on the side whether anything should be done about t2 bpos is a different question but the invention model was a step forward for manufacturers and customers alike at least as far as making it a system for everybody its invention that forced ccp to look at alchemy as a solution to other bottlenecks in the manufacturing pipeline all in all i see invention as a success though i wish i had some nice t2 blueprint originals too
the vast majority of techii bpo holders nowdays did not win them  they bought them off the lottery winners so any kind of asset stripping does not disadvantage a bunch of lucky winners  they are longgone with their cashnerfing tech ii bpos will simply hurt players that worked hard to gain the money to buy the bpos like any other bpo in the game
how about ccp removing the advantage of the current t2 bpo holders by introducing more of them this would have to be a slow process so that the current holders dont find the bpos value wiped out instantly im thinking of something like the following  ccp keeps track of the number of times each t2 item has an invention attempt  every week or so ccp releases a t2 bpo for each of the top x invented items unless one item has less than y invention attempts x should be low enough that the current bpos dont become worthless overnight y is to stop new bpos being produced when there are enough of them  when a bpo is released the counter is reset to 0  there will also be a small delay on each counterwith this the existing t2 bpos will lose value over time as the new bpos are researched up this will also lead to the price of t2 items dropping even further once there are enough bpos to let the bpos set the price which has the disadvantage of making invention on that item unprofitable so invention rates will drop to a point where the counter stays below y so no new bpos are produced until demand increasesthe bpos can be released via either the lottery or via auctions ccp spawns the bpo then puts it up on auction either way the people with the money will buy the bpoadvantages  it will make the current t2 bpos less of an advantage because of the new ones unless they remain profitable enough to be able to buy up all of the new ones if they do keep their output restricted enough that invention sets the price eventually the people saving up to buy that t2 bpo will be able to outbid them  this will lead to lower prices on t2 items for everyone as we no longer have the wastage on invention bpcs adding to the price  because the t2 bpos lose value slowly but are not destroyed it should lessen complaints especially since the people with the current bpos still have the initial advantages of a researched bpo and an existing production chaindisadvantage  this will make invention unprofitable which is bound to annoy a lot of people the people manufacturing stuff from invented bpcs will probably be able to buy bpcs off the bpo holders but the people selling datacores will lose their passive incomei dont like the idea of wiping out someones income like this even though its only a passive income one that i dont make use of but its still fairer that just deleting an existing item
wow just wowso let me get this straight issler led a corp which you think wasnt involved enough in an alliance and a spy made it in which did most of his damage to her corpshe paid pirates once who were not huzzah to get minerals needed for bruce ships you dont remember what else she could have done to get kicked out but her corp wasfast forward to today you dont think her way of running a corp is best cool but you still havnt said what she did to youas far as reporting you as pirates in local goes more than just her reported you and you did kill at least one ship i know of that had absolutely no affiliation to usher style of gameplay isnt for you thats fine theres a good number of people who do like styles other than yours even some who prefer to fly with isslertadao is about having fun in eve if people dont want to concentrate on pvp we do our best to make sure they dont have to if they do theyre given the opportunity to explore that was well tadao and the honda accord are about the freedom to enjoy eve however we want to the only limiting case here being downright griefing which if youve spent a day in tadao youd know that its just not the type of people we areunder different circumstances we might have gotten along or at least had fun pew pewing eachother im much less the industrialist but i only saw huge blobs from foom i think scomis request for specifics still stands but i dont know your post might have been what she was looking forpscan we get this moved out of jita park publicity is nice and all but im pretty sure this doesnt belong here
woooothanks for the response lemmie see if i can sum allllllll that stuff up ill do my best because well im sorry but i have no idea who the people you mentioned are or what syndicate pc9 cluster red box action are or why those things are relevant 3 years ago you joined isslers corp and stayed with it for two months so im not exactly sure why the lack of out of game resources was so disturbing since you didnt stay long and were able to easily find other sources of info and again im not sure what this has to do with anything you were disappointed that tadao members didnt participate in many ops you dont mention how many members the corp had at that time were there quite a few miners or why this was such a serious concern you said they provided ships somehow even without joining the ops but dont say what else an industrial corp in the alliance should have been doing there was a spy in the corp  i find it hard to believe that this was the one and only spy ever to slink into the alliance you dont mention how this single spy was particularly devastating to the alliance issler paid a rival alliance though there seems to be some dispute about who exactly was paid to allow her to move one freighter you dont mention if this was a onetime move or if she was cutting them checks and sending them giant cheese platters every day for months  nor do you mention how this damaged the alliance issler leaves bruce and the pattern repeats itself im not sure how this is possible when her corp was no longer part of the alliance or how you could know this long after youd left her corpi took your advice and searched issler bruce but really cant find much all the recent posts relate to the revenge actions of the past month or so in all of 2008 there are a total of 8 threads where she mentions bruce at all and 3 of those threads were just corp recruitment pitchesmaybe you could help me out and point out the horribly awful unbelievably hurtful things shes said about bruce because im having trouble finding itshe tried to paint us as pirates to the locals im really not sure what locals youre talking about here or why youd be concerned about what these locals thinkso then let me know if i got this rightformer bruce people have spent three years being upset about this beef freighter move payoff one spy lack of ops participation and mean forum postscertain members have spent an absolutely astounding amount of time resources and energy during those three years to seek revenge for the freighter move payoff one spy lack of ops participation and mean forum poststhey sent a spy to spend a month or so pretending to be a tournament team member in order to assassinate her he blows up her ship in the second round of the tournament the team still wins the match howeverthen they launch a war dec assemble and move dozens of ships from one end of the galaxy to the other for a week and blow up a few ships and some stationsthen finally start a ridiculous forum smear campaign using driveby bombthrowing alts ie this threadall this for something that happened 3 years ago in an alliance that no longer existsim sorry but unless im missing something id have to disagree about whos having some difficulty letting it go
ive requested this thread be moved to coad as it seems to fit the nature of that forum betterissler
i dont believe this is a better fit for caod we have dealt with issues relating to questions of character of csm members in the past in the csm forums and its for the best they remain here
ok thento the points madeno spies where ever proven to be in any corp of mine in fact several excellent members teebee and skior became so upset at bruce trying to affect the normal operation of tada o that they became outspoken and accused of spying as a result they left our corpwe never lost half our corp a seriously random pilot named john caldwell took advantage of a time in my life where rl limited my online time he at one point demanded i let him take over my org i told him what he could do with the suggestion he then told a whole pile oh lies about how i was leaving eve and how he had really been in charge as a result we lost about 20 to happy hour mining good ridance last i heard john had left evewhen we left bruce i deliberately planned a life as far away from them as possible after a lot of exploration we ended up in molden heath since then we have had no interaction with themfreed whose name i deliberately misspell managed to get an alt happy joymaker into beep for the tourny i had no idea happy was an alt because i could care less about freed and bruce and how foom screwed all those that were committed to bruceyes when niskin was in tada o we had a very sad web site it is sad again as my hosting org is going out of business guilty as chargedthe bottom line over 120 folks currently make beep their home easily triple that would return if asked we are three years old and beep has now lasted longer than bruce beep is not about me it is about helping anyone in eve that wants help to mine to mission to explore to build and soon to fight 666 pilots of eve voted that they believe me when i say thatso looking at this in the harsh light of reality some folks decided corps should be about the members and not the leaders i agreed to organize that experiement now we have become an alliance that takes that idea to the next level i ran to be part of the csm to try and make sure that idea can florish i dont use my position in the csm to prohibit other paths in eve i just try and make sure the carebears can have a place at the tableso about the current conflict weve lost a several billion isk pos network as a result of this grudge i have not proposed a change to the war mechanism or any other game mechanism eve is harsh and aholes with grudges deserve their outlets for their disfunctions to encourage the folks i choose to represent i can tell you that there are alternatives to balance the equation foom now has debris fields where several cap ships once where if you think you are being bullied please realize there exists in eve ways to turn the karma wheelso all i can say is beep survives i remain committed to the folks i think elected me and life in the verse goes onissler
so youre saying that the spy did damage to tadao and farther down issler says there were never any spies teebee was a spy and a head i cant confirm much past thatfire mantle or huzzah whoever it doesnt matter rather than asking for help from people in her own alliance she embarrassed us by showing weakness to our enemies tadao was the weakest link and things like that made it visible to our opponents so if you want to know what she did exactly she embarrassed an alliance that i was proud ofkillboard shows one punisher killed in illamur that was not from your alliance killboard comment reports him as a pirate play how you want i dont care i didnt start this thread thats not my title up there my issue is clear if you read my first post i dont think isslers involvement with the csm will improve the game if she wants to make suggestions about high sec and industry and trading thats fine but keep it out of low sec and 00 issues anything she suggests that will help non pvpers get access to 00 will hurt the game rather than help it
no disrespect intended but if you dont know what those things are you probably wont understand much of this floofing around in high sec is a whole different game than holding and defending spaceit shows a lack of organization and a lack of leadership i found the information in spite of her rather than because of her thats the differencebruce was a unique alliance being just a miner was discouraged we tried to educate all members tadao didnt provide ships they sold them at slightly below market prices to any alliance member considering that many corps already did this for their own members the service was only marginally usefuldevastating no embarrassing yesim not the alliance historian i dont have every specific detail she chose to pay our primary enemies to get something done rather than looking to her own alliance for assistance again embarrassment yeskicked out just to clarify removed due to too many incidents that were counter to what bruce was trying to achieve anybody who would potentially want to shoot us is something we pay attention to the locals in question would be the people in the molden intel channel if you arent in it you probably should be intel channels are goodcontinued in next post
it wasnt a lot of time when you are organized and motivated things go much easier some people saw an opportunity to take revenge on a person they disliked and they did sowhat you are missing is the same thing ive been trying to point out in this thread eve is a sandbox and there are no recess ladies in some areas of the sandbox if somebody wants to shoot at you because of something you did 3 years ago they can heck if they want to shoot at you for no reason they can
teebee was an ahole im surprised you would defend him skiorh didnt bother me he wasnt around much anyway since he would leave from time to go be a piratenice attempt at spin john caldwell was motivated active and understood what it meant to be part of an alliance if your online time was limited and he wasnt filling in then who was ill take your word on the percentage although if we are talking about active members who were actually in syndicate participating then i bet my number is more accuratekicked out for being the weakest link just want to clarify that again anyway thats fine you do what you want to do im not telling you that you shouldnt what i am saying is that the two suggestions you made which i quoted in my first post were dumb and dont mesh with what eve is it makes me question your contributions to the csm what exactly is it that carebears need so badly
whewwow you know im sorry but you really take up quite a lot of thread space and say very little i didnt realize what a tough question this would bethis time i wont even mention all the completely irrelevant things so they wont be quoted and expanded upon even further though i would like to know why extensive knowledge of red box action is needed to understand a beefat the same time ill hope for an end to the hairsplitting about the meaning of one word while completely ignoring what i was sayingleave kicked out who cares when someone is kicked out they leave they dont hang around you quoted that entire passage and focused only on one word then quoted isslers entire post and did the same thing this leads me to believe you dont have an answer at all and only want to waste space to make it look like a legitimate response that and you seem to really loooooove saying kicked outremoved due to too many incidents and lemmie guess you cant remember any of these numerous incidentsokay then kicked out kicked out kicked out there the rest of the quote can now be addressed sheesh i predict it wont be thoughim not understanding this hangup about everything being defined as having things handed to you or the kicked out thing either but i guess we already covered thatprovide doesnt mean give away for free here again you focus on that word and again dont say what else alliance industrial corps were expected to do this was a large part of your beef rememberthings that were once enormously serious 3year grudge sabotage the tourney get out the capital ships send the smear alts to the forum type issues in your previous post are suddenly mere embarrassments nowlike the whole paying primary enemy huzzah thing which morphs into these fire mantle people whoever they are and then back again to primary enemy a post later well whoever youll be saying she paid off in your next post can i ask why shed do this when as you seem to claim the alliance was perfectly willing to help something doesnt add up here and pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease dont complain that help or any other word for that matter means give away for freei simply asked to explain this beef you mentioned and have been stewing about for 3 years and its like trying to staple yogurt to jello and tie it to a glob of melting ice cream these posts make me hungry for some reasonso lets see todays beef update the freighter move payoff to whoever the primary enemy is today  i never heard how many times this happened so im guessing once either way its now only an embarrassment one spy this too has been reduced to only a little embarrassment  oh yeah and the spy was a real jerk i guess lack of ops participation industrial corps were supposed to be regularly involved with mining ops but not be just a miner they should have been educated in something but were not sure what exactly sounds a little 1984ish to me mean forum posts this was a major beef issue that has apparently gone away  although its still mean to call someone a pirate in the intel channelim predicting more overthecharacterlimit posts with more squirming and few answers
i agree with this statementalso the learning skills dont take too long to learn anyway i got all of mine to a decent level in two weeks every tech 2 learning skill past 4 isnt really worth it you dont need level 5 for all the rank 1 learning skills either the payback isnt worth it
i guess all that stuff you mentioned could be found on some planets
i do not advocate dumbing down the game or make it less harsh although the touch of eve sometimes feels like soft skin being dragged across coarse gravel i gladly accept it as the reality of life in new eden i most certainly would not want it any other waywhat i wanted to say is that although there are features in name they are not there in practice a war academy that teaches about war a temple where the role playminded among us gather an actual scrap yard a convention center where corporations or alliances meet with an ability to cast binding votes not as a mere part of the scenery how much scorn do you think i need on a daily basis features that are woven into the fabric of the eve experience new markets to explore and exploit real virtual isk to be made scarce but valuable resources jealously guarded bitterly fought overthe capsuleer is the elite among the new eden citizenry but they have no own home because there is no more pleasing an idea than spending ones life on the bridge of a ship i refuse to believe that new eden could not be equipped with better upholstery and that every aspect of that improved scenery could not have a basis in an actual business model that creates new opportunities for revenuestations need dairy wheat and a host of other products why are these only available from npcs and missioning why is there not an entire space borne food industry because cows and food are not sexy food is beneath our contempt because it is not expensive and it doesnt make a big bang no army marches on an empty stomach why is the production and control of food not a hotly contested item in new eden everybody else in this marvellous 3d fiction adventure called real life seems to think it is why doesnt the eve capsuleerthere are many rich features that can be added to new eden they would not only expand and enhance the experience they would also be of strategic value add to the repertoire and especially on the topic of so sensitive a subject as the production and control of the food supply be a natural expansion of the market a great source of revenue and yet another superb reason to have big spectacular wars foroffer your own insights and suggestions for new markets for essential goods that would be a great feature to be added to the gameabulurd bonifaceme meceo
wow thats a good idea to add the tabs into the ship hangar as well i never really thought of that but it makes sense good stuff
ive been wanting this since foreverid be happy to train a rank 18 skill to get each new division at this point well maybe not happy but id do it
oh god yesif it does happen to be too much for some reason they can always just fake it as well by hardcoding 45 tabs with a class filter like ammo weapon drone module etccontainers are useful but a serious pain and a bad solution when its such a simple ui change to fix the problem i would think after hearing of ccps difficulties with cotainers and the databaseasset list they would be more than happy to come up with an alternative
you mean like well be able to respec attributes only once yeah that sounds reasonable
i dont support this you picked a name out of a chinese take out menu suffer implement name changes and you may as well shard the servers imo your name your reputation carries massive weight in this game particularity if you misuse it
no it doesnt there are so many scammers pirates whatever other lowlives you got around that people simply cant be assed to keep track anymore these people change corporations like i change underwear too and the game cater to this dummy front business to the point where someone hiding behind an alias is simply another shrug among shrugs
yeatheres plenty of people that need to change their names i say let em generate another source of income for ccp just keep their old names in their char info showing a history of previous names 
ah yes and who are you againdid i mention you can buy or sell a character to dodge this mythical reputation if you so desire dont forget of course there are 300 thousand players so you know all of the pirates thieves and crooks
never going to happen simply too simple for the more dark and conspiring of us to negate any and all risk  consequences alike in ventures like thieving scamming griefing etcccp are pretty keen on the balance between risk and reward so  without ccp providing a method to look up previous identities of characters through whatever mechanism they deem fit  its just not going to happenno support for this ever
signed
yep
signedseriously i cant think of a game feature that needs to be revamped more than this really it needs a lot more than just a visual facelift imo
not supportedthose needing nursemaids need not play eve
how can your clone be updated automatically in the situations where your clone is set to a nonmedial station not that i think this should even be possible other than for a jump cloneupdating a clone isnt hard not supported i also wouldnt support autorenewal for insurance on ships
cant support people that are either to lazy or absent minded to check their clone i lost bs5 once 800k and odds because i didnt pay attention and i would have it no other way
agreed
oh yes thats hellofamess
ghost train forever
sirswar decks and the resulting in game dynamics absolutely ruin game play this drives a lot of players out of the eve community that is they quite the game less  for ccpif people want to pvp they can go into low security areasit would greatly improve the enjoyment of playing eve it you eliminated war decking or at least limited it to 03 space or loweras it is i am thinking of leaving the game
can i have your stuff seriously im a bit low on cash at the momentas for your proposal thats never going to happen everyone knows the wardec system needs an overhaul but to eliminate it at all would cause an uproar and personally  me offso yeah game name is efrim black feel free to pass me some stuffs i have some new guys in my corp who can always use some extra cash or ships 
no need to remove itjust raise fees from current 2mil to 100mil every week you can bet 99 of griefers will quit annoying decent players and only reasonable wars will happenfor the moment npc are the only solution why you think so many players stick to their npc for pleasure
perhaps you could make a macro for surrendering it would probably be similiar to the macro you use for miningnothing wrong with the current war dec rules except the limit on them
have a nice life
euhm rightwardecs are flawed atm removing them is not an option though
go lowsec kthxps not enough nuts keep killing miners you are brave people laugh out loud at your killboards full of hulks and retrievers
whats the problem pay a fee kill some targetsedit have you seen my killboard or our killboard yeah we kill miners if we find them haulers too thats what privateers do interrupt tradehowever the majority of our kills and mine are on combat shipsas far as the laughing havent heard any but the more they laugh the more likely they are the ones who refuse to undock when decced or do nothing but play docking games
which is exactly the problem 90 of the wardecs have nothing to do with disrupting logistics removing those stupid miners from the system you want to mine in not liking the colour of the ships they fly in etc the only reason for 90 of the wardecs is just easy targets risk free pvp no point in denying it i dont say you do it i say 90 of the wardecs are that way and yes i made that 90 up but i think it is pretty closeand martha about me i live in 00 providence i am nrds and never even have been in a corp which declared war on another one it is always the other way arround people looking for afk haulers wardeccing us
yes sadly carebears are so protected on all sides its virtually impossible to actually disrupt logistics anymore the only resource you can really fight over is moons to the op can i have your stuff
i lold pretty damn hard sure a lot of ashats dec for easy ganks against noobs what can you do as it stands in noir we get paid to kill wts and i think those on the recieving end have it easy we dec you leave your corp for the week and keep making isk while we are bound by contract to sit by and camp station afkrs the dec is in their favor grow up and can i has all your stuff
you dont get it or you do get it but you just act like you dont get itby far most wardeccers arent intrested at all in disrupting anything they just want easy kills
i have absolutely no problem with wardecs at all however i do think 2m  week represents absolutely no barrier at all why not just make it free if people feel there should be some kind of cost then make it something more sensible say like 2050 mil 2mil is a joke nobody is going to care about that
i agree 2m is not a deturent by any means starting war dec fees at 50m makes much moar sense griefers that take easy kills from noobs probably wont break a profit and after a month are out 200m 
which tbh is completly fine
rokh undocks sees 50 wartargets spams redock and survives this is absurdit is time to change the redock timerleave it at 30 seconds for people who are not wardeccedif you are wardecced make it like 5 minutes to redockthis will lead to station camps being worth the time and effort
because obviously there isnt enough station campingdont station camp and it isnt a problem
would be nice to see a change of some sort its pretty lame when your targets just redock you dont really have a choice but to station camp when you enter a system the war ts just dock up almost instantly then you are forced to station camp them then they just play docking games undock  dock rinse and repeat its also lame when a fleet finally commits and they relize that they have a low chance and just deagro and lose one person while they wait out their aggro timer bumping is useless without mass so thats out of the question would be nice to see a 1 minute change enough time to kill a few or get them to commit to a fight
well there are only really 3 places where you can fight in eve gates stations and poses
maybe you should think this through again
no i would say that the agression timer for fighting should keep you from docking for 5 minutes whether you start it or not i would never agree to you getting wardecced  and having to wait outside whether you fought at all or notno not supported there are too many people who do not play docking games who would be griefed by this
this is one proposal i cannot support while i understand the idea behind it this would fundamentally change the balance of the game rich corporations macro miners and people with lots of real world money would be able to simply mass produce experienced charactersone of the things that make eve so rewarding over the long run is sense of accomplishment after putting in the time and effort to train up advanced skillsnegative on this idea
where is the troll smiley youll have to settle for this
wow this thread is epic simply because its so terrible op must have been either really high or really really stupid when he posted this and as far as im aware stupidity isnt curable
i so not support this this is eve not hello kitty online for crying out loud
qffquote for fail you a macrominer they are the bigger winner if this is applied
maybe you want to create multiple accouts buy the macromining basic skills set and drive a hulk from your 1st dayyes ccp will allow this stay tuned
i agree with most of your observations however your solution is far too convoluted you do not solve simple problems with complexconvoluted systems 3 step process1 remove all t1 drops from rat loot yes all2 replace t1 drops with tags3 reduce mineral composition of named modules by 50 or morethis reduces pves negative impact on mining and t1 industry without adding more reliance on poses or complicating refining
not supported
bms sure if you are ready for the engagement what about those times when you fight where you dont expect it i think this is a pretty cool idea it might work with ambulation leadersfcs sit in a room and pretty much on a grid designate squad warp in points arrange it by squads say squad a is 10 tacklers they hit 0 on the warping squads 23 are mid range bs they hit 50km off the warpin sniping squad 4 lands 150km from the warpin and so forth
great idea would love to see a grid type layout
if it is implentable i would love it
thumbs up to the general idea
i see the main ish as bops as jumpers are difficult to set up ranged far too short to be really useful and need the fuel bay or fuel reduction bonus to prevent bops users from tearing their own hair outas ingang ships they have less tank and less firepower than t1 bs but are 57 times more expensive losing one is like losing 10 recons so why uncloak or better why jump it to the combat zone in the first placethe result is they are marginalized out of a combat role and become a 500mil cov ops jump bridge and for the reasons mentioned above not a very good one
yea ideally they would offer better tank  gank than the t1 counter parts lets face it price does matteralternatively ccp could try figure out a way to reduce price of 1 of those into 200 mil range that would also be considered a boost
i fully support this thread all of the given options are nice although i like 4 more mining alt ftw 
a nice sideeffect of changing this mission is that the price of regular kernite will drop to be commensurate with base mineral values i always found it silly that regular kernite sold for way more than the higher concentration ores entirely due to this missioni was hoping that they could change the mission ore to something like either 8000 kernite 12000 omber 16000 scordite or 20000 veldspar or something with a 13 possibility in each category to ask for one of the higher concentration versions  dense veldspar or fiery kernite for example hell throw in pyroxeres as well if you want and any other ore which may be local to those regions that way the mission remains as easy as it is but the effort required to complete it will take far more than just stockpiling or buying the same ore over and over again if someone wants to maintain huge stockpiles of every possible ore and their variants in his storyline station then full power to him he deserves an easy storyline for his investment but the rest of us need to get the mission and spend some time working towards getting the ore before doing the missionthe main problem remaining is that the ore you need is shown before you accept the mission so people are still going to buyminehaul then accept and complete without even closing the dialogue box so the completion time is still going to be really fast and rewards are still going to be poor at least itll even out the demand for all ores though you could spawn a roid belt and only mark quest completed once its mined dry but its not going to be fun for people who dont mine perhaps if there was a way to hide the actual ore you needed before accepting the mission
its not the definition of paranoia the definition of paranoia would require you to know my mental state which i strongly doubt youll have any real evidence from a post on a space forums there no evidence that it wont but im sure its been brought up within ccp and maybe they should sell ingame items for money i have no clue what the community wants and would of like to see what they had to saythis thread nothing but insults and there has only been one decent post so far you claiming im afaird of something has nothing to do with the topic at all please stop derailing the threadthere will be no evidence for such a topic since all we have right now is selling of plexs i just wanted to find out what the opinion of the general eve community felt towards ccp selling ingame items my 2 cents is very simple i never had a problem affording items within the game and i dont see why ccp must be selling plexs when players can create them easily enoughi dont see a link to wow there but there is a free trial buddy program  1 i dont know when linear logic was frown upon im shock by this statement i cant really think of a field that doesnt use a form of linear logic maybe if we get into talking about string theory and what not but the way they try to support those conspects is linear2 i never heard of ccp scamming anyone if ccp even wanted to scam me they could simply take everything i got and ban me in a nanosecond but okay whateverthis topic was to figure out where the community stands on ccp selling ingame items so far it seems like you all support it which is fine i guess it is a game and why should you waste hours mining or whatever to get in a ship and do whatever i personally never had a problem generating ingame revenue to buy the ingame items i wantinteresting outcome in this thread indeed
no the topic was and i quote them selling plexes directly is dumbalso calling them plex is just as dumbthats not a topic thats two incomplete sentences you bumbling dipstickjust so that you and anyone else whos bored enough to care has an example this is how a topicideaissue is arrangedyoure just venting because by your 5 yearolds logic the selling of plexs in game  something which has gone on indirectly with gtcs for years  is somehow wrongyou provided nothing other than  if this happens  this has to happen  logic which by the way isnt just linear its something we in the business of knowledge refer to as inductive reasoning its also not even really an argument or proposalthis thread was a fraking joke from the first post onward so dont try to come back 15 posts later as some kind of intellectual you can barely even write english properly let alone claim any sort of integrity everyone in this thread who insulted you had a right to simply because you began this thread insulting our intelligence this board is for proposing things to be brought up by the csm to ccp thanks to your trolling abilities this topic has hung onto the first page now for nearly two days and has not garnered a single support or even the attention of the csmso you know what if this crap is going to be on the main page ill show you how its done besides  i have 2000 characters left1 its not the definition of paranoia the definition of paranoia would require you to know my mental state which i strongly doubt youll have any real evidence from a post on a space forumsno check your english dictionary idiot i use my words carefully as i am a classics major your statement was paranoid in nature and you are displaying a paranoid fear about ccps intentions with game mechanics 2 there no evidence that it wont but im sure its been brought up within ccp and maybe they should sell ingame items for money i have no clue what the community wants and would of like to see what they had to saymaybe youre sure im not and since you dont have any evidence other than your own weird delusional fantasies theres no way to address this gibberish3 this thread nothing but insults and there has only been one decent post so far you claiming im afaird of something has nothing to do with the topic at all please stop derailing the threadwrong  your paranoid worry about ccps intention is the topic if you do not like the drift of the conversation do not start one 4 1 i dont know when linear logic was frown uponhe said two  liner what he meant you silly kid is that your opening post was a mere two lines not outlining any real issueproposal or ideas other than your armchair opinions5 and this is my favorite 2 i never heard of ccp scamming anyoneactually bud there have been plenty of cases where ccp has been suspected of scamming players and at least one case of an employee helping players without permission not that this proves any point other than your lack of knowledge about company and game history6 this topic was to figure out where the community stands on ccp selling ingame itemswell you should have said that right away not that it matters since they are not selling in game items a plex is hardly an item its simply an ingame form of gtc counts only for game timeyoure an idiot in the greek sense of the word you should find another board to troll and leave this one to the grownups
way too long about nothing you get only one point for realizing i made this in the wrong section i didnt want to pentition csm to talk about this issue cause simply i have no clue if the community wouldnt mind being able to buy ingame items with outgame currencyi do think ccp selling ingame items is dumb and i also think the name plex when there are complexes in the game is dumb1 lets talk about peoples emotions i never met you posting on a internet space forum this is the defination of a hacker stop hacking2 uh this thread was suppose to you know have people talk about it since there really no other thread addressing said issue still you get half a point if you ever realize this thread simply is in the wrong section3 wow that way seriously just saying paranoid over and over i merely say i against them selling ingame items and thought the name was dumb there plenty of stupid things ccp does just cause some company does something stupid doesnt mean im scared youre logic is worth then a 5 year old4  opps its this waythere is no proposal i prefer discussion and find out if im over looking something like lets say this is a internet game and majority of the people on it are sick of doing busy work and just want to shoot eachother they would be happy to purcash items from ccp with their countries currencyof couse im happy with my previous system but ccp got to make the money and it seems like most people feel like this issue doesnt need any discussion5 oh noes ccp taking my internet money shut up already if youre not actually going talk about the topic plus thats not even the defination of a scam victimize deprive of by deceit he swindled me out of my inheritance she defrauded the customers who trusted hermaybe wow is this way vvvvv6 plex are a ingame item you can contract them you can fly them around in space heck you can even trash them just cause you cant fit them in your ships slots are do production with them doesnt mean their not a ingame item or are they people like my janitors and woman with questionable ways of gaining currancyalso wow is really this way vvvv
so now the topic has moved on to kittens i dont think i can contribute much to that topic i only have two cats  one on each side of the fireplace had to run off the road to hit the second one he was fast but now hes just a smear and a stuffed shellget back to npc corps so i can contribute something to tell the op how recycled and redestroyed his idea is npc corps are penalized enough get a life
i do not support this and i engage in pvpthe existence of npc corps is an integral game mechanic akin to a pve only server in other mmos like guild wars or wownot everyone wants to pvp they enjoy just mining i have no idea why they just enjoy permaminingpermamission running when pvp is so fun but thats what they want to do what this is advocating is essentially taking the freedomsandbox nature of eve out and putting it so only the people who do pvp have fun in this gamethere is high secmostly pve only unless in a player corp which means your open to a wardec and lownull sec for the pvp aspect akin to a pve and pvp server in wow or guild wars the npc corp not only serves the function of providing a mostly pve environment it also protects new players and people who dont enjoy pve from people who will grief them for it its an integral part of any mmo and removing it from eve i believe would be detrimental to the game as a whole as someone previously posted half of eves userbase is in npc corps what do you think is gonna happen to that user base if the protection of npc corps is pulled out logically it would be much reduced as people will get griefed left right and center and thus ccp loses a large chunk of their playerbaseprofit and we lose people to interact withnot supported
fixed that for you npc corps need some attention not all of it negative but some for sure
i agree as long as wardecs costs become 100mil per week instead of 2milthat will get rid of griefers or are you a griefer yourself and you just want to get more easy kills
rolling on the floor laughingyou kidding right fee needs to be lowered yeah sure like 2 millions is a fortune omg we cant afford griefing a new miners corporation it costs 2mil every week oh the sky is falling it needs to be lowered i wanna blow stuff for free in high sec concord is 111
we all know how alexandre won at gaugamela he cut through the flanks of the persian army and took out the head of the snake ie the commander darius causing the persians to routin a fleet battle the whole fleet gains a bonus from the leader and off course would lose this bonus theoretically if the leader was knocked out correct me if im wronghowever the loss of a leader in a fleet battle doesnt make much of a differencei have an idea i reckon itd be a good idea to place a greater duty of care on the fleet commander the leader in fleet should play a more pivotal role within the games mechanicsi understand that any one can log on to vent or ts and become fc commanding the troops as it were but im speaking of the leader as per fleet screen overlayi think if an opposing fleet tactically and brilliantly recognises and attempts to and manages to extinguish the fc the rewards should be greatie a 10 second seizure of all locks target sensing and such which is a reflection of a disorientated state having lost the commanderthis could give the other fleet a tactical advantage it could cause the fleet who has lost its f c to rout or become disarrayed in such a way as to give the one who has removed the opposing fc a reward for their exploitsi believe such an implementation within the game mechanics would give a wider and more realistic feel to fleet combat and would change the tactical and strategic makeup of fleet battles in eve in a positive and realistic way as realistically the commander must be protected and his loss is usually a massive blowany comments
it makes the fleet fall back on the secondary target caller which can cause considerable confusion and loss if people are disorganized or unprepared for itwhich is not always relevant the playercreated systems outside of the straight game mechanics are always more dynamic and interesting heavilydefined game mechanic mechanisms like the point system in fw are boring and tedious besides a lot of people just put command ship alts in the ingame fc position instead of the fctarget callercursory intelligence gathering can get you information on who the enemy fcs are so it is almost no accomplishment to find them that said the rewards for killing them are great assuming youre more organized than your enemy
my suggestion would be to make it so that every time any leader is lost all those who received boni from him suffer a penalty of 100200 the bonus for a short amount of timenot limited to the fleet booster but also to squad boosters and so on so if a squad looses its booster only the squad takes a hit for it for a short amount of time before someone else becomes boosterin addition it should be possible to identify the leaders not just simply by looking at them but using a specialized scanning device like a fleet communications analyzer that can only be fitted to command ships covops ships recon ships motherships and titans themselves perhaps in different versions of increasing accuracy so that the biggest command ships can do so much easier than a sneaky scout ship
thumbs down its a bad suggestion over all killing the fc can cause confusion in the ranks and other side effects but making them ingame side effects makes it seem pointless to me unless ccp has plans for it i highly doubt it then i say no isaac
yeah  alexander didnt command a fleetthe system is fine how it is theres no logical reason the elimination of a fleet commander would cause anything other than what it causes now confusionhell its hard enough to rationalise the bonuses they givenot supported
in ancient armies loss of a leader was catastrophicin modern armies not so much i was in the military and can tell you that modern forces are organized so that everyone knows what they need to do and command structure is organized so that if one leader falls someone else can fill the void with very little disruption
forgot to show my support
ayeif your ship doesnt completely and instantly anhilate from a bolt of antimatter plasma a ship hitting it isnt even going to scratch the paint
id like to give credit for this wonderful proposal to ashtardj of the scum alliancewith the upcoming introduction of t3 and the potential for skill loss when your t3 ship is destroyed perhaps its time to revisit the somewhat broken mechanic of ejecting from your ship currently there is no benefit to ejecting save the scenario where you are choosing to leave your existing ship to pilot another one and absolutely no reason to eject in combat id like to propose as per ashtardjs idea that we introduce a mechanism to propel a pod a specific distance from the ship it left based upon a skillpod displacement rank 2skill in mastering pod ejection mechanics causing your pod to move away from your ship upon initiating an eject each level of this skill adds 1 second to the amount of time that your pod travels when ejectedescape velocity rank 4skill in mastering pod ejection mechanics causing your pod to move away from your ship for initiating an eject each level of this skill adds 1000 metres per second to the velocity at which your pod is ejectedif such skills were introduced one other thing would also be required to make this work with existing game mechanics an extra item would need to be added to the contextual menu allowing someone to leave their ship without being fired up to 25000 metres from their shipthis mechanic would provide incentive for people to eject from their ships and whilst this would deny people of kill mails it would give them the chance to procure ships in a less traditional fashion and fits in nicely with the principles behind a salvaging profession
posting in support of this idea the idea behind the skill was mine but that was an afterthought im really more interested in getting the ejection mechanics evaluated and seeing where we can go from there
a rank 5 skill is way too much investment for this but the idea itself of making ejection have some advantage on t1t2 ships is solid i can generally support this
i agree that with 3 character slots i should be able to train themif not all three reduce it to two and allow training for those
i dont really see how this is debatable in warcraft lets say i think you can make something like 9 characters per server they dont all just magically level up while you play one specific one you have to invest time into it most if not all other mmos are exactly the same i dont see why eve should give people a pass to freely train characters they effectively arent investing time intopeople get around this with multiple accounts and ccp obviously isnt going to do anything about that if the even could being able to train skills on 1 character while not in game is an awesome thing that is to my knowledge unique to eve they certainly dont need to hand you anything else however
latest dev blogsuccess
lemme guess you are a pvp carebear who will never enter 00 nor even lowsec so you need wardec limit to be gone and therefore get more easy kills right
after reading your responses i must say i agree with you it would be open to abuse unless some refinement took placeone possible way would be for the pilot who kamikazes himself to be unable to log on for 24 or 48 hours and all skills frozenor a huge penalty in skill amount lost for this action which could reflect a suicide of sortswhat do you reckon
see this thread for past discussion on the topic
cooper i do understand the pain you have possibly experienced and i share it through my own  all you can do is suck it up as no amount of talking about it will help if theres a smelly poo list of players the gms keep i know im on it maybe im not the only player on it take it on the chin and tbh like me never petition again whether it helps them or not its not worth the time m8
i guess since everyone makes this joke of wow this is what jumpgate series does and a few otheri be kinda shock if eve change their current system
i pretty much guarantee you this isnt going to happen
yeah if people want a second character they normally want to be running it at the same time some people will drop everything for a second character for a month though to train them up as a basic miner or trade character only takes 3 weeks to be able to fly a retriever
there is an easy solution today for training on multiple characters  get multiple accounts it also works on gtcso the isnt the real issue that people want discounts for holding multiple accounts
le sigh it is evident you have tried to build a reasonable system so i will not scream to much but your system will kill a lot of professions with no return1 your system will kill invention any system releasing new t2 bpo in a unlimited quantity will kill invention a system that release a limited number of bpo will only reduce the number of t2 items worth inventing so it will only mortally wound invention instead of killing it outright but it will still be a mortal wound2 the same people that has the brought t2 bpo will buy the new bpo not because the bpo give much profit but because they are people with huge wallets and find a return of 1 acceptable as it is hard to manage very large capitals and get high returns 3 building from t2 bpc made from bpo is very rare as the copy time is way longer than the build time and require higher skills it would be simpler to train another alt and get 11 more build slots than make copies of the bpo so most bpo holder will feel a sting as the bpo will lose value but the inventors will feel the axe on the neck dont seem a good idea
learning skills have no value the only effect they have is to cause new people to wait 23 weeks before they can train anything of value its simply a prerequisite to start playing thats not hard or hardcore thats bad design grinding on something for two weeks doesnt make you less like wow it makes you more like it eve is a hardcore game unlike wow because there are real risks in the game in eve when you get killed you loose your ship and everything on it and if your not careful even your skillpoints contrast this with wow where when you die you simply respawn and loose nothing of significance eve is also different from wow in that you dont have to actively grind something to improve your skills however the only net effect of learning skills is to prevent you from doing anything significant the first few weeks you start the game its crazy simply bad design and should be eliminatedeliminating the learning skills would best be done in fashion that scales by how long you have been able to benefit from them i would suggest an sp refund via a linear percentage based on the age of your character 0 days old 100 refund 1 year old 50 refund 2 years old 0 refund so for example if you are 200 days old and have spent 500000sp on learning skills you would get back 726 or 363000sp which you would be able to distribute instantlyone could debate on the exact formula used but i think the general idea is sound recognizing that older players have been able to benefit from having the skills while they existed and refunding those who spent the points but have not yet received a benefit from having them
i personally think it would be a good idea to add a forpay option to change a characters name similar to how its currently possible to pay to change your appearance my primary motivation for this is that personally my ability to generate isk vastly outstrips my ability to fly anything im only a few weeks into playing and i already could easily afford to fly and loose battleships so im contemplating saving up some isk and mabe buying a new pilot for 5ish billion in a month or two however my sticking point is that i really have no way to give it a name i am happy with i am the kind of person where that simple fact would irritate me to absolutely no end in addition and from more of a practical perspective it would help to reduce confusion among people who knew the previous owner furthermore it fits fine with eve in a future where your consciousness can be transferred from clone to clone i guarantee you that it would be possible to change a whole lot more than just your name use your imagination 
your prose it makes for disquieting readinginsofar as i understand what you tried to convey you could not be bothered to choose a good name for your character and this makes you nervous to the point of incoherencethere are some practical complications with your proposal the most obvious one being that this would be abused by people for political reasonsas for changing ones appearance that should be possible because people do choose to wear different clothing and make other changes to their appearance however i would not advocate drastically changing ones facial features to the point where one cannot be recognised if that is important one can always create an amarr character and go for the fully cloaked appearance ive come to know some seriously impressive chins in my time between the suns of new edenit is quaint how easy people forget the importance of a good name a good name especially one we can choose for ourselves defines us in more ways than we first seem to realise eternaln00b seems like a good idea i dont know that someone calls themselves that in the game at the time of creating a persona after a few years when one is no longer a n00b one gets to enjoy that special kind of regret that comes with having to live with ones own poor life choicesdont lament having to change names pick a good one to start withabulurd bonifaceme meceo
did you actually read my post before you commented you seem to have gotten the delusion that i dont like names i pick i like my names i dont like names other players give their characters in the event i should choose to buy someone elses character with isk as it is now i would be stuck with their name unable to give the character a decent one aside from that for those players that do pick crappy names i dont see any problem with making a forpay option similar to the one that already exists for appearances to allow that player to correct his oversight later it doesnt hurt anyone so long as some reasonable restrictions are in place limits like only one change allowed every 6 months or something
never going to happen simply too simple for the more dark and conspiring of us to negate any and all risk  consequences alike in ventures like thieving scamming griefing etcccp are pretty keen on the balance between risk and reward so  without ccp providing a method to look up previous identities of characters through whatever mechanism they deem fit  its just not going to happenevery few weeks someone whos ed people off seems to think it is a smart idea to suggest this option with one or the other silly argument which does not address risk versus reward funny this one was slightly better then the last one but still fail
several times actually it made a lot of sense no doubt to youi now understand that you want to buy other characters because their increased skill points will allow you to fly the ships the increased skill point range will allow you to fly youre not worried about generating the money to buy the ships because isk spontaneously extrudes from the freeflowing molecules in the air into your wallet more power to youyour gripe is then that when you would buy somebodys experienced character but you would hate it because of the poor choice the original owner had in choosing a proper name for the character and you could not live with thatthat was worth a chuckle  thank youabulurd bonifaceme meceo
i wouldnt worry much about that for two reasons firstly your character is most likely indexed in the database not by its name but rather by a unique numeric user id that id would not change even if your name did therefore it wouldnt effect any logging that is doneand secondly if for some reason they do actually index by name or for some other reason changing the name would pose such an issue it would be equally trivial to implement a log of a players name changes and extend the logging capabilities to iterate through that list when doing querys in the log either way the issue you bring up is easily resolvednot really sure what part you find funny i think the request is pretty basic and understandable personally i thought that i would demonstrate an example where such a feature would be useful and desired by the players in addition making it a forpay option would certainly limit its use
your suggestion is to enhance the overall immersion of the game walking in stations essentially addresses your topic and provides a platform on which it can be addressed even further i would suggest checking out some demo videos i think the devs mentioned that planet and space graphics will be getting some attention after stations is out i hope that in that they bring in some additional astronomical features theres a lot in space and i really think it would be great to bring in some more depth to the playing field
i agree with all of you amy brings up some points that i would not have thought about and they are very valid as a new player i do feel that its important to allow one or two restats its almost inevitable that your first character will be royally sqrewed up i played one character for a week then remade a new one after learning how messed up it was i think both of amys suggested alternatives are entirely reasonable and well thought outi agree with omber as well personally i think this whole issue highlights an area where eve has failed to be true to itself theres no need for attributes or these learning skills at all just make everything a flat train time scaled by rank its much smarter gameplay wise as for attribute implants you could either get rid of them or replace them with a slightly different system like this have 35 implant sockets that replace the attribute sockets in them you could plug in a training implant these implants would decrease training time in a specific skill category for example you might have an implant helping your gunnery skills improve and one for navigation etc that would preserve the existing gameplay surrounding those implants isk burn and investment protection through jump clones
can someone please provide linkage to where this was announcedcheers
id like to add one additional comment the last mmo i played was a game called ragnarok online it bears absolutely no resemblance to eve except for one thing stat entrapment like eve unless you did a great deal of research before ever making your first character theres a 999 chance that your first character will be completely screwed up i played it on the official servers for 2 months however eventually i realized that mistakes i made during character creation mandated that i redo my character from scratch it was at that point that i quit the gamethe reason i said that learning skills and attributes are not true to the concept of eve is that it has been said that one of the great things about eve as opposed to other games is that should you decide to take a different carrier path you can the attributelearning skill system highlights that not only is this incorrect but you must choose your carrier at character creation and then not deviate from it much do the game a favour and eliminate this design mistake
from the preliminary patch notes
thanks for the link theres really a lot of great stuff in that
thanks
1 abandoned for years obviously referrs to towers that have ran out of fuel and have their shield down2 i would be happy with being able to only hack unanchored towers  why in the heck would u need to hack an unanchored tower3 pos spam in sov  its a broken mechanic that needs a whole new threadcan i please get a ccpdelagate response this was supposed to be escalated i know the game developers are balls deep in the new expansion but these broken mechanics cannot be allowed to fall through the cracks and take another 23 years to solve
maybe because they can only do full damage with 3x painters try again
tempest doesnt have a range problem artillery has a range problem since its same for any ship that uses them hence 1650mm arty to give added rangethe designed tempest in the proposal really goes back to 2004 times where artillery was a powerful weapon because tracking didnt exist and hence it could hit and runme notes down to say that everytime someone says typhoon is great plus its 1 tp and web vs a bs target vs smaller you have same problems as turrets do that 1 sentence is the only thing you could reply to out of the whole post
im not convinced about the ops proposal to me the temp is an autocannon boat if the mael gets changed into a sniper that is and because of the lousy optimal the damage at medium ranges is crappy this is ofcourse the same for a gallente bs but that one makes up for it with increased dps and tank the whole minnie is agile and fast is completely lost on bs size ships and that is the real problem imo ccp has to realize that racial designs might not work well for all shipsizes this is ofcourse nothing new and its actually a good thing as it keeps things diverse but when it gets to the point where a whole and important shipsize simply doesnt work for a specific race then things are wrongofcourse i understand that 75 damage and increased tracking does help a lot but that still doesnt make up for the have to get in close to get some damage done and then you find that its damage lacks and its tank isnt up to par either id much rather get something like this5 to projectile damage10 to falloff range125 m3 dronebaybandwiththis way while not making the ship beefier it can now actually use a tactic by trying to keep stuff at range a bit coupled with 2 heavy neuts that would work wellthe mael simply should lose the shield bonus and replace that with a 5 optimal range and to make it less short range lower its dronebay
so basicly the veldatar needs to be moved into amarr to join its son the veldnaughtwhile this would cause rage throughout new eden im sure it would also be a good tourist attraction i am fairly confident that such a move would cause the major ccp favorism waggon to run on mwds  so the proposal is that if the veldatar cannot be moved to the favorism reason the veldatar could be seen as a gift for the amarr empire becoming a stationary monument like the luminare titan with the exception of it bearing the ships name of coursewe would then have created the howthehellcanccpletpeoplespend90billionisktogetingamemonumentswaggonbut really lets get it into amarr so i can roam the belts in fully titanmininggear
i approve of this
why the hell not
this asks for support
any proposition that furthers the cause of mining huge quantities of ore has my fullest supportplus i want to see a titan up close abulurd bonifaceme meceo
i approve of this plan as long as it is restricted chribba only ofcsadly i doubt chribba that ccp will do this for you even if you do deserve it the wish to avoid the whining from the unwashed masses personally i think you having those cap ships in amarr and being willing to show them adds so much to the new player experience inspiring new players to continue to play eve giving them a goal with the ability you provide them to see some of the end game ships up close an personal so early in their eve life i know i was awestruck when i was 2months old the first time i saw the veldnaught in amarr many years ago
could even make it part of a storyline for the upcoming expansion the ship gets sucked into a wh and spat out in amarr the flux of energy crippling it permanently so its stuck
hell yes supported
not until i get a highsec carrier anyway try to find a wormhole or something
i wish
ill be receiving any iskies
no
strongly disagreeacceptable although it is a gift so the naming is fully up to the amarr empire and as a loyal subject you can do nothing other than obey whatever they choose to name itsupporting this although it is quite a useless change to eve in light of other important issues
when i first joined people were telling me that if i wanted to do any sort of pvp id have to cross train away from caldari because missiles are uselessi crosstrained gallente and i am mostly happy with it in spite of the weaknesses of the race i did not see a reason to specialize in anything caldari or missile related ecm is kinda cool though i have a scorp in hanger what was the point of missiles well they were an inferior but usually usable projectile turret when i first joined up and torpedoes had a long range for a short range turrets although their damage wasnt really up to par now they dont really seem to have one at all turret ships are generally better in some way against stationary targets anyway with the exception of large autocannons and much better against moving ones if you want to make missiles only good against stationary targets cant they at least be better at destroying stationary targets than turrets areit doesnt even make sense for pve really you can do better in an ishtar or armegeddon than you can in a raven or drake with the right skillsif missiles are not in for a fix why not just throw in the towel at balancing them and make the caldari a agile shieldtanked turret race with missiles as their main secondary weapons system like the minmatar minmatar seem to be a little underpowered anyway so it wont break anything will ithell if you wanted to nerf them to begin with why not just nerf the missile hardpoints on missile ships so that ravens were no longer the pwn machines people thought they were because they had split weapons systemsits hard to think of anything missiles can do better than turrets torpedos will slightly outdamage a mega neutron hardpoint for hardpoint but no ship can fit as many torpedoes as a megathron or hyperion can fit neutrons and the moment something starts moving torpedoes arent very effective anymore rockets have a really low explosion radius but their dps is so terrible they are hardly worth using anyway range could also maybe use a slight boost so that they can operate outside scram rangemaybe standard missiles are still ok dont know for sure on that much citadel torpedoesim signing this just because i think there should be a reason other than ecm to fly caldari ships either make the caldari less reliant on missiles or make it so that missiles cant be outrun by ships larger than the size they were intended to hit or just do something to make missiles usefulthere are a few promising caldari features ecm their shield buffer tanks can be very strong sensor range agility modifiers free low slots etc but the fact that they rely on a weapon system that is effectively useless makes them subpartldr missiles dont have a point this hurts the caldari a lot either make the caldari a turret race or give missiles some kind of thing to make them not look like really useless turretsalso signed
like so many other things in this game it seems that ccp have overnerfed missiles to the point where at bcbs size they are essentially uselesslarge missiles were hardly setting the world alight preqr so it boggles the mind as to why ccp feel the need to nerf them even furthercruise missiles seem very average and torpedos are barely useable other than in bs fleet battlesthe raven once considered the best ship on eve now lags behind the megathron the armageddon and even the tempest for dps output and number of build requeststhis stinks of the fame fate that befell webs nanos and nos ccp see something thats too good then instead of balancing it they just make it awful with no regard given to the players who have spent months or years skilling in those areas
moa ferox rokh vulture eagle and a few morewhen was the last time you flew said megathron
also confirming regular missile boats ie cerebus do not seem to have suffered badly have not flown with citadel torps since the newest nerf
i generally prefer being in an ishtar or dominix although those are both expensive for me to riskalso the caldari get a few turret ships too they are for the most part inferior to those of other races with a few advantages to make them stand out which is fair enough but cant their missile ships be primarily turret ships with a little bit of missiles as long as missiles arent useful if theyre a little bit worse than racial alternatives but still useful and special thats fine too
missiles are useful
what are they good for exactly though what do they do better than say a pulse laser and do they do it better enough to make it worth using missiles id like to know when i first joined people told me no looking at the missile damage formula that was spaded missiles now do such poor damage theyre hardly worth consideringi have learned the hard way that mwding your thorax directly toward a mega is a bad idea but if you do it toward a raven its not really all that risky nowagain what are missiles useful for exactly and do missile ships exploit any such advantage in a way that distinguishes them from other shipsps look at all the people whining that minmatar ships need to get rid of their launcher hardpoints in favor of more turrets projectile turrets arent even all that awesome right now it seems amarr is the way to go
i am start a formal petition to eliminate the turret nerf that has been put into effect with the release of the queantum rise expansion according to these new changes turrets of all sizes are relatively ineffective against ships every class size that the turrets are designed to target can move faster than the turrets tracking therefore the only way to get your base damage back is to target something bigger than your turrets were made to shoot even then the speed of the vehicle is still faster than your turret tracking and decreases the damage so i ask you to sign your name and or comments to this petition to return turrets to thier old already weak state or to at least change the specs to make turret use viable again
they are good for damageing thingswhy should they be better than pulse lasersthe still hit things in orbit now matter if close or wide orbitno matter if it is a frigate or battleship yeh because people fitting their caldari ships for the biggest tanks and afterwards finding out that there aint much damage left without damage mods are the ones to be asked about what to flyalso if your damage gets reduced due to the target moving you just slow your target down its what turretusers do all the time while even cruisemissiles from a raven hurt orbiting interceptors turretbs will never ever hit them once on the other hand its is kinda unfair that anything from a frigate to battleship fitted with bonused missiles still hits orbiting ships for damage when turrets rotate way behind their trackingbut orbiting the megathron pretty closerange reduces your taken damage to zero while the raven still hits you amiriteagain they do damage maybe you dont get weapons but the point of them is doing damage to things aroundyou wont and you should not do full damage to that frigate in that mission with your torpedo or cruisemissile yet you will hit it you will hit everything in pve and pvp in situations where turrets wont ever hitat this point you are telling that you absolutely have no clue about the other racesanyway replies to this thread  588 supports 119 seems like missiles are way to okish for the majority of eve
signed
funny enoughi am working on amarr bs v at this time even though i can fly a nagflar now why i want to be more effective and not on the short list of primaries for easiest to kill
that kind of authority comes for free there is no kick alliance membersdisband alliance role you can remove and detach from usual corp management directorship afaik
agreeda alliance of corperations flying under one flag should not be dissolved under the power of one person it should take a vote from every ceo of every corperation within that alliancea complete reworking of allianceceo powers should be relooked at
i disagree firstly i would suggest that these comments are out of fear not out of disagreement with the mechanism itself i would also suggest that this mechanism however flawed is one of the best things that has happened in eve it forces people in alliances to remember to be careful who they trust and also not to pss off the directors cos they can screw your whole game over put basically if the players and directors in tafkab had treated eachother a little more decently this director guy wouldnt have emoraged the alliance right down to the 9nth circle of hell god knows it might just teach people the fact that just cos theres an internet between them and other people it doesnt mean they can be dckheads
thisevery type of government would have benefits as well as drawbacks one of those drawbacks of course being the result were faced with now
thats completely irrelevant dont be such an easy kill then
ill agree with changing wardecs as soon as hisec is less profitable when the ability to make huge wads of cash in hisec is crippled then we can talk about nerfing wardecs
wardecs are essential to the game without them there would be much less destruction in the gamewhich would be bad for the gamestupid wardecs without definition or purpose is the real culprit in the gamehaving 20 people wardec a stationbear alliance or wardec another corp of giant numbers that they couldnt possibly fightbeing wardecced makes you play the game differently even if the entire other corp is offline this essentially fits in as griefing you pay a measly nonexistent price just to cause other people ingame to play differently that isnt funthey need to bring a much more advanced interface to warssetting goals destruction or removal of a pos  x placex amount of damage inflicted of ships destroyedransom amountthen depending on how much you want to inflict and your goals is how much the war costsobviously the person getting wardecced wouldnt see what the goals are exception being ransomas for op leave ur corp and goto nub corp if you cant deal with it or go play an alt you have 2 other characters on your account no reason you cant go play one of those while the wardec dies out
there has to be ways to interfere with other players and try to force things to change to your favor since we all live in one big sandbox in highsec the wardec system is the only real tool available to do this it is sometimes a blunt tool that could be replaced by a more refined mechanic in some cases but sometimes it is exactly what is neededthe reasons for wardecs that i have personally been a part of are personal insultaiding friendsdenying the other some resource getting more targets in your area of space the corps targetted are selected for a reason but for them it might seem random either they use the same resources as us one of their member might have a bad history with us or they are likely to actually fight this means sometimes deccing corps with superior numbers so they might actually come out and fightthe whole point is to force the others to play their game differently in the case of denying a resource or aiding a friend it doesnt matter if they are offline during the wardec the goal is accomplished in any case people know how the system works and can guess how the opposite side reacts they can then use this knowledge to achieve their goals i wouldnt object to adding actual goals to wardecs allowing advanced options and tweaking the price but total war must remain an option the reasons and meaning for wardecs should be defined by the people who start the war and not be limited to some predefined options by ccp
totally disagree with the op  a war dec no matter what the reason has purpose and if the dec is against new players then the war dec gives them a intro into pvp and pvp game mechanics in empirethere is a positive in every negative enjoy the war have fun it wont last forever lol
i dont think they should be removed part of eve is that theres no place safe from pvp however the fees should definitly be raised 25mil at least 2mil for a war dec is pointless because anyone can afford it and 1 kill during the week can pay for that 2mil many times over
wardecs are part of eve and should not be removed live with it and be prepared to defend your corp or stay in npc corps which are a perfectly valid alternative for those players that do not wish to engage in warsccp agreed that it is mostly used as a paytogrief system but instead of whining about how unfair eve is and threaten to quit perhaps it would be more productive to come up with things youd like to see changed instead of aiming for a complete removal which is unrealistic and never going to happen as thatll destroy a large part of eve
the fix is to remove highsec and watch the problem disappear
110 troll has been tried alot and better
2 mil to dec a corp does seem a bit cheap you can get that much in 20 minutes its utterly triviali understand the logic of having it increase in cost with multiple to discourage people from using it for kicks but i think better would be having it discounted or free if the target corp has had recent aggression timers with the declaring corp also maybe make it free for a defending corp to extend a wardec so that declaring war doesnt mean youll be free of it after a week if it turns out you miscalculatedotherwise it should be more expensive than it currently is a strong corporation that doesnt have to defend anything stationary could wardec whoever they please without their target able to defend themselves in any meaningful way and hide away if it turns out that they can and wait out the war until the check is no longer theirs to paywardecs arent really that bad if they happen once every few months to a corp that doesnt bother anyone it doesnt much make sense but if the random griefing is infrequent its manageable because there is time to rebuild after the fighting it gets ridiculous if an uncoordinated war dec follows after another though or if you have to deal with three in the same month etc which has been happening latelyi dont think removing them is a good idea since itll effectively give impunity to highsec pirates that dont get on the wrong side of concord like a can flipper in a shuttle they should however be a more significant decision than they are now you shouldnt be motivated to simultaneously wardec two corps you never heard of before just for the fun of it and it definitely should not be cheapmaking wars more costly might help as an isk sink against the inflation introduced by bounties and mission payments anyway if inflation is a problemnot supporting this topicps maybe concord should get ed if a corp that hasnt paid for a war dec helps a corp that did in a fight with the decced corp via logistics at least make it so that the attackers have to all dec and cant work around it by sending a large fleet of reppers to help out some guys mega
or you know you could band together as empire industrial corps into this fancy thing called an alliance you know the sorta thing that deters random wardecsjust a thought
an alliance needs quite a bit of isk and skills not as simple as just making an alliance
perhaps the same thing should be required of corps a bit more isk say 50 mil atleast to make one that would also help this problem
ccp have stopped all wardecs vs npc corps if you want to chat with friends then go ahead and do so via a chat channel if you want to be in a player corp then you open yourself up to pvp via wardecs thats the whole point of a player corp the first thing new corps should do is build up a stockpile for their first wardec  because it will happen eventually it involves the corpmembers working like a corporation insted of a bunch of solo players with a chat channel build up a massive warstock as a corporation and then you can have fun if you are part of a corp where everybody is a solo player or even a corp where you just minemission away forever and the corp has no plan with how to deal with their wardecs then i am afraid to say you are in the wrong corp
what the title says they are an alt corp no questions there
end it
also children of gjallarhorn or what they are called
is it possible to only have alliance leadersceos and diplomats communicate on caod
hell no it keeps the trolls out of the other useful channels you can keep them in caod where any sane person doesnt look use intergalactic summit if its important not signed keep the trolls posting in caod to help keep the rest of the forum clean
was just a after thought caod imo is a forum for alliances and corp to dscuss primarily politcal issues bewteen themfrom political conflicts to battle reports news and corporation press releases  this is the incharacter political center for all things corporatei personnally find it interesting to read what is going on in the political arena of eve  just a shame its trolled to such a extent that its impossible to read  all i have learned from it is goons and others just spam it with total irrelevant posting causing caod to sink deeper into the sewers
caod hasnt been a serious forum for over three years as far as i can tell its too late to remedy this so we might as well keep it as is to stop the forums from being flooded with all the trash that inhabits that forum at presentits a form of damage control i like to read the forums but i dont bother with caod because frankly theres no point anything anyone needs to say will be said elsewhere and caod can be left for the trolls and the goons i recommend if youre interested in reading about alliances and corporations that you simply look around the other forums the information you seek is available outside caod
i agreethe internet was funny when it was just a few guys in an obvious alt corp just posting random rubbish but now they let in anyone who just wants to post obnoxious  on caod and theres enough of that already tbfh now instead of being somewhat amusing they are just sad and pathetic just like my posting i bet real cutting edge joke thereobvious alts posting obvious smack should be obviously banned csm is not the correct forum but theres been worse threads in here so what the hell
good idea but its probably way too late to turn caod into something other than the joke it is
i like bandwagons prepare the stoning table
oh yea its to latebut still i want to close them down just to  them off and to make ccp look like the actualy care about forum rules
this is my main i do stuff indeed i wont be affording any alts until i receive my gaming bailoutstimulus package this is completely unfair that you would libel our entire corp based on the alleged actions of 2 atlas guys
doom is an alt corp created for altposting in caod mods please do your jobs and ban them from the forumsthank youyour king
the internet are the best damned thing on coad since they banned windy anyway they are alts from across the whole spectrum of alliances and do nothing more than hold up a mirror to you all if what you see is unfunny trollish buffonery semiliterate stupidity arrogance and the just plain sad then stop blaming the mirror cos youre ugly

i would totally support that
the internet is an elite pvp alliance not made up of alts we will take the glorious region of cloud ring as the beginning of our brutal campaign of elite pvpness
ta think it needs its own thread as tbh its a more general suggestion
agreed
i also like how sk rooster voted with not only himself but all of his alts in a row keep trying there bucko
show me on the doll where the bad the internet touched you oh and what the hellsigned
can you guys please take this whining to another board
i just told you we are not alts we are an elite pvp alliance that is going to take cloud ring  off
why dont you people get a roombetter yet wardec each other and kill each otherseriously gtfo
hey sk rooster dont you think its a bit ironic that youre launching a one man crusade against the internet because in youre view theyre just an alt posting corpim only mentioning it because i notice that you used your own alts american tourist and chinese tourist to post directly after you supporting your view in this very thread and its not just a one off thing you did the same thing in this thread and many othersso its ok if you do it but not when others do is that correct
you should support this topic then
miners can drop their ore directly into one of the holds of an orca without needing secure cans or anything similar this creates a completely safe mining environment apart from suicides which just shouldnt beincreased asset security is good and understandable and putting in effort and thought should make things safer but 100 safety is not what eve is about any thoughts
1 lacking an orca they sit there with 1 unit in the can they drop in the can and then grab it immediatelytruly the creationuse of orca just makes less bandwidth and checks required which is good
there is no 100 security because in large belts the orca driver has to haul in cans from tens of kilometers awayso there is always a chance that an honestworking can flipper could interferedropping ore into the corporate hangar is as it should bethere is nothing to stop you from shooting at any ship you like you dont need an excuse at allwhy do you believe a miner should accomodate your need to facilitate the destruction of their shipplus not everybody has access to an orca they tend to be rather priceyi dont see your problemabulurd bonifaceme meceo
and thats where youre wrong if the miners are within 1500m of the orca they can directly dump their ore into one of the hangars without needing to use cans whatsoever thats my issue with themi dont have problems with their role as ore collectormining booster using their tractorbeam bonuses its the fact that if they choose to sit right next to their miners they dont need cans at all
so what carebears are paying an incredible amount of isk to have an orca with which they can mine safely without having to fear some can switchersisnt that what the orca is suppose to do
this method is 100 failsafe which there shouldnt be in eve and 500 mil isnt exactly an incredible amount
the little highsec pirates life became more difficult
have no problems with things becoming more difficult or challenging but immunity is something eve shouldnt have and atm with an orca youre immune
so whats the difference exactly from being able to mine into the cargohold of a hulk besides scale thats 100 fail safe no way to steal ore that waybut heres an idea for ya join corp of miner you want to rob work your way up to getting corp hangar rights sit next to orca with your own orca wait for corp hangar to fill take all the ore out of it and put it in your own orca cargohold ho wait thats not 100 fail safe1 guess i broke your thread huh nother suggestion join random corp skip ore stealing just fire away at corpmates without concord interfering
come back when you are capable of rational thought
talking to yourself ey everything i said is as it is i know it must suck for you but i only state things that are completely true but feel free to take a shot at any of my statements or make another reply without arguments but with insults like you just did if you like it still wont make you right and as for the thread well that was going nowhere from the moment you hit the post button so nobody is going to mind anyway
ok how long would you survive if you flip a can in mining ops with an orca and like 48 hulksya you expect to loose your flip boat and then you come with a bsif youre lucky you will be able to kill maybe one hulk before around 50 drones dismantle your bs while your tackled by em
ok lets check your amazing reasoning hulk has a limited cargo even when expanded and will have to dock up to unload ore meaning less optimised orehour its also one ship so as with every ship as long as it doesnt get suicided its cargo is safe apart from other ways ofcourse with an orca several miners can drop their ore off in complete 100 safety and then the orca can dock up unload and be back way before the miners cargo hold is filled up again this also means that he doesnt have to invest in expanded cargo holds but he can fit more mining upgrades increasing his yield even moreon your join the corp thing that would be the same as saying that low sec piracy can be completely removed as its just as easy to join a corp and then start killing your corp mates this reasoning just doesnt make any sense whatsoever especially not since you tell me to use my own orca  to then steal from the others hangaras stated earlier come back when you can come up with some actual reasoning instead of obvious flamebait but tbh i like replying to this flamebait as it gives me the opportunity to expand why i disagree with the situation as is it may reach more people that waythanks
our confirmed kills list states otherwise
i guess you are horribly informed how miners playstyle is
or mine for that matter
well i would simply not engage in such a case i think no can flipper will but like i said the orca gives us nothing new besides larger scale and guess what thats what it was designed to do
like i stated several times it just ups the scale mining without having risk of ore theft was always possible transfering it to a hauler without risk too there is such a thing as secure containers which you can anchor hell you as a can flipper should know its the first advice flippers give when someone is ing his ore got stolen its even safer than using corp hangar in orca only problem is its a  to do so the orca makes it easier and ups the scale of what was already possible gee not something you would expect from a subcapital mining support ship or is it i was just giving you some ideas like i said it is entirely possible just takes some effort but i guess youre looking for quick easy targets and yes your own orca to steal ore from corp hangar of other orca or any other boat with a cargohold i just mentioned orca for its huge cargohold and to add some irony well statements still stand nother thing most miners who arent complete noobs will not have their ore stolen andor be tricked into agressing you so if the orca was fixed it would not yield you any significant increase of targets which makes this entire discussion rather hypothetical now i dont mind that one bit but you might be more pragmatic in that case i advise you to find other ideas to get more yarrr going on in hisec just one of my friendly tips
there is a safety vs mining yield safer game play at the cost of lower yield due to using secure cans or docking up and unloading ore its the main reason why ccp refuses to increase secure can sizes as to have a choice between optimised yield or safetynow its and faster and 100 safe and thats not how it should be
as i described its not 100 safe very hard to get at but not 100 safe even without secure cans like i said experienced miners will not have their ore stolen anyway they just park hauler next to hulk jet can transfer quick if you wanna talk about flawed safetymining yield ratio i guess youre kinda miffed with secure containers too theyre so small they basicly have no use for a skilled miner everybody who does not have corpalt hauler support flying a hulk will just cargohold mine unless in a system they deem as safe using your logic even having a hauler is bad in the first place it increases yield and safety compared to jet can mining with just a single hulk docking up and switching to hauler to go and empty your can
nopei have no problems with people using secure cansi have no problems with people moving back and forthi have no problems with people putting in effort security or just being smarti have no problems with people trying the quick switch trick in fact i love it gives me plenty killsi have no problems with things being difficult challenging or needing efforti have no problems with people accepting lower rewards to increase their securityi do have problems with a 100 failsafe way of doing things while at the same time increasing rewards
i love it when a pirate turns into a 3 year old and starts throwing a tantrumthe orca was designed for this you jackass grow a fricken braingo to 00 and youll find plenty to shoot
to be honest this is working as it should as you yourself admit they are not 100 safe there is still risk from suicide ganking there are even a couple of threads about this atm and you must accept that an orca is a considerable investment for this safety
you do realise you only get those kills cause youre exploiting a bug right namely that in case of lag or being very slow at the miners side you are able to steal the ore while his client gives no warning that he is about to steal if that isnt an easy kill i dont know what is for all you know ccp designed the orca to circumvent this bug
i am but a doeeyed blinking innocent little carebear i know nothing of the big world you people so smoothly operate intell me educate me if combat is that thing that you so dearly crave why not just go down into the netherworld of low to nul security where you can maim and slaughter to your hearts content is that not what you want do you not seek the shriekingyetbrutallycurtailed howls of pain as the air vents from the compromised space frame into the endless void between the starsdo you not crave the spectacular effects of giant ships succumbing to the onslaught of your mighty weapons as their structure buckles under explosion after explosion of the insert the ammunition type of your preference that you so generously inflict upon themdo you not seek to mull around in the cloud of expanding debris grasping for that sacred prize of all loot sweet merciful loot that you can raise in your hands and display to your brethren while you expel a bloodcurdling growl from your lungs as you celebrate your latest fabulous victory against the impossible odds that you overcame so as to make a name for yourself in the new eden demesne is the greater good not the curt nod of acceptance as your peers stand in silent awe maybe even yes praise the light of the very stars in jealous contempt of the glory that you gather as your fearful adversaries whisper your name in silence throughout the galaxy so that it preceeds you as a cloud of quickly expanding toxic gas that steals the very breath from those who have the audacity to oppose youart thou not the master corruptor art thou not the scourge of the universe is there any bounty that can atone for the villainy that you so generously foist upon all who dare take up arms against you is the greatest prize new eden has to offer not merely a pittance in recognition of that marvellous creature that here stands before us lamenting the meager contents of a pedestrian container looking like a stray dog for the puny solace of the equivalent of a halfeaten meal are we to believe that our blood is enough to still your great vast hunger was this the goal that you embarked on in your voyage between the stars are they synonyms now pirate pauper peonor could it be perish the thought that anything that offers more resistance than a weak shield and a thick hull is too much of a challenge for those who would cackle with glee over yet another victory over the defencelesscome lets have mercy on the beggars i must have some refuse left after last nights efforts i shall send you a million isk so that you at least wont be without the benefits of an honest days work even though you clearly havent seen one yourselfno need to thank me the table is never so empty that there are no crumbs left for the hungryabulurdme meceonote corporate comptroller please send one million isk to the account of tzarim maybe he can buy some gizmo to pretend victory among his friends
ganki petitioned myself for doing it a long time ago the reply was that nothing odd had happened i also dont believe in the i never got a warning message while at the same time stating i didnt have messages turned off you know full well how eager
nice writeup must admit still somehow stating that high sec should be safeleft alone and that true stuff happens in low sec or 00 shows that you dont exactly understand eve
try it yourself i have reproduced this bug b4 it does not warn you i lost me a ship this way and petitioned it too response was logs show you stole nothing odd but file a bug report if you are sure so i did still in processing ppl who wanna try for themselves
empire is never safe and is never left aloneuse a wardec or suicide ship and achieve the same results
i sense pirate tearsmove valuable than carebear tears any dayif there in a corp working together with an orca war dec em hunt em slay em profitif there in npc corp but they are clustered close enough for an orcayou can consider suicide bombing them not sure how that works these dayswhats that phrase adapt or move onthough slightly off topici hate npc corps for any character older than the trial period
working as intended much
well as it never happened to me i dont mine i can only go by what a gm tells me keep me updated on what happens to that bug reportpetitionin the mean time ill still stand by what i say regardless of the trolling folks being able to drop goodsore directly from one ship into another without needing an extra step makes things too easy
thats total bull it wouldnt be difficult to anchor a gsc between those shipswill you then cry cuz you cant access that gsc
if youd have actually read the thread then you would have understood that no i dont mind that it takes effort and you cant move a lot of ore at the same time youre also confined to a single spot but feel free to troll without actually reading threads
pretty sure rookie corps cant use the corporate hangar on an orca because it requires permissions even for being the pilot of the ship to get things out of it
if i get in this close i really want to do my on paper dps somehow tracking would help that signedand yeah large autocannons in particular lost out too again i think right now amarr is the way to go ishtar is cool though
there arent enough significant differences between the 3 close run guns they all have nearly same damage output  with a single damage mod making one better than the rest ship damage bonuses overshadow the default differences then what it really comes down to is the type of ship you fly  strengths and weaknesses plus tracking optimal range and falloffall of those factors make pure damage differences insignificantthe only significant differences in close range weapons we have are between missiles and gunsin my opinion we should have more pronounced differences between the three gun types of course therell be plenty of people crying over balance  the type of people who think that balance is achieved by homogenizing everything erasing as many differences as possible its a boring type of balance and people calling for that shouldnt be taken seriouslyideally blasters should be kings of damage for short range  they should be hard to operate as reflected by range and tracking but they should be undeniably most damaging weapons to create a noticeable difference in damage blaster damage output would need to be increased about 20  which is roughly a free damage modwith that everybody would clearly see that blasters are most damaging weapons then would come the arguments of balance people would cry blasters are too powerful and maybe their concerns would have some valid points but the way to balance would not be to nerf the damage output it would be to look into optimal range falloff range and tracking statssimilarly autocannons should be kings of falloff and tracking make their tracking undeniably more powerful than all other guns  a clear cut advantage from other weapon types then there may be more imbalance objections but the way to address those would be to look into damage outputthe pulse laser strength is in the best optimal range of all short range guns they can provide a nice medium of damage and tracking between blasters and autocannons while having clearly pronounced advantage of optimal rangethats how we should balance things  respect diversity make the game more edgy
whats really absurd is your obviously the idiot in this equationstop station camping you just might get your stupid little kill in your stupid little war
i was thinking that alsothe problem i thought of though was what about those in 00 kind of hurts
you think 50 wartargets camping a single guy needs to be boosted gtfo
no i think people who wardec much larger targets and then running from a fight 100 of the time is just plain stupidthey either have interceptors orbitting 300500km away and will run the moment they see anything coming towards them or battleships playing station games on a messed up station with a 20km undockbump rangeits fair enough i can understand why they wont engage but they are the ones who wardecced us lets just change the mechanics to end the stupid station games everyone hates
someone call a whaaabulance
my 2 cents and btw not supported1 if the undock redock is extended or taken away then and lets be honest noone will undock at all at least with current mechanics you get a chance no matter how small to pop the tgt by using bumping alts cloakers ect to aid you2 i would reccomend to remove the annoying tgts that constantly dock and redock to have a gradual exended time that would increase with every time they dock and undock so 1st undock they wait 30 secs 2nd undock 1 min 3rd undock 2 mins ect ect ecti mean seriously what station manager would accept some idiot wasting their time continually undockredocking causing station ques to get longer and mess with the schedule
alright no ill agree with you on this and i think every pvp player will agree station aggro and undocking mechanics are incredibly bad and in dire need of a fixi supportevery station a kickout so that by the end of your 30 second invulnerability timer you are 15km from the station like gatesno windows to peek outaggro timer scales on the size of the ship that aggressunfortunately the whole we only engage unless we have vast superiority aka the blob is quite common in eve i keep stressing against changes like the gigantic qr agility buff that makes it easier for people to avoid combat and run away whenever they like and this is what results
only supported if there is this hightech feature called window that allows people in the station to see whats going on on the doorstep
lol that would be an awesome invention d
youre insane it cant be done too dangerous
why if youre so worried about being shot as you come out the station put some effort in and scout the areayou wouldnt jump into lowsec without scouting the gate why should this be any different if youre wardecced
ever been in a war dec before you dont need a window you have local if your stupid enough to undock when 4050 red stars are in your system you deserve to be shot why not do what the rest of the people do undock in a pod if your so worried
i feel the hatelots of terrible hate over this thread
if you cannot figure out how to get a fight away from the dock range of a station you are doing it wrong uninstall please and get off my forum
this  fix
not sure i think buying sp isnt the way forward as it goes against eve game philosophyhowever i would like to see better rewards from agents ie a reward of a certain amount of sp or a reward of a level up up to a certain amount of points after completing some long mission series or somethingthis would make missions all the more rewarding
great ideasigned
no way right now mission runners supply materials to the economy that are used to produce the things that mission runners and pvpers need the current system is working well
facepalm
hate disconnects mostly cause of the drone thing

i was a little disturbed to see a leading delegate making an accusation in caod about a leading alliance and various out of game tactics alleged to be in use by them
its an important topic id like to hear this discussed
o0
please stop posting already
please go post this crap in jita park or crime and punishment this has nothing to do with game mechanics hell go make a petition but stop making yourself out to be a emo jackass
the description of this forum is  a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar management
quite the constructive and mature response from an elected delegate to think you represent the players is a little worrying with that attitude
thats how the csm works thousands of voices want you to shut up so instead of cluttering a thread with them we elect people to tell you what everyone wants
and my description of you is a person who has no brain and would like to trash up the boards with kill the goonsthis is a forum board for discussion of ideas for the game not about conspiracies and bullcrap you can drum up
610  could do better needs more application shows potential
again read the forum description the word  topics  is the give away i am bringing a  topic  to the csms attention the topic here is meta gaming and out of game tactics to influence in game eventsdarius johnson has publically stated he has been a victim of this as a csm delegate he is in the best position to bring this to ccps attention and lobby for ccp to resovle the grey area that surrounds this practicehe must have proof otherwise why make the public statement i dont belive that many players like or except meta gaming so why not try and put a stop to it
maybe your just being a pathetic loser and refusing to take it like a mantake it to the game leave that crap off this board
this is probably a troll but i dont care virtually every serious alliance ensures key members have means of outofgame communication if you want to stir up a fuss about people giving other internet spaceship gamers their phone numbers when said spaceship gamers are presumably responsible individuals who know the consequences of passing out contact details then stir up a fuss about forums teamspeak  irc and msn oh and email hell campaign against vocal chords as well and pens and chalk and smoke signals best preempt telepathy as well we should only be permitted to communicate on evevoice and in game channels
it should be if the devs can do it in the videos they can do it in the game the grid would be sort of like a chess board support snipers and long range hitting boats in the back while fast close range in the front while clicking on that grid button it should have an option to designate coordinates to each member and squadronex squadron one frigs to point a15 altitude 6 next squadron with tacklers and hacs move to point c47 altitiude 9 and so on once everyone is on their points the fleet captain can hit an alight fleet to button and set it on a point in space
excellent idea id love to see such a system which would enable more tactical gameplay and more cohesion which means wargamers can get more involvedgreat
formation warping is on the cards just needs some time and attention methinks
i like this idea a lot it would add a lot more complexity to fleet battles

a lot of people especially veteran players often feel like many of the older game features are not quite right or have no idea why theyre not ever so slightly different not necessarily better just differentthere is absolutely no good forum for this right now and i dont mean forum as in these boards but as in some communication medium the existing forums are cluttered with ideas rather than questions and any questions are simply dismissed as thats how things are take it or leave it by the forum boards posters most of the time drowned outbut we want to ask ccp questions question that never received a proper answer or if they ever received such an answer its so hard to find amongst the generic chatter you might as well not botherof course ccp cant be bothered to even find the questions that are worth answering theres simply not enough developer time for that let alone answer such questionsthis is where the csm comes into the mixright now we have the assembly hall which is the area where proposals are showcased and people show supportthe speakers corner is sadly an almost completely redundant sectionso why not use this existing subforum to do something about it and shoot two birds with a single stone we could repurpose jita park speakers corner to be the place where concerns are voiced and questions are asked leave assembly hall for the proposalsyou know questions of the type what was ccps intention with feature  why does feature work like that and not some other way  or why does item class cost how much it does and why isnt ccp doing anything about itthe csm could then select out of the jpsc subforum on a weekly or a monthly basis some of the yetofficiallyunanswered questions they think deserve attention and present a certain number of them to ccp on a regular basis slightly rephrased if neededthe questions posed and ccps answers could then be collated into a weeklymonthly newspaper of sorts with a decent archeive available right here on the site alongside the knowledge baseexamples of questions which might be asked  why sizeofshipdependant rigs or stacks of rigs in larger ship rig slots were not introduced from the start and why theyre not in the game nearly 2 years later  why rigs have so many advantages but next to no drawbacks and why are there rigs with absolutely no drawbacks  how much are t2 rigs supposed to cost  if theyre not costing as much as theyre supposed to why dont they increase drop rates  if theyre supposed to cost this much why  why do t2 bss have lower base prices than the sum of base prices of components out of all t2 ships  what is the logic behind attribute respecialisation as planned to be implemented as in why not just give everybody 13 base in all attributes and do away with everything since it has almost the same endeffect for longterm players  how much are t3 ships supposed to cost and why so much when their performance is meh aka whats the point of t3 ships  what was the logic behind alchemy current values  when can we expect a massive shift in alchemy effectiveness  can we expect it  why  also what was the logic in the chosen materials why tier 3 and not the junk tier 1 ones for starters i would propose the following  one month to gather some questions and selectreformulate the most interesting ones between 5 to 10 questions depending on expected answer complexity and current unanswered question load are presented to ccp on a weekly basis all answers and accompanying questions are published in a permanent section questions may not be reasked unless a recent related gameplay change was made or the phrasing of the issue is radically different answer clarification questions however may be asked any time
so much boldi agree a top ten questions to ask the lead game designers every month would be superb live dev blogs and other nonsense that ccp tried before is failsupporting akita t oh my akita t is such a fast typist fingers must be so sore must go through keyboards like britney spears goes through rehab
carefully approvesi think this idea improves player  csm  ccp communication in my opinion there should be a lot more communication going on both between the csm and ccp so ccp is more aware of minor issues that bother players in return the players get more answers to their questions which is a good thing and the csm is a nice filter which prevents ccp from getting all the trolling and clutter we unfortunately see in these forawith our current system players can propose larger issues which they perceive as a problem but the often rather small questions do not get raised and never reach ccp with the players being left in the dark
and here i thought you wanted to go against what i had to say precisely  i hope this gets on the next csm meeting agenda and is approvedimplemented asapps thumbs up for the thread
i say yes to improved communication
yes
aye
excellent idea
all are good ideas

interesting responses and yes i know alexander didnt command a fleet so please cut the sarcasm i wasnt being specific i was mentioning what happens when a commander has been eliminatedjust an idea i wished to relay
i think the idea has merit though i dont think a game mechanic is needed because the reality of this idea already exists when a leader dies confusion and demoralization are possible the degree of confusion and demoralization are determined by what kind of leader has died if a leader is weak and has little impact on hisher pilots  then the death of that leader should have little effect on the fleet if the leader is strong and is heavily relied upon by hisher pilots  the death of that leader will have a significant and real effect on the fleet without imposing extra handicaps i say let the death of a leader have as much impact as it should by merit of the individual let us not augment the importance of insignificant leaders through game mechanics
i read the first post and ya pretty much thats how it worksso i was in tama we had a fleet going obviously we were kind of pirating antipirates jumped on us our fc had nice bonuses for us he died left system we no longer had fc primary died secondary died we then wondered who we shooting took time for the next person to step upso ya no changes necessary
this is not rome total war
he compelled darius iii to retreat he didnt kill him darius was assassinated in a conspiracy some time after the battle and dumped on the roadthat aside its still a bad idea killing the fc causes plenty of problems without need for any mechanical penalty the bonuses dont really matter and why should a well discipined well led fleet be arbitrarily penalised by a mechanic
how dare you people try to alienate and discriminate against us we have the same rights and follow the same rules as the rest of you just because we dont take internet spaceships as serious business doesnt mean we should be gaged and muted we are a corporation that has no stipulations no rules our members can do whatever they wish we do not discriminate against other players for their skill points experience and activity i do what i want when i want following the same rules as everyone else in the community this witch hunt against us ends nowi call upon ccp to start banning all those that try to discriminate and bad mouth us just because we dont fit the mold of normal alliances shame on all of you
signedyour posts may be bad but if we banned you then wed have to ban about half the inhabitants of highsec for the same reason
from what ive seen badmouthing other players seems to be the internets forte so i cannot see what basis your being descriminating on religion maybe sexual orientation or is because you have no control over your members and as you say they can do what they want when they want not really a good example of how to behave in a community is itso basically your upset because of people wanting to curb your antics and maybe turn caod into a useful forum tool rather than let it awash with pure gibberish interestingop not supported
i got an idea how about you both stfugo back to coad and leave the csm out of your ing match
qft  take your little flame war elsewhere now let me just get over to the other 2 or 3 threads started over this crap 
it was the lead developer at ccp that was talking during the tournament so im guessing its reliable infohe was asked about ejecting and hinted that yes you would eliminate the skill loss but the other pilot would of course be able to take the ship if he could fly it he stated that the skills lost would be rank 1 skills and would take 4 days or so to retraina four day wait in my opinion is not that big of a deal if the skill loss is not wanted then you can always eject if the other pilot cant fly the ship you may have a chance to get it back i like the new risk element and we would still have options there are so many billionaires out there now that money really doesnt matter any pirates who are reading this and dont like it are crazy youve wanted to steal ships for years and now you cannot signed please see signature
losing 1 level of a rank 1 skill get over it thats a few days training at most and if thats really so upsetting just eject before you die youll be much more distracted by the huge amount of isk you just lostnot supported
not supported but quoting an important point
disagreeisk is almost no more an issue to many a little more risk brings eve closer to its origins
this might surprise you but isk is an issue to the majority of playersobviously i am not saying that everyone should be able to fly everything as they please but i believe this is the wrong solutionif the problem is caused by a group of players having so much isk the loss of a t2 ship with fittings and rigs is insignificant we need to look at why they are so rich and if there is a genuine issue therethe biggest concern i have is power creep in eve  until recently t2 fittings were the exception not the norm now they are cheap enough to almost obsolete t1 modules for established characters
disagree i dont think eve needs another time sink after the learning skills maybe at some point in the future
i dont really care about graphics as long as they make killmails distinguish a bpc from bpo 
you clearly have a wonderful understanding of computers and database systems design i suggest you put in an application to ccp this statement goes for everyone else making such suggestions toosarcasm
shouldnt the game go along with the description and show them as contraband in the amarr empire and khanid kingdom theyre currently legal everywhere
forbidden doesnt imply illegal imo
ive got a copy of the amarr empress in a odd position with a minmatar male slave and a dog 
fixd
no it would cripple my corps business
in the last week we have seen why this idea will not fly in the real world when two satellites collided in leoif we were to take kinetic impact seriously i have commented along the same vine elsewhere we would have to consider colliding with an asteroid colliding with a stargate colliding with a stationwhy would it work only when you decide to crash into something rightwith object x moving at speed y in  direction and object a moving at speed b moving in  direction you dont have to worry about shielding or amor both turn into a cloud of debris on impactif you brought real physics to eve your hifalutin space contraption turns into a glass jar on impact if you absolutely positively need to blow it up on the cheap mass times speed does the job every timewould you also keep track of how big the hold was and how full of ore or ammo it was and what the density isid like to see an iteron iii full of veldspar impact a megathron and the iteron driver gleefully declaring victory choose the impact scenario you like best this forum would melt under the howls of indignation creative thinking i like it a lot its just not practicalabulurd bonifaceme meceo
same here
thanks for the feedback ive adjusted the skill to level 4 and added a secondary rank 2 skill to compensate of course its the principle im really interested in  im just postulating as to how it might work if implemented in game
just wanted to pop in and say im actually stunned to see all the posts complaining about mission rewards literally the most lucrative risk free profession in eve
yes and no its more for people who want to try out other facets of eve without paying the full subscription cost for another account sure a trial works but you can only get so far with it
the way i see it if youre producing t2 items you should be inventing bpcs owning a t2 bpo isolates you from a crucial part of mass production deleting t2 bpos forces all producers to either buy their bpcs or invent them themselves in their own rd department requires longer assembly line  goodhow to transition reimburse t2 bpo owners with bunch of free bpc copies one equivalent t1 bpo and a bunch of datacores theyll still have some advantage but eventually will have to participate in invention like the rest of the population
i did explain it quite well actually your failure to understand most likely stems from a gross lack of exposure to game mechanics beyond drag ore to jetcan and click deliver to get what you built the funny thing about carebears is that they think only they do industry as though its somehow too difficult for others to handle i mined a bunch of trit over the weekend and built a battleship from it and now i plan to fly that battleship into battle bruce didnt have industrial corps we had corps who could do any number of things issler never grasped that concept that a true industrial only corp is really only half a corp because you can build your way to riches but not to successlisten its pretty simple issler was an embarrassment to bruce i wont debate with you whether she did the things i said theres no need to debate it they happened and she was kicked out because of them she can continue on leading her carebear army in sweet non competitive bliss she can help to coddle members like yourself so that youll never know the challenges eve provides however if she makes suggestions on the csm which look to remove eves challenges and make them easier for industrialists to achieve then i will object to them
whew well i kinda feel bad that all you have left are personal attacks and no you didnt explain at all why knowing particular individuals regions and terms is necessary for complete beef enlightenment but thats okaywhos your spy thats been telling you i only do industry and reading my mind  and saying im snootyi think there are quite a few industrial corps that would argue with you about whether or not theyve found success and about whether or not industry is non competitivei dont think i ever denied any of the embarrassments you mentioned i asked you to point out the mean posts you complained about but i think thats iti didnt know i was supposed to be getting the coddle treatment you never mentioned that part thanks for letting me know about this i had no idea i was coddledeficient this is an outrageous outrage you can be certain ill start demanding serious coddling immediatelybut anyway im sorry i egged you oni was gonna stop once you said something like i dont need a good reason eve is like a play set with a plastic slide yadda yadda so there neener neenerthis last post is close enoughi mean cmonnnnnn these embarrassments are peanuts they really take the cake this is all bologna you dont have a beef with issler at allmaybe a spaghettios hamburger meatball but not a holy cow beefaww poo postings making me hungry againif issler was the most destructive malicious person ever to be a part of any of your alliances and tops your formermember beef list you have unbelievably fantabulous screener people ill hire them for quite a lot to make sure applicants cut the mustardfor doing such an amazing job i think id really want to cater to them and provide them with an absolutely embarrassing number of giant cheese platters to make sure they dont leavethis thread is in exactly the right placebread crumbs have been dropped here and there in previous posts  this beef is really about issler being a csmthis is where i was trying to go with this so thanks for getting us there finallyi think the brucey people are concerned that issler holds a threeyearold grudge about some things that are a little more significant than piddly little embarrassments and theyre concerned shell do everything in her power as csm to settle this slightly heftier beefi may not understand meanspirited tactics but i think i do get this fear about making 00 more accessiblei used to live in a popular retirement location and this reminds me of the groups of retired people there who after moving to the area wanted to slam the door shut behind them they would always fight proposals to build new retirement communities major red box actionthis sounds pretty similar well if you ever move to a retirement community youll already be have some experience and be ready to talk turkeyi cant speak for issler but really unless youre mean to llamas im pretty sure you dont have to worry about her seeking revenge for an old beefi never said you had no right to object to anything but i think it would be better to be more up front and sincere about concerns and to explain exactly why a proposal is lacking rather than slinging personal insults and just calling it a dumb idea that doesnt meshoh yeah you dont happen to know what day tadao left whoops i mean was kicked out im thinking that day should become an annual corp holiday with lotsa ice cream
edit double post cleared
whew i wanted to start my post with that since you always seem to do that and i thought it might help me understand your lack of understanding it didntyou can imagine whatever you want you can try to justify it however you want it wont change what happened ive stated what my beefs are both previous and current ive explained why you fail to understand them and until you go out and try to take and hold space of your own you most likely wont understand them what the heck though i still have some room in this threadnaught lets do itred box  your enemy somebody who is trying to kill you the pointy end of the gun goes towards these people just fyisyndicate  npc 00 space where there are no sentry guns and no concord when living in this space you either hold your own or dock up and stay there forever generally this has to do with the ever present red boxes who will try to shoot at you every chance they getnow the simple explanation is to call syndicate the schoolyard and red boxes the bully if the bully comes up to you in the schoolyard and says he will beat you up if you dont pay and you do pay what do you think he will do tomorrow does the bully respect you or have any reason to think twice about doing it again nope so if you are with a group of people and they all start fighting the bully while you stand off to the side and dig through your wallet well you just became the embarrassment thats about as simply as i can explain iti have no interest in shutting any doors and it wouldnt be behind me if i did because i dont currently live in 00 what i am interested in is preserving the doors as they exist right now that is making sure that if a corpalliance wants to live in 00 or low sec that they will have to work for it so that if i ever return i can expect the same challenges that previous pilots have faced and overcome what you seem to miss is that anything that makes it easier for nonpvp players to access 00 will make it easier for all players to access 00i can assure you that i have no fear of issler seeking anything revenge or otherwise i am simply voicing my concerns over some things she proposed at a csm meetingcheck the corp history im sure it will be on there enjoy your celebration
you still have not made it clear whether this is related to csm or some events that happened quite some time ago well before i started playing eveif its csm related i remind you again that issler was voted a csm delegate by her constituents from what i can tell in between all your personal attacks perhaps you should be taking up your views with other csm delegates there are 9 total if its the later well id have to say your posts are surprisingly lacking in qualitative content and you seem to be attempting to make up for it in personal attacks we would appreciate it if you refrained from this
i have nothing against you personally niskin that said here are some facts this isnt another one of your storytime sessionsi found an interesting link as welloutside forum quoting friededit link was broken but its the first result from googling friedrich psitalonhere it is stated by fried that after leaving bruce he has a few plans among which are begin targeting people we have grudges with or would be fun to pew pew repo industries the honda accord isslers alliance and privateers are all high on the list this is mid 2008then we accept an exbruce pilot into our alliance for the tournament funny thing to do if we hated bruce wouldnt you say this was just last monthsaid exbruce then failed at assassinating issler and made a public mockery of foom who leaped to claim credit for said failurealliance tournament thread of failthen in an attempt to save face foom declared war on the honda accord or was this planned a year agofinally were delivered with this thread started by an alt full of fail which you are attempting to lend some credence to if i were you i would have just started a new thread backing up a pathetic alt post like that might make people believe it was youthis is a very interesting thread to bring that up in which meeting why arnt you posting in that thread you got off to an awfully funny start in here for someone who is interested in a csm meetings minutes
your not getting his point covertone of the reasons you cant change your name has nothing to do with ccp tracking you it has to do with other players tracking youlocation agents become useless as players could just pay to change their name making them invisiblecorpalliance thieves become impossible to trackthose are two very important reasons off the top of my head to never allow name changes and why they will likely never implement name changes
pretty sure you cant rename pokemon after a trade seemed relevant to me at the time
no hire a courier stop cutting professions out of evemake one or more contracts for the things you need to move and they will likely be movedbelieve it or not a fair few people still make money off of couriers in high secto top that off your removing the risk to your things by letting them instantly move instead of exposing them to free space where they can be suicide ganked destroyed by a war target or any other random mishap
whats with you people lets make is game riskfreego play eq wow or whatever dont make a scene just gowhy would you play this game if you cannot accept the risk involvedgo just go away please
back to the top  still awaiting a ccpcsm update
1st  dont bump topics at least not obviously2nd  if you read the minutes you would see that ccp is looking into it
sorry i meant offlined the context of my post shouldve shown this was a slip of the fingers i was talking seconds before about hacking towers with their shields up but hands up i said the wrong thingmuch like when i see the ishtar and ishkur on scan 5050 chance ill mix the two up
coming soon
reading through that post theres 2 ways of solving the problem1 change projectiles alltogether2 accept the racial proscons but actually get the ships some decent bonusesi very much like option 2 as im not really into a spreadsheetlike solution like making projectiles fall inbetween lasers and hybrids would make for a very dull world if every problem was tackled that wayfunnily enough as i see it the main problem isnt what happens if we run into a megahype but rather what options do we have left against a geddonabaddon its lasers that need changing they really need to lose their mad optimals or their high dps once those are normalised a bit then changing minnie ships bonuses to add a  falloff would make sensebut as said before minnie lacks tank and dps and has to make up for that with uhm yeah it can outrange a gallente but against amarr is has no other option than to use its neuts which ofcourse work but in this age of passive ehp tanking meaning the cap booster only needs to feed the guns thats not really working too wellperhaps the issue is with cap boosters making cap dependancy less of a problem and thus making capless dps less of a boon dunno edit on the muninn specifically its down on dps range and locking speed compared to a zealot if used in its sniper role but the thing is the extra high slot allows for a cloak and the small dronebay allows for ecm drones giving it some survivability i rather like that
with the frigs and the cruisers fall off can sort of still be used that way as long as your not fighting lasers because your ability to move around and the generally reduced number of targets you face in one instance is far fewerbattleships is another kettle of fish although boring adding autocannon optimal range its probably the most balanced way of dealing with large autocannons and with an increased drone bay alpha and tracking the tempest restores some long lost versatility and performance in the weapons departmentbut do you really want to undo several years of amarr needs umph whiningideally youd wanna get underneath the lasers using your agility and improved tracking add situational tracking distruptor to your advantage however autocannons hit supprisingly poorly at optimal and the tempest isnt quite agile enough nor tough enough to be roasted before getting there in realistic situations the damage output at fall off just doesnt make any sense and isnt ever optimal and thats what i hope you change with those changesthe muninn has 2 spare high slots it loses one for an extra low you can still cloak warrier ii drones are better than ec300s and in either case the deimos can carry both sets deal about the same dps with rails much less alpha though with speed range and tracking pretty much even for a ship that cant do much else swaping one of its two spare high slot for a low is a fair solution
if you give large autos an optimal between blasters and pulses then add tracking and a bigger dronebay and the already available signature advantage and 2 heavy neuts then you create a monster i woulf fly tempests more often then but i feel it would be too much i still think that the problem is amarrlasers trying to make the tempest workable against amarr bs by giving it brute force is imo the wrong way on the muninn yeah i failed on the extra slot but id rather add another midslot giving it more sniping versatility sensor booster or tracking comp adding it as a low slot would make it into a short range armoring tanking autocannon boat thing is ofcourse that the armor resists for minnie t2 fail hard it just doesnt work as an armor tanker not as it should
guysplease stop with all the requests for change for minnie ships the race is ruined it has no flavor and it has no place in eve anymore out tanked outsped and out ganked by every other battleship the tempest is simply not a viable pvp ship any moreother players can screech in disagreement but the reality is when an fc says he doesnot really like to see tempests in a fleet fight you know its the end of the lineccp know this they have been told formally and informally and they have acknowledged the problem they push off the rebalancing and with tech 3 inbound just what is the likelihood of substantial change with all the other issues it will bring in rebalancing tech 3nil nada zip butkiss zero zilch there is no possibility of a change for at least 12 months and even then what will you get this is the team that said alpha strike was bad and unfair and then introduced doomsdays this was the team that said sniping was boring and not the way they wanted the game to go and introduce the ultimate in boredom the rokh this is the team that listened to the amarr whining and nerfed the vagabond into uselessness now there is not one minnie ship that is capable of outtanking outganking or outdpss its amarr counterpart all other things being equalthe evidence is clear the minnie race is being willfully singled out for nerfing into uselessness there is no ignorance here there is no desire to balance the game it is a conscious act with prior consideration and thought look at the willful blissful way ccp ignored the minnie capital issues and push it off we are going to look at minnie capitals sonn tm yeah right in the fullness of time in due course after all the requisite procedures have been considred after we have formed an interdepartmental committee to examine and review the basis for understanding the player groups concerns after actively consulting with the csm and the player base after scheduling in any system changes with future program development paths and storyline arc considerations in other words when we can be buggered looking at it sunshineso adapt train amarr and let the tempest die a graceful death is it fair no is it reasonable no it is good for the game to destroy diversity nobut ccp dont care they just hit 50k online members and to be frank they prefer to gain a noob against losing a vet so dry your eyes and harden up and fly amarryou know it makes sense

i for one welcome my new and improved veldspar devouring overlord
lol i read this and thought how cute i dont see a reason to say no aslong as it is not combat operable
that would then be the only titan in high sec not up to speed with when they changed the building requirements etcyeah ill support that and to people saying but thats favouritism yeah so what
wormholes into highsec will never be large enuf for caps to enter at least thats what i have read
if ccp wont do it for you i shall take care of your ship while you go lobby in person
i approve
i approve
i too
i fully endorse this product andor service
do it
signed if only because i want to try to fly my mammoth into its naughty bit
ill agree with the tourist attraction ideaalthough i can picture amarr quickly becoming the major trade hub in the game from this going to have to replan all my routes to fly around it
this may not be the most pressing issue in eve history but its the little things that make a good gamei suopport this idea mainly because i know chribba would never hurt anything else than huge lumps of veldspar with it
if anyone deserves a giant phallic monument in amarr its chribba
as long as ur not a git and use a ddd im fine with it
no im sorryfavoritism and discrimination are the exact same things in my world and i do not support either
supported just because its chribba
move the veldtar to amar 
oh man come onit would be awesome
i like this not many empire dwellers get to see these marvelous beasts
i like it would draw more people into amarr relieving pressure from jita and would make more people want to head into 00 to see more of themsigned
supported because its chribba

i want to give my support to the ideadiscussion going on
i agree as eve needs more things for people to see when they start up
seems the missile damage formula is still in dispute and hasnt been spaded out ill reserve judgement until more details are out the one i was working with made some pretty dire predictions they should be better at something and that something should be a reason to use themcald tank is in mids buffer tank can be okay but they generally dont have the capacitor to do anything like a dual mar its not a jaw dropping tank either and you sacrifice webbers or scrams as well as electronic warfareit does have the advantage of opening up low slots for damage and tracking modules but there are no tracking modules for missilesalso cruise missiles will still do neglible damage against an interceptor look at the formula and put in some figures it wont round to one i was getting dps figures to the tune of 648847e4 even though they always hit they effectively do no damagei think youll be hard pressed to find ships with missile explosion velocity bonuses tracking bonuses on the other handit doesnt reduce my damage taken to zero because i have to keep up my traversal which isnt always easy and if i make one mistake the turret is calculated as if its doing full damage even with a mwd runningand in those situations where turrets will never hit youll always hit for neglible damage anyway at with turrets there is an incredibly remote change of hitting for good damage also youll likely be in an armor tanked ship with things like stasis webifiers or tracking computerswould you put a bunch of sp into missile launcher spec
at this point you should reread everything you wroteyour writing reflects your low unterstanding of ingamemechanics and experiencei for one fly all races
an adjustment towards this would be most welcome
if the forum search software worked decently unlike currently imagine how much less useless and repetitive threads there would bedetailed search would mean people could chose to search in the csm minutes and get the answers the devs already gave right away too instead of relying on hearsay

you give the human race too much credit o but alright you win this one o p
with the whole bob deal aside  its a broken mechanic that needs fixing 1000s of peoples in an organization shouldnt be dissolved with the dissolved with the posh of a button
i completely agree this sort of thing is what the csm is suppose to be all about eves entire end game as defined by ccp has been ignored for far too long alliance mechanics pos warfar titans all this and much more needs to be addressed i am pleased to see that many pf the csm delegates have this at the top of their agendas remember dont let some scandal or bug uncovered by ccp distract you from your cause
you want protected you gotta pony up the doughit is a mmo you know with the focus on the second m part band together or suffer the probability of being attacked eventually and take the necessary steps to mitigate possible damagethis coming from someone who has lost quite a bit of isk during war declarations in my earlier years
or make caod a non access forum where isd or some other ccp controlled news team report on events they attend andor diplomats and snr corp directorsalliance leaders issue statements togive summat for the diplomats to do and tbh will make caod easier to read as we the players cannot be responsible enough it keep it on topic without the constant trolling and out of control posts

nerfing a ship just so you can rely on a canflip is not a good method of game balance if anything wardecs should be easierback to point if someone wants to spend a pile of cash on a ship just so they can dump directly into cargo then its time for you to adapt from your can flipping ways the old story of adapt or die springs to mind
could also be done by simply being fast enough to stacksort the ore in their can or to snatch it all into your can havent tested that lately though been on hiatus
they can still drop ore into the hangars and the pilot always has access to the hangars of their ship
umm hauler on station pulling a jetcan at a time back to station while the miner cycle for the next load in cargo rigged hulks with upgrades in the low they can handle the time for the itty v or transport to come backeasy enough to unachor and move the can with a tractor as neededthis sounds like someone upset that the easy prey has disappeared but keep looking not everyone has an orca on hand
bolded what do you think bringing other people is an orca can easily be classified as security against can flippersthey are lowering the rewards how many people have to be in hulks in the gang to make up for losing a hulk to add an orcai find it vastly humorous that a can flipper is trying to argue risk vs reward when they tend to target newbs for the easy loot and lulz
enough thats its worth encouraging group behavior
i see you missed out the i have no problems with things being more difficult or challenging i do have problems with things being impossible apart from that an orca gives mining bonuses in case you havent realised so the but they need an extra pilot for it doesnt exactly hold any ground especially as they dont really need another hauleralso youre mistaken on the targeting newbs part it shows that you dont really understand the whole conceptto the other poster going but they can tractor cans tractoring cans still gives an opportunity its not completely safe and the orca pilot has to be alert and not afk as it is now the orca doesnt even need to be actively used as the whole thing is done by the miners
if my math is correct they would need to have a gang of over 25 people in hulks in order for the command bonuss to become more profitable for that one orca pilot to not have brought a hulk as wellso either they are sacrificing mining yield for added security or you are targeting large corp operations that would swarm you with drones the second you started flashingso ill give you the benefit of the doubt and not think you a complete moron by assuming that you are targeting ops with 35 pilots with that assumption and your reasoning that i bolded in my previous post your argument is moot and your suggestion defuncttargeting anyone mining is lowering your risk otherwise why would anyone be a can flipper the ore you would be able to carry in one hauler load is about enough to pay for the hauler and a second hauler to replace it assuming you use cargo expanders unless you are one of the fabled 00 can flippers but then you would be complaining about the rorq instead
youre forgetting one thing the hauler thats normally needed to move the ore hes replaced by the orca so you actually gain mining yield due to the fleet bonuses unless ofcourse you do the lets all mine 20 cans full of ore and when were done well all grab haulers and go pick it up but that would be stupid and luckilysadly i dont see people that stupid too muchyoure also mistaken in the fact that i actually care about the ore or some hauler or silly retriever dropping cargo expander 2s
ok so you are just interested in easy kills for your killboard too bad the carebears are now starting to outsmart you lol and the bug if your interest really is can switchingand actually with a 35 man op why sac a pilot to a hauler when a properly rigged hulk can warp back to station to drop their own loads without losing nearly as much mining yield that hauler would only save one mining cycle per 10 min while losing that pilots mining cycles for the entire timeregardless can flipping in highsec is the most lol profession in the game you would make better isk salvaging belt wrecks but you arent interested in the isk
yesterday well over 5 billion was destroyed due to our actions could be more its a guesstimate as we stopped using a kb and wouldnt i have had the youre not within 1500m of the wreck bug wed have looted at least 2 bil more than the 150ish mil we didis that a whole lot no but were having fun doing it and we gain cash in the process id rather have that than optimise my income while being bored to a point my braincells start to meltalso youre not debating the issue but are just voicing your dislikelack of knowledge on my chosen passtime my statement still stands being able to mine directly into an afk orca with a huge cargohold and which gives bonuses is silly i dont mind the cargohold or the bonuses i midn the 100 safety issuein the mean time your replying or trolling not sure on it keeps this thread nicely bumped so thanks i guess
actually the break evengain is 5 hulks  1 orca vs 6 hulks with the orca bonuses using the cycle time reduction gang linka common fit for a high security orca is lse iis in all the mids for a large buffer tank expanded cargohold iis in the lows ganglink tractor salvager in the highs for cleaning up rat kills from the droneswith t1 rigs it comes out to about 120k m3 cargo capacity which for the hulks is only around 56 cycles for the fleet figure a yield of around 45k  5  225k m3 per cycle so about 5 cycles before the orca has to dock one reason many use the corp hangar as a gsc with 2 haulers to take turns emptying it allowing the orca to stay out there with boosts
its staying bumped but it has 0 thumbsup supports so far out of 46 replies at this rate it might soon match the pay for skill gain thread for replytosupport ratio activity does not equal progress
reminds me of the whines about nerfing secure containers yes there were whinges about gscs being unhackable and making mining too safe with miners using them as transfer canistersnet result there was nothing just database load issues resulted in them being removed over time and from higher security spacenow its the piwhat whines about the orca in high securityadapt dont whine
this topic has no porpose go 2 low sec and go after people that can defend themselves instead of moaning about how you cant kill empire miners with cheap tricks
i figured it out he got pwn3d by an orca and now hes whining over epic failnessthats why hes posting this stupid thread
or goaded the wrong hulkorca team into a can flipgist tank hulk and drone spec pilot ftw
an orca gives a total bonus of 5514 to a miners per minute yieldwith your maths yield of 25 hulks  orca  yield of 38785 hulks without orcaso already in a group of 3 its worth to switch one hulk for an orca 2 hulksorca  31 hulks
without getting too much further into this the hulk is actually not dropping the ore directly into the orcas cargohold the ore is sent to the corporate hangar which has a fixed size of 40km3 so you wont be afkorcaing for too longhuge is as huge does the corporate hangar inclusive total cargo capacity using expensive rigs is going to be 165km3ish ore its a fun amount of ore its not going to buy the old lady a pair of new shoes and paying someone to make 60 jumps up and down to go and collect themits a fun boat an orca its not the holy grail either buddyabulurd bonifaceme meceo
wouldnt be the first hell the eve uni had a pilot get 2 kills in their orca so there are some out there that will eat the unwary for lunch
youre thinking about it the wrong wayan orca is a secure canister with an engine and tractor beams what ccp wantedthusan orca is a tractorenhanced ship with a corp hangar array ccps implementation
posting in a i have no ideas and cant hang in low sec or 00 thread
npc corp  no corp hangar  almost useless orcai doubt that as a corpmate without roles was happy when he received them saying now i can access my orca hangars
the corp hangar and ship maintenance bay do work in npc corps and for those without roles you are told access denied but have full access anyway to the ships corporate hangars same with any ship using a corporate hangar the pilot always has full access to any part of the shipa npc corporation member can drop into the corp hangar even though there are no roles they get the message about you can not recover these items if you continue 
you can also fleet with an orca and you can access the hangars even if you arent in the same corp as long as they set up the permissions correctly we do this alot with some associatesas for the op if you dont like folks mining into their orcas be all means start shooting at them blowing up the orca will certainly solve your perceived problem of course if you do that enough everyone will just start mining in hulks again  but who doesnt want to mount strip miners on a mammoth i mean really
i would like to see a compelling reason to sacrifice tank for more gank on a blaster boat and to use neutrons and some more in optimal and tracking so that theyre more effective once theyre in range only working at extremely short ranges is supposed to be the downside of using blasters with the exception of large blasters its pretty unlikely youll be within optimal thoughi dont terribly mind the idea of sacrificing a lot of tank to gain enormous damage output that will beat another more balanced ship one on one and be easily taken out if it cant get in range or is up against multiple ships i think thatd be very gallentelike right now it seems its hard to beat a geddon bstobs regardless of what you are in
signed
yep never understood why the info page on blasters was along the lines of how amazingly powerful they are supposed to be they seem useless to me
there is a problem with blasters not as big as some people make it out to be but there is still a significant problemccp should look into this
although this solution doesnt address some of the more problematic issues regarding sovereignty its still pretty sensible just this alone wont solve the problems however sov still needs to mean something beyond fuel bonuses and pos still need to be extracted from the mechanic as painlessly as possiblec
lets look at this from the supply and demand prospective if you reduce the amount of minerals flowing into the economy from mission runners it reduces the total supply that reduction will not increase the amount of minerals produced by miners effect prices of everything goes up while income stays roughly the same end result relatively everything on the market becomes too expensive to use except in the safest of conditions which dont exist in this game people find it much more difficult to progress in the game and leave causing less total minerals to enter the system repeat ad nausium server gets shut downso sure ill support your idea to destroy the game thanks for playing
partly support if mining were made tolerable and not an afk jobreprocessingrefining as jobs no and i cant stress this enough
why there is no concord out there and since you dont take hits for killing other players why should you get a sec hit positive for killing npcs also as this is not empire space why do you get a bounty now we are getting bs in low sec there will be the good bounties and sec hits here in empire space
fail
troll much
 op  why the hell would you have a problem with that to begin with
not supported because its dumb
not supportedjust because theres no law official law doesnt mean they shouldnt get bounties from concord for someone on the wanted list im sure concord will still mail them a check
so wait since when is getting the rl cellphone numbers of corpmembers and allies a grey area tactic or since when is calling upon your ingame allies using oog contact means in any way weird  ok granted its pathetic to wake up or disturb people at their jobs just so you would not lose some bits and pixels in an internet spaceships game but that is certainly not an issue ccp has any say about nor should theyop has no issue makes an issue out of nothing and does it so in a pathetic waythumbs down
alliance bull write a petition no one cares
we pvp with them pretty much every day whenever there is an opportunity we use them putting them at risk hotdropping gangs ganking carebears  ratters etc and despite how often we field them we only lose on average one blackops battleship every 2 months lost one in august 08 october 08 december 08 february 09 that was until last week when we lost 2 in one week  which puts us at 5 lost so farso weve lost 5 blackops total in the 6 months  1 year that our members have been actively pvping with them weve lost 25 bil in bo hulls though during that time weve gotten hundreds of kills  collected tens of billions of isk worth of loot from carebearmissioners wrecks so were still firmly in the black isk wise losing a bos sucks sure but its nothing compared to replacing dreads which we have also lost 5 lost to lame old pos warfare which is what we did before blackops
sure we should just completely remove the idea of a fort from the pos so all the shield is is a box come on attacking isnt meant to be balanced when you attack a fort you expect to lose more men than you kill because they have a walli extremely disagree
the issue isnt starbase tactics the problem is in sov mechanics
you can also bubble and kill people at station and gates yet we still have 1 min aggro timer are you saying we dont need it there either
1again whats good for the goose is good for the gandershould be applied to pos shield just like stations and gates
sarcasmi agree with this thread in fact in real life a person in a bunker can just take their gun and shoot out the small gunholes on the bunker with very little if any chance of getting shot back we should nerf rl bunkers immediatelysarcasmreally the defenders should have this kind of advantage i dont think this tactic is the problem but rather the whole pos mechanics tied to sovereignty issue ccp has said that theyre looking at this issue under a microscope and change will come
its quite different you cant pop the whole station with people in it so station access needs to be balanced people getting out shooting and redocking when in hull there is nothing you can do to finish them so timer is needed but you can pop the whole pos with everything in it so defenders should have some kind of advantage you are attacking a fortress and a destructible one
i agree with most if not all statements  better communication between the community and ccp perhaps preferred through the csm shouldnt do anything but help people
how do you make the thumbs up iconedit found it
yesand please lets not do it as a live dev blog i hate these things
sounds good to me this is one of the reasons why i set the csm chat channel up although people dont seem to visit it much im all for tying this into a more direct channel to ccpi also support redesigning the jita park forum as its often neglected and hardly used for much well see what ccp thinks about this as they will probably get some tough questions but i support the idea
ok

have to support this dont hate the mission itself just the fact that i get it more than all of the other storylines ive done combined
i had a little discussion lately as we had a planned corp mining op to increase funds the corp tax was set to 100 and people accept the tax then but are not really happy about it sometimes at least those who dont love and want to help their corp they said that they need to make iskies too to buy new ships for pvp what is also understandablewell most corps are based somewhere some in empire some in lowsec and then those in 00to make it short there should be an ability to limit taxes to different regions or constellationsmaybe also with different taxrates with the normal general tax only applying to empire or wormspaceso that the combat forces still can get an income if they secured a system far away just as one example maybe you find another one for yourself it can also limit the efficiency of possible ninjaratters when youre in a 00 corppost your thoughts i dont know if this already has been suggested so shoot me if it has
if you need to set 100 corp tax to encourage people to take part in planned corp activities then you have a corp problem not sure this should be solved by some ingame mechanic having said that i understand that with a larger number of members it gets difficult to make sure everyone does his sharewouldnt it be easier to have the few people that are exempt from that corp activity apply for a tax refund for that period of time that way theyll actively have to approach a directorceo and thus having to account for their absense
you seriously need to resign or figure out something else mana 100 corp tax rate is just flat stupidwere doing fine with 10 and the bloody wallet is richer than i am
i am proud to be in a corp with a 0 tax rate with that said i dont see any reason why more flexible tax options would be a bad thing for corps that would use them giving a thumbsup for why not
a more granular tax system would be niceit deserves more discussion at the minimum
i would support a more granular tax system for sureon the topic of the op id quit any corporation that bumped its tax rate up above 25  if you need to tax your members that heavily to make money you need to rethink your operations in terms of profit and loss
a more granular tax system would be interesting not just by region  constellation but also for1 rat  mission rewards ie 10 on rat bounties 0 on mission reward2 roles new members could be taxed at 25 extra3 security status pirate corps could penalize those with high security4 standings lower taxes for those with higher standings towards a factionbonus points for being able to enter formulas of some kind a flat tax system is simple and easy and i bet that a lot of corporations would just stick to that but having these options would be a lot of fun
to clear the 100 tax discussion it was only set for the limited time of the op and not full time normal is 10 the op was announced several days beforeand sorry if i didnt wrote it clear english isnt my natural language
perfect ccp has lumped together every 15 minutes the rat bounties to reduce lag and this idea will add four more check for each rat killed as a theoretical idea it is interesting implementing it will be a killer
kick those people from your corpmine is a very small one but everyone donates when we have a corp projectno need to add more crap for the servers to do every single time an npc is killed
oh ofc i support my own suggestion 
thisim supporting it because i want something shiny with a countdown timer for production and skill training ccp might have plans to build this into the interface it might look as good as the corporate interfacegive us something cool to look at while were managing our industrial activitieswhy is this not a part of the interface yet i have a good idea why dont point it outextra credit if ccp allows capsuleers to give their realworld coordinates if they so choose so corporate members may be displayed on a rotating globe and a realworld progress of the terminator as the sun rises and sets over the world a great visual tool with smart functionalitymake it look as good as the spectacular ingame art something fit for the age its supposed to be used inim getting all giddy just thinking about itabulurd bonifaceme meceo
awesome  supported
not supported ical suites me just fineand i can post it on the web as i feel the need tooif ccp wants to give it to us then they will give it to usright now its just a luxury that only a few select groups will even use let alone acknowledgegood idea but just not a high priority
well im supporting this just in case this falls under the why the hell didnt i think of that category
emo  emotionsplease stay out of the topic if you have nothing to say about the topic
pay me 1 billion isk and ill gladly comply
im pretty confident in ccp that plextimecards will always be the only items that can be legally bought and sold using either rl currency or isk
ah so someone does realize penalizing the npc corps would result in legions of small 15 man corporations to wardec and whinge about
this is the problem with dealing with the t2 bpos if t2 bpos are nerfed by flooding the market it kills all the professions based around invention if they are deleted or changed to bpcs the holders will complain and nobody else will notice anything as invention sets the market pricesif t2 bpos really are a problem making more bpos seems a better solution but after reading your post im thinking that making more bpos might cause more problems than it solvesas to your points1  my plan was that ccp releases bpos until invention stops happening if something causes invention to start back up release more bpos so invention only really happens after ccp releases some new t2 items into eve with small spurts of invention as demand for an item goes up2  my assumption here was that someone wanting to buy the bpo would save up each time the auction comes round the current holders have to buy it meaning their profit margins put an upper cap on their bid but the person without the bpo will eventually get enough isk to be able to outbid themthis assumption is very questionable especially if the people saving up cant predict which bpos will become available in advance3  i did not know this the higher skills could be worked with but the higher copy time really screws over my ideaso my idea is pretty much killed
and what good will come of destroying their items they will complain loudly as ccp has just destroyed items in their hanger but nobody else will see any change beyond their complaints as invention sets the market rate
im sorry for saying whew so much but its all i can think of after these quotearama posts where my points and questions are completely dodged because you have no answer you insist on concentrating on ridiculous things like one word in an enormous quote and have little more than personal insults to throw aroundim sorry for having such a salad bar of issues at once in previous posts obviously ill need to go over one thing at a time to try and prevent going off in such crazy irrelevant directionsalright i said we could drop this but you insisted on bringing it up again ill ask a third timeare you ready pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease pay attention and take it easy with the quotesi did not ask you to define those things i thought in my last post the one that was completely requoted i made it pretty clear i already know what those things are sheesh i was just teasing before heehee sorry about that  thanks for the condescending definitions though they were snootyriffici asked 3 times now why knowing about those things is necessary to understand this little beefwhewi predict again more overthetop quoting plenty of personal attacks and no answer
beyond the accusation that issler was an embarrassment to bruce which is more of a historical fact than an attack i havent made any personal attacks i have raised my concern about isslers input to the csm and explained my reasons none of which included personal attacks i havent taken it up with any other csms because im not here to get her booted im here addressing a concern i had when i saw the meeting minutesi chose this thread to post in because of a comment she made here which tied in with my concern check my first post again to see what im talking about every post ive made since the original has been in direct response to you or one of your corp mates you keep asking questions and i keep answering them if you want the thread to die you could stop giving me reasons to respond
first let me say that anything linked from com is at risk of being fake however i will confirm that portion when we left bruce tadao was on our list of people to shoot at for revenge not at the top or anything but certainly on the list for the reasons ive detailed throughout this whole threadi think you are overestimating how that thread makes tadao look and underestimating how it makes foom look we succeeded in getting a spy onto your team regardless of how easy it was and ensured that our target went down it wasnt the perfect execution of the plan but it wasnt a failure its also not our fault that your opponents failed to defeat you after our interventioni am not attempting to lend credence to anything once again i refer you to my first post i raised an issue and tied it in with one of isslers posts in this thread i have answered many questions in this thread but im still missing answers to my questions what is it that carebears need what justification is there for giving them easier access to 00 im interested in hearing those answers and justifications
i have dodged nothing your failure to understand the answers is not my fault i will however attempt to answer more clearly since that seems to be necessary in this caseits called context which means the set of circumstances or facts that surround a particular event situation etc exchanging money for services in itself is not an embarrassing act however when placed in context it certainly can be ive explained the context but you still dont seem to understand as best i can tell its just something that you would have to experience to truly understand the context
if you had spent any time reading csm minutes in particular the iceland meeting youd see i havent pushed for changes that get carebears in 00 there was a long discussion in iceland about improving 00 ccp suggested that new mechanisms could bring in carebears into the badlands and i participated in the brainstorming that resultedyou wanted to know what i bring to the csm i am not in the csm trying to drive a bunch of immediate changes in eve realities of software engineering and complexities of game balance prevent that from even being possible i am in the csm with a focus on oversight and input for ccp to consider in their long term direction for eveif you arent happy with my csm participation you should run yourselfmostly i think this is about a couple of disfunctional foom leaders unhappy that tada o continues to provide a place where 120 plus members choose to make their home as we approach our 3rd year in eve because every day those members stay is another day complaints about me and my ideas about how to make a healthy and fun corporation are proven wrongeve is meant to be fun fun is very subjective beep is about one way to have fun in eve foom seems to be about another way beep doesnt feel the need to interfere with other folks having fun unless it is directly affecting us foom has adopted the immature school yard bully model of fun that strikes me as getting old quickly and one that doesnt leave one with a lot of friends in the end that model of fun is a very strange one for a school teacher to have adopted hope freeds students are provided a better model of citizenship and social interactioni ran for a csm position when a number of beep members encouraged me to run i tried during the election to make my views in eve known even to the point of posting my ideas on a single new topic daily folks had a pretty good idea of what i was about when they chose to vote for me in the end enough of folks that did vote saw something in my position about life in the verse that i was given this opportunity if someone wasnt happy with that result the right way to change it is not to slam me in the forums to war dec my alliance or interfere with our pvp tourny team it is to run in the next election make a compelling case for your views and win a seat at the csm tableill be looking forward to your anouncement as a candidate in the elections of csm iii niskin issler
edit issler makes a better point than i did removed to avoid confusing niskin
no not really if ccp charged a hefty fee for name changes and they were limited to 1 every two years or something like that the option would cease to be of any practical use to scammers but would still allow players to correct a foolish decision during the character creation process
how so i could on my alt rip off your corp for everything its worth say 90billion then the next day change my name via this and you would never ever find the alt again assuming i waited till roles were up and i was out of corpi never said scammers i said thievesyour beating a dead horse your name carries more than just letters in this game it carries everything you or the owner before you did when you take that alt on as your own you take his history on with youpeople before you have asked for name changes your not the first your just another guy who doesnt get why its not ok to just change your name it has wider social implications than your seeing
fair enough but every character in eve is tracked by the database with a unique id not by character name thats basic programming and i cant imagine that eve doesnt do that same thing another option would be that when a character name change occurs a record of the change is automatically appended to a readonly area here on the forums that would provide the entire community with a permanent record of the change and pretty much negate the example you provided aboveso all that is needed is a method where ids can be looked up to find all aliases that character has ever went by very simple to incorporate that into the existing apithe issues you raise are good ones and im not saying those shouldnt be carefully considered by ccp before allowing name changes however none of them is an insurmountable programming challenge  in fact its a fairly straightforward issue to overcome
wont workunless you got a curiour in your corp or alliancethe damned collateral fees are insaneand the reward is worthless freighter pilot who does curiour contracts from time to timenot to mention a good deal of them are scams
the op is 110 correct the problem is that there are a large number of people who do want to dumb eve down dumb it down to the point where it is nothing but completely mindless pewpew without any real meaning or any end dumb it down until it is nothing more than team fortress 2 in spacethats a sentiment im happy to observe the devs do not seem to share while combat will always remain central to life in eve its clear the developers have a more profound vision and are taking steps to deepen and broaden the game experience and enhance existing possibilities surely you didnt think they put this much money and development time into ambulation just so people could walk around and walk around some more not hardly it seems obvious ambulation is intended to add just the type of flavor and diversity to the game that it now lacks and that it should be noted will offer lots of possibilities for all players and corporation typesthe eve devs have a vision and it is not team fortress 2 in space

although i support making disbanding an alliance harder i do not think that all ceos should have to agree before an alliance is disbanded there is a reason there is an executor corpi do however think that it should be harder to disband an alliance than just pressing a button the ceo of the executor corp should be the only person able to disband an alliance
1 this thread is not in caod2 the thread you linked guess what not caod3 my alts are megalapteryx didinus american tourist chinese tourist haast eagle joel polack you see thats the difference between me and you i am not hiding behind my alts
yes pleaseyou people should stfu and gtfo go  and  somewhere else
totally agree no one should be allowed on caod but meokay fine everyone who agrees with me can post on caod too but only with my express permission
add goons to the list and i am a happy bunny as it is i cannot post in caod despite being the leader of an alliance since i dont want to spam my executor corp w alts  while alts created only to make problems and harass others can thats so not logical in my world
supported because i really like the thumbs up gif
add goons and i will give a thumbs up even if they are not an alt corp the goons spew out more garbage then all the others on caod combined
i kinda like them also i really dont care if theyre an alt corpgo petition something else seriously
i support this along with a general effort to exterminate alt caod posting corps in exactly the same way ccp has moved to exterminate the hop in hop out alliances that only existed to make the cost of a war dec more expensive
ive been reporting all of gss band of brothers posts as alt posts under these same rules  unless the internet can prove theyre not an alt corp i would fully support this and a swoop on alt posts in general
thisalso supporting the original post
supported as an exsmashkill grunt they were an embarassment even back then more so than my pvp skills were tbh
how dare you band of brothers is a proud and active member of goonswarm and i for one will not stand for your petitionsoh wait petitions do nothing carry on
sadly yorda is right petitions for forum violations do absolutely fcking nothing i have been petitioning the internet for weeks now
suicide their orca or wardec them as to use the corporation hanger they must be nonnpc that sort of loss done a couple of times and theyll be back to jetcans before you know itthe option is there its not 100 immunity its just not an option youre prepared to take
recently there was a thread that proposed the ability to free slaves which got turned into a proposal suggesting the same thingalso posted was another thread suggesting the ability of enslaving say tourists or something turn tourists into slavesif players are given the ability to turn slaves into freed slaves they should also be given the ability to turn say tourists into slaves  again in the name of role playing
yay slaves can we turn the innocents into exotic dancers and maybe janitors and stuff too
damsels into exotic dancers slave traders into protein delicacies
and both threads already mention turning free peoples into slaves
how about turning slaves into frozen food makes about as much sense as the other on an item that has no real use
support please try and make blasters useful on caldari ships too autocannons could do with a look at to but they dont seem to have as much trouble as blawsters at least imo
bump as it stands it is too hard and almost impossible to get a fight off a station atleast empire the risk vs reward for fighting at a station is not there fight starts going wrong you deag wait 30 seconds and redock almost no risk unless you get primaried in which case you die and the rest of your fleet docks if you choose to aggress at a station there should be longer penalties it also offer clear advantages in most cases to an agressor wt undocks party a shoots him and ohshiv local spike he deags and by the time your fleet drop out of warp he has almost waited out his timer and docks most of the stations are too hard to bump from and the second you try they just dock
i support a window feature take the time to setup a proper trap lazy sods
read my textstop station camping
solution is simple make all stations spit you out 5 km from dock range
moar tearsstop station camping and do what camp a planet not much of a chance in empire to fight any where but a station if your really lucky a whole fleet comes after you and you can force them to fight on a gate atleast there if they deag you can have a dedicated tackler or 2 who can jump threw but you cant do that at a station
if all your going to do is station camp and then throw a y fit over people who dont undock then it is you who will be crying those tearsgrow a freaking brain and use it before you start spouting offat least at the gate its a game of chance and planningi swear thats all i see these days station campers who whine and complain and what did you people expect a buffet of kills and blood cry some moar
you folks seem to be laboring under the delusion that we like being shot at of course if i undock and my whole screen goes red im going to redock thats not playing games thats called survival it falls under the heading of im not a complete moronyou see and i know this may come as a surprise to you some of us dont play eve for the pvp we could care less about your killboards or the size of your blobfleet we have better things to do than help you get your rocks off killing mining barges and industrial ships my solution to station camping is fairly simple  its called jump clones if youre going to station camp by the goddess youre going to have to camp four or five of them
while i respect you dont play for the pvp when someone declares war on you you have pvp whether you like it or not i dont play counterstrike to get shot at but it happens from time to timeundocking into a heap of reds if youre silly enough to undock a ship while there are a lot of war targets in system without having someone confirm your undock point is safe then you are silly edit and really deserve to lose your shipi support the idea of an increased redock timer 30 seconds then a minute and a half etc etc having people deaggress and then dock up when it suits them is ridiculous its almost as bad as someone deaggressing on a gate jumping then logging off while under the gatecloak to disappear 30 seconds later
honestly the point of station camping is not to get kills it is to prevent the enemy from accomplishing anything and to lock up their assets in a station station campers should not expect combat
remove localproblem solved
no  they have pvp  albeit hopelessly boring and i do hope they enjoy the view worst case i have two other character slots i can use ill just pause my training on the primary and play with one of them until the other side gets bored of staring at stations all day longthe idea to try and make people play eve the way you want to play is flawed  and frankly bullyish im not denying that you can declare war on anyone you like but dont get whiny when they wont oblige you by coming out to let you bloody up their nose
oh by all means avoid the fight if thats how you play the game i certainly dont think highly of those sort of people but respect that choicewhat i think is unnacceptable is that people are able to undock without consequence on some stations thats the issue  not people avoiding pvp if you want to stay docked up or play a different character thats your choice
lol
what are you doing showing the wt you have 50 people in system 1 place a neutral cloaked at the station 2 have people fast lockers on the other side of all the gates or the most likely route he will be heading 3 have the neutral tell you which direction gate station belt planet the guy is heading when he undocks 4 if he stays in system and does not redock at another station bring in the neutral probe guy else have the neutral cloaker sit on him again5 if he does jump out of system catch him at a gate and hold him till the rest show up6 and always remember the neutral people do not talk in localbut then i could be wrong never been in a gang of 50 before
the longer time should depend on whether you fire or get fired at however i do agree in principle to longer redocking times30 seconds is far too short especially in small gang pvp where you can decide to stop firing for 30s because you realise you might not win the fight and redock this is used to create startlingly riskfree pvpedit support in
supported if  they provide a feature for a pilot to look out the window and see who is camping the station so that they can prepare accordingly or decide to login to their alt and fight another day
this tbhnot true if you were to leave the system chances are theyd come out to play then you can get back in and gank some of them before they get safe again mindlessly sitting in front of the station and smacking them for not coming out to face your overwhelming force isnt the smartest choice of the options you have open to youor more likely it will mean they will not undock in the first placeeither way not supported because you didnt think this through before coming to the forums with it
doesnt workall i need is a couple alts and then i can freely move about under ncpc and laugh while you hold my main hostage if you think thats my main that isstation camping is a waste of timemining rock for 10 hour straight is more entertaining sarcasmhell watching paint dry is more constructivesarcasm
about the part about the targets not wanting to undock and fight because they may not be able to redock if they are losing is true on another hand most of the fights that i have seen at a station are usually 23 ships undock as bait and the rest warp in from out of system and then dock if they are losing atleast this way win or lose the winners have a chance to finish the job properly not just get one more of 8 shipsas for leaving the system and camping the gates and using alts to watch the station been tried many times people have such an intricate network of alts to ensure safety and the few that dont just ctrl q when they see us in local and escape after 30 seconds if they have a lot of hp because the fleet is spread out and has to relocate for the killi just propose that if you agress on a gate or station that you cannot dockjump for maybe one minute or just make all the stations kick out stations so you are not in dock range just like a gate sure they may not undock but its all the same when they just redock as it stands at a station fight the risk vs reward is missing risk 1 to 2 ships for the greater good of fleet but i guess this issue is only pertaining to small fleets
oops sorry fixed title thought id bring it up again needs at least an extra 100 grid really whos with meand if the reason you never fixed the nighthawks powergrid was anything to do with the possibility of fitting some stupid passive tank and a full rack of assault launchers despite needing another 300 grid or something for that the wellshould actually bother to balance passive shield tanking while youre at it hint  change the attributes  penalties to shield power relays
i dont fly nighthawks but i did spend time calculating good setups what i found was that if you dont bother fitting gang mod then everything fits ok  may need a couple power diags but thats fine for a shield tanker but theres no way to have a decent fit and 200 extra grid for gang modfitting cloak is probably much more useful than gang mod anyway
yes you do need to sacrifice dps and tank for gang mods the nighthawk can be used as either a superdrake or a good gangboosteredit not supported

just as long as we remove bounties from lowsec because concord isnt there either
come up with an alternative for combat pilots to make money first otherwise it does have some merit given ratting is so boring
interesting idea but unlikely to happen due to the whine factor too many bears out in 00 rely on bounties for income rather than being paid by their corp for protecting miners from pcnpc piratesyou might as well say remove all belts and l4 missions from hisec people whine too much when the nipple is removedps the concord not in nullsec argument is invalid a police force would pay a bounty for osama for example wherever hes assassinatedas an alternative make the npcs drop dogtags that then have to be sold in concord stations in order to get the bounty edit and sec increase
very true i must say so support
this
ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
you disappoint me and i voted for you so you represent me please rethink your approach
your posting is p bad and i keep running into it so it bothers me please rethink your approach
the devblog with the final report about the pos exploit has raised several questions in my mind whether the logs as they currently work are enough to detect and track exploitsnaturally i dont have any special insight on how the logs work but i believe there has been some clues in this and other devblogs as well as in other forum postsjudging from the number of i sold something to someone who had gotten some money from someone who had bought it for real money and now my wallet is deep in the red whaaa whaaa posts the tracking of isk is very effective its a safe bet that all transfers of isk is logged and recordedbut isk is not the only thing that has value goods also have value even if it is less liquid a revealing quote in the devblog linked above is not counting contracts or direct trade why not might it be that it isnt logged that is a possible security hole right thereand while the volume of trade in different goods obviously is logged and recorded are the actual transactions saved so you can track buyers and sellers afterwardshere are a number of different scenarios that i whipped up while writing this post if the current logging doesnt allow these types of interchanges to be logged recorded and tracked after they have occured the logging must be improvedalice  filthy rmt sellerbrent  rmt buyercharlie  innocent third partyin all cases the objective of alice and brent is to transfer ingame value from alice to brent in exchange for real money transferred from brent to alice in the real world1 alice buys random goods from charlie uses instationtrade to give it to brent in exchange for 0 isk2 alice buys something for which there is no current buyorders places it on market for 1 isk coordinates via msnwhatever so that brent immediately refreshes his market and buys it3 brent sets up a scamcontract alice knowingly accept it4 alice buys random highvalue goods from charlie goes to a predetermined spot and jettisons it in a can brent comes along and picks it up5 alice buys random highvalue goods and an itty v from charlie meets brent out in space and allow brent to blow up the itty v brent loots the wreck6 as in 5 but it isnt brent that shoots the itty v it is alice that aggs an npc brent still loots her wreck
they do track direct trade and contracts but its not a simple task to get the information about what was tradedcontracted into a readable format for such a large scale search for small scale things or when they ar elooking for something specific they can find it
needs more support 
if only there was a warp wingsquad to x km option where my wingsquad commander could gang warp me in to the right location owaibut in general yes i like the idea of some tactical formations and ultimately tactical manoeuvers having an advantage over a big static blob the tools to do the tactical manoeuvers are already there but dont have any benefit to doing them and are too fiddly in the heat of combat even if you wanted to look spiffy to the few opposition players with brackets on
spended to long time to lvl 5 black ops with 2ndary skills but now i m really dissapointed about how useless and expensive they are give them life so it worth to buyflylose them
i propose that any thread that gets put in the index here or the common ideas thread in features and ideas is left unlocked so ppl can comment rather than start another duplicate thread currently most of the links in the index and common ideas are locked due to being over 90 days old either they need to be unlocked or someone needs to remove them from the index
the details might be problematic but the principle is solid
i will support removal of all these dirt short missions as storyline missionsthe term storyline actually indicates that there should be some kind of story to these missions but in these single part missions there is not i would expect and wish for all storyline missions to have two parts or moreas you only get one every 16th regular mission you will not burn through the mission pool that fasti am often quite puzzled why regular missions in eve are so similar and simple made on level 3 and 4 agents comparing to the variety you will encounter during cosmos and tutorial missions
my observation is that i get this mission as a result of doing a large percentage of rd agent missions  a similarly trivial mission to complete btw and i have rarely gotten the materials for war storyline missions when my focus has been on combatbased missions
first i do not mind that empire faction ships carry no bounty but tags instead but the faction losses for destroying empire faction ships are very inconsistent and often unreasonable compare to faction losses against pirate factionssome times you get no loss for destroying a particular empire faction ship and in other cases you get huge losses for destroying a single frigatefaction standings need a long needed overhaul also to get rid of the black holes
hate to break it to you but that would be all of themconsidering the amount of petty jobs that need doing and the clear shortage of manpower its obvious that theyll offer jobs to anyone in terms of roleplay there is no good reason i should be allowed docking rights on any minmatar station right now yet i am however only an idiot would offer a job to go and kill amarr if said person is in the amarr militia has high standings with the amarr and is flying an amarr ship and expect them to accept itso what were really saying is that agents are idiotsi dont see why people are getting so focused on the 4 hour timer thats not the actual problem its ending up with lots of missions you cant cancel for 4 hours or a standing hit you can keep the timer and improve the mission allocation system without making it a zero risk isk machine people have already stated ways it might be done just nobody is willing to listen theyd rather fill in their own blanks
one thing that bothers me about the skill system is that there are skills that have little to no real effect or that just seem to serve as time delays while at the same time they should do something or more based on their descriptionfor example there is this nice corporation management skill called ethnic relations what it does is that it allows my corporations to have 20 members of other races than my own per level that is nothing but a time delay there is no advantage whatsoever from this not really yet that is not the point now obviously when i got this skill i am more capable to deal with other races right shouldnt that have any secondary effects for me like a small increase in standing with other factions or a small modifier to how fast i gain standing with themmany of the social skills could also easily qualify for secondary qualities when i got labor connections why doesnt it save me at least a tiny bit of money when i install production jobs after all i got connections right why doesnt fast talk diplomacy negotiation or bureaucratic connections help with customs fines a bitmy thought is that while such minute secondary effects would be meaningless for many it would give a little bonus to those tho skill a wider spectrum especially since the corporate trade and social skills are neglected by so many players i am not talking about 510 boni anyway just a 051 boost here and there for training skills that most players dont ever train anywayof course this could be applied to some other skills too giving a bonus to ship repair cost if the character has racial starship engineering warping a tick closer to stargates on autopilot for every skill level in astrometrics a tiny reduction in heat damage for overheating thrust systems for skill levels in rocket sciencesomething that rewards diverse characters a bit more in a system currently overfocussed on specialization and limit exploitation
the problem is that things get diffuse and hard to balance that way as well as making things hard for players to sort out and its not like the skill system is simple asis some of your ideas are interesting but it feels like players will either regard it as trivia or as another year of skills they have to max out to make their ship work at its best neither of those is really desirable
if the premise behind your complaint is that most skills are nothing but a time delay then the same thing can be said for all skillsi do concur that there are some weak skills while others are stronger but the whole skill system is based on a time delay
just think of some kind of reimbursement imo its just too broken to keep in game let them keep it but have it expire so they can get as much use out of it as possible give them a stack of 50 equivalent bpcs give them raw isk obviously you cant replace the infinite potential value of the bpo but thats the inherent problem isnt itmy main argument is that owning a t2 bpo is like holding a patent that never expires if they decide not to sell it the rest of the population will never match their profit margin i have no problem with older players having an advantage so long as it is not permanentas far as the rest of the population ignoring their complaints i could not agree more with your analysis im sure most of the player base would be happy if an elite few who have been grandfathered into the system had their advantage taken away to make the game mechanics more fair and accessible to all subscribers
wow the best part of that post is that you found dictionarycom claps happilyyup i guess after quite a few whews and a lot of squirming you do eventually seem to get around to answering things though you didnt answer why she would pay to move the freighter when the alliance was willing to help with itim sorry i poked fun at you for bloating up your modest embarrassing beefs with unimportant context and prodded you a little about your comment about how i couldnt possssssibly understand what youre talking about which im sure you meant in the very nicest possible way context is great and all when youre writing a novel but really understanding your beef is entirely possible without all the nuggets of contextim glad thats overwell mebbie issler wasnt at the very top of your festering beef revenge list but shes the only person i saw mentioned by name so she must have been in the singledigits at least if this kind of effort goes into a diabolical revenge plan to settle a few ancient embarrassments well i already feel bad for the next poor sap at the jita burger flythru to forget your onion ringsim sorry im having a tough time swallowing that youd go to this kind of trouble over a few old embarrassments its like trying to eat brussels sproutsa historical fact and your opinion are not the same thing as for the personal insults i guess i just overreacted to all this stuff discounting my posts as delusional ramblings it really shows your gross misunderstanding of eve your hatred for bruce has blinded you teebee was a spy and a head your failure to understand most likely stems from a gross lack of exposure to game mechanics issler never grasped that concept help coddle members like yourself i wanted to start my post with that since you always seem to do that and i thought it might help me understand your lack of understanding it didnt the pointy end of the gun goes towards these people just fyiim sure you meant all that in the very nicest possible way im sorry for the misunderstandingokay wherever it is you live it seems youre very concerned about something issler said about a 00 proposal i dont think shes ever said anything about things being handed to all the coddled industrialists which im sure you meant in the very nicest possible way without workwhy are you so certain shes out to remove eves challenges i know its asking quite a bit but maybe you could clarify just what part of the csm meeting really upset your apple cart something beyond just calling it dumb i mean which im sure you meant in the very nicest possible waydictionaries are good
the idea that somehow by changing your name would mean that suddenly you would be untrackable is crazy as i mentioned earlier your identified in the db by a number not your name theres no reason that suddenly you would be removed from everyones addressbook or any other changes would suddenly occuryour characters former names would not be reusable by other players either you would still be searchable via that old name the only places the old name would appear would be in your profile under previous names and when you search by that specific name your still plenty findable
you are still missing the point probably for a reason of argumentative motivationccp can find anyone anything anywhere anytime in the database thats rather obvious the focal point here is not ccp however its about the capability of players to identify and track identities within the game environment using in game methods and tools players who through some strange mishap do not have access to the database twisted isnt itjust look at what you said for a moment and really think about it now think againtheres no reason that suddenly you would be removed from everyones addressbook or any other changes would suddenly occurchanges would occur they would have to since ccp always focuses on in game mechanisms and methods you are hinting at tracking people by means of out of game methods the character id number that however is not a mechanism available within the game environment to the players only to ccp ergo they would have to look for other methods ccp has those at their disposal players do notso for it even to be considered you would need an in game mechanism which allowed players to backtrack on identities think of something like a really clever search agent but one available to anyone and everywhere sans charges as the parallel toolset of show info also is rather simple and straight up available to everyone
yeah the only people that can be reliably trusted are corp members as they have actual penalties for betrayal kicked from corpset collateral at 120 market value of your items and pay decent money to get your stuff moved freight service is expensive if you want it dont ask for a cheap npc alternative
great idea
yes
yes please
i support this idea i feel that this idea should be implemented with a feature so that you can see all of the characters names since he has been playing the game i feel that this name change should reflect to a degree how difficult it can be to legitimately change your name in real life in the uk you need to be known by a name for a period of no less than 2 years this wouldnt be practical in eve so a name change should be no more frequent than once every 6 monthshere is a feature that might bring more interaction to eve rather than being able to see all of the characters names the show info for a given character may only show the last name used before the character changed his name a level 4 agent could be asked to find all aliases known for a character name the agent could also use an old alias in a search find the current character name i feel this would be a good feature and would prevent scammers from becoming completely anonymous we should take care to note that scammers particularly contract scammers use expendable alts which are scammers main method of hiding his identity
im sorry i cant support this just because there are currently methods for thieves scammers and spies to circumvent the name problem buy new characters and the fact that there are other mechanics that are currently being used unintentionally does not mean we should implement more ways to do itits simply a poor argument sorry 
supportedif i could id run a non combat high sec mining capital too
i agree  it would be nice to have at least one titan in hisec so new players can see just how awesome these ships are without having to worry about whether their medical clone is up to date
this would be massively cool and give new players something to look up to the titan in luminaire is an npc object no big deal people who play lots of space games are used to big npc ships having a player titan in highsec would be incredibly awesome because its a representation of how much you can advance if youre massively successful
no to stop the innane argument for tourists as far as i know there is already a titan in highsec npc but still a titan unless chribba is an npc he should not be given preferential treatment
veld for the veld god i would fly to amarr just for this lol
as hidden fan of roleplaying i support this
i would only support this if the ship was taken away from the player and made part of the game and not part of a player account
oh why not p
i give your support to the ideadiscussion going onedit my support even
of course
he cant use the dd in high sec so why the heck not let him have a titan in amarr i support this will all my front and back sides
signedmissile were allready the weekest offensive weapon  they didnt need nerfing
they changed the missile damage formula apparently and since i dont know what it is im neutral to this thread nowrunning the old one with the new numbers though i was getting figures like 00006 dps for a raven on some targets which is a rounding error turrets start missing to the point they are missing all the time too but it doesnt happen at any range missiles do a rounding error all the time turrets do it if traversal is highinterceptors get a mwd sig radius penalty bonus now thats also part of the reason for the huge drop but it dropped a lot for just about everything i tried since the explosion velocity of missiles are tiny nowonce we know the new ways in which tracking and explosion velocity is calculated if someone knows please point me to it itll be hard to say from what ive heard from people their missiles have gotten weakerone thing that does stand out is that battleships are able to outrun heavy missile explosions now a different formula will only affect by how much they can outrun them a medium pulse laser should not have terrible trouble with tracking against a battleship
guysas i have posted beforeplease just stop whiningccp have acknowledged your concerns and promised to deliver a review of capitals dont hold your breath on any change as ccp simply dont care they would have ensured something was done this coming patch if they didthe naglfar is the worst dread by an order of magnitude you know it they know it but ccps lack of attention to rectification is a willfull conscious decision it is not a function of prioritsation as capital changes have been mooted months ago it is a deliberate game management decisionnothing you do or say will change it no matter how right you are no matter how valid your suggestions ccp are incapable of admitting error and reacting quickly that is the irrefutable conclusion to be drawn from past minnie ship rebalancesccp have openly stated they want noobs and not vets and capitals are a vets toy at 50k members they are focussing on the bottom line and things that affect just a small portion of the player base such as minnie ships are ignored because not many pilots fly them simply cross train into amarr they are now the fotm ably supported by massive changes in their favour its the only solution to poor game design and ccps arrogance in the lack of attention given to this shipyou know it makes sense
this is your opinion just because minmatar doesnt fit into your cookie cutter setup doesnt mean it is useless if you dont like the ship train for another race that is more your style this is not necessarily a matter of what race is better but obviously more one of different from your playstylethat being said yes the naglfar sucks how about get creative and put a triple trimark with 1x damage mod and 1x captial armor rep then you can put all the fukken sensor boosters you want you are going to get outdamaged with 4x damage mods any way so stop trying
i agreewhile i hold no personal stake or ties to kenzoku formerly band of brothers in of itself the principle that 1 director from 1 corp can disband an entire alliance containing whichever amount of corpspeople at the whim of 1 instant button push is a bit sillyyou may argue one way or the other about treating your highranked officers properly so that such a thing doesnt occur but really thats not the point it really is completely irrelevant whether or not you genuinely mistreated a director in a corporation they still shouldnt be able to have such a massive impact on an alliance structure like thatit also doesnt matter that this has happened before this is the first time it has been really highlighted because it was such a massive event so the fact that it didnt happen before is irrelevantthe point is that it shouldnt be possible and now a lot of people myself included know that its possiblei will repeat for the sake of marking it down it does not matter what happened who did what to who who said what nor what happened beforehand the point is that it should be changed because it really is terribly silly that 1 person can without votes disband an entire alliance regardless of what the other directors want what the other corporations want ceos shareholders and so forth wantthis has nothing to do with picking sides between goons and kenzoku this is about a game mechanic that affects everyone and i genuinely hope people will treat it as such
not a single person from the affected alliance has supported this thread so even they think it was alright you really dont have to worry about your noname alliance being the victim of this even if you post your account information here
the fact it is even possible is horrible imagine it happenes to your own alliance s
obviously you didnt read my post this has nothing to do with kenzoku nor goonswarm  this has to do with the game mechanic that makes it possible in the first place to disband an alliance at the click of a buttonthis has nothing to do with how famous your alliance is or how special you think your own personal alliance is i know youre an alt character from one of these alliances or at least support one of them and thats fine but honestly i have little to no use of what your alliance thinks or feels about this this is about the actual mechanic simple as that
i would also like to agree with the banning of bob posts now they are an alt corpalso would like a stronger stance taken against people starting new threads in coad to tell us about the dump they took today its not just goons bob and the internet but it mainly isi would place a bet that the last couple of weeks have seen record level of reports of posts in coad the forums are one place potential players can come and see whether they would like to play and what sort of online community the game supports any of them stumbling in to coad would be rather disapointed its a shame because the alliance system is a very interesting dynamic system overlaying this persistent world which is being currently championed by barely literate wits gloating through multiple threads a day
i support this not necessarily as something that has to be enforced but more like a plead to the caod people  all i see there are 2 things1 the internet trolling full force2 goons talking to themselvestrollingof course theyre entitled to say whatever they want but its getting needlessly silly i dont mean this in a tongueincheek fashion or for that matter in a provocative sense i genuinely think it needs to be toned down a bit
fix caod pls
i would also like to see a zero tolerance policy enforced by ccp on caodcaod has always been messy but not so much as it has got in the last couple of years its time for the ban stick to come out and issued to all the moderatorsextreme trolling in caod requires extreme measuresalsocsm members who post and trollflame and are non constructive im not saying any are btw should have their posting privileges removed as they are in the public eye and should set a example to others
go away
as much as i respect your opinion efrim black  i have to politely refuse your requesti shall not go away until caod has been cleared somewhat of irresponsible posters thankyouas my suggestions are to be fair only suggestions call it a work in progress if you will to work towards a caod that is used responsibly b forum bans issued for repeat abusers c basically make caod what it is intended for rather than the trolling flamefest it has become
they can use the corporate hangar on the orca even in npc corporations same as any ship equipped with onea npc corp pilot can not pull out of the ship unless they are the pilot of the ship thoughbut the hangar can be used to drop items into the orca for the pilot to move around
yeah the only thing related to corp hangars in an npc corp is the station based ones the tabs and ship hangars are still accessiblebesides to get the benefit of the orca they have to really train the leadership skills yep really hurts the achura minmax crowdnot to mention the effort even if its rl work to earn enough to sell the gtcs to afford the orca and implants
so let me get this straight  youre claiming that mining into an orca is 100 safe yet you have orcahulk fleets on your confirmed kill list
but but he said they dont use a kill board anymore
no apparently they use a confirmed kill list which is not a kill board
my my what bunch of nice replies showing exactly what i figured would happen people who either dont understand the situation somehow think that because its not their preferred playstyle it therefore has no merit or are frantically trying to defend their advantage which is ok ofcourse although the fact that theres no debate but rather crap posting says enoughthe reason we dont have a kb anymore is because we cant be bothered with the oooh we destroyed x miloneeleventy we kill a target and it shows up on the corp confirmed list you know the one in your corporation window hence the confirmed kills name as thats how its namedmost of you are incapable or unwilling to actually debate the real issue the fact that being able to directly move goods into an orca from another ship in this case a miner isnt exactly in eves spirit as its a 100 safe operation while at the same time benefitting from the orca itself oh well ill keep voicing my opinion on this who knows what good it will do
shoves a baby pacifier into ops mouthget a backbone go to 00 and go pirate therestop your cryinits not a matter of people who didnt understand or didnt read its you refusing to use your stupid braindont blame us for your short comingsand i have it on good authority that its not 100 safe i know people who hunt orcas in high sec
again op get smart about your targets plenty of orcas out there with no fittings to assist in the event of attack given you precious seconds of suicide time if they are in npc corps
yeah i mean they cant be suicidedthen there are those juicy traders in jita just waiting for you to shoot themthere is no 100 safe there are options you choose not to useget it right opyou are whinging because your style of operation got harder even though the number of orcas to miners isnt 1 to 1 or even close to being every miner dumping into an orcayou have targets out there you just got to work harder to find themthey adapt of course and youll start seeing more gscs used for storage or just transfer rendering flips impossibleor the ever fun hulk cargo runs
funny i seehear more homophobic jokes and statements from homosexuals than i do from other groups its like the whole if you are black you can make black jokes up to and including the n word and for the most part its tolerated but if you are any other ethnicity you would be labeled racisti dont approve of double standards in that line its more than just a bit hypocritical since most of the jokes you hear about any minority originated from said minority you would not believe some of the really sick stuff ive heardi dont in general approve of the lifestyle choices made by gays i dont try to beat them over the head with my disapproval either
water off a ducks back is all i got to say its not like the words someone writes in their bio or has a description of a corpalliance are going to jump through a computer screen and kick your ass nine ways from sundaythey are just words get over it and move on youll avoid being butt hurt down the road
this has to be a troll postit really does if the op was any sort of serious theyd try to defend their views and participate in this thread so far i only see 2 posts
hey got go play wow no ones about you or this thread
signedblasters need more rangetracking or the need big dps buff
 this
agreed blasters could use a bit of love
this is a pretty good ideaedit just realised its a corp mate too id better start logging in again
station camping is for people who dont wanna get any killsthe game would be stupid if you lost ships just by pressing undock before you have a chance to playso not signed its completelly not signedcamp a gate or use out of corp scouts to set up ambushes if you want kills
if this gets approved  then we should be able to peek out the airlock window and see what is outside before undocking
stations should spit ships out at random locations around the station not a single exitthen you can do whatever the hell you want station camping wisebecause at that rate youd need a pretty large fricken fleetand large fleets mean dedicated resources at one locationand one location means people can slip past at other locations etcetcetc
im not sure if this is going to be in with the expansion but i think it should be i went ahead and got a new video card just to play with premium but jagged lines make my minmatar ships look like bad paper cutouts so i found this thread
id hit that
yessssno jaggiesi want to see the gleam of my duct tapped maelstrom
absolutely the current sovereignty system is so horridly flawed it ought to be erased from the history books of eve ive heard ccp devs state they intend to eventually do something about it but the csm ought to let them know it needs to be a priority a top priority
feudal system should be an optionas well asdictatorshipdemocracyinsert any political structure hereetc
this
yikes i remember when veto corp used to be good at pvp instead of posting really noobish and awful roleplaying whines with very little knowledge of what game mechanics areif this isnt a troll which i hope it is then this is pretty sad
concord is the agency set up by all the main empires so when in any empire space you should get bountiessec hits but when outside of their space you should noteven if the no bounties in 00 is not a good idea i can hear the 00 npcers saying yes to that the sec hits should not exist as you do not get hits for killing ships that are flown by a pod pilot but you do for killing ships that have a full crew this does not make any sense
get the fck out now got
were you actually crying when you wrote this post
i hope you all die ingame
i beleive that it isnt possible to establish common deadline for every point agreed by csm due to balance recalculations programming timings etcbut what should be definitely done  that there should be some kind of table with issues approved for development sorted by importancyprioritypeople spend lot of their time in game developed by respective ccp it would be honest to show ccps respect to players helping to improve the game at least by some marks that their opinion wasnt just a flood at the assembly hallanyway i support that as an option of visual feedback from ccp to players
it gives the csm too much powerccp is best are making the right decisions seeing as they are a business and theres certain thing which the csm should have no influence on the csm is there to broaden ccps perspective and give a second opinion it works well
ill post my opinion below whether you consider it constructive or notccp never needed to give us a csm in the first place nor listen to any of their suggestions to impose deadlines on them would only put pressure on what should be creative processes id rather they took a year fixing something right then six months pumping out something to please the communityi agree with vista too much power for the csm
agreed efrim has a valid point hereyou people need to stop forcing the issue to your ideas and start working together for constructive ideas and proposalsccp can do whatever the hell they want in all reality start thinking like that and youll find it easier to deal with setbacksdont like it then leave more stuff for the rest of usharsh yes but its reality and reality is much needed hereso a bigfatloud not supported from me
srslydie ingame ofc
not supported the most popular ideas are not always the best i would prefer that eve development is not diluted by any rules that force ccp to adopt an idea just because some group of players wants it to happen the csm should continue to funnel our feedback to ccp they should continue to champion ideas that they believe have merit ccp should continue to impliment or not impliment those ideas as they see fit theres been a vision behind the development of this game that should not be watered down
no sec rat farminggets caught by hictor w bubbletoo stupid to fit a cloak watch local or think about how pvp worksattempts to get hictors nerfedfails oh so hardrinserepeat
while your proposal is 100 ed  one thing you may want to pursue is a scan res penalty to be associated with having a bubble up basically will make a hic have a friend there for webbingother than that your proposal stinks of elderberries
and we fart in your general direction
yeah this will work great then we can see people pvping with warp core stabs that will be greatgreat
im quite amused that a sin appears less capable than a dominix the flavour text talks about it being a capable drone platform yet the sin has lower hp lower targetting range and less power grid than the dominix but it has an extra mid slot so you can fit a sensor booster to reclaim the lost targetting range and 25m3 more drone bay so you can carry 1 spare sentry drone for all the sacrifices you can fit a covert ops cloaking device and get a higher agility so you can do a 180 and enter warp half a second faster i dont imagine that ill be trying to cloak my way through a bubbled gatecamp in a battleship any time soon though 
covert cynos should work in cynojammed systemsblack ops battleships recons covert ops and the other ships that can use the covert jump bridge are either too expensive or too weak to take down a cyno jammer even in numbers this means that their strategic value isnt all that high this ability isnt going to make them replace a large battleship fleet as the premier way to begin assaults on sov3 systemswhat this does mean is that the purpose of inserting a small team of cloaking ships into a secure enemy system is to infiltrate behind enemy lines and just cause chaos and disruptionthis is both a awesome and b actually what the black ops was intended to do this combined with the range boost and the fuel bay would give black ops a niche without making it stupid overpowered
i think that once wspace comes up that blackops may get a boost since it was confirmed on a ccp panel during fanfest that cynoing in ships is intended of course they are still horribly broken but with the creation wspace looming we can presume that blobs will be unlikely an that smaller gang pvp can become more common with this in mind why not gear the black ops ship to be more in line with the new wspace theme perhaps tweaking them to be design by various empires to explore wspacejust a thought still please fix them p
i agree generally but finding someone with the time to do that is a problem look at what happened to the ah list of issues  it started well i yelled into a void for a month and then its barely been touched in the last 8 if someone wants to go through and clean it up id be all for it but given that it either has to be a gm or the op its not easy to find such a person
no this forum needs two features 1 an actual search engine for boards2 a thumbs down feature to antibump threads and drive them down the list this way only heavily supported ideas stay on the front pagethis would allow people to find out if their idea has been tried and also the opinion of the community on the subject
i agree its lamethe defender shouldnt have to step outside his fortress to fireallow pos defenders to lock and shoot out through forcefield without need for force field dancing
escalated
well with not just one but three csm members showing support i believe that qualifies it as can be brought to ccps attention in 7 days no 
good idea
i have a level 4 internal security agent in the same station as a storyline agent i run missions day in day out then the storyline agent gives me materials for war preparation im running missions to get faction standings and i keep getting the materials for war preparation mission which gives me piddling little standings boostsits getting to the point where i have to think hard in order to separate storyline agent and materials for war preparation as different concepts in my mind as soon as i see the storyline agent appear in my mailbox im already looking for kernite on the market before ive stopped to check what the mission waiting for me in the journal actually is
signedthis mission is an utter joke and though i have profitted off this its quite ridiculous
to andrea griffin and kahega amieldengas missions  yeah i dont accept them any more and have you tried to use 2 harvesters i do have more than it trained to rank 2 and i am told that i may not use more than one harvester per cloud mining missions at down time  there is no point starting them not because of ore disappearing quite the opposite the asteroids and the mission counters reset you still have the ore you mined prior to down time but it will not be considered the needed items it is quite pointless to start a mining mission prior to down time unless you know you can finish ityes i do read the mission logs and some of them are really the opposite of what i would like to reply to my agent talk about bad luck 4 l4 mining agents all giving kill missions i just as ankh had to figure out something other than missioning to do i think i priced a few items on the market for sale and logged i agree its not so much 4 hours but the ability to have something to do vs being locked out agent ai would be a step in the right direction
id really like it if my mining agent didnt give me level 4 kill missions like vengeance im here in my hulk to turn rocks into money while drinking copious quantities of alcoholid also like it if my internal security agent didnt give me trivial courier missions  they have plenty of rookies in frigates who can run those important reports over to the next station im here in my battleship to blow stuff upi dont think we should have some soft option for evading missions against enemy factions if youre working for a minmatar agent why wouldnt you go out and blow up amarr scum well unless youre in an industrial corp who already has business in amarr territory and is looking to establish a pos in other empire space to be closer to different markets i guess which is probably one of the reasons were running missions instead of mining and building stuff
its already a zerorisk isk machine
only problem i really see with this is that newer players may not realise what is happening when the accept a mission vs another faction the game should be very clear about what happens when you blow up another factions ships before you accept the mission like i said more for newer players so they will be able to make an informed decision as to accept or decline a faction missionif this is allready in game then their is really no problem with the current system
wont this whole issue be addressed with the new mission arcs
t2 out of game i disagree with1 wing it so that t3 bpos require more data cores to save the passive income2 allow invention to continue working as is and add in the t3s to the mix3 lastly introduce t2 to market gasp we can theory craft this and that to no end but my spin is1 no real losspay days may take longer though2 t3s will become the new t2s obviously3 set the price to the typical multiplier roughly 10x for the t2 bpo pricey to say the leastmaking invention still worthwhile and making it a challange for smaller corpsplayers to obtainjust not impossible and wo ruining the edge of megacorps and vetsjust as an example t1 bpo for say a bs is say 1 million isk not literally then the bpc are usually around 10k then so price a t2 bpc and multiply by 10 as a suggestion for bpo
noand no i do not have one nor off hand does anyone i know in the game have onethe reality is that the developers have been removing t2 bpos alreadyanyone whith t2 bpos that gets hit by the banhammer thoes bpos go away and quite frankly when a person with datacore alts can make enough every 30 days to pay for a plex i dont realy see it as something that needs to be fixedthe reality is that if they did take them out people would just ring up a few more dcore altsmains for a bitheck i could add in level 23 rd agents on my mission runner now all i would have to do is train the rd skills instead of bs skills which has me wondering why i did not do that to start with lolinc skillplan update
i did read the full minutes from which i pulled the original quotes i didnt see many suggestions from you besides those and some stuff about colonies yes you noticed that the ui sucks and mentioned that although everybody knows that and its not as bad as it used to be i still dont understand how any of those suggestions are going to help anything whether sov is based on poss or ferrying people or goods from a colony it still wont matter if your opponents are station camping you id rather fuel a pos a couple times a month to hold sov than play age of evepires and move stuff around from coloniesunfortunately due to having a family and a time intensive job i cant do so but this conversation did spark some interest in thatwelcome to eve where slamming people on the forums war deccing their alliance and interfering with their tournament team are all fair play that is exactly the point im trying to get across these are things that dont need to be changed about eve when pl hacked our forums and vent and went about dismantling bruce i was pretty ed but in hindsight we left ourselves open for it so i cant be that ed
youre asking the wrong person we were wondering the same thing at the time your posts read like delusional ramblings thats just my interpretation as far as i can tell you do grossly misunderstand eve im open to suggestions about what it was that actually caused the blinding then no apology teebee was an ass again im open to suggestions on how the person referred to here came to misunderstand things issler still doesnt grasp that concept see the post above what exactly does she do then seriously the whew was offensive ok i take it back then you were the one who said you didnt know what those things were so i took some creative licenseif i have to explain why more carebears in 00 and custom paint jobs are dumb then chances are that the explanation would be lost on you
so am i to understand youve just admitted this entire thread is simply an effort at metagaming griefer tactics

there are lots of tourist attractions in eve such as the titan in luminaire the damaged station in malkalen the graveyard in korazor etc there are abandoned stations at planets in several systems at several gates and there are asteroid fields and ruins in weird places all over the placethere are beacons and markers on the map such as the myridian strip that you can visit as well but part of the problem is that even when you arrive they are spectacularly boring i went there the other day and it was two stations with classic graphics and some cloudswhoo lots of interesting but boring things in eve im sure something could be done about this
definitely support this much needed as station containers dont allow the freedom of the hangar and utilization of the new apocrypha asset sorting
please
while i feel that being terrified of scammers is a poor argument against this issue as is popularly said if you cant afford to lose it dont fly it if you cant afford to have it stolen dont allow someone else access to it
do this and you just fueled the macro miners and then the market for megacyte will drop so low it will kill all the real miners that are risking their butts in 00 to make moneyi do believe that the system needs an overhaul but not thisi am a miner in 00 flying orca and a max hulk miner with michi implant dont tell me im not risking it

amazingly enough i was taking the best possible fit for the naglfar in comparison with the others yes you can armor tank it and you dont need fitting mods but then you get literally half the damage of every other dread while having a weaker tank thats more cap stable i know the appeal of doing the damage of a blaster mega while tanking as much as a chimera might appeal to you but for 16 billion isk id rather actually get something out of my dread
please just stop readingthe only way we as a player base can display that we do care about this issue and consider it to be of high priority is to state suchif you dont agree  fine but telling us that you agree yet we need to shut up because nothing has been done yet is simply idiotic feel free to avoid this thread if you think it is such a waste of time

obviously you didnt read my post there is no problem with this mechanic
id have to agree here maybe not with the justification even though it is a bit valid largest alliance in the game gets this used on em and doesnt complain about it i dont think anyone else has a right to do so eitherbut yeah executor corp works exactly like ceo of a standard corporation ultimate authority no wait period to remove members unless they have roles
whatfirst of all it was a director that did it not a ceosecondly i dont give a pair of flying dingos kidneys that some random big alliance didnt complain about it it has absolutely no bearing on what i think what i think is that its a broken mechanic that id like to see changedthird of all you may not think the mechanic is broken but i do
okay  im gonna give this a thumbs up  not so much because of the initial issue raised  but i would like to give kudosprops to the gms to take action when a line is crossed in conversation between two people trashtalking in local is well behind the line but situations do arise where threats going beyond what could be called roleplaying enter real world peoples lives and these should not be tolerated by anyone anyone recall ginger magician
maybe raise the damage modifier boost on gallente ships so that the output dps of the right size blaster turret is much higheralso why would you want the caldari to be good at using blasters blasters and drones make the gallente ships special to fly if the caldari need boosting why not something else specific to themps on the three turret types to put it simply do you mean blasters melt stuff both close and webbed autocannons have trouble missing things theyre supposed to miss and that pulse lasers tend to hit things at range but can be outtracked easily thatd make sense to me
a very simple thing that will allow bombs to be used skillfully is to allow bombs to hit ships when they explode that are in range of the explosion and out of warp but which were not there when the bomb was launched ive noticed this mechanism in testing and if it was fixed to what i propose bombs will finally have a decent place in eve i promiseit only makes sense that a ship gets hit from a bomb that explodes right next to it what difference should it make if it wasnt there when it was launchededit i would also like to know if this is a bug or it was intended this way
yes yes yes
definitely a step in the right direction towards fixing bombs
like this idea a lot it makes sense to have multiple undockdocking ports as a single one may just be too congested add some kick out too it say 34km that way if you do have some tacklers around you have a chance to get the target as to station camping is not for getting kills i beg to differ in our current campaign every single fight has been at a station we have tried in our small fleets engaging enemy small fleets and they ctrl q as soon as they see us in system because they do not have the safety of the station deag its actually rediculous yesterday a lone i think i counted 13 logoffskis

with 24 hours as a cooldown between jump clones its inevitable that there will be a drift in the time day to day and some players like me may well have reason to want to swap between areas on a more regular basiswith that in mind i propose the followingskill name  neural pathway strengtheningdifficulty 5attribute with each level of skill cooldown time between jump clones is reduced 10

problem overview for anyone living under a rockplayer corp standing with an npc corpfaction is the average of all activeaccount toons with nonzero standings to that npc entity this leads to the absurd situation where a toon with low positive standing eg 10 to an npc corpfaction is much worse for a player corporation than a toon with no standing at allhighsec pos anchoring is well known for the corp management shenanigans it requires encouraging alt corps and quitrejoin nonsense to manage standingssolutionallow resetting any positive standing a toon has with an npc entity so that it no longer contributes to the player corp average to reset a toons negative standing it would have to be raised above zero through other mechanics and then resetthe interface to do this already exists for player standings theres a rightclick option to reset playerplayercorpalliance standings that same reset option could simply be added to the rclick menu for positive npc standingsi cant imagine any potential for hax because this is a very narrow solution that only allows reducing a toons personal standings for the good of its corp it does not help individual toons at all it does not address the stuck negative faction standings problem which is more complicated and still needs fixingreal player corps with mains could more realistically deploy highsec poses and maintain jc standing with npc corps since players with positive standings that are bringing down the average and no desire to run more missions could simply reset those standingsreducing the amount of unwanted positive npc standings cluttering the database also seems like an opportunity to improve performance
uh im sorry but im having trouble understanding how a positive standing would affect anyone negativelythe whole point of a positive standing is that its a positive standingits the negative ones or a shortfall that cause troubleswhile i get your implied issue i think you got it completely reversedmy biggest issue is how bloody freaking hard it is to get standings up for an empire factionits getting to the point now where ill have to kick everyone out of my corp for a week drop a pos then let them back inbecause my personal standings are far higher than anyone elseperhaps you should restate the issue again and then propose your solution
mistake in testing

eve governments are more efficient at collecting taxes than sol governmentsits better the way it is otherwise the market would be full of orders for trit at 2b isk a unitno no not supported
perfect reasoning anot supported
take a step back and saysales taxone more timesales taxgo get a dictionary no not wikipedia you idiot a dictionarylook up the definition of sale and taxfollowing me hereyeah im starting to see the spark of knowledge in you thats the ticketin case your brain imploded sales tax is the taxation of any sale you make a sale you pay taxit doesnt matter how businesss pay that tax when its all said and doneso your argument is just flat ridiculous and even then your throwing a fit over what pennies on the iskseriously get a life man take a break go take a long walk outside and get a breather
businesses are required to charge sales tax on every sale they make  in the real world they calculate that tax at the time of the sale collect it from the customer and then pay that money to the governmenteve streamlines the process by simply collecting the sales tax from the business ahead of time it may seem unfair but in a market with limited competition artificially limited by the total number of available sales organizations it encourages the business to offer their products at a fairer price so that as someone already pointed out we dont wind up with tritanium at 2bil isk a unitnot supported
this is not how the market worksthe tax is displayed when you place the sell order but it is not charged until the sale takes placetry testing before suggesting
ki tarraafter further testing i believe you are righti made a mistake in my original testingi have several hundred trade orders upapparently during my previous testing some orders had completed while i was testing causing me to see a sales tax for the wrong transactionmost of the items i work with are similar in priceits interesting though looking at the responsesand seeing several actually against the idea of taxation at the point of salenext time ill bring this type of topic up in the features and ideas discussionbefore bringing it here to help catch any mistakes

i fully support all reasonable ideas to save drones after disconnection including setting to autorecall drones before emergency warping out helps but wont work for outofrange sentries return control of drones after reconnect setting to optionally disable ewarp completely if youre in highsec not at war and you can tank rats why have ewarp at all have npcs ignore and stop shooting drones that are no longer under anyones controlthe last one is my favorite tbh but it would be nice if all of them were implemented because they all address different aspects of the drone disconnect scenario
brilliant idea
actually i dont know about that one couldnt someone just keep abandoning whatever drone was being targetted and create a cyclical droneabandonementtank of sorts if they did it at close range they could immediately scoop and relaunch the abandoned drone and repeat
rp robe onconcord has negative standings to guristas concord hates the guristas so much that they put a generally bountysec gain on every gurista ship that you find they set the amount so that frigate kills are rewarded with small bountiessec gain and the larger battleship gurista pirates that are killed means a larger bountysec gainsince the guristas live in 00 you will find more guristas there as well as the guristas biggest ships which will yield the highest bountysec gain hence security status of the sector does not matter mighty concord hates the guristas so much that they will paygive sec for guristas ship destruction anywhere as every gurista ship killed is a win for concordend rp robeing get it or do i need to dumb it down to a 2nd grade levelor are you telling me that if i kill a veto member in low sec and run to null sec you wont care if you get revenge on me because i went to 00
pretty much spells it out  o 
this thread is a blatant troll look at the ops corpfixed
veto dont hand out isk for kills nor do we apply security hits fact is that you get a security hit for killing some ships in 00 but not others the empires do not like me due to my security rating and will actively hunt me in 05 space and sit by and watch in 01  04 space if i am attacked no player takes a sec hit for attacking me in any space and i only take hits in 01  10 yet no sec hit in 00 unless i kill npcs this does not make sensei know most of you are up in arms and calling me names over this as no doubt you enjoy the isk and sec you can get in 00 this is an idea and i welcome any constructive feedback but throwing insults and name calling is very poor form

the csm tell ccp their requests in order of priority already so the most important topics to the csm gets talked about first and more thoroughlyyou are mistaken in your thinking that ccp must do everything the csm proposes maybe you should bang your head against the wall a few times to free up some more brain cells as the concept of the csm is going right over your head
ive heard that fleet formations already was implemented few years ago and were disabled due to high load at servers to maintain them so i dont think that this idea will give a shotanyway i support it cause i like it
lets go with raw isk to make things simple how should ccp determine the isk value of each bpo no what i was saying is that other players would see any change at all with the removal of the bpos except the whining of the people in the alliances that lost themas i see it the bpos do give some players a permanent advantage but all that advantage amounts to is that they have more isk than other players so not an advantage i can care much abouthow about increasing the quality of invented bpcs up to the level of researched bpos this will reduce the advantage that bpos have in material costs so the only advantage for bpo holders is that the bpo owners dont have to pay the cost of invention everyone gets access to cheaper t2 equipment
ill tell you what i suggestis that you start slowly getting rid of t2 bposhow incentivesfirst start simplyhave npc buy orders for t2 bpos and slowly over time raise what the npc will payalso introduce some rare destroyable items that have a t2 bpo as a requirementfor example a destroyable item could be a rare pvp ship that u could only get from the loyalty store it would cost loyalty  isk  any random t2 bposome people would go for it not everyone but it would remove some of these t2 bpos from the game not all just overtime incease incentives for players to trade away to npcs these t2 bpos removing them from gameby choice not force
personally it is time to end these damn threadswhy do you want to take away someone somehow earnedwait its because the majority of these threads are started by those that used to  about how they couldnt win a t2 bpo in the lotterydeal with it your a loser let the winners bask in the light
we were wondering the same thing waitaminute you mean to tell me that in three years after this horrible horrible embarrassing embarrassing kettle of fish you never got around to finding that outif i have to explain oh okay i coulda sworn someone said something about never dodging questions musta imagined thatevery kestral should look like every other kestral thats ever been or ever will be because its less confusingthree years stewing over a few embarrassments most people would have forgotten about whats a few personal attacks here and there i still know you meant it in the very nicest possible waywelcome to eve where slamming people on the forums war deccing their alliance and interfering with their tournament team are all fair play  hey youre supposed to put a neener neener after that
made a specific attempt nothing yet however as i detailed in my previous posts the suggestions you have made are leaning in that direction 00 doesnt need to be adapted to get the carebears in carebears need to be adapted to survive in 00 i started out as a carebear and through learning and practice i ended up as a respectable pilot that could participate in a fleet or roam solo everybody can get there they dont have to love pvp or go out of their way to find it a well balanced corp should be setup to deal with anything it could face in eve and that is what makes them ready for 00 any changes to 00 to make it easier for carebears will make it easier for everyone that means pl and kenzoku bob and ra and anybody else will have an easier time defending their space because of the things that are intending to bring more people out there
nope if the reason wasnt good enough to keep her from getting in trouble with the alliance leadership then it doesnt matter to me to be fair though i dont see how there could be a reason good enough to justify it red boxes are a shoot or die situation either is more acceptable than paying them for protectionive explained the situation sufficiently enough that anybody who understands the situation properly would know why it was embarrassing anybody who doesnt would most likely need to experience it themselves to understand in that respect i would highly encourage you to motivate your corpalliance to move to 00 and try to survive there its a great learning experience in many waysok ill explain this one because not everybody is going to know about the mechanics of software development the graphics you see on that kestrel are called textures they are rendered onto the model of the kestrel the textures that make up any ship you could potentially see in space have to be loaded in memory ahead of time or else there would be severe lag when the client was notified to draw that ship on the screen so if you had a kestrel with a custom paint job those images would need to be loaded into memory by every person playing eve anywhere in the worldi wouldnt call it stewing we had nothing going on that weekend many of us wanted to exact some revenge so we did my posts in this thread are barely even close to personal attacks if you look at what goes on in eve go read caod for 5 minutes and your definition of a personal attack may change
a simple my mistake sorry would have sufficed is this thread now about what you think issler is capable of instead of what she has doneat this point i do believe youve said more about carebears in 00 than issler
what she has done so far has not alleviated my concerns about what she is capable of doing in the future so its about both and that means what
have i been mislead and youre here with noble constructive intentions im sure both issler and i would love to hear your thoughts on the future of eve im sure you have just as many constructive comments to future game development as you have had complaints to isslers ideaswe can make this a productive thread yet i eagerly await your thoughts
i would like to add an issue and revisit one from the past due to new information1 transfer sovereignty to corporations2 removing t1 meta 0 loot drops from npcs mark iisee ya on sundayedit it seems they changed the thread ids so i switched to a post by ccp that shows the exact percentages for anybody curious the link that used to be there was the one used previously so i know it worked but now it seems to have gone the way of the dodo
the link for removing t1 meta 0 loot drops from npcs mark ii is a thread about small changes to missions to make the more fun
which was even raised during the last csm too
apparently no one thought of a simple way to deal with this but you simply put up a forum or database with a script that says hearee hearee on this day vuk lau became luk vau if you can find public character sales eve search you can search both name people being unable to think of a way around this is mindnumbing
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
bump
i suppose ive been lazy yeah thats the excuse ill use for not supporting this before nowreally though i guess i just thought that something would of been done by now
ive posted a couple of times in favor of this id like to add that if this could go with making setting up poss easier from a ui perspective itd be great
ok wiseguy so whats the big deal if some silly macro mines the 1 concentration arkonor instead of going for the 100 concentration veldspar rock right next to it ill tell you what hed actually be losing isk that way
while i know you arent actually serious still going to not support this favoritism isnt cool you can always park the veldatar in some lowsec pos to display the epeen behind glass forcefield
give the man what he wants a happy chribba is a good thing
yus 
the veldator should also automagically ignite its ddd once per 2 hours removing all veldspar roids from amarr faction space
signedi like missiles too
o
love the rust pls dont make me train shiney gold stuffs they use kittens to polish them dont you know
the fact that its been 9 months with no response other than a completely generalized we are looking at all capital ships response ticks me off to an insane degree its horrible pr and it indicates a complete lack of caringget off your aes and do something ccp
a buddy of mine was bumped repeatedly by random players in an l4 when he was dying in high sec this prevented him from warping rats killed him random players looted the wrecki think that if youre in deadspace if a player unfleeted bumps you it should probably flag them as aggressivefwiw i think this is really clever but i view it as an exploit like item duping
said player should petition for harassment
should have had a better tank
why was he letting people he didnt trust into his missions 
troll troll is very troll and full of troll would the troll not agree troll
i guess you never heard of scanning
while i myself do not approve of a gay lifestyle i will not criticize or torture them for it people have a right to choose who they choose to be with but reading corp descriptions or bios and getting offended is just plain ridiculous its a game people say horrible  just to  other people off same thing in the real world if someone gets ed off at you what are they gonna do find something that is wrong with you and demean you for it this is a game just because you see someone say i hate gayshomos or anything like that dont take it to heart they are just trying to  you off if someone directly harasses you then by all means petition it but dont petition them for a generic bio or corp description unless it is truly ruthless
have you tried filing a bug report
this sounds like a bug but it could also be that your bombs are going off before the player has dropped out of warp and became vulnerable ever notice you cant lock people who drop out of warp for a few seconds or until they do somethingbut yeah boost bombs
yes i filed a bug report no response yet and i did not notice on any known bug lists i thought they might have it intended but it could be a result of the timing between the module activation and the aoe effect smartbombs activate instantly and i was pretty sure they could hit people in warp at least so i have heardi did a lot of testing on the test realm a bit ago to test the viability of bombs and it doesnt look like they have fixed it from the patch notes since thenduring the test i asked them if they were out of warp when the bomb exploded and they would say yes and during numerous tries i came to the conclusion that i could only hit them if i launched it right as they were loading on the gridi will try to setup tests on tranquility and report back with a more detailed results
if theres to be any ship buffs minmatar goes first o p
stupid internet connect caused double post
just lol at listed fittings a mwd nighthawk no shield tankers are not supposed to tackle and if youre using heavy missiles you dont even need to be that close to hit your target tbh hams would be a different matter but in that case youd be looking more towards a gank nh anyways and would have to sacrifice tank for it not supported at all and i fly one of these things
currently the nighthawks bonuses are thishighlighted what appears to be wrong with the description as far as i can tell the nighthawk only gets its second bonus to heavies as per the description rather than it being an error in the description meaning that fitting assault missiles or heavy assault missiles means you lose out on your damage bonus and only use up the rate of fire onei think the simplest proposal would be to give this command ship a niche role antisupport change that second bonus to include assault missiles currently a heavy missile nighthawk can do around 500 dps with a realistic fit using heavy missiles at up to 85km this change would allow it to deal 400 dps against smaller targets at up to 45km and have more than enough grid left over to tank it up to the eyeballs
the salvaging exploit is getting out of hand players have found a way to steal the salvage from someone elses wrecks without being flagged aggresive this is obviously an oversite on the part of the developers as people get flagged for stealing in eve ie can flipping to pop agressino timers and the like people actually abuse the theft  flagging mechanic to try and pick fights in empire spaceplease make fixing this oversite a top priority as it kills what i believe most people are drawn to eve for the dog eat dog kill or be killed world and it enables griefing which i think another thing people like about eve is if someone is griefing you you can actually shoot themplease look into this im not sure if youve been made aware of this oversite but it would be nice to see it corrected
sorta makes me wanna ask if that means stealing from cargo containers flagging people is unintendedbut at least i know that its supposed to be brokenthanks for the info
lets see i think your thread 250 on this subject its aloud by ccp and they have stated this how can u claim something that was nvr really yours
obvious troll is obvious
you whine enough times for ccp to change it son
indeed the op has been determined a troll and this case will now be handed off to the troll post rating commission from this point on any poster who falls for this troll will be issued a forum dunce hat

i would like the csm to raise this issue with ccp  why is it that if you remote repair someone with a low security status you get a global criminal flag please change this mechanic so that you only get flagged for repairing someone who has a global criminal flag themselves
supporting my own topic
this has been brought up before and unless ccp changes their thoughts on jump clones no supportisaac
considering ccp already has a problem with jump clones having made eve quite a bit smaller i think this would only make it worse not supported
linkage please for ccp views  google has failed mei confess i see neither the technical nor the philosophical reasons for denying this  that jcs make the universe too small is an argument against jcs in general rather than the details of their operation  and that is not on the cards having a small proportion of clones with a 12 hour cooldown instead of a 24 hour cooldown does not it seems to me materially affect the dynamic of this facility but rather gives a measure of increased flexibility to the communityi declare my interest here as one who fights in fw and would rather not take a break for 24 whole hours in practice more when i jump to my mission running system
i would like to see jump clones elminated or severely nerfed no support
dosent take a math genius to figure out why your idea is ridiculousthink about itevery time you push the time limit down people can move around the game much fastersoon youll be throwing a  fit over 12 hours being too much and want the bloody thing shrinked even morenot supportedever
the combination of jump drives and jump clones has pretty much negated the need for actual trade lanes or the need to actually risk your implants travelling placesi know they will never change those things back to the way it was but the last thing we need to do is make this bull easiernot supported
all these comments are from a position of not liking the mechanism of jump clones at all and with respect that is entirely besides the point of this discussion if you wish to campaign against jump clones can i suggest you make a csm petition specifically suggesting thatin the meantime im looking for ideas and discussion on how the system that does exist could be made more flexible for those of us who do use it without it being used in lieu of regular travel at 24 hours there is an unavoidable phase shift in the timing of your jump clone eventually causing a bulk movement in this timing that serves as an unecessary inconvenience to solve this i have proposed as above 12 hours cooldown seems to me to be a good minimum as it remains long enough to prevent it from being a means of more regular travel whilst ensuring that with a finer degree of control there is less inconvenience for the user to preempt the inevitable comment of course there would be a phase shift at 12 hours but it is unarguable that inconvenience is a monotonically decreasing function of jump frequency its just a question of balanceif there are real or practical reasons why this would not work or you feel that 50 is too lenient and another value might serve better then i certainly want to see your ideas if you just dont like jump clones then this is not the thread for you im sorry
im sorry tooconsidering ccp already has a problem with jump clones having made eve quite a bit smallersince ccp doesnt care about your jump clone improvements eitherid be suprised if they didnt make them harder to use honestly
i raised this but i believe it was voted down id have to doublecheck however
indeed but i asked for a source on this and none has been forthcoming so thats really just hearsay at the momentcsm voting is a level zero veto though so if this has been raised and rejected before then ill have to let it die so confirmation would be appreciated thanks
how about you try reading the frakking post you idiotseriously are you trying to live up to your namei just told you why and you are obviously blind as a batthe point is not that we hate jump cloneswe didnt say thatif we hated jump clones we would say iti said it would make it a little too easy for everyone to move about the game without restraintthat and i also said that you would encourage people to remove the time limit all togetherspend more time reading and less time putting words into our mouthsyoull get farther not to mention live longeri beleive a 24 hour penalty albeit cumbersome is a fair compromiseotherwise it would be abused something fiercedont like it then i suggest you figure out a way around that problem other than making the system worse as you obviously implied
where is it cant find it
try using the archive losercan a dev lock this please no reason for this to keep getting bumped to the front page when the issue has been dealt with
while i dont need such a feature it surprises me to no end that ccp does not have some sort of notification featurei would think that they would actually increase their revenue stream a bit more if they did since people would be less prone to have an unpaid account for a day or two while they arent paying attentionthere was an excellent idea presented by csm calling for a countdown clock to be on the character selection screen
sounds like a good idea and im paying by credit card so i wouldnt make any use of it
this is such a good idea that the csm has developed time travel just so that they can discuss the matter with ccp a month before you even posted about it
and this is why we need a better search engine
uhm just make a spreadsheet with a field days leftalso the expiry date is available on the webserver  so if anyone at ccp says sending out an email when an account is about to expire is difficult they are wrongthey sure know how to send automated emails when your account is expired to trick you into signing up again d
theres a current issue where someone can engage in combat in high sec while being repaired by unflagged players i like being able to repair flagged players as a mechanichowever i would like to see the following changeswarning message are you sure you want to repair xxx hes flagged y0and if you repair him you get aggression against all players who the current player has aggression againstin other words if you repair someone who has done something naughty people can take revenge against the repairerthis is extremely fair and would prevent can tippers from becoming invulnerable in combat
you might want to check your mechanics therelast i checked anyone who reps a aggoring target is subject to being shot at without penaltywarning or no warning this is already in placefeel free to correct me looks at everyone else
this post is based on what ive heard others say if youre correct thats greatcould anyone confirm
i would refer you to this kb artical but concidering that the gang aggression paragraph has been out of date since june  about all that i can suggest is that you test it to confirm for yourself
with my current situation and the economy was wondering if the issue could be raised of a main client that can scale down to what classic has atm i know many of people that play while on the road and dont have super gaming rigs was wondering what the csm could do to raise this issue and see what can be done or is being done to make eve like it is now really accessible instead most people play it for the gameplay the pretty graphics are just topping any feedback would be much appreciative
i have an issue it is people who hear about an issue from a guy who knows a guy and makes a terrible thread on ah when they have absolutely zero clue to what is going onif you havent figured it out it is you you are the issue
if your current situation concerns you economy wise then you shouldnt be playing this game
heres an examplei have 5 people in corp we all have 80 standings with caldari so we can anchor a pos in caldari high sec space we are able to do this because the corps standing to caldari is the average of our corp members standings which is 80my new friend bob joins and he has 00 standings with caldari he doesnt count for the standings calculation since he has no standings now bob runs caldari missions now he has 10 standings with caldari now the corps average standings is below 80 and we cannot setup high sec pos anymorei do not support this proposal as i do not like high sec pos period im well aware of the  and  effects in high sec but mainly high sec pos are used for me research slots bypassing the station slot mechanic and the mechanics resulting are just terrible id rather have me slots in empire looked at and a new mechanic put in so that if you want an me slot you can compete for it or somethingpos are and high sec pos are
at least your example makes more sense than the op no offense to the opas for the mechanics i think the better solution is to have the ceo weigh innot the membership
for the love of god no moar lol quantity over quality or invention can produce moar than a t2bpo per weekbigbadbob has a t2bpo and can make 200 bobits a week demand for bobits sits at 1400 a week invention sets the price because invention is stocking the market not the t2bpoyet an other troll thread or a new member who has just heard the shocking tale of t2 and had to run to the forums
jesus whats the point with saving the current t2 bpo owners and keep the value up on themeveryones complaining about how cool it is that the game is not based on fairness and that it is good the way it is now but then the same ppl start whining when the unfairbalancetrain hits them i dont see a reason why t2 bpos should be limited to a small blessed group of ppl
hooboy im feeling another whew comin oni dont even know who owns the mcskanky character uhm hello brandnew guy how did you miss this partwhen did i say anything about the reason being good enough i am just amazed you would cling to all that bitterness for three years without finding this out this was the big enchilada of your embarrassment beefs rememberive explained the situation sufficiently uhm i think you need to go back and read your own quote here youre talking about something completely different now and you wonder why i say whewblah blah blah those images would need to be loaded into memory by every person then its simply astounding that other mmos are able to pull this off and have for over 10 years how do they do itwe had nothing going on that weekend uhm havent we already established that a lot more than a weekend was put into exacting revenge for some 3yearold beefs about a few embarrassmentshas not alleviated my concerns about what she is capable of doing wow if youre going to sit around worrying about what everyone might be capable of doing well its no wonder you dont have any hairgo read caod for 5 minutes yes yes theres always someone doing something worse than you are kids discover this excuse at 4 and some never stop using it oh yeah a neener neener should have gone after that too
and niskin is clearly one of the people that has no clue about the modern graphics rendering pipeline while something as radical as a hello kitty kestrel would require unique textures major changes in apperance could be affected almost for free in terms of performance using the gpu shaders there are also textures already available local to the client that can be included in the final rendering that currently arent used the alliance logo and corporate logos for example simple initial performance profiling could be used to determine if this addtional final rendering is performed and could even be made option via the graphics options uiso my advice niskin is dont talk about technologies areas where you have no understanding because youll say stupid things like you just didissler
no this way you could simply change your mains name and walk away free from both your reputation and deeds by changing name and portraitit should not be possibleno no no
im reading through the mountains of trolling and im constantly referencing the forum rules to keep a tally of how many rules are broken the numbers gone higher and higher and in most threads there are no mods to be seen the rules of the forums are pretty clear but ill highlight the ones that are being consistently broken etc etc etc why is the moderation staff just giving up on moderating some of the larger threads it took a wave of spam topics before fallout stepped in and that was just to lock them not even to glance over the last few threadnoughts
rather than counting hit that report button and copypaste the rules in mods will then step in asap
i support this and will bring it for the next csm meeting just need to double check why this was not implemented ages ago
this is so vastly superior to the crap we have now
bump because this is still a major issue im sick of seeing falcon threads when the arazu is so underpowered
not supported dampening still works and we saw a lot of it in the tournament gimp i think not especially when most of them dampening werent the ships in this thread isaac
1 for the inspiring wonder in newer players and keeping them in the game with the desire to attain band
who cares if new players want to see a highsec titan there is one in luminaire this isnt about player content or anything else its about you being a forum celebrity and wanting special treatment for it im sorry but building your image about a type of mineral in game does not suddenly give you the right to get special treatment i know there is an ingame love affair with you among new players because they see you as some kind of mining hero but tbh a lot of the major alliances have done a lot more noteworthy things and they arent demanding they get their titans moved to highsecputs on his flameretardant suit
i dont see why not
chribba love ftw
thisim sure most of us have given up by now and started training for the rev with dreads being such a prominent force on the for front of large scale 00 combat you think they would take a serious look at this issue maybe they are just waiting for every nag pilot to give up and cross train to another race like most of us seem to havedont forget that going nuts with the nurf bat can be very tiring im sure they are just relaxing off the taxing act of not doing any thing productive
perhaps most upsetting a naglfar fix would be incredibly simple to implement they can spare enough manpower to implement walking in stations but cant have one guy go adjust the attributes of a ship
i had the idea of adding the possibility of having a que for deploying posses making it possible to stack onlining jobs in the control tower so you dont have to wait for every structure to go online and manually online the next one after 10 minutes could also be used for anchoring of coursea photoshop exampleplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesshow your support at this thread and or leave constructive critism and i will get back to answer you question as soon as possibleanyone who has ever deployed a few posses will support this i bet op updatei agree that some boundaries should be put into placei think there should be a time limit on the starbase itself and next to that an alliancecorp restriction in a fashion where you can only anchoronline 1 pos at a time in the fashion ofyou can not start a secondary queue or anchoronline another module on a starbase structure in this system as your alliance is too busy doing the essential paperwork for another starbase structureif this was to replace the current game mechanics it would limit an alliance of setting up more than one pos in a system at a time also bringing down pos spam while keeping the sovereignity system in placeofcourse there should also be boundaries in place of how many posses you can deploy per constelation and per region at one time

talking to a suicide ganker today he uses trial accounts about 1day old to suicide gank and discards them when they hit 5 standingsthis is really unbalanced as it allows people to just continuously suicide gank without the requirement of grinding their standings up or losing them effectivelyso basically i guess the solution is to disallow trial accounts from attacking people in high sec unless theyre aggrodkinda lame but i think its the only solutioni mean trial accounts are restricted from a number of activities that unbalance the game like flying indys so this seems like a natural exclusion alsoedit he said that he would bring bigger ships if he wasnt able to do this i feel that would be totally fine and totally balanced bringing the bigger ships
it is already an exploit petition if you see it
it is an exploit and with the changes to the rookie low sp he will no longer be able to jump into a suicide cruiser instantaneously anyway
when are those changes coming mar 10th should i basically make all my alts now 
fwiw i think it was suicide destroyer 500k ship 45m fittingsjust for popping shuttles and newb shipsedit as long as im here the guy said 17 time nothing drops 47 everything drops 27 5080 drops7571 ev for cargodoes this sound about right based on your experience i could go through a lot of killmails or something to verify this but if this works out with what you guys have experienced in looking at your own killmails then thatd be good to know
trial accounts should not be allowed such things if ccp hasdnt already nerfed it they shouldsupportedarg ninja edit posting on an iphone is not easy
trial accounts should not be an option to get around standing mechanics at least not in high secwith skill queues coming it may become viable to cycle trial accounts even if the ganking only becomes possible on day 20 of the 21 day trialblocking trial accounts from doing anything that would trigger concord is one option
i had this idea a little ways back goto mission hubs buy all implants then get a number of suicide ganking chars that will allow you to suicide gank get to 5 then biomass the chari made a petition asking if it was allowedgm said it is not an exploit or anythingthe obvious fix is dont fly around in ur podps you dont have to be a trial account to do this paid account can have main  2 other chars that could do it
where did the op say anything about pods being ganked his talk about drop rates tells me he is talking about ships being gankeda paid account has to deal with the character deletion timer but someone cycling trial accounts doesnt have the timer to worry as they can throw away the account once its full or switch to another while waiting for the deletion queue to endif the ganking characters require skills beyond what they get at character creation then the person using a paid account needs to halt training his main to train the gank characters and can only train one ganking character per account but that also does not apply if he uses trial accounts because he can have as many accounts as he needsso using trial accounts allows him to cycle the gank characters faster while still training his main for free
please create a petition under rules  policies exploits if you see such behaviour in game
gtfo and go back to wowwelcome to a world where you have to fight to defend what you hold precious

or they like pvping in empires space want small gang or 1v1 fights and dont want to get invoved in 00 politics and pos sieges
meh stay in an npc corp if you dont like warsthough i wish you could war dec those too 
right now my alliance is involved in a war with another who ed us off claimed space where we lived was theres and were a general annoyance we have killed one barge in high sec the rest have been pvp ships and the occasional hauler on top of that we have killed 2 of their empire poss something which we could not have done if you got your change im sure there are some people there that are out to grief noobs but at the same time you want to be in a corp and have the advantages that come from that you have to take the good and the bad like war decs and corp theives and spys its all part of the game
i work for a ltl less than truckloadfreight carrier in real life with a few extra tools added to the current contracts systems player corps could solve the delivery problems in eve and profit from it generating new careersyou do not need much1 add a contract that can be used to combine many small courier contracts into 1 large courier contract to transport the small packages intact inside one other large one this combined ltl courier contract should have its own separate collateral  destination2 add a contract that can be used to combine many small courier contracts into 1 large item exchange contract in which a percentage of the profit could be transferred from corp to corp as with the responsibility of the collateral being transferred as wellplease please please let players have these career options and let corps run this instead of npcsris dnalor
i agree with op
or turning corpses into soylent green pbut seriously yes its a rp tool it couldnt hurt anyone and it would help the rpers enjoy the game
homophobia or irrational prejudice against any group is badhowever this is not a case of itget off your high horse stop being so oversensitive and be grateful that you live in a liberal society where homosexuality is not persecuted
if this is happening it needs to be fixed
hiim sure many of you know about the ways local and buddy list allows you free intel in the game particularly when traveling through certain systems or for finding out who is online during a warare there any firm plans to change this mechanic
lets see how it affects wormhole space confirmed delayed localbuddy list will never change you still need some way to determine if a player can be convod
when i phone someone i have no idea if they are home or not i wait 2030 seconds and if they dont pick up i know i wont be talking to them at the moment then i can email them in that case but what i dont have is an indication of who is home or can be calledpersonally i could live with that uncertainty if in turn there was some fog of war in conflicts and sector transitsrecently i had a mission in a sector of space that the bushwhackers control pretty tightly low sec i buddy listed the members of the corporation particularly the ones i most often saw hanging out in that system as soon as there werent many of them online i jumped in and did my mission fair not really
yet if you were to talk online on msn or skype you could see their status while they could block you thats not really the point
if you havent seen the new warp effects then i urge you to check them out they can be viewed here but id urge you to also get on sisi and check it out yourselfbasically if youre like me youll agree that the new warp is made of incredibly epic fail so epic in fact that i feel it should not be included in the expansion and that the current effect should be retained players csm members i urge you to take action on this now before its too late
yes lets all panic and riot in the streets over a product that hasnt been released yetyou need to get a life and take a break from this game kid
its not that bad maybe you should go drink a can of stfu
that silly arguement keeps popping up but it doesnt make any sense if something is on the test server and people dont comment on it that its broken or causing issues then it wont be changed or taken out now would it
i assume the same applies to bug reporting we shouldnt report bugs because it is only a beta version and clearly those bugs will be fixed by the final release faili too dislike the new warp effect and unless people state they dislike it it is unlikely that ccp will change it significantly
signed
i like it personally
i think it looks okay really it just needs something to give a sense of forward movementalso dont forget a lot is broken on the test server and at least for me theres no sound when warping its probably better with sound
did i say anything about bug reporting nomaking assumptions  epic failjust because its on the test server dosent mean it will be implimentedtry using your head before speakingas for the other commentslook i get that you need to complain to ccp so complain to ccp in the test singularity forum board and or ideas and featuresdont waste the csms timethey have influence over tranquility not singularity duh
technically he has a pointi like the new effect as well just some minor tweaks would make it goodthe old warp effect looks like a cheap windows xp screensaver
im not going to freak out the devs know our opinion
geez you guys need to calm the crap down ccp hasnt released this on tranquility and youve got it in your head that csm is going to fix it before it comes out csm is not going to bug ccp over an issue that hasnt even been released its ridiculous and a waste of time take this thread somewhere else isaac
why would it be too late after implementation why would they be unable to change it backin anycase they have been tweaking it for a few days i like the direction the new jump and warp effects are taking they link with the cynosure effects and create an actual themepretty badass really if they get the sounds right and add a bit of blur or something it will be perfect
defnitely prefer teh old one right now things might change but its unlikely to change enough for me
after checking it out myself i must admit i dont like the new warp graphics theres more new graphics that seem just to be made for the sake of being sparkly and new rather than being focussed on what its meant to be for
i happen to agree with efrim here i like the direction nice change form the status quo graphically speaking
there is no problem you are simply fitting it wronglots of ships cant properly fit big guns  tankyou still can use the bonuses of the ship to the best of ur abilityishtar on the otherhandno matter what youre doing with the ishtar you basically never use medium hybrids you have to go nosneut or small guns basically or medium projectiles on some setups
ill keep this simple  docking mechanics have not really been changed in the years ive played this game and need to be updatedsubproposal 1 make dock timers a function of ship masscase study guy undocks a carrier starts remote repping his friends while remaining within dock radius and parking the ship the moment he is put into a dangerous situation the argument ive heard from ccp regarding a lot of things is that people are not committing to fights  thats why they nerfed warp core stabs thats why they nerfed nanos and should be why stationhumping gets a bat to the face it allows capital ships to hump the safety of neutral or friendly stations assign fighters or control that power directly while repping friendlies without serious fear of being killed due to the large dock radius of most modern stationswhile i do believe the repping someone should set an aggro flag just as running a ganglink apparently does these days thats not the point here the point is that in the past ships could be killed in the 30 sec undock time if the forces attacking had reasonable dps  since then t2 has become more prevalent rigs have been introduced overheating damage controls etc  hp has gone up directly up with ccps intent to lengthen combat and as a result 30 seconds is no longer a sufficient time to kill someone if they knowingly undock into a hostile forceso the proposal is to make larger ships wait longer before they are able to dockredock as they are harder to kill and will make station games more riskysubproposal 2 knowledge of space surrounding the station while in docknow im not a heartless bastard some people honestly have no clue theyre undocking into a waiting station camp  help these people out by giving the station a feature to show what ships are on grid outside of its dock port this will allow them to know what awaits and if they knowingly undock into it and die no sympathythis is quick and dirty so enhancements and refinements of these ideas are welcome and if this isnt the only thread on this as im sure its not feel free to support both rather than getting uppity more threads like this the better tbh
this would be a good option also to fix the station games
proposal 1 good fair enoughproposal 2 nowrong way to go about it and would not make it any betterthe only way you will have a favorable outcome is to have random multiple undock exit pointsperiod end of discussion case closed feel free to suggest the kick im out at some kms idea s well
i like the idea of the larger the ship the longer it takes to redock that then can lead to the issue of the person just undocking his pod for a quick look then docking back up and changing ships its not soo much the pilots that undock and realize its a trap and dock back up that seem to be the issue its the ones that aggressassist in your cease and as soon as they see the yellow reticule they cease all actions scoop drones and mop up the damage until they can dock that are the issue its getting really lame we have encountered a few fights on a few stations fights that had the potential to be good but as soon as two hostiles ships are popped they other 10 stop doing everything and dock resulting in only an extra 12 losses if you choose to fight you should be forced to accept defeat and stand and fight not count to 30 and dock again the randommultiple undock thing is a cool idea as long as there is kickout whats really the point if the mechanic is still in play that you can just ctrl space and cut your engines count to 30 and dockup give a 2km or so kickout at a random ejection spot this also eliminates those pesky insta undock bookmarks as it stands the majority of the empire fights are on stations no one wants to fight on gates any more as it does not afford the same luxury of the 100 security after you have waited out your timer
if stations had oppositesided entrances and exits there would be no problem unfortunately that would require new station models but would solve the problem quickly as you would have to circle the station completely or warpoff then warpin to redock
not reallythey dont use the exits realistically at all anyway
i have an alternate subproposal 2 wait till ambulationin order to see outside you have to leave your ship and go to a viewing areawindowcomputer terminal to look outsidemake it a pain in the ass and ill support it if you can just constantly scan from in ship to see whos outside its nonsense people would just stay docked foreverat least with characters needing to get out of ship you can have some on foot espionage with members of the camping corp loitering watching for the target to look outside they can then relay when the target gets back in their ship etc
110 for calling it an exploit
youre terrible get out
considering that over the last week caod posting has gone from being basically amusing to now lets establish something  we could let this go on for days and days and days the common responce to caod critisism is dont read it then the sad fact is that caod is the only place on the eve forums where you can reliably find out whats going on in nullsec and where the interesting people post worse this caod junk leaks out into the forums at large with the people inside believing that posting similar tripe on other forums is also acceptable evidence page 1 of eve general discussion will the csm be talking over changes to caod with ccp tldr version proposal csm get their heads together with ccp to thrash out a better forum for alliance discussion in the mean time ccp lay the smacketh on caod and make it clear that the forum rules cannot be broken even ic
very simply a proper banstick for trolling and if it happens repeatedly give a permanent ban also have bans work for all accounts for that player if you use an alt char on your alt account and do dumb stuff with it your main account also gets banned
theres been many discussions re this topici may as well support this one as well 
the problem is not caod the problem is every frakking idiot and there goon friends are so damn egotistical and prideful that they will post in any board and any other forum board without restraint or complaintand until they stop playing games and get back to shooting each other in the wondeful world of eve it will never stop moderation or noti at one time respected goons for there tactical prowess and ability to get things going and then they started posting enmasse with there ego swelling to the size of a damn planetat least darius is respectable his alliance members however need a swift kick to the headit is one thing to play the game to its fullest its another to be a bunch of egotistical asswipes with pride swelling to record heightscourse the same could be said for alot of other teams the goons just happen to be the most popular oneno offense goons you where better off scamming and grinning without posting 1000 times a day  o 
i too think that ccp should read every single post and sit there contemplating if its a troll or not
wait do you mean why do you get a flag when youre helping an outlaw because thats pretty self explanatory and you dont get a flag when repping someone of low security unless theyre an outlaw
even if the outlaw isnt currently flagged even if you yourself are an outlaw even if you warp to the middle of nowhere out of range of any stellar object the mechanic is broken
outlaws are flagged 247 thats why anyone can shoot them without consequene just because the gates guns dont shoot at them doesnt mean they arent flagged
theres a difference between a global criminal flag and being 5 or lower both allow you to be shot at anywhere at any time and currently both will flag anyone who tries to assist them however it makes no sense that someone should receive a global criminal flag for assisting someone 5 or lower assisting someone with a gcf yes but not just because they are an outlawexample two pirates warp to a safespot neither have sentry aggro they both use local armor repairers and nothing happens they both use remote armor repairers and voila both have sentry aggrodumb
so you dont think assisting a wanted outlaw warrants punishment talk about the ultimate bait outlaw sits on gate waits for someone to fire and his rr buddies show up to help him out
theres a difference between helping a relatively good pilot positive sec status and a criminal negative statusyour making this too hard take a step back and think about it
no not really given the amount of damage spread caused when you tank sentries with an rr gang the sentries are merely an inconvenience and you can happily use a flasher as bait in this fashion without worrying about it and this works perfectly because the person being attacked does not have sentry aggro themselves reducing the amount of damage the original target takesin short as far as combat mechanics go this wouldnt be a game breaker to change
for anyone that does not think the current mechanic is dumb bear in mind right now if your an outlaw in a droneboat or carrier and you remote rep your own drones you take a sec hit and get a global crim resulting in sentry guns firing on you now you cannot say that is not a screwed mechanicfair enough if you rep an outlaw that is attacking someone getting global makes sense but one that is not doing anything wrong is silly unless you make outlaws constantly under sentry gun fire themselves
that should be reported as a bug not a messed up mechanic  o 
i believe it has been and that the standard it is working as intended not a bug reply has been returned however i cannot confirm 100 as i have not filed bug rep myself
no you really didnt  what you said wasone of the few ways that this statement makes logical sense is if you take the position that jump clones are an inherently bad feature of the game there is some small scope for debate in that position however so we look to what you said just nowhere you are saying that any reduction in the amount of time between jump clones is per force a bad thing accepting as a statement of fact precisely that which we are trying to determine there is little reason to form such an opinion straight away unless you didnt like jump clones in the first placefinally  you referred to the 24 hour cooldown as a penalty an interesting choice of words as it implies rather succinctly that you consider the act of jump cloning something to be punishedall in all it is clear from this evidence that you do not like the jump cloning mechanism at all  that you think that all travel should be done in a ship through space and thus subject to the dangers therein and it is completely reasonable to take that view as i said before however this is not the thread to air these views i had rather thought that the framework of the proposal was clear enough but evidently not  it is as followsaccepting that most travel in eve should be done in space and acknowledging and accepting the existance of jump clones is there a way of shortening the cooldown between jumps without jepardising the principle abovewith this as the point of discussion as it always has been you have touched on one thingit behooves you here to explain exactly how this change would be abused what is it that people could do with a 12 hour cooldown that they could not do with a 24 hour one that would be considered an exploitthat is how you move the discussion forward not with clumsy half sentences a preponderance of ellipses and cheap abuse if you have something constuctive to add here then feel free otherwise you may as well not post for youll get no further response from me
stop jumping every day or take one off there this perceived problem of your is now fixed
your car works fine except that if you travel more than 10 miles the wheel falls off and you need to put it back on by your argument your mechanic saysstop driving more than 10 miles there this perceived problem of yours is now fixedas ive already said it is the fact that i have to do that that is the problem ignoring it doesnt make it go away
if you cant figure out out how lessening the cool down would be considered a risky and obviously abusive feature in game you should change your name to stupid bobim not going to take time to teach a child the art of game mechanicslike i said you ask for an inch youll want a foot then there will be no cool down period and everyone will be jumping all over hell without restraintthereby removing the need to fly the old fashioned wayits way to easy to get around as it is stop being lazy and get off your ass and go play the game
anyone else agree with my quote
lockedplease do not crosspostoriginal thread is here
you dont think that more people might mine if the rewards were higher also once the price of trit rises a little above current levels to 5 isk it starts to become much more profitable to import in bulk from 00 space especially for people with access to jfs mineral compression or jump bridge networks i suspect that the global mineral supply is much more elastic than you might think
you facepalm why there are trillions of people in the eve universe many pirates they make stuff mission runners blow it up and take what little remainsoutside of gameplay it is good that the actions contribute to the economy instead of just getting bounties id be all for  loot drops less isk
hey guysim gonna raise this very issue an issue which played an important role in my csm platform in the next csm meeting in about 8 hours with the info from chronotis im hoping to have enough csm support to raise this issue to the developers i would like your help though in pushing this through by talking with your csm representatives in support of this issueon the mining is boring note weve been talking a lot about mining and how to make it more interesting with ccp in reykjavik so hopefully well see it soon though probably not during this csm session they want mining to become more interesting too
try to get clear data from ccp on how much of that loot is made by ships sold under mineral prices and reprocessed compression items ie items build in one location and reprocessed in another for ease of transportation npc sold items the same percentages show on the table from a before the removal of npc sold shuttles and b before the change of the pos modules that were the prymary source of tritanium before the shuttles without the historic data that table has little meaning
t2 bpo owners have spend fair amount of time i think it required some kind of grind to improve your chances or resources billions of isk to gain those bpos the lottery mechanics were stupid but valid at those timei have proposal for all the t2 bpo whinersearn enough money buy those bpos they surely have a pricetag based on possible profit and trash them yaay everyone is happyand dont expect ccp to fix every problem for you especially if it isnt a problemedit fixed english
editwe need someone who understand the needs of the cp posters in as csmit is my belief that captain pompous you know youll get in anyway tchell is the right man for the jobhe even encourged me to go on a dieti post in cp not because this just happend to be here and i edited it to look good but because this is our home and from here we shall fightoriginalbefore this gets lockedive been busy but i really miss posting here and miss all the regualr guys you know who you arespecial shout out to captain pompus a name made for deliberate effectwell done you
ahoy pouponwhere have you been it is like the night sky is missing the north star or mcdonalds fat people e forgot to add thank you for my shout out ive never had one before so you made my day
first in a le poupon threadalso to add so dont get wrong for only posting first i feel that the cp community also missed you or some  like that captain pompus for next csm elections oedit crap the git beat me t first so second in a le poupon thread
hyperaltfest itthow have you been poupon
othanks kirra i will base my campaign on forum warriorage and mild ridicule of every type of eve player i think does that sound about right and how do i go about it not wishing to hijack poupons thread 
its all good to hijacknot long before the lock i doubtive been busy in oopeive acctualy been making serious postsbut then as long as i dont say eve its a serious post down thereits not as fun there though just thought this thread is missing a nexus touchid vote the captain to csm no doubtedit the fat people in mik ds thats me
well try and work quickly thenserious business ill have to check it out after this stint in cp s rl rarely isan acerbic zing would not go amissty sir o7i meant it in a nice way 
to become one of those csm thingeys you just need a passport and some people to vote you in i think peoples votes can generally be bought with exotic dancers must work cos jade constantine got voted in lol and as for the passport if you dont have one i am sure someone can get you a decent one for reasonable price on oope forums
then its settled this thread is now a captain for csm thread brb editing op ddammit its almost going to be a serious post
lol sounds quite straightforward thanks kirra to whit the passport situation i have several but i will just keep trying them all on the icelandic authorities until i get one that fits and is to their liking like those toys babies have with cut out holes that they have to push blocks through and if jade constantine can be elected to the csm let along become chairthingwell theres hope for everybody i guess
poupon my friend lol you are on a roll tonight dcp is not the same when one of the regulars goes awol 
ta muchlyseriously though youd probably get in csm quite easily
i think theres only one way to confirm this 
ahem
mr pompous is very mean i dont think he deserves it
zingyou like it like that though dont youyou naughty naughty 
well youre here now  bit late but we do what we can
i think id say i was quite mean not very mean e vote for me and i will make sure your tears are heard
its called pvp maybe youve heard of it
fixed my post
i trusted you and look what you did to menow i cant trust anyone again i will be voting someone else at random cause theyre all liars like you prolly
a vote for the captain is a vote against words like prolly i hope
much as i would love to vote for the captain i honestly believe that tchell dahhn is the right person for the jobthis is a completely unbiased opinion based solely on my own observationshowever if the boss tchell steps down for any reason then the captain has my vote
i should totally run
ya as a matter of fact i have  even more than that ive actually participated in itone time i was battling this corp called angel they had a load of ships that they just kept throwing at me  angel frigates angel thrashers angel seraphims  i think these were the corp directors  but i blasted them to smithereens and salvaged up their corpses it was awesome
rest assured on that 
a floating vote is still a vote look for me come election time d
you should but then i fear youd be jumping on the cplurker troll regularascsmcandidate bandwagon
shut up you worthless alt got
i will fight you
e inadvertant sniper
having read thisim sure that myself or one of my colleagues will be looking for you sooner than that
very droll i need to activate my irony beacons i think d
ugh i read the other post where i said youd get my vote before i read thisnow ive read this one too and you still get my voteif therell be exotic dancers maybe i can vote for you with my multitude of alt accounts as well well have to discuss that matter tho i tend to vote for people with boobs
lolboobs can be arranged votes for boobies shocker
im certainly hopeful given the stiff heh competition being proposed in this threadyou should youll lose but hey you shouldyes however the floating vote is for meme scratches his head and considers what would happen if he filled his cabinet with the likes of pompous nexus and le poupon
what a crazybutitmightjustwork kind of idea
im hurting
agree with the op smack talk is great and they havent yet invented curses that offend me however the eve forums have hit a tipping point and its high time for the mods to step in and lay down the law its gotten so bad that virtually every thread on the forums gets hijacked and turned into a contest to see who can post the most snarky comments in the shortest period of timethere are some bright spots of course but there needs to be an increased official presence on the forums and ccp needs to make it known that this isnt the place to come for endless flame wars and rants filled with racial and sexual epitaphs perhaps ccp needs to create one subforum for smack talk and silliness and let everyone know the rest of the forum is for serious eve discussionspeople here love to heap scorn on the immaturity and stupidity of the communities of other mmos well its time for ccp to take a more active role and help shape this community into something just a tad less juvenileive brought at least 4 new people to eve in the last month or so ive taken the time to explain to them how deep and rewarding this game is all the possibilities it has to offer and how it is really unrivaled for serious multiplayer gaming then they decide what ive told them sounds interesting enough to come to the official site and check it out only to be instantly turned off by the ceaseless spectacle of stupidity on display hereif this keeps up people on the wow forums are going to start saying go back to eve you whiny 
ok first off covert cynos in cynojammed sistems is a good ideea but only black ops should be allowed to jumpbridge to it thereno point in having a cynojammed if it can be bypassed just by using a dedicated recon ship that would make it uselessdedicated fuel bays is an epic ideea its also necessarynowabout making other ships be able to be bridged not only covops and reconsthey could add a rig that would allow thatit wont be a major setup wreckerit should cost relatively much so it balances outalso if im not mistaken u can bridge blockade runnersif u want to run a succesful black ops mission at least with the current mechanics fill some brs with fuel and take them with uzsecondly the cov ops cloak is too much recons and cov op frigates are very specialized they give up dps and utility in order to fit the covops cloak u simply cant have it alllastly in regards to dps and survivabilityblack ops arent designed for all out pvpthey give away dpslocking timebit of hit points in order to fill their specific roleis that role to nicheit sure isshould it be expandeddefinatelybut in regards of firepower they should be less equipped than their t1 counterpartsto summarize big bad fuel bay  ability to jjump and bridge to covert cynos in cynojammed sistems and a expensive rig that would allow all non capital ships to be bridgedit would be rather cost prohibitivedue to fuel costs but it would be possibleand it would a rather interesting mechaniclove stealth
increased fuel bay no longer necessary once t2 transports were allowed to use the covert jump portal
no your reputation is the most valuable asset you can have in eve
its not like it can use the dd without the most incredible concordokken everi dont like the precedent but its a seductive idea
i have to say yes to this for me its things like this that raise eve way above any other game ive yet come acrossoh and although i would never bother travelling to see the npc titan i would certainly pay amar a visit for thisfavouritism noreward for services above and beyond those expected of a player why the hell not
supporting this thread i love my drones and hate feeling like a second class eve player where my skills are sometimes seen as a liability in fleet engagements for the cost of drones and how easily they are destroyed or lost through connection problems they should have more optionsedit also i cant stress enough how annoying it is to have 75mb bandwidth on ships like the myrm flying the 2x heavy 2x medium and a light drone combo is inefficient compared to just flying 5 medium drones in almost every circumstance
all testing for the expansion seems to indicate that drones are very ineffective against sleepers i know there is still testing and balancing going on  just wanted to say id really like it if drones would remain useful in sleeper space i love that the sleepers will be smarter against drones i just dont want the drones to so weak against them that drone boats are not viable in wormhole space
nag has the highest dps of all caps if set for gank i think its a good tradeoff for what the ship does you dont want gank train for another ship its the beauty of the gamefor pos shooting its totally  but for hot drops it can be nice as hell depending on how you use it ultimately its not the nag that needs changing its dreads capitals and all of their tyness that need changing in addition to pos warfare as a whole if you want go by the logic in this thread though everyone and their brother should be in a revelation and lets call it a daymoros drones are clumsy and removable and blasters are just a joke the devs made up one day phoenix missles are lol there is no cruise version and its cap is worse than watching paint dry and nag cant do tank and gank well even with lots of skills to train but the rev best dps consistently gank setup is near that of nag cap recharge is just sexy and its tank makes pos cry not to mention it rox with pulse or beam setups so really lets just all fly revs and quit the emo sessions please
oh thank god for a second there i thought yaay supported my thread and i was going to try and get it deleted before anyone saw
this game has turned cookie cutter enough it doesnt need to be more the phoenix is  yet half of goons fly those right pl at least got that one right when they banned them
good enough 
you lost me
if we give up then nothing will happen i for one will keep posting till they change the damn thing or delete the post then i will start another i cant let getting ignored make me give up or at the very least grow some balls and say screw you guys its not changing
somewhere in the lostness i pointed out the obsurdity of the whines the ship does what it does like it or hate it if it does get a boost i think the only viable one is to tweak capital missle damage short of hitting a slow flying yet oddly stationary brick wall capital missiles are fubar
so we can go from macro mining to macro pos deployment whats next
i take it you have you have never deployed an entire posthe waiting to manually have to give all the commands to the pos is a very dull process queuing would help greatly as you can at least go and do something else in eve in the mean time while not having to take your pos by the hand to tell it explicitly what to do like it has some kind of short attention spanallow me to give you a small example of it currently isyou yes hello i have plans to anchor and online a corporate hangarpos well i think i could anchor it for you but onlining it right after that well i dont know ask me after i anchored it12 minutes later you didnt want to stare at the screen all the time so you went to make a cup of coffee etcyou have you started onlining my corporate hangar array yetpos well no you didnt ask me to do it so i have been staring at that piece of space which seems just a little more black than the other pieces of spaceyou well ok online the corporate hangar array for me then and make it snappypos sure wait another 10 minutes and then give me a new order for a new structureyou cant i just tell you where to anchor and online stuff and be done with itpos no your going to have to do this a million times more because i just cant remember more than one thingand how i feel it should beyou i have plans to setup 4 silos and a reactor could you anchor and online them for me if you show me where i want to put thempos sure
regardless of the supports it will never flythere are too many holes in your idea that could be abusedi suggest scrapping the idea and starting overright idea wrong implementationsome of the holes stacking jobs would make dropping poss very easy to do in 00 which cause pos seige warfare a total hellthats just the tip of the iceberg
i feel this would change almost nothing other than make it more practical for people operatingdeploying posses if i really want to spam posses i just fly around a system and anchor 4 posses at the same time now its no like i got not time for that but i also think that there should of course be a maximum time limit on the que or a maximum amount of jobs you can stack to not make it completely automaticand who says you cant kill these unmanned posses last time i heard they only had 50 shield when they were deployed
i recently put up a pos for the first timei swear the process was designed by jack thompson as a gaming experience it was like buying what you think is system shock ii only to find theres a copy of daikatana in the boxanything that would allow you to configure the pos then set it to online would be welcome i appreciate the need to make the process lengthy to allow a period of vulnerability i dont appreciate having to sit and watch a clock for several hours not to mention wait several minutes if i make a mistake
if we put aside that sov claiming needs to be detached from poses and moons this is the thing i would like to see implemented asap anyone who was puting up cynojammer or jump bridge tower or even plain deathstar knows how painfull pos anchoronline mechanics is it is one of the biggest timesinks in eveanyway i will raise this issue for the next csm meeting
pos onlining is maddeningly boring the only reason that this mechanic has any place in the game is to add some time for countermeasures in the pos for sov role as such if sov is changed away from moons then we should just remove pos timers or at least do this
what does responsible pvp mean cold harsh universe if you undock you could die you get griefed move somewhere else pay the ransom do whatever or get tough and join a real corp
op needs to gb2wow
nothing wrong with the mechanic just the reasons for the wars i doubt that ccp had opportunity to get easy kills in mind when they came up with the system more likely corps warring over access to resources that said ccp only have them selves to blame for the present situation since the make hisec resources so ridiculously plentiful that industrial corps have no need to fight each other leaving the mechanic in the hands of those looking for some pew pew in hisec if resources were harder to come by maybe some of those looking to pew pew would find a home in a pvp wing of an indy corp as it fought over a good system a load of corps competing with each other by any means tradeindustrywar would be far more realistic that the absurd fragmentaion into pure griefing and pure carebear corps we have in hisec now
surely all you would need is the ability to put courier bundles into a different courier bundle with all the paymentcollateral being manually trackedie1 customer contracts to ltl corp2 corp recontracts to pickup driver to bring to hub driver pays collateral to corp  corp has same amount of money as before driver gets paid for the journey he makes3 corp makes daily or we hub  hub contract containing lots of little contracts other driver pays total collateral gets paid total rate4 corp recontracts to delivery driver same deal as above5 corp completes original contract obtains moniesmight be worth checking if this can already be done and if it cant it should supported
finally an intelligent ideacollateral makes me cringe as always thumbs freighterbut this might make life a little more bearable
in real life shipping prices are based primarily on distance and volume and for the most part have absolutely nothing to do with the value of the goods being shipped this is because carriers in real life have insurance of course so that they dont have to have the cash money on hand to cover potential losses even then though the insurance company doesnt pay some sort of collateral for the shipment they only pay out in the event of a lossi support this idea i dont think it is the answer to all our shipping problems in eve but i support it all the same theres so much more that needs to be done to improve shipping though primarily i think we need to move as far away from the current collateral system as is possible heres some further readingcourier system and transporting your goods interbus shameless plugdecentralize trade post by marcus gideonhiring npc haulers you escort themconsolidation toolinterbus solutionproposal ccp finish interbus transport systemyou need to try to get the courier system workablecsm  ccp meeting 001  0019 contract improvements

in theory i agree with everything you say but with dictors being dictors i dont know how you make the trade off better unless that ship gets changed too over night bs speeds dropped by 2400ms so its only fair they got a boost to agility along with every other ship out there agility is fubar right now but then again so are interdictors 1 stop wonders and bountifulness i still long for the days before dictor spheres when support actually tackled stuff n stuff
nothing wrong with dictors they work great within eve  even without the messed up agility of all ships and we absolutely cannot afford to mess with dictors while the lockingagility issue remains and it will remain for years as ccp would not go back to fix something they broke on purpose not until people forget itto help deal with ccp ego we could attack this problem in a different waylets focus on optimizing eve client to reduce the lag in this areas1 overview lag when ship decloaks and starts to warp off theres a small delay to the time it appears in your overview2 module activation lag once a successful lock on target is achieved theres still a small delay in time your modules take effect on target even if they are primed  blinkingwith successful optimization of those areas we can possibly improve lock speeds by 1 second  which would have significant positive impact on tacking of smaller ships  frigs and cruisers
as per the discovery detailed here and the quotes therein includingplease vote here with your support to permanently remove this from the ideas board of eve may it never be implemented
i support this never being implimented there should be no combat without risk
no fake pvp allowed imo
supported the eve server was right to reject this horrible idea
nevah
there are definitely more important to us players things ccp could do with that timefirst nerf local and redesign pos sov and tweak certain modules and ships to make the game seem less bland and more edgy
im sure you op have read on the forums how the orca is being used my neg sec status pirates they pod into high sec fly to an orca in a ss board their ships that are inside and away from sentry guns and gank high sec miners havent you and i bet it brought a smile to your face yes one could argue that the intended use of the orca was not for this but it can be used in this way so what miners can mine straight into it now you have to work a little at finding miners wo an orca or find a new way of earning isk sorry but youre pain i do not have pitty for i love tears
a post with your mainb you assume things as just as most people you polarize issues based on how your percieve a certain person instead of keeping to facts and logic in fact i do not think and have posted on that as such that outlaws should somehow be able to negate the downside of being an outlaw the normal use of high sec if people decide that going outlaw is cool or they accept the downside of doing low sec pewpew or suiciding then they should not be able to circumvent the results of thatas i see it concord should simply follow you around if youre flying a ship following you till you come out of warp and attack as only concord can do it no silly faction police crap
the bottom line is your complaint is irrelevant tzarrim the point of a corporate hangar array on a ship is so people can directly access corp assets in space the fact that people use it to directly dump ore while mining is smart just liike canflipping is smartthe problem you see is that when people work intelligently they are 100 safe because you dont have an overly easy method can flipping of getting them prepped to kill easilyin your op you say putting effort in should make people safe but not 100 safe yet you refuse to acknowledge the fact that using secure containers already provided this orcas and all other ships with a corp hangar array simply assist in a more convenient fashionin the case of the orca it is doing exactly what it was created to do be a mining assistance platform do you thing that corp hangar array wouldnt be there if ccp didnt intend for it to be used
your boohoohoo tears fuel both my hulk and my orcathank you
finally a normal arguement written in a normal waysecure containers are 100 safe that is why ccp refused to increase them in size compared to normal cans they are safe at the cost of size restrictions having to be anchored and having anchoring restrictions 5km range so ccp gave someone the option of being safe at the cost of it taking more effort which is exactly as it should be i have no problems with that at all if someone puts in the effort to secure his assets at the cost of efficiency then he gets to reap the rewardsnow we go to the orca it has a mining bonus which helps tremendously thats good it gets the tractor bonuses which just makes sense thats also good it gets a huge cargo hold and the hangar allows for storage of a bunch ships in case the miners need to defend their assets the ship fills its intended role to optimise and increase efficiency for miners and normally due to the tractor beam stuff it increases the security of their assets but adding to all the bonuses of efficiency size etc it also provides a 100 secure system thats too muchthat would be the same as saying that someone who doesnt put in the effort to make sure his t2 haulerfreighter gets ganked by using scouts or effort and some thinking should somehow get a free get out of jail card by adding immunity to being locked or scrammed or whatever or someone who bought himself a marauder instead of a normal bs cant be locked killed or jammed just because on top of the other bonuses the extra cost should make him fully immune it just doesnt make sense in this eve worldstating that people just make smart use of the options they have is true but that didnt stop ccp from saying that carriers shouldnt be used as haulers and thus added restrictions to them or them finally realising that nanoing needed to be contained if something is too good it needs to be changed and providing on top of a whole bunch of other bonuses a 100 safe option is overpowered
what about mining and flying back to station to drop it off
it increases security at the cost of effiency and effort thus theres no problem with it
not suportedas the old saying for salge thingits a featurewar dec the orca pilot and stop wining
an orca is not 100 safe in high sec it can be suicide attackedin response to the desire for larger containers ccp decided to give the community the orca you forget the original containers were released when there were no barges just laser equipped cruisersbattleships as the top mining shipsrather than release larger scs they released the orca which is a fleet ship increasing the multiplayer aspect of mining even if many do it with alts its not a ship most can get into real quick unless they were already trained up for fleet boosting with mining foreman while piloting a hulk you have at least 120180 days for most starting characters current not expansion to even be functional in the orcaits expensive balanced out now to about half a billion isk or so for the hull close enough to a freighter in cost when outfitted most small operations will not be able to afford one and will just cargo rig hulks or anchor a gsc for transfer into a hauler on station resulting in the same security as the orcayou just have to hunt more and farther or resort to options you choose not to uselook on the bright side your style of play was one of the reasons ccp released the orca you changed eve online just not in the way you wanted it to evolve
a bit like being a pirate in an npc corp you meanif people are using a 500m isk ship as a giant secure container thats their right 500m isk is a an expensive cargo can
would make a nice roleplay added featurepersonally i would like this added to an overhaul of the station functionsnot the features but the underlying mechanics so npc goods offered and demanded was linked together so players could basically provide different types of goods to make the station create other types of goodshigh sec concord station demanding militants to increasemaintain security statusdemands of tourists to raise prices on luxury goods etcthere are so many items that could be linked in ways to promote more contentif linked with an import export order function it could also make it easy for ccp to spawn these demands by some simple scripting from a type of rules tables
anything that makes the world richer and increases the amount of professions im all forim hoping for a method to turn militants into ferrogel
yes yes yes for the love of gods yes
why are you bringing the klan into this 
whilst im sympathetic to your point the eve populace is dominated by white heterosexual males aged 1840im afraid that they fear that theyll be even further marginalised by being asked to treat people of a different sexualracialreligious orientation with a modicum of toleranceits already so hard to be a white male in the western world already you see they need to fight oppression and express themselves by making childish jokes about men having sex its an important part of the latent selfexpression
tolerance isnt acceptance dipstick it is just the act of allowing something to take placei can think that guys shoving their genitalia up each others digestive tracts is funny whether you like it or notall i have to do to be tolerant is not try to stop it and i dont so by all means continue whining here wont get you any high fives or status just stop bumping this nonsense
i can bump whatever or whoever i like but i thought your focus on the mechanics of anal sex was quite enlightening as to your personal feelings on the matter
i dont appreciate your racist joke i demand to have you banned
op id flame you for being thin skinned but im sure youd find a way to spin it as a hate crimesuffice to say not everyone who disagrees with you is discriminating against you you do not have the right to never be offended
 this in flaming letters 10 feet highwhat really amuses me about the whole discussion is its all freedom of expression this and freedom to choose that unless of course they dont agree with your choices or your expression in which case its badand that goes for both sides frankly best thing that could happen to this thread is for it to be locked

bcs are my favorite ship class unfortunately they dont have anything near the variety of say cruisers or battleships 1 for more bcsalso faction bcs
the upcoming apocrypha expansion pack  its new ai will lead to massive changes  as drones will be more often targeted gallentaeans players will have to rely on blasters  railguns   which are just    messed   so it seems pve will have sense only for caldariamarr even maybe minnmatarrccp do hate us
ok i posted on this subject before but i want to make a new pointi have lots of pvp experience fighting in close range battleships and my weapons of choice are blasters acs mega pulsegiven that i can fight effectively using all of those weapons i would not go as far as to say that blasters are ineffective however it is clear to me that blasters do not offer any significant advantages over mega pulse autocannons are also rather soso but at least they are easy to fit blasters have fitting problems especially with cpu  which would be ok if they really had some major advantagesright now properly fit close range bs of different factions perform about same  with mega pulse having slight advantage with the superior optimal and easier fitting to support armor tank autocannons seem rather bland i guess ccp would call it balance  all ships performing about same way but what i want is greater variety blasters are supposed to be the most damaging weapons that are optimized for close range combat that is simply not so when compared to performance of other weapons blasters have no clear advantages they are just like other gunsyes i see how this is balanced but it is a boring form of balance and frankly mega pulse is still better  for pure tank and gankwhy cant we have more clear cut differences between different fighting styles
we really need ccp to rethink corp access and affiliationthere really isnt any reason why we should not be able to work for more than one corpremove the 24 hours limit thing and let it only apply for actual unaffiliationsespecially in these days where administering and leading corps is needed it could really be usefullmake it possible to shift corps instantly if you are already affiliated the max number of corps joined could be skillbased or totally open would be preferred though
you must be on drugs or something
sadly 9999 of the ideas that the op post here and in other parts of the eveo forums make be believe that drugs are involved
someone wants to instantly corp hop to avoid war decsno and gtfo
well sort of self evident to the idea that you couldnt shift corp and avoid a wardecyour wardec would follow you like your involvement in the corp
hello all this might already have been suggested but im gonna post it anywayswhy not make a ship that can create a cloak bubble around it it would have to be able to cloak for a limited amount of time this would definately result in some interesting warfare tactics
very astutethe point is that we can and do survive without such omniscience that the game suffers for it while in its absence elsewhere nothing doesnot that it hurts me ill go on checking to see if my enemies are around and plan my battles around the online or offline status of buddies be they at war with me or pirates
i would prefer if these intel tools especially concerning the buddy list would be removed on an optional basis yes it is nice for my buddies and useful for my enemies to know exactly when i am online and when i am not i should still have the option to have some privacy and i do have that in every kind of social application i have ever usedi would highly appreciate if i had the option to set myself toonly show online status to people on my buddy listonly show online status to people in my allianceonly show online status to people in my corponly show online status to people in same channel as medont show my online status to anyone
this
although i wasnt origninally in favor of changing anything about it after all it is the future and we have ships 11 miles long but we cant know whos in the same system as us but this is a good idea allowing for a little bit of privacy
the new effect doesnt give the feeling of traveling fast like the current one does so i do prefer the currenti was delighted to find the screen judder removed though
i do like the current one more but i mean its an effect no mechanics have changed because of this its just how something looks
the only thing i miss is the sonicboom noise that used to be there but then there was no sound at all a few days ago so its hard to say what the final product will look like
i like the looks of all the other effects i saw in that video very much except the new warpthe new warp effect without that halo of visibility in the direction youre going surrounded by blurred sides really made you feel you were travelling if possible i would love ccp to keep that
if it needs some additional effects i wouldnt mind what you see in this intro of freelancer
signedthe new effect in its current form is hideous if you think that looks good then i really think there is something wrong with you that screenshot is merely the offshoot of other people warping its impossible to see whats going on with just a couple of warps on grid as in the picture let alone the amount warp ins you would see at a busy trade hub i am less than 5km from the station and yet i can barely see iti really suggest that anyone who hasnt seen the effect for themselves do so before commentingthe old one is a classic effect that looks great its is not over the top and all pseudo scifi the old effect gives a great sense of speed and that you are actually warping its fits what is expected to happened when you go into warp to my mind at least its something that when i first played eve made me go damn thats cool i really just cant see that with the new effect
i think it is very relevant to consider this one in ref to later ambulationwhy not make a special character transport contract where you basically gets dropped at a location of the transporting shipso you could pay for safe passage or hitch rides free a small thing would be balancing that you arent actually on the ship and you might do stuff while someone is transporting you an easy solution would be that you would enter a ship that could not fly transport cubicle and a twin was carried by the contract holder so in effect while in the cubicle you might have to hang outside the station waiting till completion of the tripnaturally the better way would be to actually be able to be transported on any ship while in your pod best solutionadd tractors ability to target and pull pods and you have the ransom game increased toscoop to cargo for this removing yourself from cargo should not be possibleit would be rather exciting to get tourism in the game this way
the details need work support for the general hitchhiking idea
most of what you said didnt quite make sense tbhbut i like the idea maybe paying someone to transport a jump clone after they moved it you can jump
not anymore looks like it wont be making into march expansion
ops points 1 and 4 supported 2 would be a bit too much and 3 is a bit meh one way or the other
i like the first proposal not s fan of the second one especially with ambulation around the corner besides if people cant be bothered to check local andor cant be bothered to put in teamwork effort to provide intel then thats their problem
well i have to give this rather nice idea a little additioni am all for more game around space and a really neat way is to do something like op mentionedi think dock and undock should be added to the autopilot wait hear me out but when you undock you cannot warp close to station you have to wait till you clear a bubble sized by some factor like station security etcthe campers then needs to wait till the ship clears the vicinity of the station thus you can undock to see if someone is out there unless they are cloaked and if they are you have to redock and with the timelimit with this stations could be camped a bit more like gateswell something along those lines atleast
oh thatll be why they have specifically stated over and over again that it is a working as intended and was b not meant to be yet more income for mrsbecause they hadnt actually noticed it
emphatically agreeing with the op salvage theft is a horrible exploit and should be stamped out as soon as possible
sure why not make the game easier no problem makes it easier for killing you if you can get into bigger more expensive ships faster and you think you know what you are doingpeople think that if they have alot of isk or sp earlier on that the game will be easier for them that if they had 20mil moar sp they wouldnt have gotten pwnd or probed out or lost their ratting raven to a quick gank squad anything to overtly make this game easier for the masses is really not in their best interest the game is complicated and you are going to spend alot of time failing in the first couple months before you get ur feet underneath you but if this combat simulator buisness is true i feel like it will turn into wow so why not use isk people just dont get it
i feel like voting yes just to show my approval of this wonderful idea and the forum which which it was made possible 3 chears for the epicness of this mans mind and we are all smarter for having read this post
no
nojust in case you missed it
as other people have already stated you can buy skillpoints with iskreal cash alreadyits called the character bazaar stop by there sometime
nonever
this bad idea has been hashed and rehashed and again its a resounding no are you fking stupidplus in a way we do pay for sp by purchasing implants the more sp per hour the more you have to pay for the better implant
not supported and you should be podded back to a prealpha clone for suggesting it one you cant buy your way out of
post here your screenies so ccp can ban them or at least do something painfullmacro miners
good god dont start disuading egotistical tools from posting in caodthats an idea up there with sealing your drains because of the smell id rather everywhere else didnt stink of  as well
indeed the situation where a pirate repairs their own dronesfighters and gets a gcf isnt considered a bugthis is a dumb mechanic with no real justification for its function and an ideal topic for the csm to raise
well i brought up the topic and my fellow csm members shot it down immediately they voted 8 against before i could even finish my proposal so i followed suit i do like the idea but apparently the major alliances do not
as things are we have a non working bounty system and a rather hyper aggressive killrights systema whole new gameplay and fixed issues would be the result if the following was addedkillrights was based on witnessed aggression only so targetingshootingdestroying and killing was 4 different actions if you got targeted you got a right to target back if killed to kill in return the rights would go on the character sheet and be removable like bookmarks and possible to give and trade with other players the time a right like this was active would be based on type and security of the system observed in so in 10 a whole month in yellow a week in red 24 hours and in 00 not relevant because not witnessedthe idea is that the victim gains an advantage to use against the aggressor in the future maybe someone would like to be able to later attack or target etc this offender without concord interference this only goes in non patroled space like the belts concord should never accept any aggression near gates unless its wars near stations there isnt any concord unless its a concord stations naturally so this is unpatroled spaces like the asteroid fieldsthe reason for such a system is to make players govern more justice i such a system you could basically remove security rates and let all pilots roam in high sec those with low security rating should only have the disadvantage of not being able to dock on stations naturally if they aggress without killrights they are attacked by concordbounty system needs to simply be based on standing so the person claiming a bounty would only get percentage based on standing from the issuer so if a bounty is composed by say 10 people or corps the individual standings would decide the resulting payout standing 10 is all and standing 0 would be skillbased and be taken equally from each bounty provider percentage based so if you destroy a ship your skill and the ship types value would decide the payout thus the result would be that you could still clear your bounty theoretically but only by sacrificing an extremely valued ship and only if the ship exceeded the value of the bountysuch a system would improve player to player standing usage and social interaction the profession bounty hunter would mean something and the bounty hunters would need to get killrights to be able to aggress in secure space thus becoming a sort of player police
an anticheat team of employees that can be petitioned by ingame players to see if a particular player is using a macro or not macromining is becoming extremely common especially in highsec and it wouldnt be hard for ccp to determine who is a macro and who isnt if they looked at the accused players habits with their own eyes
is macromining really on the rise again last time i checked the minerals price index it didnt look much like it unless the macrominers stopped mining veldspar
there was a timing strength on targetting suggested somewhere that would solve a lot of macroingtarget risk being lost coherency loss this based on target size target speed and number of active players targetingthe effect would be that macroing would be a bit difficultalso if the coherence reduction was really tough on multiple targeters it would also change things a bit on some situations in combatin mechanics it would be simple to add this to roids simply have them invisibly use target scrambling might work
sorry been looking for it id swear ive seen it said by someone at ccp but i cant find the post so i guess what i said has to be disregarded hate it when that happens
i have seen the post at least once but i dont recall whereall i know is that ccp didnt intend jump clones to do what they are doing due to the nature of jump bridges the titans jump driveand a few other nuances
aww pooi wanted to bring up the hello kitty kestral of doompouts
if it was up to me scomi i would absolutely add the hello kitty kestrel of doom to eve and i would only allow you to have one any additional lag would be more than compensated by the additional ice cream sundaes i know you would be sharing with our alliance issler
i have very little that i think needs to change i like the game pretty much the way it is because im part of a corp that sets goals and then tries to achieve them i dont need eve to put additional things in to entertain me however since i wouldnt want you to think i was avoiding your questionposs shouldnt shoot alliance mates if their sec status is lower than what the pos is set to shoot you can check the box to allow alliance mates in but if they fly outside the shields they can be shotfacwar should be sustainable for small ship pilots frigate and destroyers putting bounties on rats in complexes could help with this if they have bounties inline with low sec ratsthose are the only things that come to mind right now that need addressing
ive read through your comments and once again its like a bunch of words that dont add up to anything so if youd like to make a point or ask me a question go ahead otherwise i dont see anything to respond to here
you can go for days critiquing others ideas and this is all that comes to mind when youre asked to be constructive i am disappointed in you niskinbeing an avid reader of csm dealings i thought you could at least attempt to give some credit to other professions in evefor example drone ai and disconnect issues with recalling drones would be a large boon to many players the problem with probes and dockingdisconnects which is now going to be fixed in the next expansion with a whole new system what about being able to import premade fits onto ships using the fitting screen is that also an unneccessary addition to eve would you prefer that ccp just retire now maintain the game only and never improveyou are more than willing to offer excessive criticism of others but very much lacking in your own content give constructive criticism or stop trolling hereill help you out this is what a discussion looks like try to emulate it in future responses and youll be much better received
what i said is still true sure maybe there are some new shader options that allow for minor variations in what is rendered but thats a far cry from custom ship paint jobs its unlikely that alliance and corp logos are preloaded on the client which means they would have to do so for any pilots in system before you hit a point where they could render any shipsin case you didnt notice ccp is already behind the gun on performance they did this whole need for speed initiative to reduce lag which was badly needed now that theyve made some good progress on it the last thing they need is something that takes them in the other directionwhat eve needs is more pilots taking risks and more corps setting goals and trying to achieve them if you need custom paint on your ship to motivate you to achieve something then there is a problem if there are unused portions of space and you see that as a problem then move there and occupy them solve the problem yourself the game allows for it its how the game works
drone ai has been improved since i started playing and i dont have a problem with how it works now ive never had or heard of a disconnect problems with recalling dronesive never had a problem with the probe system nor have i had or heard of disconnect problems from probing in fact last i heard the system on test is worse than the current system ill wait for final release to judge it thoughyes its unnecessary although it wouldnt hurt anything either i dont care if they put it in or not as long as it doesnt break or slow down anything elsejust because i have criticisms doesnt mean i should have counter suggestions i think ccp has done just fine with this game prior to the csm and while some useful changes could come from the csm its more likely that a bunch of whiners will just toss pointless requests at them and some will get through so maybe my suggestion would be this just because somebody thought of it doesnt mean it should be implemented to your final comment about facwar if ccp wants people to keep doing it then they should do things to keep people from needing to stop doing it lag and cost are both issues there but not always issues for the same fw pilots i think both are important and since they are already looking at the lag id say theres no reason to switch priorities
i am going to tldr this for you niskinyou are a hypocrite your statements change from one post to the next this is the point some of us are trying to make heresomewhere a bridge misses its troll dearly
players who are disconnected are unable to regain control of drones without approaching each drone individually which can be difficult to manage and very time consuming quite needlessly for say a mining barge amid asteroids or so ive heard the same follows for losing control of scanning probes which can be quite time consuming to place and expensive which were needlessly lost before the new system on sisi was introduced provided it works as intended when it hits tranq ive heard many positive reviews of the system and most complaints are from bugs which are being resolved although we both know there will always be those people who resist changeso anything that can save you time and optimize the game is superfluous would you prefer if eve were a text based game no lag seriously though arguing that we should only change what is necessary is arguing that eve is by design perfect and all thats left is a few bugs judging by the fact that there are still expansions being released i think ccp would disagree with you ccp created this game and im sure theyre perfectly capable of judging their players desires and  catering to those desires if this were not the case we would not be receiving expansions your alliance pos mechanic would never be changed come on ccp and eve would not be in its current state of growth and prosperityi believe you just supported the idea of catering to the players needs and desires you dont need an incentive to keep fighting in a pointless war if that is your goal right also you do need counter criticisms and ideas otherwise youre just another one of the mindless sheep of eve
wow anyone who disagrees with this is completely wrong wrong wrong learning skills are completly pointless everyone is saying training learning skills is a choice thats like saying you could run out of the way of a bus about to run you over but you also have a choice to crawl out of the way of the bus thats about to run you overyah i guess it is still a choice but its obvious to most people which one you would choosei dont know about you but i play mmos over the long term i mean thats the whole appeal about mmos is their replay value so when i made my first character and found out about learning skills i thought oh well i guess i will train all my learning skills up so that i can train everything else twice as fast but in the back of my head i was saying well this is really stupid why do these skills even exist in the first place if they are basically required by anyone that plans to play for more than a month hey ccp you would like players to play for more than a month rightand as far as reimbursing players who already trained learning skills just calculate how much sp they have trained in learning skills and give them a 2x sp rate until they have earned that back easy and clean any intelligent person can plainly see learning skills are pointless i mean i had to literally think about it for 2 seconds to know this there is no valid argument against removing learning skills

gotta love cp posters
not really going to run seriously how would i explain to people irlhey guys im going to iceland to talk about internet spaceships in a very serious business manneri would just get some funny looks imho
lol good find  i love yes minister but had never thought it applicable to eve politicking d
do they pay your airfare out to icyland
they used to but with recession looming they just send mitnal to pod you a few minutes later you wake up in a maintenance closet in rekyavikincidentally this explains a lot about the current csm plainly not everyone has updated clones
that makes a lot of sense lolin both ways 
just tell them you saw a really hot avatar and you think she might be theretheyll understand
i might even consider to candidate myself for csm after this one
is this a play on how csms are little more than the cleaning staff
i think the csm are unequivocally ccps cleaning staff these days
funnily enough ccp should be licking the csms boots and kiss their asses while they dig through logs to see wtf gms do ingame really or at least thats what ccp promised us when they got this crazy csmideaironic its now rather a show for the galleries mmo democracy is more like a democrazy and csm have to eat the scs off the ccp table while ccp chestbeats about this system in international media it reminds me of somethingthe united nations
dont knock the un nobody does pointless existance like the un does pointless existancenot being bound to any laws under the geneva conventions is a plus thoughwant to  and murder join the un and go to warbetter yet vote pompous in the next csm electionseven if you dont want to  and murdervote pompous in the next csm elections
its true no one does useless existence exceptthe league of nationswtg on manchuria btw guys if i get in i will guarantee to uphold the values we hold so dear in cp and i will not rest until they have been spread across the whole eveo forumsty for your encouragement  without your initial suggestion none of this funtime would have been possible
i will run too cp seems to have changed a little you need people to see this change and move with the flow to go over the apex and try to see beyond itand yes i am talking utter trash it is what i am good ata vote for me is a vote for liberalism and freedom my version anyway
the bandwagon has started just remember team poupous got there first anyway more candidates can only be good and whilst we might disagree on matters of ideology i hope and pray we are all united in bring the spirit of cp to the rest of the forums

the best thing about caod is that the crap and poor quality posting there normally stays there and do not flood to other parts of the forumas such i think keeping caod in the way it is is pretty fine let those who need to spam their pointless crap there so i can ignore it
its not like caod was ever a high quality forum its always been bad we as goons have simply removed the middleman of fauxhonor which went out the door anyway as soon as someone didnt cowtow to the status quo of fellating bobs supremacygood riddance
this sticky will be returned new and improvedif a member of the csm could get in contact with me at the email in my signature thatd be fantastic
i have to say first thanks a bunch for your support vuknow that thats out of the way i wanted to comment on somethingive been on singularity recently and there has been a change to the assets window made i actually spoke to lavista vista about this ingame about two days before it hit he didnt give me any details but i was talking to him about the whole item tabbing idea and he told me there would be a change in store for the assets window that related to itnow i am pleased as punch by this and i certainly dont want to look a gift horse in the mouth or  ccp off by flaming their hard work but i still want morethe interactivity of the new assets window really is a great step in the right direction but it still feels clunky and foreign the sorting mechanism of the assets window in station tabs is very much like what i envision for the item tabbing functionality except that the player would have control over where items go how to sort them and more importantly how to manage themlavista mentioned that actually this had been discussed with ccp before but at the time of the talk there was a technical issue involved with implementing it again there were no details but it seems crazy to me that this could be so hard to do when we have the mechanism ingame already in two places no lesssadly i know next to nothing about computers and i really and truly could not begin to speculate what the issue would be or how to get around it but the item tabs feel so close so vuk if youre reading this it would be awesome if you could bring this up to ccp again and see if they have come up with anything if they havent maybe you could ask them just exactly what the obstacle is and if they have plans at all for overcoming it in the near futureim pretty sure this would benefit just about everybody in eve in a very basic way so i say keep the thumbs up coming
i say no name changebut think something along with titles or nicknames could be good i do not know much about fw so forgive me if i seem like a noob this could well have been suggested already and the example below does seem alot like other mmos like lotro  wow etc so maybe we shouldnt ask for itwe could have something like the hero of battle name when you have achived a certain number of fw victories or slayer of ship type or role when you kill x number of ships in fw
uhh hell nosome of the largest institutions on built on a single intangible asset called trust part of this trust goes with the name of your toonthis trust factor extends to every facet of the game and permeates everything we do from contract sales to market orders want to sell forums secondary markets ebank alliances research services corp creation services etcyou allow changing of names and youve pretty much instantly torn down everything that makes eve eve
incorrectlet me tell you a story which just recently happend within the secondary market of evewe had a person using a toon called xabier create an investment opportunity involving capital ships the plan was vetted it seemed sound and the amount initially asked for was well within reason for a capital startup program the investment went through as plannedfast forward two months later dividends have been paid out on a regular basis and the person wants to expand the expansion is met with limited resistance and goes through without much hasslesfast forward another month another dividend has been issued this time however another person evn who has a small relation to xabier wishes to launch a seperate investment opportunity long story short the evn rode on the coat tail success of xabier to a multi billion scam which in turn xabier ended up walking away with close to 70b because of the trust he had built upnow fast foward 2 weeks after the  hits the fan those of us who care about the secondary market notice that evn is attempting to offload alts on the character bazar we also notice that fake transactions of toons have been made to obfuscate toons between accounts all this is made public and any reasonable person can likely just search for xabier on eve search and pretty much bring up the entire historynow and forever the names involved in the scams above will forever be tainted character sales involving them wont fetch as much theyll always be a black markedleave the option to changes names even with a history about them and you take that away and open the door for more situations of abovetrust is the biggest and priciest commodity in the game lets not devalue it anymore than we have to
this is a good idea i think some of of the comments against this are stupid you take this game too serious saying you wont make as much to sell a toon or even that more people are going to get ripped off is stupid i think that if you can get an aka when you search a name then this should just be added heck its another thing ccp can charge us for win win
case in pointwe now know youre associated with the alliance efferus vehemens inasnum latrociniumthe names of those in that alliance are on the linetheir reputation is tied to your reputationnow imagine if this toon had been used to scam someone not saying you havetrust and reputations here are a pillar of gameplay within eve names are a big part of that since character sales can be tracked via the game forums we can trace when and where names have gone pretty easily now and any other transfers outside of the game forums are a violation of the tos which can be reported since it often leads to rmt scammers etceven if there is a history of names it just adds one more layer of obfuscation which dilutes the trust respect reputation we have currentlyforgive me if i tore into you but obvious alt is obvious with the scant posting history
afaic all of the people whining about zomg favoritism are just jealous chribba has done a lot for the eve community push the veldatar up into amarr
chribba definately deserves a little favoritism not only is he the go to guy for trades involving complete trust in the other party he is also been a big part of the eve community most 00 alliances have done less then chribba for eve p an before you say thats bs go look how many alliances are in 00 counting those without sov
hmmm this is either1 chribba wanting to show off the giant vedatar or2 chribba wanting a way to sneak in a titan to the amarrian homesystem so he can ddd the amarrian royal family and then put himself on the throneeither way i am all for it love live emperor chribba the 1st i mean chribba the king of mining
boost them
im amazed by how stupid you are every time you post and ive seen you fchmm yes ccp please boost missile damage so the phoenix im training for is even stronger tia
if you havnt figured this out yet yaay1 youre a complete idiot2 the nag does not have the highest dps of a gank dread both blaster moross 7k and revs do more 57k edit even without drones both do more3 youre a complete idiot4 get out of my threadedit totally meant drones not clones
5 your intel sucks pl hasnt banned phoenixesedit no wonder you guys are losing so bad right now
the only difference between a macro and how it is now is that some poor unlucky sap has to sit at the pos for hours and anchoronline each module have you ever setup a deathstar by yourself let alone 5 in one sitting i doubt it you should go do it before you comment on things you know nothing aboutif you think mm would have any more pos than they do now with this mechanic in you are mistaken fuel is what keeps pos spam in check the anchoring mechanic is a uselessmindless time sinkthis is a major reason why pos is  full support
i suggest two things to balance out your ideafirst limit the ammount of pos modules to be qued to the levels of anchoring your have so if you have anchoring 4 you can have 1 module onlining and 3 qued up etc etc secondly i really think that there should be a modifier to the time that pos modules take to anchoronlineunanchor either tied in to the anchoring skill itself maybe 5 reduction per level or a brand new skill altogetherwith your current proposal i do not support it too many advangates as many above me have posted i do however agree with where you are coming from balance it a bit and you will get a thumbs up from metldrno for now balance it better
this1 for treelox
i support this fully especially now that you can only anchor 5 towers per alliance to prevent towah spam
what he said add in those changes and im happy to say yes to this
the point of pos anchoring is to be a heavy demand full setup a tower takes 46 hours of time but you can currently manage 5 at a time in 1 system meaning 1 person can do the work of 5 if he rotates onlining at towers that alone is enough i refuse to support anything that encourages more tower spammingwhile the balance is better in that version its still not great lets see what changes this patch brings to pos apparently there are some things in store then worry about it more if queing ever were added the person needs to be limited to modules onlining in system not per tower i mean ffs thatd just be easy street
the current system seems to be attempting to create game balance through player pain its like saying i dont want you spamming towers so if you really want to you have to treat it as a fulltime job im fairly sure it wasnt intended that way but it seems to be how its worked out and its unspeakably horrible game design if tower spamming is too easy make it harder to support  more expense being the most likely option but im sure there are others  but dont make a player click one button every ten minutes for a day and call it a game nobody wants to pay 15month for a boring unrewarding deadend job and yet thats what some players are saddled with now because of this system the details may need some work but the meat of the proposal is entirely necessary
supporting teh cause1
hell yeah supportedps also some collateral changes to the marketcontracts would be nice see this post
these arent the only needed changes to the courier systemfor the love of god take off the 120k cap already but they do sound quite interesting anything that makes this aspect of the game work better  and this would  im all for
this is a issue i believe is very wrong for a mmo to make possibleif you look at 00 today you will see a few alliance names but if you get down to the politics more there is really only about 34 alliances that control 95 made up number but my feeling of 00 spaceto me this is not only game breaking in what i believe a mmo should be but could be game killing no eve is not dieing yeti want to bring this to the csm to bring to ccp to push for changes to 00 so that a small handful of alliance cant control all of null seci realize ccp want it to theoretically be possible for 1 alliance to control all of 00 but that should only be possible if the alliance meets no resistance even the smallest amount of resistance should be able to stop such domination from happeningmy view is that a alliance that numbers in the thousands should only truly be able to control 1 region or so of space but as things are with planning a cap fleet can make it from the far south to the far north in just a short time framei believe this should not be possible to move your cap fleet from far south to far north and then if you get attacked in south while in the north just turn around and come home with relative easei am not sure how this could be changed but i do believe it should be risen to ccps attention perhaps a way of changing this would to make it so a cap ship could only make 24 jumps and then need a cool down period of 24 hours doing something like this would make people thing more about moving there cap fleet to far way from home as doing so would open your home space up for attack as well as possible stranding your cap fleet in hostile spacenow i know there is nothing ccp can do about the political ties alliances have and there is no need in my opinion if it was very difficult for the large alliances to move there cap fleets around a small alliance in the north would not need to be allies or live in fear of a large alliance that was in the south at least not as much from a cap fleet stand pointso to summaries the issue as i see it is that there is only really 24 entities in most all of 00 that control it and if you are not part of them you can not be in 00 this to me is a very bad thing for a mmo this is a mmo after all not a three entity game
even with terrible mechanics like you describe i do not see how you can stop people from forming power blocks via napblue arrangements it is only natural that a group of small corporationsalliances will band together and wipe out the competition and that repeats until you have large power blocksyou could set lame restrictions like oh you cannot have more than 5 other alliances blue or whatever but restricting the sandbox somehow takes away from the completely free nature of 00 which is really what 00 is supposed to be anything can happen at any timeif you really want to destroy the 00 powerblocks instead of whining you should get your ship and start fighting
maybe ccp should add 2500 new systems that cant be claimed with sovoh wait
there are already multiple tweaks to 00 on the drawing board based on various threads on this forum overexpansion has been followed by a fall for every emipire in human history the mega alliances of eve have not shown a change in that pattern i do agree that it has become too easy to move too much too fast jump bridges jump freighters huge cynocapable fleets and even jump clones were detrimental to the bigness of the galaxy and have contributed to the ability of an alliance to control more space than could be controled before these tools existed i would like to see some nerfing of the ability to move massive fleets so far so fast
at least you admit you have no idea what youre talking about
tell you what when you reach the end of your lsd trip you can come backuntil then gtfolast i checked there where more than 2 to 4 alliances who had sovyou have no bloody idea what your talking about leave please dont let the door hit you
the problem here isnt the bumping its that he died in a mission if you die routinely youre flying missions bigger than you can handle and should downgrade if you die one in a thousand or so like you should and that one time happens to have both people scanning you out and them deciding to bump you to avoid fleeing then you are the most fantastically unlucky man to ever live it doesnt require a mechanic change though just a proper mission tank andor an aversion to lottery tickets
no change necessary
valid use of game mechanics
the ninja inside me is crying but i actually agree to some extent with the op its not really counterable still harassment petition would be bettertrust me you really really dont want what youre asking in the op what happens if i take my gank tempest and fly in front of your missionship causing you to bump me
as the title says so i am sick of the basic flaws of the nonofficial alternativesmost of these flaws are based around the fact that people actually have to do somethingcurrent problemspeople do not post their loss mailspeople do not post there kills jawdropping isnt itif i am involved in any sizeable fight it becomes necessary to scour scores of friendly boards to discover more of my kills where i did not get the final blowatm i have found that in order to get a true reflection of my contribution on just the corp killboards i have to look through endless alliances like razorplohgod tfckia  so many friends dam itthen i have to do the same again to update the alliance and coalition boards some people do invent these mails and nonofficial boards cannot tell a good piece of writing from the rael mccoywhenever new content appears there is a delay between the killboards index of what exists in game being updated and the new content being introducedim sure most of us have had kills after an expansion that can not be uploadedthe solutionofficial boards through the eve websiteif you contribute to a kill or get to the final blow or die it is under your profileif at the time youre in a corporation it is on the corporation boards and the same is true for an alliance you do not have to do anythingso if im in a large fleet battle and i want to know exactly how many people help kill and all the glorious details behind iti do not end up spending a good part of my life searching the internet to find thempotential unintended consequenceskillboards are a great source of intelligence they can tell your enemies exactly what youre doing and how you do it and who you collaborate withthe solution is simple have some settings so you can set a long delay on when kills appear or even that they never appearthats all i appreciate suggested improvements to the above happy supporting
no to official killboardsalso you realize most private killboards now run off director api keys so they automatically parse killslosses those boards then share that killloss data across a central database that all those killboards grab data from
i would support this if participation is 100 optional and those who opt out are never listed  whether they are the killer or the killee
dictors are crap by game mechanics bubbles linger after a ship dies so it essentially becomes a 20 mil suicide ship most alliances offer them free or they should if they dont pilots get back onto the field in the blink of an eye with bridging and its one ship that benefits from laglock times especially with the poor client response to guns as of late the last issue really isnt with the shipnone the less the ship needs changing im all for more speed on this particular ship or a huge bonus to sig reduction built in for some sort of defense but the trade off needs to be more pilot skill to stay alive rather than suicidalyou are right about client performance it alone would do more for the lock time issue than anything mentioned thus far dictors are my own personal battle to see the game restored to tacking support rather than dictor spams
supportedplease dont turn eve into wowstop helping the carebears
this should never make it into eve
i hope it forever stays dead and out of this gamethis would be the final straw in a subscription im still borderline on keeping
no pvp without risking your podby all means implement single player simulators but dont destroy world pvp look at every game that introduced instanced pvp and see what happened to world pvp when they did
given how well implemented this idea already is on singularity i see no imaginable reason to port it to tq i have no objection to better tools for consensual highsec pvp than mutual can theft but anything even approaching combat without risk on the real server should be avoided like the plague also given the thousand other things that could be done with that dev time even if i liked the idea id still tell them not to do it if you really have to rewrite some major chunk of the game to implement a feature overhaul how the database deals with blueprints so we can get differential blueprints for the same item as well as differentcoloured bpcs similar taskid imagine judging by what little evidence i have much more useful outcome even if that one would be much harder there are others that wouldnt be surely something has to take priority over introducing pvp into eve
this is exactly the same as what you can do now by logging onto sisi i dont see the real problemand what would it change do you think suddenly pirates would use this no they wont 00 alliances wont use it since you cant take space with a simulator suicide gankers wont use it so who exactly will use this simulator instead of starting the pvp the random carebear still gets dragged into normal pvp by pirates
im all for giving people to ability to duel for practice but the ranked bit is what did it for me
i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit its the only way to be sure
this
horrible idea
i agree no ccpenforced battleground the risk when undocking from a station should always remain throughout the eve universehowever i would always support a corporation or an alliance arranging a fighting arena for betting or entertainment purposes in the game but it should still involve risking your assets
say no to consequencefree pvp
guys this is a nonissue this situation has already been handled long agoso take it easy let this thread die trust me im completely against anything like this
the csm was informed of this feature while in iceland and have already expressed their opinions on this feature lets just say we werent that positive about it either and it wasnt just lavista that was against it
the mods allowing this thread to exist means that ccp devs arent reading these forums at all
good to know youre paying attention to whatever gets your feathers ruffled instead of my pointkeep trying chimp
im tired of having to walk on politically correct eggshellssticks and stones were all adults get over itwho cares what other people think about you as long as your happy with yourself
i support this more tech 1  2 ships for the followingdestroyers 12 more tech 1 and tech 2 variantsbattlecrusiers 12 more tech 1 and tech 2 variants
what about an exhumer for v which is larger than a hulk in size but a little weaker with same fittings and a a slightly larger cargo capacity but with a jump drive or a different type of jump driving using another fuel source since you wouldnt really want it to jump and mine and then jump again 
i ask what is the point the rorqual already does that we dont need another industrybased jump drive ship
id rather see a logistical change in how the exhumers are handled now making v required for the hulk and orca and buffing the yield amounts while changing the volume requirements on the low end minerals
i am a miner and i can emphatically say this would be a horrible idea hulks are overpowered as it isfrankly the mining mining barge and spaceship command requirements should all be raised to level 5 the way the ship is set up now it was obviously intended to maximize mining potential in low or null sec not high sec so lets limit it to low sec or trim its shield resistance boosts to no more that 25 per level or cut them altogether it wont stop the macro miners but it will sure slow them down some if they have to use smaller less efficient shipsvel
it is not overpoweredjust needs to be nudged to exhumers iv or v that or the covetor should be moved to iii or ivwhat makes a hulk overpowered are the bonuses you can stack on it
we already have three ships that you get exhumers v for i dont see why wed need a fourth the hulk is fineas are the mackinaw and skiff and we dont need or want better i could see some space for another exhumer with less capability and more security but really thats what an apocor hype or aba or rokh or mael is for
i most certainly do want better the exhumers are souped up barges thats what they are a barge is one of the component parts of an exhumer apparently you want to mine in combat ships because that makes the most sense if so why go for a preposterous puny munchkin like a rokh i want i will at some point to mine in a titan no dont say it obviously thats ridiculous too give the combat types frigatesdestroyerscruisersbattlecruisersbattleshipscovert opscommand shipscarriersmothershipstitanssomebody is going to point out the ones i missed for surewhy do they get all these behemoths why isnt a cruiser enough bang for your buck do you have to have titans is it really necessary wouldnt pvp be a lot more fun if it was just frigates destroyers cruisers and battlecruisers you know stuff you could actually afford to losein the mean time i get to dance around in a skiff which they had to give the mercoxit bonus if they ever wanted anybody to get one a mackinaw if im after ice two beams at a time and the hulk the only boat that kinda maybe does a halfway decent job of mining a fair amount of oreespecially dont give me a better mining boat that would be nothing short of sacrilege i mean a ship that can actually withstand the onslaught of three bored gankers without folding like a cardboard box and maintain its core functionality as an ore extractor what am i thinkingsome miners here think the hulk is too good and too easy to get i commented on that elsewherebigger and better combat vessels yes please bring it on moar firepower more types of guns a bewildering array of ammunition and thousands of ways to pimp out the slots when theres room left after the essentials are taken care ofa better exhumer there must be something wrong with mewhat i really should be going for is a combat ship with mining lasers thats what i always wanted mining a commodity into a purse yay me why not equip the velator with spoons would that be fair enough lets just scoop the ore out of the rocks and carry it to the station one spitball at a time that would be a challenge truly worthy of new edenthis actually ticks me off no end to wit exhumers v totally in line with the 5based scheme of eve allows for an exhumer with five laser mounts it serves as a deep core mining unit strictly for nulsec operation its slower because it has to put more energy in the beams but it mines and refines its own ore in a hold the size of an orca and it has a freightersized tankthere you go thats the one i wanted to mention in the first placei will call mine olof palmeabulurd bonifaceme meceo
the exhumers are mining ships yes the hulk is a covetor with extra cargo hold a bit more tank and 915 yield and the other two are basically hulks that get a fourth high for mining one specific type why is that such a bad thing its exactly what the exhumer family ought to look like and i dont suggest mining in combat ships per se what im saying is that there is no reasonable place for a higheryield mining ship to be added to the game so the direction it could go in is for greater security with reduced yield however we already have that which is why i mentioned the rokh  a hulk set up for max yield mines 1326 m3minute whereas a rokh gets 1059 or 80 as much however it gets about 4x the effective hp base and can get up to 9x if you want it of course you can also go far higher if you start stripping mining upgrades to get your cpu back and fit up a proper battleshipsized shield tank instead of the cruisersized buffer tank that i have on that fit given that the niche for a ship that mines almost as much as a hulk with far better protection is filled by the five eightturret battleships asis i see no need for adding a new one of the same design intent to the exhumers list since ive already dismissed the fourstrip exhumer as a bad idea and i cant think of any other natural niches for a new exhumer to fill im not going to support the idea of adding a new exhumer to the game theres no need for a new one because the hulk is fine and adding anything better would just lead to silly results especially if you follow though on your idea of giving it refining ability as well hope thats clear also why would you want to mine in a titan its been done
hey just out of wonderinstead of just podding it back to base in a pod could there be a way of hijackingstealing ships in combatit would add a whole new level of action to the game if there was
if a ship is ejected from anyone in a pod with the ability to fly that ship can jump in what youre basically proposing is giving people a reason to eject more often  since i dont think anyone would like a game where their ship can be entirely stolen from them by pirates theyre actually sort of doing this with tech 3 as it happens  given the skill loss from losing a ship and the 2minute wait for selfdestruction there may actually be combat ejections happening a lot more often so yeah interesting but i dont see anything the csm could reasonably propose here see how t3 works out
the problem with your statement especially in these days where administering and leading corps is neededyeahwe dont need more corps we need less of them imo if a corporation was started and needs leadership then what the hell was it started for so no no support at allisaac
how about we change absolutely nothing about them except to call them guilds that would nullify thisuh idea

bombs have so many stupid interactions at present if this is one of them it ought to be fixed
aye
im in favour of removing these hackedtogether intel tools in favour of real intel tools dont know what the details ought to be although ive seen many interesting proposals but longterm local and buddy should be tools for conversing with randoms and friends not for spying on enemies
judging by the effects video i rather like the new one im all for its bugs getting fixed though of course that said even if it was the worst idea since nobody will ever uncouple their reactor arrays the csm couldnt do anything until months after it was released anyways this isnt realistically speaking the right forum for this complaint
 this
the new effect is ugly and disruptive
some one need to stop it this is madness
because it is linked to several other graphic effects and so it is not possible change it back without touching other part of the graphicsi think that a option to tone down or remove some graphics effects included the warp effect currently on sisi would be a good idea
yet the sleip with xlarge booster more guns bonus to all medium projectile weapons more dps better speed is working as intended i dont want a huge dps boost being able to hit at 70k is more than enough but having the option to fit close range weapons hams like every other races commandships can do is only fair everywhere in 00 ccps endgame needs a mwd or you can easily get stuck in a bubble so trying to debate that seems kinda moot especially when the sleip can fit the mwd with its xlarge booster cap booster full rack of guns its imbalancedmaybe i should change it to nerf the sleip p which i dont want since commandships should be amazing like the sleipabso
active tankwith large sb or buffer tank nighthawk can fit hams just fine
no they cant show us your failfits also an t2 active tank on a nh is pathetically weakto clarify  the whole point of field cs is to fit a gang mod  otherwise they offer nothing over their t1 counterparts so any proposed nh fit must include a gang mod for example an active hamhawk requires three rcu iisnighthawk active ham gmdamage control iireactor control unit iireactor control unit iireactor control unit iiballistic control system iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivelarge shield booster iimedium electrochemical capacitor booster i cap booster 800photon scattering field iiinvulnerability field iiheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy terror assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy terror assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy terror assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy terror assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy terror assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy terror assault missilesiege warfare link  shield harmonizingcore defence operational solidifier icore defence operational solidifier ieven a bogstandard buffer hmhawk requires two fitting modsnighthawk bufferhmdamage control iireactor control unit iipower diagnostic system iiballistic control system iiballistic control system iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivelarge shield extender iiphoton scattering field iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iiheavy missile launcher ii caldari navy scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii caldari navy scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii caldari navy scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii caldari navy scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii caldari navy scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii caldari navy scourge heavy missilesiege warfare link  shield harmonizingcore defence field extender icore defence field extender iyou do not see nighthawks in pvp because they cannot fulfil their intended role a ship that requires two fitting mods for a basic fit is broken

yeah and minmatar capitals lag behind all the other racesthe races differ in ship classes and im sorry but the caldari have it good in plenty of other areasif were going to be doing some buffing minis need some love first
lol  matars need a nerf not a buff everybody knows this 
probably too much work to implement realistically but ill give it a thumb for being sufficiently amusing anyways
only if you can kill the hitchhiker when you get blown upand the idea is full of holes but it is amusing
no one would use it for fear of being podded open to far too many explotations and grief tactics
frankly its normally just as easy to hop into a shuttle and fly myself there the trip time isnt going to be any shorterwhat would be cool would be some kind of npc transport service like the interbus only with real buses ie passenger spaceships you pay a fee to ride from one station to another and you can even watch the trip through your clientmeh id still fly myself probably
noccp has aimed to push the fact that the players are demigods if you dont know what im talking about do a youtube search for the new player intro movie being introduced in apocryphademigods can fly themselveshowever in the interest of interbus id love to see npc convoys transporting people or slaves or tourists around in space even better would be the ability to attack them and make some sort of profit the way you always hear about npc pirates doingbut thats roleplaying fantasy it will never be done not supported
allow bounty hunters to access warp gates and check who has passed through of course concord wouldnt allow such action so you will have to bribe them that way bounty hunters have a way to track their targets they should also be allowed to purchase a license from concord allowing them to kill a certain player in high sec that has a bounty players with a bounty can retaliate against their attacker  but they can never make the first movewhat do you guys think
accessing logs of people jumping seems crazy tbh imagine checking jitaperimeter gate itd take 12 years to loadas for buying kill rights the idea has been posed tons of times problem beinglets say they go on market when you open say markettrade goodscriminal evidencekillrightshow many different people are going to be listed there tonscontracts would work but honestly thatd just be hard to track down killrights also person could be somewhere you could be sitting right there they target you you figure they cant do anything they search killrights they buy it they start shootingit just isnt very good of an optioni say people with bounties may be hunted in high sec kill their pod and you get the bounty but you get to shoot their shipcurrently the bounty system is a farce basically you cant put a bounty on anyone that the value is  their clone upgrade cost or they just have their friend pod thembut even that idea doesnt work because whats killrights cost then 5000iski think in order to put a bounty on someones head you must have killrights on him you give up killrights in order to put that bounty also theres a minimum of like 1mil isk to do it
a new system was proposed and discussed with ccp in the 1st csm the outcome of that meeting can be found here unfortunately i cant find the actual proposal anywhere  if someone from the 1st csm could link it it would be handy
checking jumpstargate traffic nobuying kill rights make more sense
the original proposal is here i put together archives of csm submissions and ccp responses here and herethis is the one i found the link in a while back although it seems the master thread got 90locked while i wasnt looking if you can get it stickied ill remake the master and add csm 2 submission 1 to the list of threads since it does seem like a good resource to have sitting at the top of jpsc where everyone can see it
herschel thanks for the links  ccp is actually working on getting all that info into the evelopedia atm do your work while greatly appreciated may not be needed
i suppose the followup question here is whether the csm wiki is supposed to be public or not i know its actually got a pretty good set of issue lists and the like and a link to it is probably sufficient for things of that nature in place of doing it again on the forums or the wiki but if youre trying to keep it mostlyprivate then a workaround would be desirable

no covert ops cloak for killer battleshipseverything else is ok
subproposal 1 has my full supportsubproposal 2 sounds nice but should work like the directional scanner so no seeing cloaked ships and no pilot names just shipnames and types while integration with ambulation would be nice it would force it on players and i believe ccp already stated they dont want to do so
looking over the proposal i see several flaws first off just because people abuse station games doesnt mean they arent valid when your camped into a station you have a few options assuming your not going to use a jumpclone1 stay docked and online2 logout3 undock and attempt to run4 undock and fightnow if you implement a longer docking time for larger ships your basically removing the benefit of having a larger ship when dealing with being camped in fact by increasing dock time you basically ensure people will not undock to engage at all station games are more of an issue caused by there being realistically only 2 points to catch people consistently the station or gate since these are the easiest and normally only places to catch people unless theyre stupid youll get games like undock engage then redock hoping that your friendly station camper has to leave due to sentry fire or you can entertain him long enough for support to arrive the issue needs to be addressed indirectly to be effective
sorry but i could not support thisi view salvaging the same way it works in real life in international waters anyone can salvage any wreck and if you neglect or unable to salvage a wreck on the spot when you destroy a ship or you try to return to it later and its gone because someone else does the salvage then toughbeing frank if in lowsec or 00 space someone else is salvaging a wreck before you are able to then what is stopping you from greifing the salvager and then salvaging his wreck unless hes in a larger ship
never should a ninja salvager be aggrod the wreck belongs to the npc corp i think that the loot should also belong to the npc corp and not cause aggro if taken by someone other than the mission runner where is the line drawn if ninja salvaging caused an aggro flag to the mission runner on the ninja do you have abandoned drones flag aggro if they are scooped by someone other than the owner of the drones if a player ejects from a ship and leaves it sitting in space as long as youre trained to fly it you can board it and take it obviously ownership of that ship is the pilots only as long as they are aboard it mission runners are never aboard npc target obviously so why should they claim soul ownership over the entire wreck they get the loot or an aggro flag if the loot is stolen thats good enough in my opinion
johnthank you for you input in this thread i havent been by here much lately and was worried this wouldnt get bumped you didnt let me down and i appreciate that
once you leave the grid your drones are on they are no longer yours to control disconnecting is an unfortunate way to have that happen but then the mechanics of dcing and reconnecting are hairy in any game designing them to be convenient while preventing abuse of the mechanic is difficult the problem is that you cant tell if somebody dced on purpose or by accident and because of that any improvement in the system for people who dc is a possible option for abuse by intentional logoffskisid prefer ccp err on the side of caution in this area and the current mechanic doesnt bother meexpansions  new content although sometimes we get bug fixes or enhancements with them too generally those enhancements needed to be made to allow the new content to work properly i supported the idea that if ccp wants people to use facwar then they should eliminate some of the reasons why people might leave people will still use it even if they dont change anything just less of them and for different reasons than ccp originally intended imoagain im trying to make the point that just because somebody had an idea doesnt mean its a good one or that it needs to be implemented so if my position is that an idea is dumb it doesnt require a counter idea to be valid
err on the side of caution logoffskis are allowed in all number of situations as a valid tactic by ccp as they will not start trying to make the disctinction between those and a real dc in that situation it saves a pilots entire ship as probes expire on their own i fail to see how abuse of log offs in this situation can compare to avoiding gatecamps which is already allowedhow did you address what i said i didnt ask you to define expansion catering that was my point csm  opportunity to provide ccp with feedback also can be read as a way to allow ccp to better cater to their audience entirely correct no idea requires your approval to be implemented either eve will expand and grow its up to you to decide if you just want to shoot down ideas as you see them and only from issler while ignoring the rest of the csm board or take a more active stance in guiding eve where you would like to see it
niskintry quoting the whole post and addressing those points your lack of input is nonetheless still appreciated we were worried you might not come back and we appreciate that you have
first it will be eliminate all learning skills next it will be give us free skills you lamers you are whats wrong with gaming nowdays

csm in its current shape is a joke anywayeither keep the original intent or we might as well disrupt it as much as possible srsly yes why not vote someone in that has only one agenda  to close it down id vote for thatthink about it we the players pay for people to get transported to iceland and steal valuable development time from ccp the original intent was alot better  to check so ccp isnt being involved in fishy stuff ala t20 now they use the internal affairs for that which for all we know can be just as corruptednot that i personally care tbh i came back to eve thanks to t20 had forgot about this game and since that day i am still here but anyway before i am way off track again csm as it is right now just cost money to the players and they dont do  worth anyway theyre mocked and ridiculed by players they dont do what theyre designed to do and ccp hasnt earned trust in players as they wanted in light of that the most reasonable thing is to close it downso it makes perfect sense to just lolvote for csm or at least vote for someone that wants to close it down my vote is for pompous for lolz until someone will be running to seriously close it down then they get my voteshrugs

back to bisnis more sriusyou need a defined platform you also need exposure is it too late for a full page spread in eon maybe cough up the dough to get one of those ingame login adverts you need a website done in web20 with flashy transitions you need snazzy automated forum signatures that supporters can brandish in their posts maybe a certain insultomatic could be adapted into a voteomatic hmmm hmmmmmmm
tell that to goons they still try to kill him beating on the dead horse huhyou bastards
yes i agree entirely i will look into eon  maybe something can be arranged but are the elections on the nearhorizon an advert there in any event would be ideal great idea i fully accept the need for a snazzy web 20 site but i cant code for  lolbut ill just see what bills i can pay with the skills that i havebtw i was meaning to ask you about your sig i heartily agree that could be a great tool for getting the word out and i think itll only need a few modifications to change it from insulting the previous poster as it does now to insulting the previous poster for not voting for the right candidateor something heheany thoughts

i have read the blog and i am completely satisfied with ccps response in fact it is more that i expected thank you to the csm members who commented here i would have liked the blog sooner but seeing the quantity of info they provided i can understandsusungps oz you got my vote if you run again no attitude at all a perfect public servant
i think with the expansion walking in stations comes alot of things like u want it you can drink a beer with a corpmember or you play evepoker with a completly unknown stranger in a beautiful bar while exotic dancers try to make some extra moneyits not all you want but its the right way greets
i support this idea as long as a search on the old character name always brings up the new character id also suggest that the characters corp ceo if any and anyone who might have the character in a buddy list get an evemail informing him of the change

i support this seeing a player controlled titan for the first time was one of my high points in eve and was pretty jawdropping as it was a couple days after i registered everyone should be able to see a player controlled titan at some point
ambulation when it comes down to the wire is a side effect of the world of darkness mmorpg not interested in it never have been and never will bea revamp of the way poses work is far more of interest to my corporationthe csm is there to raise issues with ccp not just once but until those issues have been resolved so keep flogging the dead horse and bring the stinking carcass to every csm meeting and throw the maggot ridden mess on the table until ccp does something about it
there are a few things that bother me about this1 they didnt even bother to use the proposal name in the minutes shows they didnt give it much thought2 they claim it is too hard and requires a lot of artwork how much artwork went into these t3 ships and is going into wis imho they could have easily created a programing group assigned to this issue and if they had started when the issue first came up they could have had it ready by next years spring expansion i dont think anyone expected this to be accepted coded and implemented over nightcsm your job is not to bee ccps play toy your job is to represent the player base and the player base wants this ccp i understand that we cant always have what we want however a company that cannot listen to its customers will eventually find itself without any
are you suggesting that eve is dying again
just please make them hit for full damage agaisnt the proper ship sizecruises and torps should hit battleships for full damage heavy missiles should hit cruisers for fulli dont care about shooting smaller ships its only fair that missiles do no damage against smaller ships so they are equal in turrets but please give us our full damage against the right ships

original poster is too stupid to correctly spell queue so therefore should no be allowed an opinion
anchoring  onlining time reduced by 10 per level of anchoring skill minimum need and 1 additional module to the queue would be nicelevel 5 anchoring means 5 minutes to anchor or online a modulethis or something similar would get my thumbs up
oh please yes
only pos crews know the paini support this so they can have more time to enjoy the game
i agree that some boundaries should be put into placei think a limit of the queue up to a maximum amount of time should be in place and instead of making it skill wise have it so that this counts alliance wide something in the way ofyou can not start a secondary queue on a starbase structure in this system as your alliance is too busy doing the essential paperwork for another starbase structureif this was to replace the current game mechanics it would limit an alliance of setting up more than one pos in a system at a time also bringing down pos spami believe that could keep it in balance with my current idea and still keep sovereignty applied to posmoonsyes because maybe the ops first language aint english noooo that cant be can it

hey there i appreciate the support in the us we still use an antiquated system ive no idea how common this is elsewhere but i have heard that much of the rest of the world uses volume based pricinghowever many ltl freight carriers in the us use the national motor freight traffic association 
while i dont work for a ltl carrier in the us i have dealt with numerous different carriers around texas in regards to shipping furniture container loads blanketwrap services and ltl volume loads in pup trucksi can call up and ask overnite now ups abf trail lines or really any ltl carrier and give them two pieces of information estimated volume and class of course in all cases i have to include a manifest the exact opposite of what eve accomplishes with its mystery package systemfor sealed loads i can call ask for a pup truck to be dropped off at the bay door fill it that night and have it picked up the next day they only charge me for the amount of space i take up in the trailer based on the class 100 in this case hell i can get a full 28 foot pup truck from austin to dallas 200 miles for 350for palletised items this is even easier once again its class 100 and a mixture of volume and weight at no point in my dealings with carriers in the us have i ever had to declare a shipments value the one time i lost a shipment one of old dominions trucks literally burnt to the ground brakes slowly lost pressure overheating i simply faxed them the invoice of what the items they were carrying were worth and they reimbursed us for the lossthe point is the guy driving the truck doesnt pay for the load when he picks it up in fact if everything goes smoothly the shipping company itself should never have any significant portions of its money tied up in some rudimentary collateral system even if you hire some guy that owns his own truck and trailer hes not paying a collateralthe problem eve has is that there can be no class system everything is equally likely to get damaged there are no forklift holes in your shuttles when they offload them the only risk to a freight load is from scamming and pirates theres also no such thing as an insurance system or even courts theres also no reliable way to price an item i can claim that my 1 tritanium is worth 1 billion isk all i want but no freight company in their right mind would agree right now we have mystery boxes that really could be anything who knows what theyre really worthwe need some sort of tool to help us start managing the logistical part of eve of course the first step in any major logistical endeavor is to set up shipping hubs ccp give us the tools
the hatred for collateral is really kind of silly we dont have collateral irl because we have an insurance structure to compensate for very rare losses and we have a legal system to protect against theft and fraud eve has neither of those things collateral is the best fix for those gaps that were going to get  handwaving and saying that a ship carrying stuff getting destroyed just teleports the stuff back to the origin is a terrible solution
aye the class you speak of is sometimes based on the value of freight among many other things like density fragility etc this is really not the point and doesnt apply to eve in the end we both agree we need logistical management tools i understand that the current collateral system would be a barrier of entry for many corps to go into the shipping business but for me that would only mean less competition i can easily include my risks in pricing while still making an appealing rate that customer would find useful if however there were a different method availble then id use that alsotralala
i like this idea
as i stated if you just look at sov there is a few alliances that hold it somewhere around 55 but if you get down to the politics you can link most of them 55 or so alliances all to 34 large groups the power blocks i guess maybe i should state what i think should be more of the norm is that instead of a couple wars ie war of the south vs north or gbc vs goons or any of the other large wars there should be several small wars throughout all of null sec for example it would be nice if you looked at the north and seen 2030 different wars going on all of which involved no one from the south and vise versa
try reading the op before passing judgementeliza hacklehaber i know my corps kbs are api assisted however this does not work for kills on friendly boards and as for a central point of date sharing i think youre overestimating the level of corporation people provide in game
no youd need to have total control over whether your killslosses get posted and even then it would remove misleadingfaked killmailsalso encouraging peoples epeens any further is a bad idea
while i dont pvp as a rule this wouldnt be any different than what a lot of other games do though those tend to be rts games as opposed to mmosid support proposing it with the caveat that i can opt of it in game and with the understanding that there are other parts of the game that need fixing a lot worse
if you have the option to opt out how does this help the situation you are trying to remedy youre citing the issue of other people getting killmails where you arent the final blow and not posting them yet if they opt out of the reporting then that kill wont show up on the official killboard eitherthe only thing an official killboard would help with is the current private kb lag after patchesunless im really missing the point imho this would make it a waste of developer time unless of course they wanted to introduce it as part of the cosmos social networking thing maybe throw that up as a suggestion
not supportedkill mails are a total waste of time and nothing but ego stroking epeen bullim sorry but all i see these days is kill mail this kill mail that its enough to make me sickwho gives a flying rip you never kill the guy completely anywayalright fine you want kill confirmations then pull the damn thing out of the game and post it on your own damn board as ceo of sc i can see every kill to date its not that hard to figure outyou people are so bloody lazy its ridiculousan official kb would increase the latency traffic as it is theres too much crap to parse outif ccp gives this with there blessing then fine but im not going to push it on the csm
im more open to an outlandish idea of doing away with killmails altogether
then how will we have any understanding of whats going on in the gameomber zombie if somebody doesnt want any of the killloss history posted this would now give them the ability to do that if they choose this the issue of finding mails its still resolved as there is nowhere else to lookin sort what is public is easy to navigate and what is private is totally secure
yes that increase in latency traffic would be terrible i think some kind of common kill register is a grand idea of course it would need to be delayed i think better simpler for ccp to implement than that would be the ability to drag kills from your killlog into fleetlocalcorp or whatever so other people can either verify the kill or copypaste the killmail to their own killboard
try reading my post again jackassand think before you speakthe kills are not posted or published anywhere in ccps network of databases they are storedits 3rd party people who parse them out if you had bothered to pay attention you would know thatfor this to be implemented means adding to the load of whats already presenti dont expect people to understand database mechanics but i do expect people like you to read and think before you speaktop that off with the fact that i can see all kill mails in the corporation manager just as easily as the next director there is no need for verification if it happenedits beacuse the server said so end of discussiongot a problem with fraudulent killmails thats your problem not mine
the only thing i can think that would satisfy all parties and keep it simple is just mark who got the kill and stop right theremaybe log the rest as assistsmuch like freespace 2 or descent 3no moreno less done and done
fake pvp dont you guys get that its all fake there is no new level of fakeness there is already the test server this would be an awesome oportunity to merge them and make it fun and cool at the same time i play supreme commander and its ranked ladder is really competative and fun to use i really like the idea of players competing for fame in the virtual reality of eves virtual realitythe stupidity behind the mentality of the political animal never ceases to amaze me this is why i ignore politics and politicians because they are just the zoobs that step forward because they are too stupid to know that the real power is in someone elses handswanders off grumbling about zoobs and imagining the total coolness of eve players being able to enter into a virtual universe of space combat and adventure and excitement  so much like  yet they cant see it grumble mumble 
really theres no implementation of arenas that will work for anyonemight i remind everyone that we dont mind when they do the alliance tournament done right how is this any differenteve online fanfest 2008  ccp panel  arena discussion starting at 2430 minutes
ships die in the alliance tournament
pod killing is also possible though it does have penaltiesif a real distinction could be made between the dueler and the soldier this is an idea i could accept the reality is that the only distinction would be that the dueler doesnt fit a warp scrambler
arena pvp sucks
bam so agree and very happy to see the irrational crap from the ops ridiculous complaint getting shot to pieces
as another member of the glbt community i must say i do not feel discriminated against while playing eve i feel embarrassed by you making us out to be soft skinned victims though some ppl dont like us get over it you wanna help gays that are victims bring attention to the ones that still get killed in backward nations just dont do it here cause your sexual preference in a game is irrelevant

yay csm support d
how about t1 ships that belong to minor factions
personally id rather see ccp spend time on improving the role balance of current ships by that i mean improving the usefulness of ships that are rarely flown because they are simply outclassed by a t1 counterpart id like to see the tier system be supplanted by a role oriented system once ccp balances what already exists they can spend time on making more stuff to balance
the more the better i always wondered why there are only 3 bss per race
this
we already have all the tech1 ships we need however we dont have upgraded versions of it like all the tech1 modules have aka named modules besides faction and tech2 ofcmore version of each shiptype would be good sorta a step up towards tech2
i think this is not a bad idea if it is done with subtletyonly very small boni would fit without disturbing game balance and without making unnamed ships obsolete unnamed modules are already obsolete because they tend to be drastically inferior to named modules hardly anyone uses unnamed stuff anymore for anything but refininga named amarr frigate from carthum conglomerate could have a few points more armor and a little bonus to capacitor or a creodron gallente ship could have 510 points more drone hangar spacenothing too drastic and the trade off should balance the gain in power with a slight tendency to being an inefficient tradei dont think it is needed but it would probably be nice to have more variety among tech 1 ships
well i disagree we do not have all the t1 ships that we need id point to destroyersyet this would be a great idea as long as the changes are subtle but id like to add that there should be some slight visual tweaks to other variants like with faction and t2 ships
this sounds like the role that faction ships are intended to fill its like a mega but 50 more hp and with an extra low slot is exactly the sort of bonus id expect from named ships
interesting idea but i can see one major flaw how would you get these ships you get named t1 modules from looting npc wrecks so would you get a whole ship in one of those wrecksthey could drop a blueprint but that already exists commander spawns drop blueprints for ships like the daredevil nightmare etc while those are faction ships i believe they fit the role pretty wellhonestly i dont see this fitting into the current game mechanics sorry but not supported
named t1 ships would be interesting not different slot layouts but differing meta levels of ship that change some aspects say a 5 bonus per level became a 6 bonus or if thats deemed overpowered simply giving it more hitpoints of the ship simplest implementation would be to add another form of research to existing blueprints to allow the manufacture of higher meta level ships that could then be sold normally on the market
you just prove my point there youre saying that a battleship if you beef it up a bit will keep pace with a hulk the best miner in the business so the ship thats supposed to be the best miner is marginally better than a wellequipped battleship that means that the miner gets a ship thats better at mining only in token a ship thats specifically designed to mine should not just be able to outdo a differently fitted battleship it should be vastly betterim told i should just shut up and be happy with what i have when what i have is nothing more than a flying pacifier the miner isnt the best equipped capsuleer in new eden it turns out his flagship miner mines only a little bit faster than a battleship but hey its got a bigger hold does the term cold comfort mean anything to you and on top of that a lot of people are even convinced that the hulk is too easy to get what we should be getting is a ship that doesnt perform as well so that everybody in a battleship does a better job of mining than the miner does and youre ok with that why have miners in the first placewhen everybody and their grandmother gets to fit an epeen to fit their egos the miner doesnt even get one decent mining vessel thats the reality of it its even worse expressing the desire for one is akin to a social faux pas what you want a better miner how dare you5 strip minersorcasized cargofreightersized tankore refining facilityfighterclass dronesevery time you want me to do with less im adding to the wish listim not going for originality i want to mine in a really big ship what anybody else does makes no difference to me i have wanted to mine in a titan since the first time someone mentioned the avatar about three days into the loony bin i will have a titan one day not soon but one day i will mine with itabulurd bonifaceme meceo

so you want a ship that can do what a rorqual carrier and freighter can all in one along with mining capability and allowed into empire spacewhile were at it can it have fairies pixies leprachauns oooo and truck nuts cause everything that big needs truck nuts
i fully expect you to be there you are what makes new eden such a great and fun place to be inits a mystery to me why mining in a titan would be such a big leap of the imagination ok its big its expensive its as elegant as flying in a concrete bathtub so what im not bothering anyone i just want to mine why is that a problemabulurd bonifaceme meceo
you said it would be allowed in empire space not ii have a hard time grasping why my request for a real mining vessel would be so offensive miners apparently arent supposed to make a decent living many people not all commenting are notdont want
i assume you are referring to the apoc and the insanely crazy need to both staggers the cycles and empty your cargo at a rate which makes playing diablo on nightmare look easy you also lose much of the tanking ability that the bs has as well compared to a like fitted hulk ie fitted for maximum mining efficiencyeven with mlus in the lows a hulk can tank effectively against rats and some pvp encounters youll never get the same in a bs at least pre quantum havent checked recentlyand apparently youve never seen how fun it is to gank using a hulkwe already have capital class mining ships as well the rorqual and orca
you mine 25 more and are actually capable of doing it solo the difference between a mining battleship and a hulk is like the difference between a stabber and a vagabond when it comes to mining ice or mercoxit that difference increases dramatically  a battleship is incapable of mining ice and a skiff gets something like twice as much as a rokh but even for ore you have a sizeable advantage from using mining ships and you save a lot of money too you can whine about epeen for other players but this side of red moon rising missioners got one class of shipsmarauders haulers got one class of shipsjump freighters pirates got one class of shipheavy interdictors and miners got two specialized support shipsrorqual and orca and there were eight ships for basically everybody addedtier2 bcs and tier3 bbs  yes i include miners in everybody since a rokh is a far better battleship miner than an apoc was a dedicated miner has three new ships he can realistically use  rokhor other bb rorq orca  which is the same as a pvperbc bb hic and more than a missionerbb ma youre hardly being neglected and you can add as much as you want to your wishlist  you can ask for the ship to order you pizza for all i care youre not getting it the game cant just keep adding bigger and bigger stuff forever and expect anything to make sense  remember there hasnt been a new class of t1 ship added in the last three years that wasnt designed as mining support given that we cant just keep going bigger accept that youve gotten a lot better in recent years and live with it

well basically pointing to the same claim about it being a wardec safety is a bit lamei specifically said it would not be a way to avoid wardecsthis is only a way to make it easier to be affiliated more then one placethe alt skin jumping is not something everyone preferchanging suituniform and access to other corps facilities etc is rather usefull and fitting say you want to work in a corp with friends and family but you would also like to do metagame stuff like djing for edenunderground or everadio you have to use alts and corp them honestly this is a rp flaw and i think it would be nice to get rid of the whole skin jumping and ad hoc alt usagealso i would like to have the option of joining say a pew pew school yet still being able to maintain my ceo position in my own corp without using an unskilled alttraining times are already become rather riddiculous something like 6 months to fly something top line
theres this thing called alliances allows you to build affiliations of corporations with other corps
forgetnow drake though caleb has had a few good ideas in the past let us not forget that he sometimes has some strange ones
twitchruns to his padded roomscreamsthere was no idea in that threadhe was just totallyvague its like he wants us to do the thinking for him
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ok so basically you are saying that you dont use alts to work around the need to be in more corps than onei am rather sure that a way to move between corps would actually mean less skinswapping and less micro corpsi just know that there are many services and play to get in other corps but they all demand you use alts or leave current corpas a manager or ceo that is really a problem however you turn and look at it if you give the consequences of such a feature some thought you might see what i am asking for and why

nice long post drakei think i would tend to agree on every single point what you fail to see is that corp jumping and alts is a problem when it comes to trust and loyaltyand even though you might not want to have multi affiliated members in your group i for one know that the cross corp activities are really frequentespecially in regards to having different professions and roles in different corps but with the same maini personally hate the fact that i have to play more characters than one to be able to do things this suggestion has nothing to do with corp jumping its multi corp affiliation and not in alliances but goerning different roles in different corps and even alliances
and what you fail to see is that it will never be used the way you think it will be usedpeople are greedy eve encourages entropy and chaosi will not stand by and allow the mechanics of this game be abused in favor of laziness
totally agree the fact that you cant tell how many war targets are sitting on the station is what is really broken here
yeah prety much like the science vessel in starcraft maybe instead of a ship a module
put it on black ops
only if its exclusive to black ops
supported ifa the bubble can only handle so much mass any more and it is overloadedb their is some kind of ongrid burst you can use to decloak anything inrangec you need a specialist ship to launch the bubble like black ops
what an awful idea
what an awesome ideaonly supported if the cloak works both ways they cant see in but you cant see out either you still appear in local but cant be scanned whilst the cloak is active so the opposition knows something is up and youd need scouts outside the bubble to report when to drop the cloak
interesting  dont see it going anywhere though
i really really like the old warp effect and dont see any reason why it needs changing at all
i agree the new effect is bad and i feel like im drowning damn
i hope a ccp representative sees this and realizes how absolutely a failure fw is to bring entertainment to the game the current mechanics are absolutely ridiculously weak in entertainment this is the biggest part of the game that has absolutely no
i vote yes for obillboards in plexes
1 more support for prono boards
lol no not everyone knows that
other ships being broken is not an argument to not fix this broken ship
hey good bye
i must admit i almost liked the idea of moving other peoples clones even more than the initial proposalbut se hitching and being on someone elses ship in flight really still appeals to metourist like and maybe as a reporter to a great fleet battle or other operationswould make war and combat reporting easier

makes perfect sense to trade aggression rights they should be level based so there is attack destruction and kill each type of aggression grants the victim a similar right 1 to 1 type 1 scanning targeting and can looting grants the same option back towards the offendertype 2 destruction of ship or other pos property 1 to 1 itemtype 3 homicide all the type 1 and 2 are limitless with this right towards the offender and any gang corp and alliance but not kill rights on thesethese rights are generated and placed in the character sheet and can be taken out and traded w other playersthese rights are active in highsec space but not at gates roaming concord belts moons or at stations they are activeadding a standing based bounty payout system to the above and the whole pew pew has gotten a huge upgrade and the best part is you can stay out by never aggressing and earn isk on trading the rights to those that want the pewpew gamethis is not only fair its going to be damn fun nb standing based bounty payout is 0100 based on 010 standing and with a bounty hunter skill you can alway minimum get the ships base value payed out from current bounty pool

hey sol did you add a yellowish aura around the captain on the website its awesome i look like a futuristic jebus
couriers could use an overhaul thoughincrease the number of possible couriers outstanding so you wouldnt mind placing more of themalso remove npc pricetag or make it inverse function of time so short and fast was expensive and long was cheap to createthis would beef up courier business a hell of a lotplayers would have a lot more courier offers and you would easier fill your cargo space with interesting work
honestly training times are really becoming way to longyou could practically plan a training that would most likely not be completed before the eve game became obsolete or totally changedthings should be rebalanced a bita suggestion that might help unplugging implants when docked at med facilities this way going on operation and sacrificing training time for potetial value loss if caught of guard and unprepared the loss would still be relevantincrease all traing times to two maybe three times current but have podkills and shipdestructions cost skillpoints lost along the lines of t3 just morethis way the seriousness of dying is retained both from a skill and economic perspective but more might be willing to shift things around a bit to take chances and partake in more pvpthe intention is to have more pvp all over but make it possible to risk manage and chose your battles
theres no need for any of that training times are just getting long because your character is getting old and has already trained all the short ones diminishing returns at work and that is definitely a necessary mechanic
this really have little to do with my own characteri am quite comfy with my skillsi am refering to the fact that the current skill demands basically mean in practical terms that you wont see much of the game unless you sign up for 1 year or more from day onethis commitment is keeping more casual gamers out from a biz pov ccp would potentially get more players if they changed this a bit
quoted to prove that dampspecific ships are worse than their nondampspecific counterparts
dont approve lachesisarazu are fine its damps that need a boost
i do agree that the tempest needs a change and i would certainly love it to have some sort of unique bonus like the tracking that allows it to fufill some sort of niche do i think your ideas are spot on no but they are better than anything ive seen so far the tempest seriously needs some changes made in order to compete in with the other battleships though im not sure how much i agree with your proposed maelstrom shield changes and ideas about torpedos after the speedweb nerf patch minmatar always used to be very difficult to train for as many of their ships required both missiles projectiles and a large drone bay its the only races that has both shield and armor tanking ships with many that can do either this wasnt bad though because when someone took the time to train to fly a minmatar ship they were something to be feared now many of their ships are a joke and only the newly released minmatar ships compete with the other races its sad
oooohpretty titanwaitwhys it glowing oshiyeah signed
sure why not 
the first time i saw i titan i was in a recon ship cloaked 80km off a hostile death star pos in deep in 00 space dozens of battlships and smaller ships surrounded it  a massive and impressive display of fleet strength there should be things in this galaxy that remain rare and maintain thier awesomeness through rarity seeing a titan should be earned either by joining a fleet that has the power to wield one or by having the gall to get within visual range of such a fleet without invitation i do not support this idea before this thread i didnt know who chribba was and after it im sure i still dont care entertaining this idea would be favoritism in its most blatant and silly form anyone who doesnt want to take the risk involved in seeing a titan up close and personal can stick to videos and watch it on tv they havent earned the right

my mistake i guess the several pl who have said as much are offset by the one dread that a guy is flying so let me clarify that pl heavily encourages turret dread use however due to peoples nubbery im sure it will take time til all pilots are swapped over when it comes to dreads though any dread is better than 1 less yordanag does slightly more dps than a rev with the same effective hp youre right about the moros never even considered it before i posted but then honestly whos ever used a blaster moros ive at least seen a pulse or auto setup or 2 in my timeas for being an idiot meh

welcome to eve try not to live up to your namesake every time you post here
glad to see someone took their laconic pills this morning
to be honest this is a similar broken feature to local and both should be fixed as soon as ccp can fit it in to their schedule
ceos can just hook up their api key this idea is pointless and alot of work for ccp
simple solution give everyone that appears on the kill record access to the kill record regardless of who laid the final blow
theres zero need for a ccpbuilt killboard that would only be buggier than the api what would be nice is an api that works for crap and reports the information people want that takes less effort than building a killboard system that a lot of people would decline to use anyway
i dont know about anyone else but i think the 24 hour wait if you have roles is stupid doesent help anything useless and annoying i see no point in putting this in but having another inconvenience when moving to another corp if i could see this thing removed i am pretty sure that everyone would be a tad happier with the game
unless im mistaken i think its there to slightly deter corp stealing people of course its only a day which is useless take it out
supported p
ill support this but only if the same applies to war decs currently the leavecorpdelay is the only tiny deterrent to people corp hopping to avoid wars unfortunately it doesnt work
not supportedinitially i was against the policy then i realized there is a valid reason for this annoyancegives you a 24 hour notice before your kicked if someones sabotaging youi suppose an improvement is needed but removing it entirely is not a good idea
err noi may not disagree with this shadow of an idea that wasnt implemented yet i would never vote for an idea to be removed forever from the boards this isnt soviet russiaanyway if they try to implement it as a feature or if they announce it i will vote against it to my knowledge its not even on the table at the moment

we were discussing the delayed local feature in wspace over on the test irc channel and this came upwhat if 00 local was by default delayed where that you only show up if you speakbutif someone has sovereignty in the system you show up anyway after a period of time the higher the sov level the faster you appearflamesuitactivate

i support delayed mode for all 00 space i dont support the sovrelated change
you are suggesting 00 space get a similar mechanic like wspacehere is to hoping that local delay time can be easily adjusted for 00 alliance andor corp members andor fleet members should have immediate local even in 00
you mean like this idea its still on page 1 of fi yet another sign of how pointless that forum is now the assembly hall is here
i really need 30 second delay to my name showing up in local to deal with the chinese farmer ravens infesting 00even if they die once every day they still make more money than they lose
the first good option for local fix ive seen
thats precisely what this game needs yet another means for the established powers to ease their ability to hold their territory against challengers they dont show up in local but invaders do bravo were well on our way to a perfect game now

i wouldnt mind seeing another destroyer for each race but other than that there are plenty of t1 ships already

i would like ccp to look into the balancing of short ranged weapons in general with the qr changes
blasters are suffering heavily from an erosion of their role they arent useless but their application is significantly more difficult and has even gone so far as requiring gang mates to be used to a greater degreevery rough calculations but currently out of all the guns at their optimal  falloff blasters have the lowest speed requirement to outrun tracking  so in effective terms they have the worst tracking available and yes is it lower than arties true that at those levels they are tracking better than other weapons but it means their dps is significantly lowered compared to its paper valueship bonus will make a clear impact into these figures which may explain some of the experiences some people have had with some blaster boats but unless were starting to advocate that weapons only be useable not better on ships designed for them much like ecm is now and other ew is fast heading as in have a tracking bonus i dont feel this should be factored in at this pointpersonally i find the scram and web changes to be the most significant aspects in the equation since scrams have put people off from using mwds in many situations i have witnessed in favour of ab so combined with lower web effectiveness much higher orbit speeds are frequent which are exaggerated at shorter ranges it also means that once committed there is no option to disengage at all unlike other weapon systems were there will be some if not very muchbut in all when you are faced with these additional problems for no significant bonus in damage the logical call is to use a different weaponlasers are tracking too well at this moment so yes there is some mileage in lowering their tracking but i still dont think this would address a core issue with blasters at the moment
signednot because blasters need a boost directly with the change to webs all turret weapons need their tracking stats looked at and hopefully adjusted

your argument is for any battleship or either of the mining directorsi have all the information i need thanksabulurd bonifaceme meceo
fyi fears of more isk farmers and macrominers are not valid reasons to oppose greater mining capacity ccp has always had the ability to detect and ban isk farmers and macrominers it seems they finally got their act together and solved the problem of infestations of isk farmers now they need to do something about macrominers just about everything that happens in eve is logged and anything not logged could be logged with minor programming with everything generating an audit trail its a matter of data mining to detect activities like isk farming and macromining its just silly to think that mining has to be limited or crippled because greater mining capacity would benefit isk farmers and macrominersfyi the present problem of most hi sec systems being overmined is a problem of overpopulation given the numbers of solar systems belts sizes of asteroids spawn rates etc for any given eve population there can be resources that make it possible for all of us to find good belts and to support ourselves by mining ccp has fallen down on the job and let mining resources get way out of balance as the eve population has grown and as more and more players have skilled up to mine effectivelymy mains have maxd out on all mining related skills ive reached the limit of what i can do with my mining fleet and i want to do more there should be no real limit to the evolution and growth of eve and the activities we can engage in in eve
thats an absurd concept of course everything can continue to grow it just has to do it with consideration in an orderly manner and with corrections ifwhen mistakes are made the present high end of eve would have been inconceivable a few years ago where it will be a few years from now would likely be inconceivable at this moment wake up
tbh what i would like to see is a ship that may mine about the same as a hulk but is considerably tougher  touch enough that it would be actually viable to protect miners in losec00 something like a drakeclass tanksuch a ship would be of no interest to hisec macroers but would be very useful in opening up losec and marginal 00
actually eves high end is exactly where it after the spring 2006 expansionred moon rising the one that added carriers and titans many aspects of the game have gotten bettersupercapital tackling jump logistics etc but the only aspect of the game that has gotten any bigger is the mining gang and remember that theres a limit as to how high you can push things before you start to make the game unplayable for new players if minerals cost half as much but everything else is the same because mining is now twice as good a new player takes twice as long to mine his way into a bpo and start the industrial game and might quit before he gets there not to mention hard caps like insurance fraud  if mineral prices drop much lower the floor under them will be entirely artificial nobody wants that there are consequences to expanding mining that are more dangerous to play with than for most other aspects of the game and once you add a ship you cant take it back incidentally i asked zulupark this exact question  will there ever be a bigger miner than the hulk  in his qa a while back and his answer was maybe someday but not soon it was exactly what i was looking to hear for the aforementioned reasons and hopefully it should indicate that im not the one who is out of touch here like a rokh say
whats absurd is the size of your headbigger is not necessarily always betterid like to see a diversification of smaller ships not massive mining ships
can i have a ship to go with titans 5 please it should be like a titan but be able to fit 5 ddds at once launch 50 fighters have a cargohold 5 times that of the largest freighter have 80 resists across the board 8888 slot config 8 rigs and be able to deploy to act as a mobile pos with 1 week reinforced timer also it should be allowed in highsec

right we all know who i am not and we all know i am not that other person to ascertain who i am you need to do some research but that will fail as i nobodyfor one year i have played this game and for one year i have enjoyed it alotit is this pleasure i feel must be endowed to others and for them to enjoy they need a voice that they can rely on to get their gripes out into the open i can be that voice because i am loud and proudany good person in this kind of running will need a set of policies so here for your scrutiny are minenumber onethe term epic fail will meet with insta ban of any forum posting there is no room for discussion herenumber twoi will push for an increased amount of emoticons for basic forum usersnumber threethere will be a movement for the idea of profiled windows settings ie you can select from a drop down menu the settings for different window configurations which are custom madenumber fourto listen to people and not enact harsh and unrelenting judgement biased to how many numbers are in their namethat is it so far
its this sort of absentminded behavior and lock of attention to detail that makes you a poor candidatea wise voter will see through your ruse and vote pompous
 spamming the forum with related threads are not the way to do it as wellsry but i do think there will be certain alliance leaders that have a couple of thousand players behind them or quality forum posters not you that will get voted onedit afte
 ha ha you know what i see a spelling error we all doit is this kind of deficit in attention to detail to which the followers of poppy are accustomed to which they adhere by which they live and by which they prosper thus any kind of movement with uylear at the helm will be flawed and inadequate totally eviscerated of any sense and constantly in strife with itself
what a jokeri support my rt hon friend in her election bid may the candidate with the brightest banner and the rowdiest supporters win
i agree wholeheartedly on this point more smilies for everyone i cnat agree to any more tho as that would give the impression of actually having a coordinated platform and i would be lynched by my supporters coordination or indeed thinking is not the essence of seeing and peeing props to you miss
what is your policy on alts
have lots
and never forget evers that we must adhere to one final law physicsin no way will i push for items of interest that simply cannot be done due to ccps limited technical abilities my goals will be economically viale completely realistic and in tune to a growing communitythere are many minds to consider when enacting a decision many lives are altered on the whims of those choice makersit is with this in mind that i will back bench the small scale ideas the tweaks to interfaces for exampleactually you know im not being serious at all im merely boredvote pompousi dont have a passport anyway nor a brain or a clue as to where to get one
my policy is to leave them as they are they work as intended and no further tweaking need be made though for the true nature of scummery to come alive in eve perhaps an api mod can be worked for each indivudual alt infact thats my new policy independent apis per character

oe was just surprised at your support  twas a nice surprise tho 3
no problems im making pancakes want some you have my support because i really like your name tbh it is something i feel endeared too
any friend of pancakes is a friend of mine french toast is for babies
pancakes would be greati made a whole bunch the other day for pancake day but more would be awesome especially the way you make themalthough as my maiden aunt always told me a moment on the lips forever on the hips

i see youre following ankhewhatevers way of campaigning with similarly important and viable spearpoints make sure to note that youre a girl every 3 seconds dont forget to stress that important bit it works well with the nerds and youll get oodles of votes
baah miss sorry about the forced relocation i think its on the cards for poupons thread too
logoffskis only save your ship if you can warp faster than the person locking you and you arent in a bubble or if your ship can survive 30 seconds of pounding so i see some caution there warping now or logging now versus waiting until your drones are in is a decision any pilot has to make if you wait you are risking your ship if you dont you lose your drones i think thats a reasonable decision to ask pilots to makecatering to players who either are incapable of learning game mechanics or choose not to is one thing catering to the intended player base is another the former would be adding things to make life easier for carebears the latter would be expansionswhich is exactly why a csm who wants 00 to be easier for carebears to access is something that is bad for this game combat pilots still have to deal with industrial stuff and all the things carebears do its not like carebears have exclusivity on mining or something carebears choose not to play part of the game and i think ccp should choose not to make that part any easier for them to accessshooting down bad ideas is taking an active stance in guiding eve where i would like to see it
i had almost thought you forgot about me making me wait a day is unlike youthe issue was never making it impossible to lose drones its being able to recall drones after relogging in the example i cited was for mining drones in large unwieldly mining barges so if you return to where you were relogin after a dc you can reestablish connections to drones from further than 15km make it require a module if youre worried about abuse the fact remains that it is a problemthis is not some magical fix that would allow you to steal the drones from a pirate who dropped in on you either you warp or log or get dcd and they have nothing stopping them from staying there and camping them or picking them up themselvesso adding things like a jump drive fuel and path calculator in game is catering to carebears or can you do this in your head sounds to me like this is something many choose not to be able to do without the help of 3rd party toolsare you the intended player base or am i i think you might actually be able to put your definitions to work here please define who exactly is comprised in this intended player basealso i bolded and underlined a part from page one that i feel was finally concededwhat exactly did she suggest that anyone without a certain amount of sp be given safe passage in 00 im pretty certain theres a large amount of certain disreputables in eve who would love more carebears in 00 if there are carebears in your 00 blow them up ive never heard issler propose that they be given polaris shipsyour attempt at shooting them down as stupid doesnt seem to be all that successful from my point of view i was simply trying to provide you with an alternative that might lend you more success
things are busy at work my availability to reply is limited at the momentif they want to put something in that affects mining drones only i dont care if it affects all drones then i have a problem with it being able to recall combat drones after a login would remove the need to make a choice between loggingwarping off and waiting for your drones it may seem trivial but for a dominix or myrmidon in dangerous territory its an important riskreward decisionsince i dont fly carriers or dreads i would leave that to ccp to decide i wouldnt ask for changes to something that i dont have experience with the intended player base is anybody who participates in the grand scheme of eve entity versus entity combat in low or no security areas is the focus of the game everything else is there to support that politics war winning and losing these are what make eve go around mining trading ratting missioning these are just supporting activities to the core of the gameissler raised the point of carebears in 00  the current system doesnt seem to cater to allowing established alliances to allow them in thats what i read in the notes to that i say that carebears need to learn how to be useful in 00 and then they will be needed ill make a full post on that nextand i would say that is because your point of view is lacking experience from some very important areas of the game
carebears in 00if carebears want to be needed in 00 they need to make themselves worthwhile having there that doesnt mean they need to be combat experts but they need to be able to survive and accomplish things in that hostile environmentthis means they need to know a few thingsundockredock mechanicsbubble mechanicsbasic 00 survival informationthey also need to be able to do a few things without a babysittersetuptakedown poss maintain pos fuelferry moon minshandle reactionsmine ice  minerals with your own scoutsoverwatchits likely that there are pvp corps out there that would go to 00 if it wasnt for all the pos management and backbone stuff they arent interested in doing an industrial corp that is skilled in the things above could easily work with a corp like that to make a move for 00youll need carriers jump freighters blockade runners ships fit for travel and survival most of all youll need experience doing these things in a hostile environment practicing in npc 00 is the best way because you have to deal with bubbles but still have stations to dock in as a backupeve has four different environments people can choose to live in high sec low sec npc 00 and true 00 each provides a different level of risk and reward but all are decently balanced a corp has to decide where they want to live and what they are willing to do to live there the more risk you take the more reward you could see
you have demonstrated your own experience deficiencies the next three quotes work well to point this outyou are changing the situation in order to break the suggestion rather than finding a solution to the current problem this is not a fault of the suggested change but of your desire to disagreerecalling drones in a mining situation is difficult because the large mining barges cannot navigate through dense asteroid fields put a long timer on the recall it would not change the benefit of getting drones back without mucking around with the aggravating collisions with asteroidsyoure perfectly willing to classify the people who want them as being unwilling or incapable of dealing without those changes though anybody who participates in the grand scheme of eve i couldnt have said this better myself this includes your 00 giants day old noobs miners traders ratters missioners all of these make eve go around the core of the game would not exist without them if you think pvp is the core of this game why not relocate everyone to the test server free goods for all no one would mine or missiondo you even know what that quote means is a carebear still a carebear once theyre in 00 as free targets any incentive that would promote more people in 00 cant be all bad it actually sounds a lot like darius ideas with incentivizing 00 you want less people in highsec and more in 00 given people a reason to go out there if you disgagree there take it up with darius
this would be good material to stick in a guide have you considered compiling one and expanding on each its probably been done before not sureseeing as how you dont reference isslers words once in this post it makes me wonder what has issler offered to change about any of this you can ignore my first saracastic comment and i apologize for the slip do answer me why you felt it necessary to provide this guide here though you have spent all this time opposing issler blindly without any concrete examples of what shes changing that you dislike other than she mentioned changing something im going to run for csm and change pos mechanics how ill change them i wont tell you until you vote for me
when i dont have experience with something i say it and then i leave the suggestions in those areas to other people who do im not sure what youre trying to say with demonstrated but ive been transparent with that throughout this threadim not changing any situation im explaining why this change has broader effects on the game than you seem to be aware of as i said do whatever the heck you want to mining drones and i wont object but if it affects combat drones then we have an issue not sure what you are going for here you were responding to me saying i dont fly caps so i dont address suggestions related to them and in that case your response makes no sensethe grand scheme is not i mine therefore i am its i mine therefore my poss are fueled and my corpalliance can continue living in this area pvp itself is not the core of the game but conflict ishopefully not ideally they would be 00 saavy industrialists my previous post explains that and what it takes to get theresure it could bad ideas happen all the time for the noblest of reasons whats important is that ideas are well thought out with all situations in mind then they are less likely to be bad
all of that info should be available on these forums if you search on it or ask questions in the appropriate forums im not really motivated enough to do a guide myself but who knows maybe somedayive quoted her comment in this thread a few times so i wont do so again the point is that she made that suggestion rather than just training her corpies to do the things i posted to get to 00given the way the thread is going i wanted to make sure you were aware of the options currently available to carebears who want to go to lower security areasthis isnt blind its not like ive never seen her operate i was in her corp and then i was in the same alliance with her for a while after that ive known many of her ex corp mates and have seen intel on the accords activities in addition ive yet to see anything in this thread that alleviates my fearsanyway got to go will probably be a day or so again
those other people who do couldnt be issler i take itwhy is it that i offered a solution which you didnt address then i solved your apparent problem with combat situations a timer make it no more efficient for people who could fly to their drones so it only benefits those who cannot fly to their drones due to asteroids the part of quoting yourself that you left out other people do have experience with these things just because you find them stupid doesnt mean youre qualified to comment on them drone recall mechanics cap ship jumps bays carebears in 00 is it clear where i was going with that now i am not a miner dont preach that to me the point i made is everyone has their place and you did nothing to contradict that without a steady supply of noobs to venture into lowsec we would have very unhappy pirates as well everyone contributes to eve no matter their profession or level of experience supporting those new players is good game development practiceprovide situations in which ideas dont work so that they may be fixed then you cant do that with isslers 00 ideas because you have nothing specific to complain about therefore your criticisms are pointless all youve done so far is give us a walkthrough of how things are not even an analysis of problems with that system
read the whole post before seriously commenting on admitted sarcasmthe details of her ideas are what i was referring to the next comment should clear that up if you cared to read it before typing the response abovei bolded the part you missed i really dont think you read my post if you dont try a little harder to respond properly others might begin to see through your trolling

push the ballotahemhypothetical question if i were elected tomorrow and that you voted for me also of course   what one thing would you like to see changed abut cp
everyone knows that brand new players can participate in parts of the game but new players dont know that yet coming from a mentor based organization we rarely have this problem with our newbees but there is a subset of players who join this game and want to fly ships that are way out of their league right awayi think its more of a marketing issue players need to understand that you cant do everything you want after a month of grind like other games hopefully the new player experience will teach people that even with an absurdly low sp they can still fly ships  but those first 10 missions have to be really fun otherwise every new player will quit after only ever seeing rookie shipsbut back on topic training times id be all for resetting everybodys skill points to the base 39 remove learning skills then roughly double all effective training speeds just like newbies are supposed to benefit during their first few weeks i used to argue for learning skills but honestly they are not fun and that by itself is a pretty decent reason to take it out of a game the 6 month redistribution and implants should be enough attribute modifiers this way old players train at around the same speed that theyve been training but so do new players older players still have the advantage of access to good implants for their ridiculous skills but newbies can get in the game quicker
as stated by previous people very good idea imo as well
1 for more powerful ship bonuses currently dont see a serious use for any of these ships
im glad you took my suggestion seriously or did you put this here before i even posted thatim not glad i havent been in the assembly hall since errm long long time take it to amarr
hahaha i love this idea fully supported
supported because its chribba
i think its a great idea families should be allowed to be together its cruel to keep them separated
its chribba so yea stick this titan in amarr by whatever means nessesary
can someone please explain how this is any different to a dev spawning a bpo teleporting players out of a camped system or just favouring certain groups when answering petitions if someone suggested moving one of kenzokus bobs titans to highsec there would be public outcry at dev favouritism but when its the almighty chribba everybody is quick to get in there and join in the massive brownnoseorgyalso just so you know having a dreadnought in highsec even if you only use it for mining is still an exploit and should be treated as such it has more cargohold than a mining bs or bc the only ships able to fit as many lasers and can fit more mining lasers than an industrial the only ships with comparable cargohold not to mention the fact that any attempt to suicide gank it is futile this essentially means that if chribba wants to afkmine he can spend longer afk and get more ore than if he was using the ships above ah i hear you say but a hulk mines more and has more cargo space correct but a hulk cant tank 100 bss shooting at it for the 10 seconds before concord arrives this is essentially a license to afkmine while being completely safe from any attack and get a very good yield while afki propose that ccp remove all highsec capitals drop them in station in the nearest lowsec system and declare it an exploit to ever fly a capital ship in highsec again this would fix this obvious fault with the game and might stop all the fanboycelebrity madness thats going on here
sadly thats how favoritism works  most people only have a problem with it when the favoritism is given to the person or side they dislike
in no particular orderstep 1 ask the player base to make the artstep 2 im not a programmer but whats the issue with programming the new pos setups they still are modular they still require anchoring they will just look like the ones that npcs have all clean and put together missing something herestep 3 how many dev blogs are there one cant write something about pos setup and layoutstep 4 cry moan cry harder please do thisstep 5 profit
i would say its pretty clear at this stage that close range dreadnought fittings are inappropriate for use in any sort of situation where they might get hotdropped as evidenced by the multiple highly onesided capital ship engagements with sniping dreads which actually highlights another disadvantage of the naglfar in that theres no practical way to get adequate range with both weapon systems so youre limited in a sniping fit to either guns or missiles and usually it ends up being the guns the result is that once again the nag ends up by far the lowest in terms of damage output assuming the fc is able to get the phoenixes to shoot targets appropriately if nothing else the naglfar at least needs a 33 turretmissile hardpoint allocation even if the number of highsmidslows arent altered and it could definitely use more cpu

i approve how about auto setup requires you to sit there but does each step auto so you can do the tower and then have the rest just come up when its ready to come up you still will have people spam towers dont you already but it will require a toon to supervise and one character cant do 5 at once on autobut it will take the mind numbingness out of the setup drop an orca at a moon and have it run auto after telling it where to place the modules then move to the next toon and do that again doesnt make it an all day job for you but does for the toon start process come back later  not every 10 minutes still can spam towers but needs more people to do it a least more characters onlineless micromanagement makes me happy
a while back they changed the carriers so you could not put anything but charges inside a ships cargo before putting it in a carrier i think its about time that this restriction got looked at or removedheres a short list of things which shouldnt be restricted but area combat drones of course you could just stick them in the carrier itselfb mobile warp disrupt bubble the anchorable kindc liquid ozone really are you worried about some awesome liquid ozone trade routes of course theres one good reason why restricting any cargo inside a ships storage is completely outrageous ccp have never made any effort to unlag the pain in the butt that is the corporate hangar facility of capitals or even pos   even with 3 gscs and a hsc my corp hangar is extremely laggygiven that jump freighters make moving valuables completely safe if you know game mechanics scout and cyno properly etc i fail to see why a carrier nerf is still in place at the very least give us 10000m3 cans so we can decrease the lag just a little bit more  or let us abandon divisions within our corp hangar as that is probably the cause of the lagcmon ccp give the older playersaddicts a reward for their loyaltyaddiction to your product

they should at least lower it to 4 hours or something
insta leave should be viable but only if you are not at war or will be involved in the next 24 hours if you are at war you cannot leave
what that idea sucks
correction on the war clause if your corp is at war and you leave your a war target for 1 week then your free to move onits fair in my eyes as it either stops you from playing eve for an entire week or your going to get shot at for a week  o p
rob corp blindleave corp without any delayexcoprmates dont have the 24 hour window to shoot you without concord interventionnot supportedstealing from corp already has no practical consequences leave at least a little chance to kill the thief if he is careless
this 24h wont kill youif youre not committed to staying with a corp dont accept any roles hell i dont accept any roles and i am committed  i just dont want the responsibility
no it wont kill me but i dont see the point in waiting 24 hours any good reason for this is not very strong because its only 24 hours
yeh when entering a new corp i kinda block myself from new roles immediatelywhy get stuck 24 hours somewhere you might not want to be
no its like 2 week notice for rl jobs keep the 24 hour times personally i think it should be 1 week from last withdraw from corp hangerswallets 24 hours to remove roles sure but this way either they dont play for a week or they get shot honest leaving should be veted by the ceo in 24 hours
i prefer it the way i said it but your way isnt bad
id prefer extending the time and give the ceo power to eject a player earlier if they wish this may help with corp stealingalthough i think the corp jumping  wardec exploit really needs to be fixed its quite annoying
i support that whoever thought of this idea was fired and that it should never see the light of day or even thought about again this isnt fing wow
this
keep it on sisi
or all these damnd janitors they dont clean shtthe dancing girls are static and the slave army i got cant raid another corps hanger as they are located in a concord station in a 10 system they dont do a damn thing let me put them to wok doing something even if it is knitting sweaters for the dallas cowboys or the blackhawks or refining ferrogel out of each other just make me able to do something with them

youre welcome arent you glad to have mebut really im not sure goonswarm functions in a world tainted by such vulgar antihomosexual behavior and sentiments it runs counter to everything we stand for and must not be allowed to continue
ccp acknowledge this is an international game with an international communityno where is it declared in international human rights that homosexuals must be treated as heterosexualssome countries are openly against homosexuality others accept it but do not allow gay marriage and finally there are a few countries that openly accept homosexualswho are you or i for that matter to declare someones opinion as being wrongi am sure people dont say you must not be gay but as being gay you may be treated differently just as we would not expect a woman to lift a heavy object that a man would gay people are fundamentally different to straight people and so are often fundamentally treated differentlyi personally am against homosexuals but i will not grab a pitch fork and hunt you down you are free to do as you will and i am free to stay away
haha im sorry but no theyre not
oh heavens no anything that should prevent goonswarm from posting and waving there epeens around without restrictionjackass
who are you to make an opinion on this matter thenoh wait that means your a hypocrite

except for battlecruisers right 2 per race is not a lot
off topic  the balance of t2 ships has nothing to do with this 
agreed faction battle cruisersextra battle cruiser for each race maybe not sure at least the t2 battlecruiser should be a new model entirelyalso i want a level 4 battleship which is a pvp based ship using the benefits of a race raven is good for caldari but not very pvpall tech 2 ships should be remodelled so that they are completely different to the t1 or similar but not identical
3 tiers of destroyers  1 more t2  faction salvager specific3rd tier bc  12 factionfaction frigates need lev 4 frigate and 1 ship specific extra skill not just lev 3 frigbadger mk 3 4 and 5faction frigates should be expensive but at the rate that they get killed its sort of stupidly expensive  15 vigilants in a mission  17 billion isk 4 dramels in a mission  12 million isk4 marichials in a mission  38 billion isk and thats just lev 3s the numbers are stupid make them less rare what kind of business model are the rats using where is my state issue cormorant federate catalyst navy issue corm cat
while having more ships to choose from is not a bad idea what is the purposewhat new features  bonuses would these ships have that the current ones do noti can just see a whole lot of new whines as a result this ship is over powered this ship needs to be boosted its not a strong as the other ships the typical crys to make every ship the exact same i dont really see a point in this change

arent faction ships named t1s
they have for the most part different slot layouts and some are totally unique hulls the op is proposing metalevel ships which would be the same layout with slightly better stats
well then tbh seems like a waste of time named ships might be nice but then why not just more different ones t12 versions of the different faction hulls improving the ships stats without skill increase just is like a general buff for whatever ship your using think of the named modules what would the difference be between the effect of named mods and named ships a plain t1 hull would not becould not stand up to a named t1 hull in combat  how would you get these ships why would anyone use a nonnamed t1 hull balancing would be terrible or absolutely useless unless they were for noncombat roles  i figured that the mods were the stat boosters in conjunction with skills the ship would be better now too seems like it could get real ugly real fast just support more ships it seems like this is the same suggestion as that
youre right of course but stay with me a moment  add a new research type the higher you get this research the higher the meta level of the item produced they probably wouldnt but lack of demand would lead to lack of production pretty much the same as what we see with t1 mods why would anyone use them when they can use a better named version balancing is always difficult and is not an argument against an idea these things can always be balanced if deemed viablei dont understand this im afraid we already have named mods  could you please try to rephrase thisthe principle is that higher meta level ships have slightly improved fitting stats more armorhullshieldcpupowerwhatever than their raw t1 counterparts and that these meta level ships could be created through researching the blueprints of course if we did this with ships we should also do this with modules
hauler spawns they carry like 2550million trit etc so why not a whole ship
add new research  eeww buff for big research corpslack of demand i still dont really know what these ships would add to the gamebalancing yes because we all know how good cccp is at thischanging the ships attributes resistsspeedcpupowergrid it seems like the t2 ships are just that better cpu better power better resists named t1 ships brings a call for named t2 and a huge nerf to everything to keep it in line with cruisers and battleships adding a new layer of slight increses means that t1 cruisers will be that much less effictive against frigates named frigates will have to be closer to cruisers in power or all frigates will be nerfed to keep them from overpowering t1 cruisers sure the point of named things is to be better then the t1 version but the balances between ship classes are already a bit off forget the named ships its a bad idea tons of new balances ie nerfs and more crying
ive personally seen this happen to my corporation recently basically when a corporation wardecs you anyone can join that corporation and shoot you this is already considered an exploit by ccp and was petitionedthere needs to be restrictions on new corp members like them not being able to shoot or be shot by war targets for 24 hours or something of the sort it doesnt even have to be that long its stupid that people can join corps and shoot you then leave minutes later so you cant retaliate against them
if you can run away from wardecs by corphopping then expect people to use the same mechanics to kill you deal with it
no not like a rokh a rokh is significantly inferior to a hulk for mining as you well know theres also the tiny detail that it needs battleship skill not miningexhumer skill im talking about a mining ship not about a refitted battleshipand on a side note ccps own data show that a whopping 40 of mineral production comes from reprocessed rat loot that right there shows that mineral production is seriously out of balance with that balance tipped strongly against the minersopening up lowsec for mining or better yet poor trusec 00 will greatly increase the supply of low ends this will have several beneficial results1 the relative price of high ends will increase back to what they should be2 hisec mining will be relatively less profitable reducing the incentive to macro and reducing resource strain for the new players3 it gives people a reason to get out of hisec
i dont understand why everyone who is against this idea keeps harping on the oh i want it in empire as well we wouldnt want this in empire we would want it in lownullsecthis would not be gamebreaking at all if anything the gamebreaking occurs already in the form of reprocessing lootthe argument that we already have mining ships that go with exhumers v come in the form of the rorqual and the orca i may point out that they are not mining vessels but mining support vesselsbefore i sign off i have to repeat we dont want this in high sec at all mining ships should vastly outperform battleships in terms of mining in every way and bringing up that the rokh can compete with a hulk out in lownullsec only supports our case
wait wait i must be missing something  you are against a ship that would a bring miners to low and nosecb drop mineral prices further making ships costs lowerc tank rats in 00 you of course shoot better so whats the difference to youd support capital warfarewho said anything about this being a hisec ship the orca doesnt mine does the dread shoot the rorqual doesnt mine does the titan ddd where is the comparason where is the dedicated no sec mining ship there is a nosec mining support ship and a large hi sec support ship but can the rorq fit strip miners can the orca where is the capital mining ship  supercapital mining shipfigure a t2 rorqual 8 high slots 8 strip miners hell maybe even a capital strip miner 7 medium slots needs a tank6 low slots for the cargo and tank and mlu2smake it move like a barn and fly like a barn but mine like the devil himself no ore compression but really why not no clonebay or fighter drones this ship needs a escort but why isnt there a cap mining ship yet reallynow how many of you would like to have this killmail think about that before you vote no
i would like to see a more advanced miner  but the problem is to keep it out of empire 
make it a cap ship  solved until chribba gets one that is
why are all the command ship modeled after the first battle cruiser rank 1 ships brutix typhoon etc why not make the second one modeled after the rank 2 models myrmidon prophecy  hurricane etc
to be honest they should have a completely new model
the answer is because command ships were released before the tier 2 bcshowever i do think theres some mileage in a revamp
no there needs to be new tech 2 battlecruiser ships using the tier2 battlecruiser model
supported i dont understand why i have to lose my settings each patch can it really be that difficultoh and rejoice thanks tusko
well as some might have noticed the trader profession seem to have been overlooked in regards to the higher ranked skills there havent been added any new skills and higher levels to this group i really think we could use a few new ones a new level above tycoon would be nice also a skill to handle the suggestion belowi really would like to see a specialized trade ship kind of like the orca but specialized for tradethe features such a ship would have is a bit specialit needs a cargo space somewhere between the industrials and the freighters i would say something like 100000 m3 would be fitting its function is selection more than actul volumes it would ofc be resupplied by indies or freightersthe ship would need to anchor its commerce bay this would basically be a huge can the size of its cargo hold this should be a non scannable can or at least difficult to scan when this is anchored within range of a station or gate it function as an extension of a station item storage thus when you buy and sell the items you dont need to be docked and your orderbooks are injectedupdated with the local marketsthe update with local scc takes time the idea is that your orders are the same even though you decide to pack up and move to another region or system when done the orders can remain the same and keep the track of the demands so your ranges etc change when you move shop but your original order damands remain the samepersonally i would hope such a ship came in two types w and without jumpdrivemaybe even a type of jump drive that was reverse of the current system in regards to security so these could only jump into a more secure space than currently in so you would need to fly to less secure systems to get to a specific destinationi would think the ships should not be to expensive but the pricetag be on the maintaining of it the brokers fees and tax fees should be a lot higher when trading w this ship and the jumpdrive should be less effecient and have higher consumption but longer ranges the last would not be a problem the ship has no real offensive capabilities and only jumping up scale in sec makes it highly useless as an offensive weapon
in all honesty i think its more the trade commodity market that needs more looking into than a new class of shipalso i think this belongs more in either the features or ideas section or game development forum now i fyou proposed a look into the items market at the currant seeding of trade comoditys then i would have supported this but its more like a desperate grab for a new ship than anything
well its actually a bit more than just a new shipits a way to give an alternative to the station hugging wokring markets from space chose from a regional list is a bit useless if its trading for margin that is or resellingthis is basically a new feature and based in space without asking for special empire posalso its a requesting of giving some more attention to a part of the game that has not been tweaked much the last 23 yearsi am much more interested in fixing all the issues about market and economy i just wanted the idea in the mix for ships because the person that mentioned it kind of inspired me about what this could bring to the gameplay a commerce ship could bring a lot of stuff to the mix of trade and trader services
i agree that the corp access needs to be rethought but how about a affiliate status like a freelancer that your corp likes so a partial corp access most corps have a public hanger in their station setup of course this is different everywhere but maybe grantable access to a specific hanger or better usage rights to pos labs or something my main is in a mining corp we have friends who do pvp they wont join and we agree because of the constant wardecs they get but thats no reason not to let them have some access we make bpc of cruise missiles and would like to make them available to our friends we really have to make contracts and station trades constantly we cant just like give them the hanger key just the one mind you its stupid the way that is restrictive but i agree that you work for one corp and one only but where is the friends of corp x types of options in no way would they be working for us or even part of our corp but you have friends and then you have family why is there no access options for friends
its exactly things like this you would get if you could simply wear more corp uniforms than oneand switching between uniforms did not have the time limit of 24 hourswith such a feature the 24 hour limit might even be moved to 48 hours and that would be how long to resign from a corp affiliationthe only issue is how to handle being in a friendly and in an enemy corpthis brings up the issue of how wardecs would work they should somehow be more consenting and based on aggression thus if you made it dependent on both standing to and from it would basically mean that wardec payments would be paying for standing differencenaturally this would mena standing needed a rather extensive overhaul but in effect it would also mean you could be at war with higher ranking members in a corp while affiliates might be disregarded you would still have kill rights from the wardec but you would be able to see the individual standings and disregard the targetthis would also make new features of having spies or moles in corps in a new mannerthe core idea is that accessing more corps then one with your main character would be nice for those that prefer not to use alts and skinjump and even those that opose the whole corp jumping for safety issue
si
id like it if there was an option to contact the station owner and then a way to bribe him to boot the person out of the station and not allow them to redock for eg 24 hours
id like it if there was a way to bribe the station owner to shoot at the campers outside the station lets at least make station camping more interesting
thanks for the response guys it would definitely be best suited on black ops i also like the idea of having some sort of negative effect keep em coming
awesome ideathe greater number of warfare tactics available will improve pvp on this game dramaticallythis would be like an ambush maybe 10km range
having only been here a little over a month or so i cant say i know what the whole t20 deal was  though the way everyone says it it sounds like someone not only robbed fort knox they stole the fort at the same timebe that as it may  if you dont trust ccp why are you doing business with them i certainly am not going to buy a product from a salesman i dont trust so why are you i know others have said it in this thread but i frankly dont see a problem
would you rahter have a game where the developers play the game and have a connection to it or one where theyre pushed out and lose touchthere is no issue with misconduct in recent events like the pos exploit ccp have actually handled things very wellthese rumours are only lingering by the voices of the tinfoil brigade
they should include a tinfoil hat in the new eve box

sigh where to start with poor lost niskin in no particular order1 ccp does not consider buildingtradingminingindustry as something secondary to 00 hard core blood in your teeth pvp if you believe that you are simple wrong i have met many in ccp that would back me up so niskin and anyone that thinks eve just exists to support your pvp myopia reality check eve is about all that other stuff you hate just as much2 tada o lived in 00 for some time we choose to leave and take advantage of a blend of empire and low sec anyone that spends any time in low sec knows it is probably harder than 003 the discussion you keep referencing where you suggest that i stood up banged on the table and shouted ccp please for the love of gawd let carebears live in 00 never happened the idea of opening the regions of 00 to a broader range of folks came up and i offered some ideas honestly i am more interested in fixing low sec and believe if you take a moment to review my campaign platform youll see that low sec was my favorite subject4 for someone that claims to have direct experience with my organization you clearly never spent a minute to understand the core concepts if ever there was an egoless organization i think it has to be beep that fact that you have choosen to be part of the most cult of personality org i have ever encountered in a virtual world makes me suspect you have a hard time forming opinions on your own that you need a rigid structure to survive and i understand how anything that change your very limited view of this amazing virtual world would seem to be a threat5 it must be hard for you to continually respond to the members of beep that have challenged you with the limited content personal attacks that seem to be all you can muster while none of your org join in your rants summary you seem to fixated on me someone that never ever did anything to you personally and offered you an opportunity to be part of one of the happiest and most committed long term organization in eve sorry that you have this personal vendetta but i dont see anything in your compaints that makes me want to rethink my ideas or regret any prior decisionsi remain committed to the following ideas1 corps exist for the members not the leadership2 alliances exist for the benefit of the member corps3 eve is for more than hard core pvpers and has one of the most amazing enviroments for folks many would be discounted by the vocal minority of eve pvp bigots as mearly carebears4 that the csm can make eve better and my background can be valuable to the csm5 that nonnis in iceland makes the best sandwich in the worldsorry if any of those positions keep you awake at nightissler
i endorse this product
the sarcasm comment came in a later post i wasnt aware that it was such when i respondedthere were no details that i saw simply the comment i quotedive never been called a troll before thats a new one thanks for that and btw thats not sarcasm isslers post shows exactly why i would be worried about her having input on 00 changes so ill address that in that reply in a bit
whoever is kept awake of night becaus oh wait i couldnt sleep for a few days after i got home because of the lack of nonnis
well if you read my posts youll see where i said that conflict is the core of eve not pvp specifically since you are buds with the devs ill take your word on their opinions conflict is what makes the game go around whether its ship to ship combat or market trading wars if there is no conflict things will get stale and eve will grow dull that is the pointhow could anyone possibly believe that even you bubbles alone make up half the extra difficulty the lack of stationgate guns in npc 00 and the lack of stations in true 00 make up the rest well im glad to hear that isnt how it happened i am curious what is wrong with low sec though honestly while eve has some bugs here and there i dont see these glaring issues that we need csms foroh i fully understand the core concept of beep its not like you are the first implementation of a casual family guild in the world i dont have a problem with you playing how you want but given that core concept of your alliance you should be able to see why i would fear you having input on 00 issues living in 00 takes commitment and dedication and if that changes then there would be no point in trying to take and hold that spaceive got a bit of forum warrior experience in my 10 years of mmo playing this is nothing i still dont see these personal attacks all along ive been addressing one issue you having input on 00 issues i have a feeling that if this exchange was occuring in a different thread with a different title you and you pals would be far less concerned with my comments1 a well run corp does benefit the membership even if that isnt its direct focus2 same as 13 as i pointed out before we all do that stuff you think that only you do i mine i have prod eff 5 and build my own ships i ratted and ran a hacking site last night while in 00 the only difference is when a hostile fleet undocked i went over and helped fight them the carebear term isnt about what you do or do not do its about the fear of doing them or the thought that avoiding them is possible in this game4 possibly so but we will see as for your background being valuable in certain areas sure in others well let me point back to that 00 vs low sec comment aboveim sleeping just fine but thanks for askingquotes shortened due to limited response space
you have no experience with what issler proposed will change concrete examples something other than i dont think she has the right ideayou never responded to thesenow lets get to the crux of your argument if now youre not sureive seen more than one issue anyone elsenot the important one though it seemsi doubt no matter how long we wait that we will ever find this concrete evidence of isslers horrible ideas therefore ill end with her words from much earlier in this threadand keep in mind that throughout your lengthy response to this post you should always remember one vital fact this was never an issue issler raised to ccptake your issues up with ccp

tbh lana would make a sexcellent sidekick for pompousoh and regarding your hypothetical question captain pommmmmm ive already posted it here before but ill simplify it a bit i want you to actively work to remove csm srsly that money would be better spent on a marketing dude that could help the devs communicate with customerseither that or have them install a beer fountain somewhere for the next fan fest less srsly note
i thought thats what you meant misanth but i just wanted to double check hell theres no reason why the csm cant be wrecked from within and shown to be the house of cards it is and install a beer fountain at the same time is there
quotin this cause im down with the capt
lets assume i got in and in a fit of magical wonderment ccp said hey fella you have the power to do one thing to change any aspect of the game immediatelybut its the only direct change you can makewhat would that change bebanning nexus probably doesnt count
how about actual pvp training in the turtorialsactually thats too good i knowwe have spiced winespiritsprostitutes and drugstheres a few things missingcards dirty magazines rumand for another serious idea some kind of ransoming tool
a pvp tutorial is actually a pretty good idea you know i dont want to put out too many real ideas out there in case they get mistaken as an actual platform lol and as we know the seeing and peeing things up platform is actually no platform at all amirite
ofc your right just adding content to attract the nonbelievers shuns the nonbelievers
society is not yet ready for our wholesale nihilism and iconoclasm lol thus we must dress it up with a veneer of content and respectability
a very thin veneer would be best something like the cheap melamine you find in the dustier aisles of home depot
i can just imagine it you know draw them in with promises of elctoral accountability and piety and blammo hit them with the cp stick
methinks we need some aggressive marketing

i have thought of a proposal to take to ccp if electeddevolve forum control to certain respectable members of the community and let each forum section be governed by the pillars of the community in each sectionand then let the cat amongst the pigeons by suddenly reassigning see and peeers control of md and the md group control of new players qawatch all hell break lose
because isd worked so well and there was no kind of favouritism whatsoeverwould be funny but ultimately stupid
your character has a corporation history and an alliance history from a technical perspective i cant imagine it would be difficult to have an alias name history too be kinda cool too
signedcouriers are stupid the rewards are low the hours long and too many of them are scams sure the mechanic should stay in place cause its always nice to be able to use a real person but if your not going to a trade hub it takes forever for a freighter sized contract to move just because the rewards put up are never going to be nearly enough to justify going that far out of a trade hub its like the difference between overnight fedex or usps id like a npc courier system so i know that it at least someday will get there as to the npc service cost vs player cost sure make the npcs more expensive make them take longer i dont really care as long as someday my order will get there having at least a slowboat option will help streamline some of the couriers i wouldnt mind if my amarr enam took two weeks to come to me but making a 5m3 contract just looks suspicious and how many people actually enjoy jumping into jita120k for npc couriers and 750k for players contract size for rigged bs and the likehonestly i dont see anything wrong with making fewer jumps into jita less people need to pick things up  fewer jumps in less lag
not sure what the best methods would be maybe granting all players the ability to somehow redistribute skills but at a rather notable lossit will speed things up for new players and it will give the old players the chance to position into other thingsthe game has changed rather a lot and some things you trained long ago made sense and you basically did it to try something newi am just saying that looking at the training times and trying to make a plan with a new character really would scare me away if i had not been here for so longanother method could be to create softskill installments in the cybernetics groupbasically plugins that grants you a 1 to skillsthus you might have used a plugin in your jumpclone to make it possible to use jumpdrives but when you change clone the skill and those related to it are lostthese types could speed things up and create an isk sink while making a new type of skill strategy gameanyways just think it would be nice with a bit of middle ground in regards to real time trainingthe learning skills and the basic implants are rather lame in my opinion to
damps could do with a boost too but the reason these ships suck is that damps along with other ewar were nerfed a while ago because they were too powerful caldari recons got boosted to make up for this but gallete ones didnt damps on nondampspecific ships shouldnt be very good but they should be a powerful tool when fitted on a specialised ewar ship

no but the standing loss for failing missions should be reduced as should killing enemy npcsgoing from 803 to 76 or whatever it was for killing a frigate is stupid
it doesnt even make much rp sense either the way it is nowsay you are a welltrusted person of a certain agentcorpfaction you completed hundreds of missions in the past for them flawlessly and now you fail to complete one mission making a small mistake and you need to complete dozens maybe hundreds of missions again before you have the same amount of trust conversely you are the branded enemy of an empire you destroyed countless ships foiled countless plans they made and you just need to run a couple of small errands for their friends and you are automatically all buddybuddy with them again no it just doesnt make any sense to have a certain percentage of trust lost not be relatively repaired by the same amount of trust gained later ona 10 standings gain then a 10 standings loss that should bring you almost to the same point you were beforeconversely a 10 standings loss should be almost completely countered by a 10 standings gainnote if you want to get to the exact same point it would be a 10 gain and a 9090909 loss for perfect equivalencethe above proposal does exactly thatand now you can have the failure penalty for a mission be exactly the same as or even higher than the reward you get if you complete it and still not break anythingedit added support
yep major fix neededmakes sense with what you got going on there for math but then it also looks the same with the correctionsstandings need to be easily improved just as easily lost at a minimum for me
i dont think its stupid a frigate has hundreds or thousands of crewman all of them will die a horrible death in space they cant be burried their families will never see them children will lose their daddys wifes their beloved husbands all that relatives will go to their local government office and complain about their deaths actually the empire should hate you if you kill a frigate and not like you a little bit less
heh i dropped from 002 sec to 07 security by accidentally firing off an ecm burst at a station yet it took me a month of mission running to get that 002meh guess i should train more social skills respec ftw

as many people will point out im not a goon as for sniping setups with the nag its not terribly hard to get it sniping with both weapons missile rigs  1 tetracking computer but it suffers from the same problem as a regular nag in that it has the weakest tank by far and the least dps the real problem is that sniping with cap torps means you have to shoot a different primary in order to give your missiles time to hit the target such as firing at the secondary  tertiary while your guns should be on the primary you can obviously just say  it and fire your guns at the same target but with more than handful of nags this means you really need 3 different primariesanyone with half a brain sorry yaay you dont count can see that the nag is the worst dread by a large margin combine this with the fact that minmatar bses are completely terrible in fleets and you really have no reason to train for minmatar caps unless youre an awesome person who actually likes suicide triage repping poses and feel like wasting a bs v for it all 3 other dreads are unique and have different reasons for people training for them the nag does not if youre in a nidhoggur pilot its actually faster in training time to train for a revelationmoros and then you have amazing bses and t2 large guns for a decent race of battleships not to mention a dread thats almost literally twice as good i can not think of a single logical looks dont count reason anyone would want to train for a naglfar
sold my minmatar cap pilot ages ago never looked back completely unsurprised that naglfars are still worthless
yet were here i should have one coming out from an oven in 3 weeks i know its the worst dreadi was talking with a corp mate few day ago he shield tanks his naglfar and 4 damage mods in the lows to stay competitivehis position on numerous pos kill mails was far from the top of the list and thats what 4 damage mods and compromised tank nid is armor tank thats about 1820days of training time to be able to use capital shield booster for comparative damage with dam mods another 1517days of training time for split weapon systemwere not talking about regular skills needed for split weapon of a typhoon for example were talking capitals skillsthis is a bad jokeneedless to say im still going minmatar all the way i doubt id be spending extra time to be able to shield tank it because split weapon system is enough
i understand logging of when an enemy force would otherwise not catch you anyway but the current state of people logging of in buffer tanked haulersfreighters at gates is stupid let me outline a few stupid scenarios where we are helped out by our best friends whos names wont be mentioned serious love yallwe had just had a fight on gate the carrier warped to the gate carrierwith 15minute aggrodisconnects and warps to an esafe we scan him down we tackle him we start killing him he warps back to station wtf i assume what happened here is when he logged back in his client forced him to continue warping to where he was even though he had a hic pointing hima providence runs one of our camps by logging off then logging of right after he logs on so he doesnt warp back to the gate  does this not sound like an exploit to youand all the time we have buffer tanked haulers logging off right after they jump through gates so they dont have 15min aggro and if they use the above trick its impossible to catch themso i propose a fix once you are agressed someone is attacking you then your ship will not dissapear until the hostiles stop aggroing you your ship will continue to attempt to warp off to another safe so if the hostiles have horrible tackle its their bad luckthis isnt a nerf logging off thread its a fix logging off and stop the people from abusing logging off thread
sounds like a whole lot of assumptions and a whine postand your solution is ridiculousnot supported
semiwhine but i dont see any assumptionspropose a better solution if it sounds good then ill put it in the op
originally id support the following statementplayers should be 100 sure that their ships are safe when logging offways to accomplish that would be docking in station or logging at a safe spotfriendly poshowever due to disconnects and socket closures it may not be fair thus the compromisefixing the doublelog trick would definitely help but ships even when aggressed need to disappear eventually
op then come up with a solution that makes sensewhat you currently propose would make interdiction pointless and alot of people would complain of being unable to log out all because of aggro never mind the shooting partspeaking of which what happens if they disconnect due to internet access and then you got a crapton of petitioners asking for there stuff back
ok then how about using the log off or quit game buttons send a special packet to the server causing the logoff to be treated differently yes we will have people yanking the cord out of their walls but at least its more trouble for them and that means their alts will dc as well
why would it make dictors pointless at least something needs to be done about people logging off right after jumping and agro timers disapearing after jumping also shouldnt happen
well they already fixed the timers getting killed after jumping atleast they dont reimburse for losses from it yes i jumped an ishtar warped to safespot and logged off due to rl logged back in several hours later in high secanyways claiming that people that lose connection during a fight should be able to save their asses with really valid but how many times have you gotten a disco exactly after jumping through a gate into an enemy campyes i agree those people that do lose their connection like that are wronged but lets face it atm a lot more people are exploiting this humanitarian trait of ccps then it actually helpsso yeah lets try and get these logoff tricks stopped make some constructive suggestions if you dont like the ones already posted or come up with some critique points
5 to 6 times but not at a gate campliving where i live internet access is at bestrandom stabilitypoint is you cant predict whenhowor whereccp cannot and will not be able to know the differencetrust me tcpip dictates it that way pain in the assso yes constructive suggestions are needed but dont say crap such as aggro locks them on the grid type things thats just stupidif you really want a balanced fix for the jump gateif player drops off during jump force them back to the previous systemelse they arrive right where they came in atjust like usual
how about decreasing the time you stay in space to say 20 seconds and giving agro on ships that are attacked even if player is not logged inimo it really is tough luck for people that get disconnected and ganked its part of the game that you die every so often no matter how smart you play it but people use all these features in a way they were not meant to be
fully supported freighters should not be able to travel through lowsec with total impunity and ctrlq should not be a valid substitute for intelligence or skill this is actually a really nice solution to the issue seriously compare the number of times you log out of eve intentionally to the number of times your internet dies or you otherwise lose connection i meanw hat are the chances of someone actually losing connection moments after jumping through a gate just in time to save their freighter from a large campanyway if you made all modules stay online when you lose connection that would allow people who are winning a fight when they ctd to actually survive
this tactic is driving my corp and myself nuts our last contract against kenzokubob i think 3 freigters used this trick they jumped in saw one of us at a gate ctrl qd and waited hours or even days to log back in when they did they ctrl qd again then logged back in putting them 1000000km away from the spot they got dropped at we managed to catch one write up to follow next week in cp if any one is interested not only that kenzoku ships would fly blind into our scouts and ctrl q before any one could show up to gank them current record is 13ish drops in a single day some of them were group drops where 23 would jump threw into a patrol and drop connection and the best part is they would say by first or smack us with alts after they had logged mechanics need to change as it stands if you are buffer tanked and caught at a gate as long as you are cloaked ctrl q and just hope the fleet doesnt have the dps to gank youas too the issue of mass petitions as it stands if you do lose a ship due to a dc which has happened to me a few times with the pesky socket closed eror there is not enough evidence to reimburse the shipedit spelling
approvedhaving once had the experience setting up a 20 industrial pos chain i feel your pain while balancing is an issue particularly in relating to avoiding 00 pos spamming i think the idea itself has a great deal of merit

whats wrong with a buff to the research industry sure it has its share of congestion problems but ive posted thoughts on how to help remedy this in another thread empire slots only available when you have a corp office rented in the station for examplethey would add to the game in the same way that named t1 mods add to it sometimes you fit a named damage control instead of t2 as you dont have the resources available to make t2 work with your fit named t1 ships would provide for exactly the same niche and would work as a boost for t1 production whereas currently theres only a market for battlecruisers battleships and capitals in t1 with almost everything else really being t2  inventionthis is a nonissue as your argument here suggests that you feel ccp should never add anything new into the game something im fairly confident youre entirely alone in believingmost t2 ships are simply specialised t1 ships not necessarily better ships due to the fact that they usually have improved resists something i think named t1 should not have people often prefer to use them for purposes outside their intended roles examples abound within the assault frigate class comparing for example a retribution  vengeance against its t1 counterpartnot at all we dont have named t2 mods why would it follow that we would need named t2 ships t2 is different not necessarily better rememberany new idea will create balance issues and it will always take time to address these issues no matter what the proposal is as for your comment about overpowering frigates against cruisers or cruisers against battlecruisers etc this simply wouldnt be the case were talking about marginal changes to ships based on research that render them preferable to their raw t1 counterparts for example the current megathron6875 cpu19375 pgu7764 shield8301 armor9375 hull7031 capacitora named version of this ship might simply increase one of these attributes perhaps increasing its capactior by 3 or so or adding 1 to its cpu the changes should be slight and rather than simply a sliding scale more research  better different variants of the hull should provide different benefitsgiven the average megathron setup the most desirable named version would probably be one that gave it something as small as another 10 cpu and this isnt exactly a gamebreaking change when you consider that each and every t1 ship could be researched and then produced in exactly the same way
lol youre a tripper
well he is a csm candidate 
or you could get named upgrades what rigs where suppose to be an use a system similar to tech 3akarifter upgrade 1 of 52 less low slots for 1 high and 1 turret and 50 more shield hpand that sort of stuffthen these named changes to ships could be droped
corp jumping to evade wardec  exploitcorp jumping to get involved in a wardec  acceptableyesanything can be abused but not likely gonna throw a fit about it
theres a simple solutionduring a wardec neither corp can change memberships until the war endsproblem solved
actually it is the other way arround according to ccpof course they dont care if another member joins the 20 who allready are at war with you but if 20 join the single member corp who wardecced another corp it isnt allowed
both should be fixed but i doubt it will happen
yes i fully support declaring it an exploit to corphop in order to avoid war decs it is already an exploit to join a corp involved in a war in order to gank people instantly
every time i read one of these painful threads about war decs i love 00 more
well its an exploit if they corp jump just to kill you then leave the corp so you cant fight back without getting concorded its stupid
with the new 24 hour skill queue it seems to me that ccp is missing out on an obvious new skill advanced learning or something similar where each skill level would add 20 to the skill queue length depending on how you calculate those percentages you could get to either 48 or a bit above 57 hours at level vmake it expensive and high ranking and even perhaps an item in lp store if you dont want all but the more dedicated players to use that long a skill queuebest regardsgil w
the miners understand where im going with this  thats the important thingso make it not like a hulk at all give it a distinct capitalclass ship look and feel and decent defences something that will take care of nulsec rats at least not because were fishing for nulsec rats just so we can keep mining without having to scramble and leave the belt we dont scramble and leave the belt in hisec we just sick the drones on the ratsthis ship needs a clone vat but its not a combat support ship its not a mining support ship it doesnt need 5 clone vats only the one for the pilot can we agree on that without making a frowny face and start blubbering about how i want to mine the whole belt empty in 10 space and make free isk thank you much appreciatedideally there would be one for every faction why because it would add four beautiful new space frames to the inventory maybe that cant be woven into the ore story line but i can do that easy surely ccp would think nothing of having the factions commissioning a miner from ore for each of the races some details would be factionspecific happens all the timevast amounts of belts that are now not mined would become accessible obviously a miner in a ship like this would expose themselves to great risk if the reward was greater access to exotics it would help balance out the riskreward factor i cannot possibly fathom how a nicely balanced wellequipped capital miner with the ability to survive in nulsec systems would be asking too much nothing about it would be free nobody who would be looking into flying one would expect it to be freeabulurd bonifaceme meceo
now there i agree fully lowsec mining is utter garbage at present and will be until they put some worthwhile ores there  the single worst ore in the game jaspet is a lowsec ore the supply of ore at present is skewed badly and miners especially in lowsec are taking the worst of it thing is a new exhumer wont solve that you want to solve that push for widespread changes to the supply lines of eve not for a better ship to supply 60 of the ore
hmm well if there were a 66 increase in the demand for mined minerals i suspect the the problem would at least partly correct itself
its not just a skin difference its a mechanical difference in order to build a sleipnir you need a cyclone as one component in order to invent it you need cyclone bpcs if you change the skin you change the entire manufacturing process as well and add a good 15 million to the pership costs of whichever ships you upgrade theyre not willing to do that just to change the appearance of some command ships ask for new ships maybe but asking to change the old ones is a lot more of a change than you think it is and its not justifiable not supported
just for info this thread can go inactive nowccp will release this in apocrypticaread in this blog all at the bottom you need to ctrla the page because they written it in the same colour as the background of the page so you might miss it
oh  yes i cant believe we dont have something like this already
if they ever get the lag monster under control and make ejecting something you have to do manually then you might see that sort of thing come into gameplaypersonally id be very satisfied with wrecks being actual wreck rather than some generic image with a loot can in it something that you cant just quick drag into your cargo hold and then warp off withsomething you have to repair and fly or tow back or chop up and haul back to stationmaybe someday

thats smashing monies to you d
i will join your chats within the houri fully expect to get kicked but preempting you by saying that if you post here that you kicked me you lose rep and are a massive gankwad macrojerkjust saying is all

i did hang around but your slow friends took too long to type that im afraid 
can we prevent csm runnersmembers from posting in cp come on its for a good cause
and your still failing to understand why your concern is almost a non issue obviously the issue isnt ccp since they can track it anyway and yes obviously the client would need to be extended so players can see and search name history however this is not as complicated as your making it as i already said and ill repeat it now so that hopefully you will actually read and understand this time the player search feature ingame now would be extended to search past character names in addition a players past names would appear in the player info window theres no need to make some big huge new agent driven thing just to get some simple informationyeah some strange mishap called security twisted no common sense ill give you an example wouldnt it be cool if players could join a new corporation after they have already joined one oh wait they can but zomg thats horrible because now you cant know what corporations that player was in before oh wait yes you can it shows it in the user info list the server didnt have to give you uber l33t player id information for you to know that it just sent you only want you needed to knownegative the users new name would be listed in your addressbook replacing the old name they could even add a little visual cue to notify you that the player had changed names recently and again you can right click on the name get info and see what prior names it held
you can change your portrait already your standings reputation and all other ingame mechanics would not change as we have pointed out already name history would be searchable so this really doesnt impact anything besides cosmetics
working as designed  no change is needed
this
i agree some changes need to be made particularly looking into the future keeping the game attractive to new players in addition its simply not sustainable longterm to just keep on adding more skills onto the list its the same mentality other mmos have with the oh we will just increase the level cap and put the new content there you cant do that for long before you ruin the game a major refactoring is required eventually if the goal is to keep the game going long into the future
its actually the exact opposite mentality
actually that mentality is dead on the only difference is that what you really have is a tree of leveling skills and not a single linear branch like in most level based games now instead of look everybody can now be a level 80 instead of 70 we hear you fly battleships you can use capitals but remember first you have to get to battleshipsfor example before caps were introduced you could have hit the racial ships level cap bs v etc and then the new content capitals was put beyond the new raised level cap you still have to grind through battleships to get to capitals its just that everybody grinds at roughly the same speed due to the time thus time being a grind in eve
any kind of customizationpersonalization to the look of ships would be a nice touch
and now for something completely different im really getting into shipbuilding and already made some legitimate isk from this new side of my character kat savage but id really like to have a go at building from scratch or adapting an existing design to produce my own azinko variant ship designs azinko fleet vexor for example with an extra med slot and unique name and assuming i need skills like research how do i write my own blueprints from scratch do i need a blueprint to invent a new variant or can start with a blank sheet of paper and design a completely new ship design like the azinko blak ryno for example
couldnt have said it better than myself wait i did just not as eloquentlynicely said
you know in the march release im sure i read something about mysterious wormholes to other reagionsi actually think that empire space would be more interesting with a bit more traffic outside jita so long as the servers could hack it that is but ccp seem to know whats going on in that area
cant appear to find the finalised meeting minutes  they available yet
we got the ccp version today undergoing some minor tweaking so hopefully due later today
evil  im somewhat on the fence on your proposal and so is the playerbase it seems while you do have 54 supports you also have 135 replies in total of which about 20 are you bumping the thread and most of the rest against it basically a 5050 split after you take into account the people who also supported without a thumbs up convince more people to give it a thumbs up and ill consider backing it
i already gave my opinion in the thread i will also vote no for such suggestion should anybody from the csm pick it up
please add minmatar  balance to the issues list will write document when i get home
i havent had time to brush up the mission timer topic nor work out further details and integrate player feedback so i rather pass it till next meeting as the reactions have shown quite a few good suggestions but also a bit of criticism which i need to find a solution for
no
so constructive i guess if all else fails just disagree without reasoni will say i do like that quote about not being paranoid
1 i dont think its a bad idea per se i just dont think enough people think its a good idea for me to champion it which leads on to2 just because other people are willing to champion things with less support doesnt mean i will theres 7 other csms who may take up the cause with this amount of support lavista has already said no but at this point i wont if one of those csms brought the issue up for a vote then i would look at it like every other issue brought up and vote accordingly
its a good idea and here is a suggestionccp could give each character a certain code so even if you change the name of your character the buddy list and stuff will automaticly change it to the right name so you wount get any misleads in your buddy list allso if someone was to change that name how would it still exist as a charater when it doesnt belong to anyone djust my 2 cents for help towards the character name change
i was against this but after the arguments found here i am for this as long as the cost increases per name change and the name change is listed in the players information sheet somewhere viewable by everyonei dont see a whole lot of people doing this as it would mess with your killboard stats this would be a nice option for fcs that find themselves instaprimary or people named aaaa that always get insta primaried in fleet fights 
what is the magic number of supports before you champion an idea this thread has 142 posts and 57 supports i went through all 5 pages and lost count at around 50 posts made by people who already ticked support so it is more like 92 posts and 57 suports which is a very good numberthis topic is much more supported than factional warfare complex spawning that got three total replies or a useless change like adding dumb stripes to medalsso what you are saying is that this topic is more popular and supported by more players than lots of other topics but you do not wish to support it because you are too much of a  to take a side you represent the people of eve and talk to ccp for us if the people of eve support adding in elves to eve then that is what you bring up if you do not wish to listen to the people and champion the peoples ideas then gtfo out of the csm
i am glad people do not let this up it has been years and ccp pretty much ignored and swept it under the rug the pos as it is now needs to be reexamined and revamped honestly they cant screw it up the ccp that is they can no simply because it is so screwed up already that making it worse would be like going back to 2004 anyway all people who need this whatever their affiliation might be should contact the csm they have voted for and support the pos overhaul point them to these boards you know just in case they are too busy and forgot about the funny pos thing as ccp has called
i support this issue mainly because it should have been done like 1 year ago and ccp dropped the ball on this issue and sov in general
what about drone mods any news on this yet
the underlined bits are priceless so basically what you are telling us the players of eve many of whom voted for you is this dont rock the boat truly priceless you do not want to risk a relationship with ccp just listen to yourself for a second whom do you represent ccp or the players of eve this is truly an example of being too comfortable and now that you know you will not be going to the next csm you tell us the truth your relationship with ccp is more important to you than what your duties as the csm why would you even say such a thing why would you even come out and admit that csm has no ability whatsoever to represent the players because if we go by your statements csm does not want to risk it furthermore you are comparing a polite and pointed demands that people have been aiming at ccp regarding this issue to a behavior of a spoiled child you joking right this has been going on for years now over two years has passed and i have not seen one flame one troll from the community  the only reason you would say something like this is to reduce the validity of the need for the pos rewamp spoiled children really the developers did not even give csm a time of day on this issue they chose to call it a funny pos thing and all you are doing is reiterating the point that reduces a significant issue by renaming it thus proving all those people on forums who say that csm has no ability to do anything whatsoever they cant even garner respect from ccp to call an issue what it is a pos problem and resort to the diminutive and reductive lexical semantics of the funny pos thing lv i know you are not running for the next csm and you had my support for the two terms that you have served and i know ccp refusing you entry due to your age but i am afraid from the above statements your age does show you did not think things through before you posted and painted yourself into a corner i am afraid i do not know what you meant to say but what you did say was pretty much this ccp is a big daddy i want big daddy to love me and i want him to love me better so i will take the big daddys side even if it means going against other kids and it does not matter that the other kids are the ones who asked me to help them with the big daddy because he was not so nice to themthe pos has to become a priority to ccp it has been a huge drain on resources and just patching the code does not work if it is impossible to patch the code then ccp should start working on the new code what a concept i know and when the new code for pos is ready implement it csm should keep this alive for a simple fact that pos  as it is  affects pretty much everyone in the game and making it better more streamlined more user friendly more believable will only improve the game in the long run ccp is happy to spend their time on all sorts of things why not dedicate a small team to slowly trudge and make a pos better because i guess they do not have to deal with the pos garbage every day and it is easier to have a defective if working pos than to actually have a fully functional structure in place well i really hope csm would stop being ccps lap dog and show some backbone otherwise i would say the whole thing was an exercise in futility so far the important stuff csm has failed at it oh and it is nice to be back after a month away from eve
so what is it going to take to get some csm support on this issue
importableexportable block listits harrassing to block the same people 2 or 3 times or more   and theres just too many scammers so its harrassing to block them on every char   so it would be nice to be able to exportimport the block list fromto other charactersopinions 
as long as its easy to implement sure
first off an interesting article i am one of the people that see macro mining as a problem why well i see a big feature of eve is its player based economy when people are able to mine vast amounts with no limits they can create a monopoly over ore prices minerals etc monopolies are not allowed in most real life countries so i think in a game with a market based aspect their should be at least some measures to at least make them harder to pull off monopolies shaft people and most players get shafted by macro mining regardless of whether or not people have access to macro mining programs not all people will have the best resources to run a pc 23 hours a day with the client open playing on a family computer for example so what do they say i happen to be in group of people that use macro miners they usually pull up this comment from the link at the beginning of my replyso this is what i think would be a good first step see if we can get ccp to revise the eulathat way there will be at least some clarity of it being not okay if newer players are told that macro mining is okay by their friend and shown the current section 7 of the eula it probably wont help the problem sure its not going to get all macro miners bannedetchowever this might be a helpful first step in the right direction just for ideas sake heres the similar statement from the wow eulaeve online eula
so if you are truly macrohunting and someone reacts as you stated above calling you names etc would you apologize for the gank and reimburse him for his lost equipment insert laughter here you may apologize but the reimbursement would most likely be out of the question
if the queue comes in the form of certificates it would be like ccp laughing out loud in your faceit would prolly make me rage quit
as much as i hate to say itthis seems pretty accurate
the csm is the dummyhand at the bridge table i will not waste effort in here again fly safe
so what happened i have been gone a month and since then ccp did not even have pip come out to the public is csm pushing for the detailed information regarding what happened or what anyone knows what the deal is other than the polite noises from csm and ccp and has this become a dead issue as well simply because ccp knows if they keep quiet long enough we will just go away okie dokie
please just read the minutes it says clearly that by the end of januarystart of february a detailed devblog will be released
well gee whiz i had no idea that all you had to do in the csm was make ginormous posts about such important topics i have experience doing things like that too doncha know maybe i should use my abilities as a maverick to bring some fresh blood into the csm next time the election rolls around ive got some great ideas that can really change new eden around like banning that nasty pax amarria book and making podding illegal its too much like abortion dont forget to vote for me next time the election is hereoh and ankhewhateveryournameis you dont seem too popular id stop sounding so carebearish go and take a lesson from ronald reagan and maybe you can be a maverick like me
im encountering the same issues  ccp seem to want everyone to take sides so the prevalence of faction missions is much higher than it used to be but its not just the standing loss its the lack of bounties that i dont like plus many of the faction missions ive tried are insane smash the suppliers level 4 is the most difficult mission ive come across and even with a couple of buddies to help out we couldnt do itid like to see faction missions to only become available from certain agents say intelligence if someone chooses to do them thats fine i personally prefer missions with bounties as i dont usually bother to salvage some added flexibility in choosing missions would be welcome  wanting to do combat and getting courier or mining missions is very frustrating ccp should check their stats on which missions are being turned down the most oh and i hope that these new epic mission arcs arent all faction missions
i rejectno seriously missioning mechanics are generally fine except standing mechanics for 00 factions say you have been living in low sechi sec and you want to make a natural move on your career and go to 00 but you notice you have 10 standings for every pirate faction except mordus maybe who have like 1 level 4 agent which means missioning in 00 is pretty closed for you forever i think this is a bit of a real problem there if any
gas missionsyou show you know nothing about gas missions you are not allowed to use more than 1 harvester 425 bits of gas 1 bit every 30 seconds thats 2125 minutes or 3541666666 hours for a single mission that pays no better than a 90 minute mining mission if you use an industrial ship you can go non stop if you use a smaller ship you must add in drop offs at the local station and dont forget if you jet can it you can loose your can in 2 hours lots of funstarting any mission before down timemining missions being done partially before down time are a bad thing because at dt the mission resets and you have to start alllllllllllllllllllll overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrragents giving wrong mission typesthis is a personal pet peeve of mine im the corp industrialist i can l3 kill mission but id rather l4 mining missions why would an industrial agent mining or manufacturing need a kill mission doneundesired faction missionseve is a sand box why are you being so negative on someone elses sand box everyone has the right to play any way they choose within the rules and if having good faction with all factions is someones goal that is their choice i support the portion where an agent should give the missions that they are set to give and not other genre ie security agents should not give mining missions and mining agents should not give security missions ideamy suggestion on this would be to have perhaps scaling with your faction to the npc agents corp a list of missions the agent needs to get done examplerating  missions offered426384maybe even a ticker where you can accept all 4 missions or 1 or 2 i understand this is nothing easily implemented but it is something that would be beneficial in the future
on a slightly different tangentwhy is it that when i am accepting or finishing or refusing the mission i am told what i am saying vsing having a choicei do not enjoy telling my favorite agent yeah this sucked but heres your ore give me my iskoptions would be nice 1 yeah i got there first heres the ore how much isk were you able to squeeze out of them 2 meh it was okay i had some trouble but made it back with the goods3 horrible dont send me there again
no instead you are moving it to an anything within 1km diesit is supposed be nothing moving within 1km dies so as they say working as inteneded
as i stated in the other thread it provides a larger boost to those weapons designed for sub 5km range ie blasters and autocannons its perfectly logical for a closer target to be easier to hit
negative frigates class hulls will not be touched by this cruisers will still have a damage reduction particularly if using for example tracking disrupters battlecruisers and battleships however are far too large to miss at 1km rangedoes the 0m effect count as working as intended  probably not
fool the effects of tracking will still work as intended and making it difficult to hit targets that are moving fast and neartransversal velocity however the target should not effectively shrink because of the games in inability to understand how a firing arc actually needs to increase when the distance reducesin other words objects in the eve do not apaear to be bigger when you get closer to them instead thay effectively shrinking in size a typical school maths revision guide on our the behaviour of angles and perspective view will end the matter
tldr  how does i not hit 
imbalance is never logical
what imbalance 
he will eliminate the weakness of low tracking weapons at close range
original threadbackgroundnbsi and nrds are the two most common roe employed by sovholder alliances in evenot blue shoot it is often used because marshalling standings to badguys and protecting your assets and locals is hard with unidentified ships running aroundnot red dont shoot the another option available but its very difficult to punish the right bad apples and not shoot innocents its also a constant pain to adjust standings to small corps and even individual pilots who are abusing the sovholders nrds policynrds promotes alot of good things like trade freedom of movement and generally makes 00 more accessible to the broad public combined with rattingfarming contractsdeals and dockingrights it also generates income for the sovholders so why isnt it used moretwo major factors encourage nbsi over nrds as the easy way out 1 standings are hard to keep updated properly especially in large areas with alot of different neutral corps operating on a daily basis pirates and other unknown entities needs to be detected visually and hunted down manually and they can easily hide among true neutrals in a system 2 nrds means less targets to shoot at and increases the chance of hostile spies running around uncontested the goalto make the game more dynamic and increasing the level of interaction between playersbypopulating 00 by making it more accessiblegiving industrialists even very small corps a better chance to experience 00giving pirates and pvpers new fun challangesmaking sovholding alliances appear more like true powerful factions rather than greedy backscratcher corpsambitious maybe but keep reading
my suggestionintroduce new tools to encourage alliances and corps to choose a nrds like stance and open up their space for more playersthe toolsautomatic standings an alliance style secstatus with parameters set by the sovholders pilots and gangs who do bad stuff in the sov areas are flagged as red to the sovholders like in empire the thresholds are determined by the sovholders it could be anything from agressing neutrals or entering forbiddenoff limit systems stealing cargo or putting up too large market orders on specific items opening cynofields or being reported by sovholding personel with sufficient roles like security officers depending on the transgression it would result in different kinds of flags like temporary or permanent secstatusstandings loss in the end resulting in different responses from the pilots in the sovholding alliance fees and taxes different kinds of fees and taxes like gatefees jumpbridge fees and dockingfees ignoring a fee at a gate and jumping in anyway would result in a criminal flagging towards the sovholding corp tax on stationtrading depandant on the standing of the pilotcorpalliance markets market access controlled by the sovholders by dynamic taxes in relation to standings to prevent unrealistic hostile market action since the sovholders should be able to govern the market as they do their space licenses sellable licenses that are bound to the pilotcorpalliance receiving them a license could allow access to a certain system or systems dockingrights at certain stations rights to trade certain goods or items permission to shoot neuts or reds or blues whatever the sovholders allow within the sovholding alliance territory pos setup you name it licenses would be timelimited andor revokable at any time by the issuing alliance billboards and information anchorable billboards andor automatic messages transmitted to pilots in or entering sovheld systems for example explaining the rules and directing visitors different tools would be available at different sov levelsmy thoughtstools like the ones above would allow sovholding alliances to have both neutrals and pirates roaming around in their systems industrial players would have the chance to enjoy 00 while being protected by a sovholding alliance without the regular hassle of rent and obligations to pewpew for their masters pirates and evildoers would be rewarded with target rich environments and instead of being hunted by concord or lose empire secstatus they could get fun fights by real breathing playerssovholding alliances would be competing against eachother to provide the best service and securest space for the neuts and war between alliances would get alot more interesting since it encourages smaller fleets on disruption missions and the stakes are even higher than beforethis of course is all optional these are only tools to encourage a more breathing living 00 the regular nbsi stance would still be available even a mixed nbsi nrds stance could be chosen for different systems and areasthis could also integrated in whatever new sovsystem ccp has on the drawingboardit would not affect secstatus or dealings in empire or other areas of 00 and alliance and corp standings would overrule the parameters set by the sovholders 10 would always be 10edit oh the end
i think i see what your asking forit sounds like an overhaul to the standing system in generalwould a lot of what you ask for game mechanics wise not be solved if standing had some visibility improvements so you could change standings with corps players alliances and the options would be private personal public the private would be invisible to the receiver and no collateral impact the personal would only have impact on the receiver and not further up the public would have derivative impact all the way through the standing systemthe back and fourth of such a dynamic system would also make it possible to datamine and use infiltration as a method to enter player sov regions flying false flagswith something like this setup from players would have more meaning and would create more game while making things easier to govern out in sov spacei would expect something like that to ease the workload on a combat perspective but increase the interaction needs and trust relations governings morethis would also kick at player behaviour in an interesting waysigned because it kicks the beehive figuratively speaking
i see what youre going for as a member of an independent corp in 00 that is normally the neutral in the nbsi equation is a very enticing however i dont know despite the difficulties of being constantly hunted and shot at i truely enjoy 00 as the honest simple free alternative to the mess of standings and rules that exist in high and low sec its hard for me to endorse any idea that clouds the clarity of 00 even one that seems to benefit me
no need to worry most will still shoot you but it would be nice for the nrds people to have some more options
good read my friend
as i started reading this i had thoughts of oh great here it comes another stupid ideabut honestly im stunned this is a well thought out and very ambitous ideathe only draw back is takes a lot of effort to implement this systemyou have my thumb sirand best of luck getting supportsigned
this basically id imagine that most alliances wont use this but for the ones who do itd be seriously useful a surprisingly good and interesting idea
with the upcoming release of t3 and the previous patches i fear faction ships are becoming more and more irrelevant i would love to see a boost to their abilities as it would be a great shame to see these ships fade into obscurityi would like to propose changes to these ships so they remain viable in pvp one of these changes would be to the vindicator and its mwd bonus which is more than pointless i think it would be nice to see a boost to resistance dps and other areas to ensure people keep making videos with them for years to come
would it not be wiser to wait and see how t3 will be like and to observe which influence it will have before making wild assumptionswith the upcoming release of x insert anything vague and mostly unknown i fear that y insert anything unforeseeable will happen lets change y so that my fear will turn into someone elses nightmare 
yes i love it when people say kill tech 2 omg hax pos exploit tech 2 ftltech 3 is coming read the bloody news posts do the research good things coming this way dont put the cart before the horseyou just might be surprisedcomplain after you have something tangible to complain aboutdont always assume ccp is going to screw up they do a rather good job imho let im do itps not tying to come off as a hairy troll just a bit snippy this morning hehe need my quafe or something
t3 has nothing to do with it subbs faction ships need an overhaulpirate ships need more pgcpuprice needs to be substantial reduced especially on frigates t2 ships are cheaper and more effectivedramiel needs another turretguardian angel ships may need their bonuses changesfrigates need to not all be split weapon systems hookbill worm comet dramiel all suffer from thisalso it would be nice if nonfaction versions of the frigates were introduced and possibly pirate cruisersbss as they are some of the best models in the game say you buy the bpo through the lp store to make a tier 5 frigate racial frigate 5 but no supporting skills to bridge the t1t2 gap for the standard faction ships and tier 4 for the pirate racial frigate 4 for both races i think this would be the only way to ever make the cruor viable
problem is that ecm is all those ships have if you nerf ecm even a little bit they become like one volley bunching bags ecm ships have no mentionable ability to tank anything theyre slow and possess no real mentionable offensive capabilitieswhen you talk about nerfing ecm you could as well speak about nerfing ie webs or neuts also at least curse and rapier are wtfpwnage in very similar amount than falcon is and they can actually hurt people
well looking at contracting i thought about why logistics might be an issuewhy not try and increase the number of outstanding couriers allowedso in effect couriers cost say 110th of other contractsi think more courier missions would be made this way and more would go into hauling because filling the trucks would be more likely
editdidnt notice you where talking about missionsthey should pay much more and should be categorized in there own departmentnot forced upon someone doing a ton of combatnothing says haha when you get a shipping mission flying a battleship
are you talking about courier contracts or courier missions you seem to be discussing both please clarify
yes i was talking about contracts not missionsmore possible outstanding contracts could increase its usage
penalize overkill  reward fair playthe lack or decreasing frequency of small gang and small ship pvp is something bemoaned by many players and since there is a symptomatic relation between the reasons for the decline and the natural reaction to the very concept itself it can only be revitalized if there is an actual reason to do iti have thought about that for a while without any conclusions but then i had an idea which i want to shareone thing that motivates players apart from doing it just for the sake of doing it is profitprofit can be made in many ways of course and some ways are salvage and loot from your enemymy concept is to introduce the concept of dynamic circumstantial calculation into the makeup of both loot and salvage through the concept of overkillwhen a large ship blazes away its cannon are supposed to shred huge holes into the enemy smashing anything they hit apart and eventually blowing the enemy ship to pieces a battleship that destroys a frigate will likely not leave much of anything behind imagine what happens when you shoot a commuter car with a howitzer there will be little to nothing left to loot or salvage just an area littered with smoking pieceshowever if the same commuter car is effectively destroyed by small arms fire like a goon with machinegun there will be a lot left to be salvaged and lootedthe inclusion of such a mechanism might be a small part of the bigger picture of reducing overkill at least when the involved parties act with a sense of magnitudedestroying something using a smaller ship and smaller weapons should leave more behind to loot and salvageand i dont mean that the final blow should count ccp could probably add a max salvage value to all ships and have that value decrease in proportion to each hit like a hidden hp stat that is affected by the sheer magnitude of damage not by the added totaleven if it should fail to provide the necessary incentive for increased small ship use all by itself it may easily be a factor eventually and it will provide added reward for sportsmanshipthe same could and should be true for missions blasting enemies that are hopelessly outgunned and outclassed would result in less loot and salvage reward than doing missions in smaller ships where the mission provides an actual challenge and risknow you can rip it apart
i dont really see how this should help smaller gangs and maybe its just my impression but the most pvpers out there are doing it for the fun of it rather than for the loot or salvage
i like the motivational aspect of this postit goes to the core of what i believe is a balance flaw in eveyou point at salvage and loot tables and how they could be integrated better into the players activities i could not agree morethe most refined way to implement this would be to let the destruction of ships npc and player be the balncer of access to items and everything elsei am unsure if this to some extend is attempted to hardcodemy take would be that when a ship of any type is destroyed each item should be rolled for and its chance to survive be based on how many of that item is active in the entire universe its chance should also be compared to that items donchian avg and thus the combat of smaller ships would potentially be a price balancing activitysalvaging would be the same thing the different type of salvaged goods would be based on availability of the item and that items trading value so smaller ships spawned lower end salvaged goods and bigger ships the higher priced salvagefrom ccp side they should have a general idea of how much of the different items they prefer are in the world but the above type of system would end up rather self governing if the price and trade volumes was a factorthe precise mechanics would most likely need some tweaking but in the end it should become a powerfull and effective solution to the whole loot table problemsupported by principle
to me the most important thing about this is to both punish excessive use of force and to reward those who restrict their use of such forceif you want to capture something for its value you dont blow it to smithereens ccp themselves said that they consider elements of surgical warfare for future expansions and this could be part of thatin a certain way this would also address the issue some players have with empire afk mission runners it would be a lot less profitable to afk run missions in a passive tanked ship that fires away with brutally oversized warheads at small and medium targets on the other hand using drones would gain advantage as a tradeoff for the immensely increased risk of salvage ninjas through the fact that drones do their damage in small portions instead of huge strikesmaybe some day in the distant future we might even get different wreck models where a dominix destroyed by small guns looks like the original ship crossbred with a swiss cheese and the same ship destroyed by cruise missiles stealth bombs and extra large artillery looks more like the cloud of debrissupporting my own concept of course
i dig it
yes
i would love thisbut some issues would come ie you want to dock quickly cause a dude is pursuing you and the security code ruins your docking speed loland the annoying factor maybe asking for a code each 30 minutes and you can update it whenever you want so it doesnt come just when you are in a pvp fight for example it also needs to be placed on a not annoying part of screen and must be small
they have to change the sovereignty system first before they can go after macro ice miners 00 would collapse without themas for regular macro miners so much of the economy is based off of them that they might have to increase miningrefining yields to consider banning them
exactly make all the yields 2x and ban the macroers solved
where do you want these added
wrongthe prefix meta except when used by ccp UFFFD la metalevel refers to one level of description up thus metaknowledge is knowledge about knowledge metaconversation is a conversation about conversation and so on it derives from the greek prefix meaning after fun fact metaphysics is so called because aristotle wrote about it before writing after writing about physicsyou seem to be under the impression that meta refers to something simply outside the game in reality the metagame is the game that occurs about the game  alts spying balance issues etc no stocks and iposalso you suck at concise explanations of what you are trying to sayedit dammit goumindong beat me to it reading the whole thread before posting an exasperated and intentionally condescending reply ftw
he is more right than you are icarus much more right the prefix meta means beyond the metagame is the game within the game
let see if i can clear this up in a short and concise fashionmy use of the term metagame is on point this also in regards to ipo and stocks because as a feature ccp has added only a skeleton and the players have had to govern everything else somehow i am beginning to see a few advantages in thiswhen i am talking about balance issues and go in every direction its because the missing features are of an emergent nature it will shift things maybe a bit to fast and not in the intended direction what will happen if we get a working npc interbus hauling systemwe might all agree that the logistics are a bit of a pain but to easy solutions might nerf the game beyond repair that is why i want to ask for a debate on these issues my personal take is that the motivational tools are shifted poorly i find it strange that pointing this out brings such an oppositionwhat about the oil and refinery and energy consumption parallel is hard to understandif 00 is not operating in fashions akin to real life our intuitive behaviour will be wrongif bureaucracy and capitalism isnt mainly in secure high populated areas things are a bit askewed i know its just a game and entertainment should be king but bending this to be just a scifi space shooter is not the intention of the ccp as far as i am informed after watching the fanfest videos i am quite sure about this so i was posting to open discussionwho knows someone might have some extremely simple and great solutions to these thinseve is the best virtual world simualtor around these days because in here stuff actually matter and its not a casual game experience but a lasting and life demanding onethis simulation will improve if the mechanics of ressources are tweaked no matter if that is stuff manpower or currencyfix corp standing mechanismlet stocks be traded on scc marketmake more access levels to the api to customize allowed outside access audit of corpslet players rent npc stationsfix all npc facilities prices to react by supply and demandmake system standing dynamic and even to the point where players can have 00 made secure by pulling in concord push pull of securityhave maps updated about changes in sec rating nice colored ones to in effect show where the pvp swarms move aboutthings of high tech should be build in empire space to remove risks no shipyards in real life could survive placement in a warzone exception might exist in regards to warships considered secret projectsi hope these examples give an idea to what i am thinkingnb i am all for 00 space i just seriously think it should be for the excitement and not the long lasting economic powerplay because then eve will never get a good wealth distribution in its simulation
are you sure it isnt because you have no clue what youre trying to saythis is irrelevant to whether or not its game or metagame my point about your use of metagame was irrelevant to whether or not youre using it wrong
editscrew it i give up
there are a few threads about suggestions to some changes to missioningi would just ask if the following idea would not solve a few of these issuesreducing expiration penalty on standing to a rather low valueletting the cancellation of missions not yet accepted be governed by a skillso unskilled once every 4 hours level 1 1 every 3 hours lvl 2 1  2h etc and level 5 once every 30 minutesalso in addition to this letting mission runners be able to contact about mission offers remotely also based on a skill one similar to market rangea feature needed would be rightclicking the agent in people and places and set course the same way you can with an active agent when you dock at station and have an active missionsome balance tweaks might be needed afterward to clean up the increased work on missioningbut basically this would be offering options much along the lines of selecting missions
i think it is rather moot to discuss details of mission running at this time because as far as i have read ccp is doing a massive expansion of mission running we will have to see how that works out to see how changes would fit inthe ability do deny a mission remotely would be of help in any case thoughfew days ago i flew a mission in khanid then i headed back home to gallente space 24 jumps the very moment i arrived in my home station that cramparsed storyline agent in khanid decided that he wanted to offer me a storyline mission i had to make 24 jumps back and forth just to tell him to hide in a bush and frell himselfwhen agents can contact you via mail to make an offer it should be a polite option to deny them the same waywhen it comes to skills that decrease the time for turning down a mission i am completely against it it would be an economic desaster using 12 characters in a hub area that has multiple high level agents it would become far too easy to farm for the best missions farming missions is a serious issue because empire already makes it very easy to make loads of money if i could run twice as many angel extras and assaults it would roughly increase my net yield by 30 minimum a lot of impact for the kind of skill you are suggestingif you are picky about your missions be picky about it being picky is a personal disadvantage that has consequences when i say i do not eat chicken pork shrimp or veggies i lose a lot of options when faced with a preset buffet it is my decision though i should not complain when all i am left with is rice and potatoes or the time it takes to wait for the pizza delivery service

problem with blackops is that theyre way too overpriced to be used in pvp they lack scan resolution to tackle anything theyre bs size and now even more slower than they were if they were to be used in pvp they should be made useful for that instead of being funny big alliance boy toys being able to jump into cynojammed system is only useful for very limited number of blackops pilots mostly for funny ncgoongbc etc lolguys say hi for blobs whole jump drive in blackops is only needed for going around megacamps blackops is still a cloaking bs able to go through gates the problem is that fuel takes whole cargo space making it so that you cant really fit any fuel on board tbh oh and jump portal if you get someone to make a covert cyno for you it means the path is totally possible to make through with covopsrecon so why any need for cynoing in more if they just can flyi cry when i see threads like this
is someone going to take up the missile nerf complaint
sorry to post this here guys buti have an idea for ccp on this matter with the problem u quoted in your postccp could give each character a certain code so even if you change the name of your character the buddy list and stuff will automaticly change it to the right name so you wount get any misleads in your buddy list allso if someone was to change that name how would it still exist as a charater when it doesnt belong to anyone djust my 2 cents for help towards the character name change
due to rl commitments of several delegates meeting will be postponed for next sunday 8th of february
