intel is a prickly issue with so many sides and conflicting perspectivessome believe intel should be free of effort it should be automatically be reported to you for your considerationthe problem here is that you are giving everyone perfect intel all the time and the ability to relay this is not challenging for mostno risk example of a person safely docked in an outpost able to relay system entries into a channel for intelthe downside since no competition is possible to learn of presence the ability to avoid contact need only concern itself with reacting to this provided datawith perfect warnings comes perfect defense potential and with everyone defended this well we have stalematesothers believe that intel has value in game the more so if it requires effort to obtainan effort based system reasonably would include at least a toggle that would persist for a time period or until warp was engaged the need to ping each and every time would quickly be replaced by popular demand in my opinionif you need to toggle on your sensors after coming out of warp you compete by needing to remember this and repetitively perform this action reliablythose who forget risk being caught unpreparedit might seem trivial to some but keep in mind that human nature is very adaptive players who have not seen recent hostile contact may eventually feel they can skip it if they are only going to be on grid briefly and this expectation that protection is not needed can eventually be a defensive flawi believe that players seeking to place limits and restrictions upon cloaks but not upon the intel cloaks are the counter for seem to be guilty of not considering the shift in balance they would inflictupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

how do we know if they are afk or notyes if they are truly afk they are no threat but they arent going to send us an email telling us they are afk
yeah this is where the if theyre afk they cant hurt you thing falls on its ass it is exactly this mechanic which hurts you when im afking my bombers ill usually be doing something on an alt switching over every now and then to run a scan for targetsto answer the previous question in your quote regarding which mechanic theyre using its the mechanic which doesnt indicate whether someone is afk or not and the ability to scan without any knowledge of the target after coming back from afkif there was a mechanic which dimmed the icon in local after a certain period of inactivity or when docked that would be nice imo
are you trying to win at eve so you can say this part of the game is over by virtue of being resolved in perpetuitybecause the more leverage you give to one side of this issue the more you effectively resolve it moving forwardwe already have players with perfect notification of system presence which has been demonstrated as being enough intel to base certain decisions onyou know they are in your system and you know if they are flagged as friendly or notif you add to this the reliable notification that a player is afk you further trivialize gameplay in these areasall that remains is multiboxing enough accounts together so you can plex them for the next monthwe already have play regarding competition against hostiles dumbed down to seeing a hostile name in local chat and hitting a button to warpmy smartphone has more challenging games than that i feel that reacting in a predetermined manner to anything in a specific category is not worth paying a sub forupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
there has to be a balance between the disruption you can cause and the ease of causing it consideration must also be given to the ability to cause constant disruption even when not actively playing the game currently because you cannot tell if someone is afk or not all you have to do is put an alt in the system even better if it has a history of hotdrops and you logically bring that system to a standstill while your not at the computer while this is fine thats entirely what my corporation does we afk cloak people it is too powerful in its current form and needs a bit of a nerf if not by nerfing cynos then itd have to be by nerfing cloakingid prefer the former
the threat from a cloaked ship is exactly equal to the number of players supporting that ship at the timesuggesting that a target has a right to know information about a potential ambush defeats the purpose of the ambush entirelyespecially when you consider that the source of this intel would be automatic and flawlessly reliablelocal chat is more than intel in this sense it acts as an alarm  security alert systemin my opinion to suggest that a single or small group of players should be warned automatically in order to prevent a larger number of players from interacting with them this sounds counter productive for an mmoupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
what you are not considering is the aggressors inteli can put a cloakie in a system and leave it there indefinitely during that time i can use the full availability of local to get my inteli can identify a ship i want to drop i can warp to it use look at determine what weapons drones its using i can relay that information back to my blops team as well as any pilot information in local we can look those pilots up determine what threat they are if any jump the gang in kill the pilot and leave all the while denying anyone in local any details of the gang and cloakie shipyoure trying to justify the aweful mechanics of cloaky cynos by using freedom of information but the cloakie cyno is the ultimate in hiding its own infothats called an imbalance
the problem is local by your own descriptionthe aggressor uses local to know pilot composition of the system something the local resident already knows but as an unknown potentially acts as a deterrent against the aggressorwe know this since you indicated they would use it to gauge the risk of threat that local pilots representedwith the absence of locals free warnings many agree it becomes balanced for intel to include the ability to scan for and hunt cloaked ships this is balanced by the need to make an effort or be effectively blindwith such power to locate cloaked vessels bears the responsibility to proactively clear systems as neededa gate camp while unable to prevent cloaked access in many cases remains able to often detect them well enough to warn others such cooperative intel gathering relayed to a hunting group would enable them to chase down and clear out threatsfor times when it is suspected a cloaked ship managed entry undetected periodic sweeps could be used to verify relative safety for mining and ratting etcnoone can take the time to calmly scout the system without being burdened by awareness they could be hunted at any timeagain this is null so whoever has the most players wins in the endupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
except youre using the free warnings yourself its hypocritical and in no way balanced imo its simply a way to get easy kills with no risk identical to using local to avoid the same risk
removing local from the hunters use makes perfect sense to meyou should read the links in my sig if you want a more detailed explanationwhether i play my mining rig or my stealth one local is more of an obstacle to my fun than an aid to itupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

with the new changes to fbs there is a need for more variety in drone fittings as it stands the only option for more drone damage is t1 t2 or officer mods which i have never seen for sale so what i am suggesting is to simply add faction drone damage amplifiers maybe with 2425 damage bonuses or more if the nonexistent officer ones were buffedplease feel free to criticize or expand this idea
this is straightforward
hence asking the csm to look it over as a bunch of experienced people who have an idea what the devs are thinking because they constantly talk to them and may have discussed something along these lines and not be able to talk directly about it due to ndait may have been discounted by the devs who knows i dont but i know the csm will filter
how to make pve more like pvp1 if the pve pilot shows up in an inadquate ship they get ganked and mocked in local this pretty much already happens2 if the pve pilot shows up in something competitive they get blobbed by a 21 dpslogistics fleet ganked and mocked in local3 if the pve pilot shows up in something insurmountable the rats dock up in a convenient station or warp off and talk smack in local optionally they play undock games

i havent read a single post in this thread but i bet i could guess every point and argument used
threads like this are often more about bringing others up to speed on the philosophy involvedi notice many players get lost in the weeds and suggest fixes for problems that actually reduce gameplay and result more often in gamewatchinggame watching is where you need make little effort and just end up watching the game effectively play itselfi particularly like the parts where someone claims that afk cloaking represents an attempt to deny game content by scaring away playnewsflash play is not the part where you kill npc rats or mine ore it is the part where you interact with other players in the game we can define it this way by pointing at the mmo tag as well as other detailsyou can interact by working together with them or by fighting against them both should result in two or more people in real life having a good time which is the whole point of eves existenceeverything else is just preparing for the times when we can do thisi guess it is easy to forget why we came to eve in order to play with each other in a spaceship gameupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

quite some time ago i posted a proposition for a sport in eveonly way to make a real sport for eve is to make it apeal to the braoder number of players t1 frigates 5 v 5 player matches 5 more for each team as substitues whole year long league works like any soccer league final four tournament for a rl money prize divisions 12 or more iskflow btw the league organizators teams players and spectators arenas with different setups asteroids objects settled all around highsec and lowsecthat is pretty much it you can read about details in the linkscl and neo are fine but they are nothing different from the main event which is the at all of those are just daunting fro most of the players corps and even alliances every year you see same peoplefrigates are fun and accessible by skill and isk and there are all kind of them brawling attack kiting e war logi etc
probably because theyre spending too much time enjoying your company and loving magnetic personality
the only thing that i wish to convey about tournaments is that ccp needs a second twitch account for them so that the automatic smsemail notification when it goes live doesnt wake up people that are not interested in tournaments yet still allows them to be woken up with something actually worth watching starts
lurking on forumscant sleep clown will eat me kinda night bonus points if you get the referenceinstead of having groups of people gather randomly why not have a space stadium in each trade hub a new station is added this is where players meet up form fleets and arrange fights theres 2 undock buttons one for regular space one for tournament space which would be a separate new system setup system and station so cheating and anything game breaking isnt doablemake tools available to the players to make and sponsor their own leagues ccp would have their own aswell make more types and variations of tournaments frigatescruisersdestroyerswhatever onlyor below and why not have more then pvp tournaments what about pve tournaments what fleet can mine the fastest in x time or who can complete a lvl x mission in y ship class the fastesttake the least damageim going to try to go back to sleep now
this idea has been floating around for a while now my suggestion is simple pop station it leaves a wreck instead of cans spewing where the owner can pick it up or big loot containers up for grabs or whatever mechanism that would  off whoever was living out of said station all station services are permanently disabled you cant trade put things on the market whatever basically it turns into a floating wreck whoever had stuff inside is allowed to dock regardless of who own the system and if your blue to them then youre allowed to toss up a new station in said system minus ship spinning you can do  inside of it
then please lets here your comments and suggestions on a balance that would increase interaction
maybe you can add a bump counter and when that counter hits a certain number that bumper gets a suspect flag or becomes attackable without concord interference that way people can still bump but have to watch how many times they do it and it gives miners to ability to do something about it when the bumper crosses a certain line
the biggest problem to player run small tournaments is the inability to ensure your participants safety and enforce some basic rules  alongside the issue of spectatorstake any tournament that you want pvp in and you have a problem high sec precludes consensual pvp barring wars and duels which can work for a 1v1 tournament low sec carries a big sec status penalty for the pvp and there is no way to ensure people wont pop in and blow you all up null secwh have no sec status penalty but then youre in someones space and again no way to ensure safetythe best solution is to allow group consensual pvp in high sec and i think the best way to do this is to implement a new type of fleet this new fleet would allow consensual pvp by all members of that fleet it would have no combat bonuses it would not allow bridging etc it may allow warp to member essentially it would provide a way for a group of players to meet in high sec and shoot one another but more importantly it does not remove all risks you can still be attacked if people fancy dying to concord afterthis is important the current method of using safe systems does not fit within the ethos of eve the at can be excused and the idea of safe arenas is a watered down version of that tournaments should occur in open space but with the participants allowed to shoot one another and spectators not  but not prevented from doing so spectating  do you want everyone to come and watch how do you livestream when you have one camera view and need to watch what is going on cant be everywhere at oncesolution camera dronesyou can set these up in space they record and can send their feed to a streaming sites b ccps new tournament viewer and c which is now viewable in captains quarters viewers can move between cameras at will the feed will label ships and so on possibility of having commentary and camera control as well so you can have an official feed similar deployables as others have mentioned boundary markerbubble container with divisions so people can only access one bit beacons etc all of these should be able to be audited what we need are some simple tools to allow us to be inventive with the current mechanics people have posted a lot of ideas in this thread and i think most of them can work in high sec with the new fleet mechanic  you just have to be inventive how you police any other rules this keeps tournaments within the sandbox and player driven and eve will be better for it edit another option is to make an event corp which has some different powers or ability to create an event within a corp so you can have a formal signup and this takes money delivers prizes allows combat etc
um no thatll be a just another big things for the power blocs to come through and wreck most of whats in the station would be destroyed and per looting rules and the game would probably die from having to figure out how to kill everyone that was docked and send them to new clones while killing a station may sound like a good idea itll be like the pocos besides to place a new station you have to have sov so not everybody can do it and to attack the station to begin with you have to make sov drop
there is a massive barrier preventing smaller groups from entering 00 without changing mechanics or rules of sov i propose a simple structure capable of allowing groups to live on their own in space click here for fob detailsmy history ive done about everything except run 200 man fleets in eve and fly a super cap ive pvped for the greater portion of my eve career

there are two approaches i see being suggestedone where the cloaked ships alone are impacted with the ultimate result that they must abandon being present ending the stalemate in the favor of those who felt threatenedi should point out that sending home one side in a conflict does not increase interactionto be clear if the expectation that a cloaked pilot could be afk is removed then the chances that a pve pilot will undock in a ship which could not fight back are also removed when a presence is notedalliances will more easily enforce rules designed to avoid all contact as many already have in placetwo mostly from my own words is the suggestion to incentivize pve ships to remainmany of my recent suggestions center around giving them a chance to win and with preparation and confidence the expectation of winningi feel this approach has two valuespve pilots can maintain presence and operate with hostiles present since the hostile is no longer representing an overwhelming threatandthe pve pilot assuming they are right about making good preparations has a fun fight with spaceships and gets a kill mail with bragging rightsyo dont be messin with miners arrrrrrthat is my opinionupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
yes that would be the ultimate fix the issue is not that people dont want to fight in many cases its that they know if they do its very likely to end in disastercase in point  we had 5 southern fed guys come down to our area to kill us killed one the other ran next day 10 came back so we prepare and i jump my alt into their hub dscan avatar and 20 guys at a moon while not specifically an afk problem the issue goes hand in handif you are a smart player you have to assume worst case scenario i assume all afks are cyno fit until killed and proven otherwise
as a hobbyist programmer i echo whats been said elsewhere here smaller patches are faster to release easier to download and if when something goes blooey theyre easier to track and repairaside from that they also remove a lot of smaller lessurgent bug fixes from the list before the big patch goes live whch has the double triple effect of reducing the possibility of some unresolved bug breaking the patch and a smaller overall size for the big patch since theyre not cramming so many tiny and semirelevant bugfixes in on top of the huge upate
hello and on very beginning sorry for my bad english i know that this subject was talked before in some old threads but i didnt see any good reasons not to change this whole employment history systemnow eh is visible to everyone this is simply not realistic andstupidwhen i see someone walking on the street i dont know who he is and what is his history right the same should be in gamenow people are making some decisions regarding to opponent eh which is not good both to new players oh look he is a newbie so it is easy target or experienced players hey this guy probably have some good skills so i will not attack  important for some griefs or just for combat the more your opponent knows about you and your skills before fight the worse your fight will bethere were some people saying that they need to know who the guy is before he join their corp and this is absolutely true and rightsolution is easy logic and simple lets make an option to choose like with kill rights you can choose to share kr with certain character with corp with everybodythe same should be with eh so when people need chack your background they can do it when both sides agreejust an idea but imo it should be like this from the startplease share your thoughts about itthank you
no its like a resume people can contact your former boss if they wish or see how often you jump corps hiding it would make an easier job for awox crews which already prey on people that jump multiple corps in a day other awox teams just look for that 1 UFFFDber kill usually in an alliance in low or null the highsec guys dont want to whisk being teamed up against to lose so the have alt logi and keep the ability to run away and dock after they jump a mining team so they can say they dont lose ships in pvpso no already not enough trust in eve
anyone with any degree of common sense while handling recruiting does a background check on a character including api access turning off access to peoples employment history is a small bump in the road as any good recruiter is going to require access to it regardless why waste the dev resources on something that most people are going to turn around and say hey thats niceshow me or youre not getting in i dont care if you agree or not
that is true but you dont walk with your resume stick on your forehead right its yours its private and you show it to the people when you want or need to i dont want to hide in completely for recruitment process things will probably stay the same  you want to join our corp  we have to see your resume simple explanation as abovei think that most of the people just used to the way eh is because it was always like that but really please try to imagine that eh from the beginning of eve was like your cv and you show it when you need it to suddenly thay make a change and say hey now your eh will be visible to everyone i bet that lots of people wouldnt agree to thati dont really see any good sides of the way eh is right now argument with recruiting process is not good because for that things will not change at allregards

there are many smart players in eve probably more than dumb ones however you hardly ever hear of them this practice results in a lot of unused space although i hate to admit it pro god legend made this statement i agree with full commnets can be found in the csm released minutes
the point of some ships i have interacted with if not flown directly is that they almost seem designed for a game that we are not playingi see the blops with its cloak and covert jump capability and assess a ship intended to bypass gate camps and stay hidden while creating an underground railroad for covert activityi see the normal cyno with its beacon flashing up on the overview to alert everyone in the system which is significant almost as much as it could be if local chat had not already broadcast the presence of new arrivals in a manner just as obviouswell you know they might have arrived by cyno rather than assuming they either logged in together or came in the gate alonethe only aspect of the game not impaired or bent into a different shape by local is the direct frontal assaultcloaking as well as any form of play relying on a degree of uncertainty by other players is a token detail at bestyou are not secret everyone knows you are in the system at all times regardless of whether they can locate you directlyi would like to see an effort based intel system replace localin exchange for not being prompted when to act the player would have the opportunity to learn more than the current system allowed such as enough intel to hunt cloaked shippingbeing prompted when to act is a huge detail that more than anything else impacts gameplay in a manner resulting in stalemate scenarios which any player can relate to with frustration if they experience itupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
hey im hiding my cvwell im not hiring you unless i see your cvwell im not going to show it to youokay youre not hired nextagain its pointless to hide a characters employment history on some silly belief that people will agree that it should be shown everyone with half a brain cell will require it and therefore its a complete waste of time
again nomaybe for you eh is only for recruitement process so you are right  changing it for this is pointless because like i wrote before nothing will change in that matterthe problem is that eh affects lot of other things in eve and it affect it in bad wayexamplewe have to options1 you are new player  opponents know you are weak  bad for you2 you are old playera with lots of skills  opponents expect you have big skills and they are right  they are prepared better for combat you  bad for youb with no skills youve had some break in playing or whatever  opponents expect you have big skills they are wrong but they come prepared better for fight  bad for youi cant see any good sides of how eh works right know and no one gave any good argument so far to keep it this wayregards
theres absolutely no way wed be able to use that against people especially on the 44 undock also most miners wont do anything thats kinda the point  they want to play a singleplayer mmo and interacting with a suspect means theyre not playing the game the way they want to

what about a new prob to combat and core that can locate cloakers but takes abit of time to do that way cloaker can see if he is been probed and the others cn find him win win for both
before we consider details on this what benefit would you give the cloaker in exchange for now being vulnerable to huntingupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
in my mind it would be to passively target and scan ships while cloaked the targeting is lost when switching there would also be a long targeting delay  say double the normal uncloaked targeting time  in this case if a hi sec freighter pilot would not have to worry anymore about cloaked over non cloaked scanning ships passive target and scan is already a part of the game i still insist that we have a better action based local intel system over the passive local chat system i am in favor of the delayed local however this should come with more tools enhanced tools should require at least a little bit of specializationthe idea behind it should to be pilots to work together in small groups instead of solo at the same time is should discourage use by 500 groups say the more pilots in system active in space would give many returns making it progressively more difficult to identify and gather intel about specific pilots disclaimer on the following example this is general knowledge and not classified as far as i knownavy vessels from all countries have two methods of detecting ships planes and items active and passive often these are used together active gives a ping of range and location but is harder to identify more that general size and direction passive you can gather more intel about whats there by what sounds it makes and check against known database for ship type abilities and even down to who is captain and what they had to eat before they left port however beyond direction it is close to impossible for one ships to detect range speed and direction working in a group it is possible to work out who the target is their range speed ect however get to many ships in the area creates noise reducing this significantly
the means of detecting a noisy object using passive data is done by triangulation where the object being sought is within the confines of a triangle formed by the three points of data collectioncell towers navy ships microphones whatever the context relates toby comparing signal strength from each point and knowing the power of the signal source helps here you can draw a circle around each of the listening points relative to the strength of the signal they detectedthe three circles should intersect over the point or area where the source originated the signal fromour probing uses a similar principle but since it relates to a three dimensional arrangement requires more points of referencein theory you would only need a 4th point to form a tetrahedron pyramid shapein practice the more points of reference you have on an object the more precise you can be isolating its locationupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
exactly so what if this tech for hunting cloaked ships is to much for a prob to handle and now you need several ships fitted with a deep scan listening module all have to be fleeted and one pilot has a second module that relays information from the other ships correlates the data and give a broadcastable target location  100 km from where actual target may or may not be depending on skill is just a thought but this could be set up similar to or connected with dscan mechanics for the one while the second works in the probe window or similar information could vary on skill of the pilots incorporated with 5 being the max effective number while more would corrupt the data if active the information relayed could vary from not only location but ship type and pilot
sorry i took so long to reply busy day what about a notification to say that they are been scanned down maybe everytime the prober scans and hits there sig it tells them if they miss the sig no notification comes up that way cloakers ship lets them know of danger that may or may not be coming and it means that if anyone is afk they will be killed killing afk cloakers but keeping people who are activly cloaked and moving time to shift away
the overlying principles suggest this could work if we refer to real life examples for context on how the systems would behavein the game probes for scanning give every bit as much intel but do so as a snapshot and return only the items that they retained after filtering out garbageok its a game and the filtering is really done by never having the garbage present to begin with same resultwhether they do an active ping or simply use enhanced detection over a limited time frame either could be used herewe have four different racial sensor types each operating on a slightly different wavelength if not entirely unique and pigeon holed by thisamarr using radar if this is actual radio waves then it has to be some version beyond our awareness as radio waves dont travel fast enough to give meaningful data beyond a certain pointcaldari using gravimetric measuring this is something we have little to compare with as we have no real world sensors outside of laboratories relating to thisgallente magnetometric its a big metal detector equivalent just refined to the point of usefulness hereminmatar ladar laser detection and ranging system oh yeah it uses lazors also sounds like the systems in use by a popular science fiction show so might be more like that unspecified versionlong story short none of these has real world equivalents with function so the game versions are whatever the devs say and they say they are equal to each otherby obvious follow through cloaking technology beats them all or else cloaking would be less effective against one or moreby virtue of concealment and its needs cloaking therefore either masks its presence under a larger signal which is ignored or it reduces its own signal beneath the detection thresholdpossibly some clever combination of the twoin any case using real world analogies can stimulate the imagination but they are only relevant if the devs decide they areupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
so the cloaked pilot is at best being given a heads up that their day is about to become difficultthis might reduce the negative impact to a degree in their view but it is not a positive in itselfwhat improvement would they havewould local stop alerting their targets enabling them to hunt maybe a 30 second delay possibly moreand what about the aspects where they have the right to be present for scouting purposesmaybe something that makes them totally undetectable if they have no cyno equipped not even by local chatlimited to true covert vessels not the t1 boats with a slap on modelupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
lets face it its hard to make all parties happy what this threahd for is afk cloakers not general cloakers therefore this does kill then afk effect of cloaking since they are warned but if choose to ignore thats there faultsame aspect of jumping through a gate if you dont scout well thats your fault if they scout and find hostiles then thats there smarts no one will be happy but eliminating the effects used by these is one way and yea we could add a delay if others complain why carnt we have notification been scanned down in a mission use the cloak has a inbuilt detecting device that alerts the ships sensors to scan down and traingulate what that object is giving 60 sensor strengh instead of about 15 or less of ships power
lets not throw out the baby with the bathwatergame play does not need to be shifted in favor of pve at the expense of cloaked players herethe often stated reason for afk play assuming they actually want play rather than play mind games is to render locals warning into something ignoredthey are not invisible but they are being ignored finally giving them a chance to actually huntif the current system for hunting is left intact for the most part local alerting residents well enough in advance of a threat to avoid it then they have no positiveif they can be removed the stalemate is resolved in favor of the residents which is a very real advantage for themit tells them a foreign presence must be active and therefore is unsafe to ignoreit removes the presence in the event the target fails to respond before being probed down removing the threatthis with no doubt would shift the balance in favor of sov holdersupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

iv been looking at for a little bit and been thinking is it really a  to me a is stealthy sneaky and chooses its targets and positioning well but to me atm are mainly for 00 to jump in alot of ships to gank 1 ship and arnt that useful for lowsec and high sec they are paper thin compared to other battleship which is nice as they are meant to be light and manuverable to get in kill and get out the cloaking ability is nice but abit useless as they will just be sat in 1 spot and seen on scan straight away destroying the stealthy aproach for themim proposing to give them cov ops cloak which i understand would make them overpowered in all aspects thats why i propose to give this ship and only this ship a handicap with cov ops cloak im not sure if its possible as i dont do any codeing and im looking for feedback on this idea open to i hate u die and get out the handicap would be to basicly not alow the ship to recloak or use cloak at all for about 45 mins after combat let it be shooting or shot at this way even if it kills or manages to escape it carnt cloak and sit there and hide for hours it has to move giving the enemy chance to find it and finnish it or give revenge to the examplea warps into a missioner or a pvper or who ever he is targeting decloaks and opens fire now he carnt cloak for 5 mins meaning he has to kill the guy as fast as possible and then get out to start making timer to drop so he can cloak at this time the pvper or missioner could have friends about wanting pay back and start trying to find him now they know they have 5 mins to find him before he cloaks which is enough time to scan down and catch him if they are skilled and consentrate enough of course the pilot could warp around to avoid this but thats same with any other shipi know my grammer is bad so id like people to look past this and decide on the matter iv proposed i think it might be overpowered but making the ship more vaible for lowsec and highsec pvp
here is an idea make it possible to chop up a plex into 4x pilot week extensionsthis way one plex can either be converted to 3500 aurum or one pilot week extension into 875 aurumas a bonus it would allow recurring or new players more options when to play the gamefor example when they get a cta on some social media they can buy a one week pilot extension for that operation
yes and its actually the case where abnormalilty of bumping ship owners behaviour should be obvious to law enforcing authorities in fact it should be much less span of a time like repeating bumping for 5 to 10 minutes and if its too quick for you that amateurish bunch of gangsters you are running obviously needs a proper training program prescribed to them at least put some effort and soul in the job you enlisted for okaaaaybut prosecution by deadly force is too much indeed just webifiying to zero all those who were bumping and will be trying to bump after for some period of time will be enough all timers can be tied to the actual sec level of the solar system
is the goal a the election isnt so much as mentioned on the community page the vote link is not even promoted as a main item on the csm page of the eve online site itself its a minor link halfway down the sidebar  nor is the fact of a csm election happening even mentioned on that page  because this is an eve board and tearing into particular employees is verboten i am attempting to moderate my tonehowever this  combined with the promise of a fireworks of impressive promotion for the csm8 election which never came the minutes delay due to extended time required for review by ccp and it was clearly pointed to a particular employee being the bottleneck the lack of even a nominal common sense level of promotion for this csm9 election the announcement of candidates etc and winter release of the minutes barely in front of voting startall lead me to question what ccp dolans other responsibilities are as a community manager are that so dwarf this that it is seemingly no problem to consistently overpromise and underdeliver on a variety of fronts related to this and not get called on itim hoping i am misreading and the issue isnt a an extremely lackadaisical approach to ones job b being woefully over their head in their job or c ccp signaling that it really couldnt care less about the csm as a body despite paying lip service if it is c please just come out and say so if none of the above explanations apply then what is itit also seems odd that literally except for a single commenter on the quickie devblog announcing the election which has few comments and is buried among many and xander phoena over at crossing zebras there seems no one who has a problem with this and xander is restricted from calling out specific people because he is running for csm and may have to work with them later im not running for csmhopefully ccp can take constructive  if harsh  criticism and not give me a problem for this postpost scriptps regarding the minutes i appreciate the buck stops here by people like ali and ripard taking their share of responsibilty for the minutes delay in that they didnt poke or push dolan hard enough or often enough but ultimately you shouldnt have to arm twist and needle someone that hard to do their job the devs working on the game have an excuse to not give it their full attention  but isnt communicating with the players the core of his job it speaks well of them that as unpaid volunteers they seem to be more invested in the games success and by extension ccps success as eve is their sole commercial hit thus far than a paid community manager whose livelihood theoretically depends on it or perhaps it is him telling us that its not felt his job doing this kind of community aka customer outreach is an important ingredient in eveccps success in that case what is the purpose of his position
the problem is how the meta game has spread to the csm and parts of ccpthe elections has been made easy enough for nullsec entities to produce a copypaste press ok link anyone who doesnt have a link and no idea where to look from lack of information and communication from ccps part will be excluded from the electionsa beautiful example of this is goonswarm insert grr goons comment here has members who works in ccp you can tell this by following their history not only that but look in reddit and you can find their leaked list you will see that their 1 choice is someone with no activity no interviews or information he just spawned on the list and is failing to run a campaign another bit of information is that rvbee is being spammed with list of who to vote for and the links with goonswarm leadership now at the helm of rvbee they were given a list of vote for these people in this way which is the exact same as goonswarms list tie that in with jabber and fleet doctrines becoming mandatory theyre being slowly changed to do goons bidding in highsec because they cant handle both highsec poco wars and nullsec invasions their membership is just too stupid to realize this
regarding the jump animationccp promised a fix for thisthe csm promised to follow up on the fixwere still waitingwhy a switch onoff because the new animation doesnt add anything to gameplay and its graphically annoying in other words its worse than bad its useless simple as thatUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD  kina ayami
sarcasm how intuitive much better than putting the vote link on the front page the community page or even the csm landing pagesarcasmseriously i noticed the issue with the vote badge being deployed prematurely as a nonfunctional system as well resulting in this confusion now once the election actually does open the panel is demoted to one of three sliding banners thus if anyone tried to vote based on that original panel theyve probably been discouraged andor dont realize its not working if it wasnt for the community effort to gotv im not sure turnout would break out of single digitswhat are the explanations1 conspiraceeee2 a super topsecret set of priorities and duties that are taking all of the community rep teams time attention and resources and that will wow us all when revealed that mean csm has to be completely backburnered for two years3 ccp secretly hopes csm as a concept is neutered as a stakeholder and would like to have the most minimal mandate or community participation possible the pitiable csm8 gotv effort and the even lower energy version this time would imply thisof course theres always4 negligence born of a carelessly lazy approach to ones job5 incompetence born of being hopelessly outmatched by the requirements of your jobi dont believe in elaborate secret conspiracies i genuinely hope its number 2 if its 4 or 5 then lets just say i wouldnt be surprised given csm8 the minute delays for which ali ripard et all fell on their swords for not pushing ccp dolan and this years even more anemic efforts ps  why should the csm have to push someone to do their job particularly if their job is community rep
get that piece of garbage fixed that is all you need to tell ccp fix the goddamn launcher
i just held a short brainstorm session with me and a beer attending here is the resulthow about we take some hisec systems and make them player owned you can have a monthly auction for the rights to control the system the owner of the system can impose restrictions on pilots ships modules etc via blacklistswhitelists applied to the gates andor stations and access a set of advanced functions such as camera drones damage graphs etcyou could also add a tournament beacon a warp disruption field with 100k radius which will bbq any ships that try to leave it while its active

this i would think everyone in every highsec corp and beyond could find tons of use for this everyone in my corp could actually not sure why this hasnt been in the game our ceo and industrialists often remark on how much easier their jobs would be if they could just setup corpalliance only buysell orders do it lol
imo your sale orders would take forever  its also no difference than all those ships sitting in your inventory not charging you taxes for posting it to market
i think that your suggestions for fixing cloaking tilt things far far too much against active cloakers there are times when i will spend an hour or more sitting in one place watching a pos or taking note of someones activity while i try to dig up a fleeti would like to point out however that a pilot who is afk in a station or a pos provides the exact same level of threat as someone who is afk in a cloakie they can provide intel on who is in the system can undock and drop a cyno etc etcso why are you not suggesting that people afk in a station or an alt get autologged out or periodically ejected or give people a way to eject pilots from a station or pos to make sure they are not afk author of the karen 162 blog
bottom line is afk cloaking is legit and it is used as a form of aggression bottom line is give players the option to huntprobe out cloaked ships as in submarine hunter sub chaser sub killer cloaky huntercloaky chaserkiller etc etc unless your a troll you get the pointi know i know people will say then its too hard for active cloakers the solution to that is to make hunting a cloaked ship no quick and easy task make it a challenge make anti cloak warfare be a team effort too that takes some time that way us active cloakers can still play and not worry about get probed out like normal combat probing also i think it would be more fun if i know as a cloaker i cant just sit 300km off a pos or station  that i need to move around to avoid getting hunted that just sounds more challenging and funthe concept is win win and long overdue in evecsms can you get ontop of this and either kill it or put something in the works
exactly my points thank you for seeing it the way this thread is intended
we have discussed this much on this thread however afk play as a whole is a topic for another thread i only wanted to deal with cloakers mainly afk cloakers when this thread started nikk narrel and i have discussed both merits and cons of dealing with afk play both of us agree as do many i talk too that a new intel system needs to be in place local is just way too powerful as it is and this leads to both afk cloak pos station ect there is a delayed local thread that ccp and the current csm are looking at as to cloaking afk or not as i have stated i like cloaking myself i do believe it is not balanceda concerted effort taken should result in a reasonable chance to catch a cloaked vesselcurrently there is no mechanic to combat itan active cloaker should also have a reasonable chance to be both not found and not detectedi do believe that long term cloaking is a viable tactic however i do not believe that afk play should be encouraged or allowed no matter where the pilot is afk
one of the most ignored aspects of local yet highly used is not so much the fact that it tells you who is present in the systemit is that by reporting them so quickly it also tells players when to react as well as if they should reactthis is effectively prompting players when to take an action and by doing this helps to create the too often seen stalematesi have found many players who would claim that their fellows are incapable of activating a toggled sensor or simply pinging as needed they claim these players who are unable to make an effort to get their own intel would be mass killed by a rampaging horde of cloaked shipsand surprisingly to some they also claim that the cloaked players will know exactly where to find these pve targets and be able to move in on them as described abovei have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation as to how one group will have more intel without local which would now include pilot presence location etc while another group known to have exclusive intel channels would somehow have less inteloh and of course players would not adapt to this ever and the game would die a horrible empty doomupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
every single one of you are missing the point of this threadlet me explainan unbalanced game mechanic or exploit or glitch is defined by an action taken in game which has no counter action and or which gives an unfair advantage do to its inability to be countered1 when you are able to cloak and have 100 immunity this is unbalanced and by definition is an exploit bug or imbalanced mechanic so whether the person is afk or not is irrelevant2 what is relevant is that the cloak and use of such as it is currently in game by definition is in fact a glitch or exploit due to the fact that it gives an unfair advantage since it has absolutely no counterthis is the ops point3 what is being discussed in this thread is not a debate about afkers or active cloakers it is about the imbalance of the cloaking mechanism itselfthe solution is a simple one give the cloak a timer like every other mod say 5 minuet cycle time after which it deactivates and must be reactivated these solves every issue expressed by the op and in this thread in general it also means that if an afker goes afk his cloak will fail he will be scanned down and killedeverything in eve must have a consequence cloaking afk must have one as well this solution is simple and provides it this solution also allows cloakers to continue to harass and maim at will and by no means interferes with their ability to play so long as they are active at their computer and not afk
sorry but i find your premise unacceptablethis is a game and the devs are the final decision makers regarding what is an exploit and what is notas this is an arbitrary decision on their part and they have final judgement any definition which seems to contradict this must be therefore invalidplease respect the nature of the game as intact and suggest changes from this foundationwe get nowhere assuming the devs cannot be trusted at least this farupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
nice troll post apparently you couldnt come up with anything logical to refute what i stated so like most trolls you resort to nonsensical rhetoric which only states the obviouswe make these post to assist the devs and speak for the players if you have an issue with it make a suggestion desiring the banning of all suggestions which in and of itself would make your above post irrelevant null and void anywayotherwise stfu and move on
your tactic of declaring me a troll is noted it is not uncommon for people to see themselves reflected onto the motives of othersi see people trying to have a rational debate and respond accordinglyyou apparently see trollswe have no reason to accept your biased view that cloaking is an unbalanced absolute factor as it is stereotyped by the blocking of intel which is specific solely to the exact location of the ship itselfit is balanced by as agreed to by many others the exact and specific listing of all pilots in a system regardless of circumstance such as docked cloaked operating in normal space or behind the shields of a posthis is also a form of intel which establishes the opposite side availablemany claiming cloaking to be broken and needing a timer reject seeing an issue with the absolute nature of presence data updating so precisely as to effectively also prompt when to act as well as if action is neededif you simply want to rant i cant help youupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
heres something logical for you champ being afk in a station has no counter either so maybe when you are afk in station for longer than an hour you get automatically ejected into space to be shot at thats about as much reason as your argument hasthe people whining about cloaking not even just afk cloaking are the same people that want to sit back and carebear away without a worry in life sorry eve is not a theme park game where you get to sit behind hundreds of systems in your little pocket of safe goodness while making isk with little riskcloaked ships should not show up in local nobody can whine about afk cloaking and cloakers can actually hunt rather than wait for carebears to leave the station
al i see here is a bunch of meaningless content about your personal view of definitions and absolute viewpoints it is your opinion that i was speaking in absolutes so be it but you still have not responded with a legitimate rebuttal to my reasoning or post you have however attempted to discredit my idea by simply discrediting my opinion with an unsupported opinion of your ownan opinion is just that an opinion you have yours and i have mine and while you are welcome to express yours since it has 0 to do with what i actually wrote or posted it is therefore by definition a troll post attempting to sidetrack the threadmove along and let those with actual input have a conversation which actually solves an issue that has been around for years and has even been acknowledged several times by developers as an issue that needs to be addressed or keep troll posting shrugs ive stated what i needed to continuing this debate with you on semantics is pointless and and off topic of the op not to mention a waste of time
its only been recognized as an issue by whining carebears that dont understand you consent to pvp the moment you undock your ship
i would actually agree with you on this if it wasnt for stations being labeled as a safe area and one where many of the functions can take up a rather long time such as managing a corp or market which you are required by game mechanics to be docked forhowever i would think putting an afk kick feature in game might work nicely to fix this if the person is actually afk and not playing with the market or something
actually being afk whether cloaked or not is not part of pvp to pvp you must be actively engaging in combat against another playerso it is not an issue recognized by carebears who simply go out and carebear mine  rat  whatever anyway in 00 it is an issue recognized by pvpers who want a way to actively hunt and kill these afk individualsthe excuse that only carebears complain about broken game mechanics is prejudice and irrelevant especially since in this particular case as i stated above the majority of complaints come from pvpers who think being able to sit 100 immune to attack in open space while afk is bsjust saying
perhaps you missed thisvvvi have effectively defined both sides in the absolutes which are counterbalancing each otherlocal providing intel with the ability to know if  when to respondbalanced bycloaking which blocks intel from knowing specific ship locationsa frequent consensus suggests that being able to hunt cloaked ships is not balanced if local can tell you if  when you should do the huntingremoving a cloaked presence by virtue of the timer method in any of its effective forms simply resolves the stalemate in favor of the local residents which many agree shifts the balance in their favorupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
no its a terrible idea sometimes you want the game up while youre doing other things adding an afk timer for anything would be a bad design youre basically arguing for a bad game mechanic to be added because you dont know how to deal with a current oneactually being afk cloaky is part of pvp it works to wear down morale it frustrates the enemy it helps destablize a region you have a very limited understanding of what pvp entitles if you think pvp starts when you lock onto an enemy and ends when one of you is deadand no actual pvpers have made any whine about cloaky gameplay because the competent ones understand how it works and how to counter act it
i cleaned this up abit since you sumerized it nicely at the end and this i will respond toill start here1 local only tells you who is in system not what they are in or where they are they could just as easily be in a station as cloaked up afk granted you can look in station to see if thats where they are so local has nothing to do with determining any information on whether someone is afk or even if they are a cloaker or the cloak function itself and therefore is an irrelevant topic or rebuttal local also does not tell you which ship a person is in you need to use the scanner and be in range or use probes in order to figure this out which again makes your comment on local irrelevant2 there is no current game mechanic which will allow you to hunt cloaked ships it is impossible to do the hunting even if you are aware by use of local that cloakers are in system if there is no way to hunt said shipstherefore your point here is irrelevant and simply agrees with my original post3 i never said remove the cloak function i said give it a timer which the user can recloak with continuously if they are at their computer and not afk to click the button this function changes nothing in the mechanics other to ensure a cloaker is active at their computer and not afk it provides no favoritism for or against the local residents as it takes all of 1 seconds to reclick your cloak function unless of course your afk in which case you deserve to be hunted down and killed for your stupidity of afking in 00  lowsec  wormhole space
your premiss is flawed because you fail to take into account that the immunity you speak of applies to both sides equally both are equally immune from each other when the cloak is activealso you attempt to use the terms exploit glitch and bug is rather weak rhetoric and bears no relation to the factsbut cloaks do have counters they may not be counters you like or ones that break their role but they do have counters and to say otherwise is being rather disingenuousyou base this on your flawed premiss with that in mind as well as other mechanics at play its clear to see your timer idea is ridiculously bad and breaks cloakingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i do not count psychological warfare as part of pvp i count it as psychological warfare which is war on the mind and moral of ones enemies while yes this is exactly what the afk cloaker is used for it should have a counter any method of attack in game regardless of its source should not be 100 immune to counter since you are labeling this as a form of attack their should be some sort of mechanic whcih can be used to defend against it otherwise in your own words it is the eulas exact definition of an exploit or glitch
the counter is you fit your ship properly to deal with pvp threatsor remove local for cloaked ships
i dont think an afk kick feature is a good idea i think the logical and fairest solution is an afk status indicator ill list why this is neededcloaking by itself is not a bad thing there are legitimate reasons to cloak things like operating in deep enemy null and being unable to dock while being camped and scanned not wanting to alert people to when you are and are not active a cloaked ship in local is just a cloaked ship if there is one cloaked ship then you can devise a counter this disregards cynos which are the reason cloaking is so problematic it ruins pvp and my ability to find targets as a cloaker since everyone assumes cyno dropper and leavesthe reason a status on afk is needed is 1 seeking out and killing people in wars is horribly frustrating of all the time wasted in eve the most i have wasted would easily be camping docked and afk targets 2 the hot drop menace is beyond annoying we have 4 people going on 6 months permanently cloaked in and around our stations in stain its foolish given their history of dropping blops to use those systems so they effectively are afk but can become active at any time denying hundreds of people those systemsa status indicator that turns off on warp activation after adding those people to contacts would one not deny those people the ability to cloak or hot drop but would also not deny others who are actually playing and alert the ability to use those systems and worry about truly active players since it would only deactivate on warp they could happily sit there scanning communicating with allies without giving away their activity statusthats my opinion anywayi
you have a good fit to deal with 100 tengu thats how many i saw dropped on someone the other day
oh and what facts are thosewell here is some facts i see an afk cloaker is 100 immune to being found or attack that according to many afk cloaking is a type of pvp which constitutes as an attack on others to which they have 0 defense against that by the eulas definition of a glitch exploit this is exactly what afk cloaking isoh reallyname 1 way to counter an afk cloaker in your system beyond ignoring them which is not a counter as it does not effect them or their ship in any manneryou have yet to tell us what my flawed premise is you keep saying this but saying something is flawed and not explaining in detail how it is flawed is just you blowing smoke1 you all have been debating this with me for the past 2 hours yet none of you have yet to give me one example of how to effectively counter an afk cloaker and thereby show why my premise is flawed2 you all are debating opinions and have yet to express actual examples as i ahve of why your information or opinion is correct and mine is wrong1 saying someone is wrong because you think they are does not make them wrong it simply means you think they are showing evidence of a counter currently in game to an afk cloaker would be proving my desire for one irrelevant since it would already exist2 just as giving me a valid reason why a player should be allowed to afk in open space with 0 fear of consequence in a game world where every action you take has one would also be a viable rebuttalneither of which have been addressed or given by any of you
cloakly gameplay is a way to give the small group a chance to do anything to a larger group sorry if you want to sit behind a blob wall and rat your heart away but nobody but other carebears share your opinion
an afk indicator on your picture in local would be an awesome idea in general not just for the afk cloaker reasons but for statistics and player activity throughout the game also
i never said anything was wrong with cloaky game play in fact i am all for it my main ship is an sb i am not a carebear by the way and i am a beta player  i do not rat or mine either  1 what i stated was that afkers should have consequences for sitting afk in open space you find a ship sitting afk in open space your going to kill it right if your a pvper the answer is yes you know a ship is afk in open space but its cloaked so you cant find it to kill it  garbagecarebears are the ones who want to be able to afk cloak or those too lazy to actually work on their pvp skillsso you my friend are either a carebear or too lazy to do any real pvp which is it because if you were neither and were a real pvper you wouldnt care if i could somehow hunt down your cloaky ship because youd be ready and willing to fight or run from meobviously however you care a great deal about protecting your ability to sit afk 100 immune to attack with no consequenceand thats really the bottom line laziness is not part of and has no place in pvp laziness is something for carebears and if afking isnt the very definition of lazy i dont know what is
and its for ccp to decide when something is an exploit or glitch its their game and their rules and they apply them as they see fit so as cloaking has been around since 2004 and afking with cloaks not long after if it had been deemed an exploit or glitch then we would know about it alreadyso no your claim is not based on or has any relation to know facts it matters not how you see it it matters how ccp see it in this regardwell as you already said yourself that the point of afking is psychological warfare then the counter is not to let it bother you after all that warfare is taking place in your head hence the termbut it also requires the use of another mechanic to work one that you seem to have ignored in your attempt to break cloaksso with that other mechanic in mind the list is as followsyou can close localrefit your ship for more of a pvp roleform a fleetset up a trapbut you actually said it wasnt about being afk it was merely about cloaks you should at least decide what you are arguing against first my actual point was that cloaks do have counters just not ones that break them or that you may likei already said why your premiss was flawed in my first post you could read it again a suppose but i will tell you againyour premiss is that the cloaker has 100 immunity while cloaked and this makes it unbalanced well that premiss is flawed because you dont take into account that that immunity goes both ways therefore actually making it balanceddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i like points1 i believe many suggestions could be offered about how to counter socalled afk cloakingsince it apparently needs to meet your approval however we can safely assume you will never give it thus it is not possible to meet this detail currently2 your premise itself is an opinion based on your interpretation of game detailsfact an afk cloaked pilot is incapable of inflicting harm or damage to items in game and is thus pointless to counter furtherfact since you are concerned about active players behavior as only active players can attack or through hot dropping bring others to attack your labeling them as afk is not appropriate beyond showing that they have mislead you to believe thisand thenfact since your genuine interest apparently centers around how you object to being mislead by other players might i suggest you try different tactics3 that first part is gold you should print tshirtsthe counter in sov null where this has meaningful context it is possible to see only the name and the standings in local to know more than enough to realize you must take an action to protect yourselfas evasion is often the only available means to prevent attack by miners and some ratters this is often the choice madehow do you know they are cloaked you dont however you also dont know how they got past your gate camps either suggesting something sneaky or clever happened4 outposts specifically player made ones are placed in open space people docked there are safeby this precedent players have the ability to rezone areas in system as being safe frequently this also occurs with a pos being set up as wellconsidering that being cloaked only rezones the immediate area and can be countered by simply getting within 2000 meters of the ship it is hardly as safe or secure as some have implied it seems to rely quite directly on the fragile secrecy of its location to be precisei suspect these points will not satisfy you as per my response at point 1i would further state that i believe you are working backwards from your desired conclusion cloaked ships becoming more limited and will refuse to acknowledge any response which does not support thishave a lovely dayupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
actually devs have stated on numerous occasion that cloaking is not functioning how they desire it to so they have told you i would guess however that it hasnt been delt with because lets be honest its not game breaking and pretty trivial and most people just choose to ignore themah but your forgetting that a cloaked player can not be seen while the non cloaked player can easily be seen by one who is cloaked therefore this gives the cloaked individual a massive advantage over someone who is not cloaked hence they are not equals and it is not balanced and since a non cloaked individual has 0 defense and no way to hunt down or detect said cloaked individual it is in fact massively imbalanced and my premise is thus correct and not flawed
afk players are able to inflict harm the term afk cloaker refers to a person who is afks cloaked for the majority of its time it does not preclude that player from becoming temporarily active to kill somebody or drop a cyno attempting to deny afk cloakers being a threat through those sort of semantic tricks damages a persons credibility im an afk cloaker and its obvious to me that afking for long periods of time so that people begin to relax and become vulnerable is my modus operandi just because i become active and kill somebody for 10 minutes out of a 24 hour day doesnt mean my afk cloaking is not harmful it is very much so both in that 10 minutes and psychologically at all other timesoutposts and pos are not the same thing the map gives you a good indication of how many are docked you can watch the outpost and 100 see them undock every time with cloaking you cannot do that there is no indication that a cloaker has become active like a docked player indicates pos is similar while you can sit safe in pos you can also be scanned and observed you cannot scan and observe a cloaked player like you can someone in a pos
lol what good is calling corp mates to help you in highsec against a bumper who is not criminally flagged and probably in a ship that would take more then the freighters worth to gank effectively not to mention the loss of the corps ships for the suicidealso a freighter is so big and has so much mass the bumper could miss 5 times and still have another go at bumping you out of alignment before you warped on average it takes a freighter 35 minuets to align and warp the bumper is not going to be distracted by your corp mates that long if at all unless one of them wants to sacrifice a ship to save you by either scramming and webbing the bumper and even then concord is going to kill him and the bumper is going to continue bumping you before you can warpreally man you should think more before commentingjust one of the many reason i do not carry more then 500 mil of stuff in my freighter and even then i only carry minerals and nothing even remotely useful or worth ganking for and why my freighter is always insured does it take me more time to do stuff sure do gankers leave me alone yep because i am not worth the time or effort
just give them a suspect flag trust me theyll be dead in seconds
the should do away with the history altogether it doesnt fit well with the games core concepts of take a risk and deal with the consequences if you want to add someone to your corp  alliance you take a risk but gain a potential rewardalso if some group spends 2 months making a awox group and you take them in then they put in the time to gank your ships and should be rewarded for their effortsi know most people see the history as you dealing with the consequences of your actions but you cannot change names in this game so if they awox you then make a note and dont invite them againcompare this to the market place and i think you might see my point better i have no idea who screwed me out of a few million the other day because markets dont list anything about who is manipulating them this fits well with what this game is aboutyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
if 00 alliances need their markets seeded and their industry boosted and if they are so desperate for these industrialists they know where to find them the problem is their attitude toward these individuals which without whom they would not have ships to pvp withif the 00 alliances would change their attitude or if the sov mechanics required the actual use of systems to maintain sovereignty ie mining ratting etcthen the larger alliances would have absolutely no issues finding these individuals1 in an organization it is the responsibility of those with combat power and prowess to protect those whos job it is to maintain the very weapons and ships used to carry out the alliances will as a whole industrialists if they are unwilling to do so is it really a surprise why none wish to join 2 would you if you were an industrialist be willing to join an organization that jeered and made fun of you when they fail to realize without you they themselves would cease to existmany capital pilots and decent pvpers prefer industry in fact many have 70100 mil sp indy characters but the real question you might ask is why dont they use them well in 00 the answer is simple why take risks when your reward is being left to fend for yourself jeered at and made fun of by the very people your are attempting to assist with suchno one wants to work in that type of environment i have a 70 million sp titan building indy character myself i also have an 80 million sp double dreadnaught mom character personally i prefer indy and i choose to spend my days in highsec these days simply because the 00 alliances i have spoken to thus far are well pricksso if you all in 00 who are interested in these rare industrialists really want them stop calling them carebears stop insulting them start actually protecting them and helping them do this and i guarantee you you will never want for ships minerals or other industrial needs or assetsbut i can also understand how it is difficult for a pvper to take that stance most do not have the desire to protect only to kill thus unless you are willing to change yourselves and your policies you will continue to seek the ever elusive industrialist who like me may and most likely does just have a very nasty pvp character tied to them in the end you can choose to change and adapt to achieve your goals and wants or simply hear us sayyour lossi mean after all were billionaires why do we need you on the other hand you do need us just some food for thought
quoteyour post shows a profound lack of understanding points you seem to not understand 1 there is no innate benefit to building in nullsec its oneoutpostpersystem setup results in much less manufacturing lines available unless you use a pos which is vulnerable wonky and more expensive to utilize it is farther from the materials you will need for serious production minerals datacores complex moon materials pi products etc it is harder to offload items when you overproduce less customers around so with all of these drawbacks on top of the much riskier environment there is literally no advantage to building in nullsec 2 it is not the job of anyone to play sentry for you and yours especially when you are making isk and they are not what type of selfentitled bullshit attitude is that the first rule everyone in nullsec abides by is you are the player primarily responsible for keeping your stuff safe when people talk about nullsec industrialists they refer to players that can swap ships join the response gang and help defend the space at the end of the day if you cannot andor will not defend your space which entails bringing out that nasty pvp character of course they dont want you its a dog eat dog world and pacifists have no place here 3 im a big proponent of a use it or easily lose it sov system for example if a system is not being utilized id eliminate all rf timers on sov structures in the system so sov could be lost in a single attack however how you define using a system is important pi activity pos operations mining plexing ratting logistics marketeering and pvp are all viable ways to use a system i think the military and industrial indexes are great barometers that a system is being used but the system needs to account for much more than mining and ratting activities
i have a rebuttal to your 1 and 2 statements but i agree with your 3rdlike many it seems you do not understand 00 industry as it applies to an industrialist and their job as part of an alliance or null sec corp you are confusing someone who mines or builds for sole profit with an alliance  corp based industrialist which are 2 entirely different creatures you also seem to miss the fact that he who controls the market  economy in the region controls the region not you the pvper who are reliant on such for your gear and without which you would wither and dielet me explain the reality to you1 theres plenty of advantage to building in nullsec in fact i prefer it but i am not going to explain why to you call it a trade secret most of those issues you listed are simply logistical issues which in no way apply to anyone who is an actual industrialist especially if their alliance actually supports them as they should2 so your telling me you would not protect and support the individuals building your ships which by the way you need for pvp your ammo and your modules or are at least if not building them getting them to your 00 market at a decent price so you can use them affordablyif this is what you truly think then i feel sorry for you and your alliance if it thinks the same wayits people with this opinion that belong to alliances which eventually die by attrition or happened to  one of us off who controls the market in your region and we decide we do not want you there anymore and make sure you can not buy or purchase anything and have to go an entire region over to get a single tech 2 mod or decent ship while simultaneously ensuring the people fighting you are well supplied with low prices in their regionthe game the real industrialist play involves creating and destroying alliances across vast regions simply because we want to and without ever firing a single shot the thing you need to understand is that all empires all people and everything in eve like in real life is based on money he who controls the ebb and flow of goods controls the empire and dictates the rules an industrialist or multiple industrialists which belong to an alliance does this for the alliance they ensure your market stays full has what your alliance needs and ensures your enemy does not we are the one type of people in eve that will make or break an alliance compared to an industrialists ability to manipulate the economy and market across multiple regions as a single pvper you are insignificant in value unless you are useful or make yourself useful to us at which point you will find yourself with plenty of ships ammo mods companants and even isk we are the ones who you want as friends and allies and the ones who your enemies truly fearanyone can fly a ship and shoot things very few people can bring an alliance to its knees simply by manipulating the flow of goods and the market itself as well as the management of super capitals and capitals and their various needs and logisticsyou dont want to protect us fine good luck fending off the next alliance that comes trundling through your territory when you have no ships and no ammo and when your convoys mysteriously get ganked and hot dropped in rout and do not be surprised when the enemy never seems to run out of shipsa true industrialist is the real power in eve and these are the industrialists alliances seek not helping them and protecting them while they are trying to help you is a very stupid idealike i saidwe dont need you for anything you need us and our price for helping you is your protection which is a small one at that because why would we help you if we need to protect ourselves since legitimately thats the only real thing we need from anyone or rather which anyone can actually offer us in payment no if we are required to protect ourselves which we can were simply going to help ourselves and tell you to gtof3 i agree with you on this
hello alli play the market a bit mostly selling rat droppings but theres one feature i think should be in this game when selling an item there should be a box on the advanced screen that says add to existing sell order if you have a sell order in that given station and more items of the same type you should be able to add the items to the previously existing sell order without having to open up another sell order entirelythis would make sale orders much easier to handle and it could have the same cost as modifying an order in any other way 100 isk in addition to the taxes and such i humbly seek your support on this topic bunyip
make a leave fleet button
yep
my last experience leaving a fleetscrolls all the way down to name of character why did i have to pick a q to start this characters name click on name click leave fleet click confirmyep 1
click the upper left side of the fleet box leave fleet
are you all seriously so lazy as to not be able to click the menu icon on the fleet window  leave fleet
that mynnna from goonswarm is a permanent csm council memberwhile i have nothing against goonswarm i feel that allowing any representative to have a permanent spot of the council is counter productive to the point of said councila vote for the council to choose the members is just that why even offer a vote if demographics can have permanent attendees and council members if this is going to be democratically based every member must have the ability to lose their spot and be replacedgoonswarm is one of the largest and most powerful alliances in eve and while they are welcome to play their game as they wish it is unfair and counter productive to other alliances the political system itself and the very people of eve to have a single corporation or alliance maintain a permanent spot on the council no matter their contributions or lack there ofthis needs to be addressed immediately and all permanent residents and attendees to this council removed asap to restore a fair and proper political democratic atmosphereor ccp you need to remove the vote system because honestly its a pointless system when certain power blocs can not be replaced by any means popular vote or not especially if your just going to show favoritism and ensure that 1 or more alliances can never be removed from the council no matter what the vote says or popular opinionand this is a clear sign of favoritism and violates the very eula you all are supposed to enforce as it shows the devs and ccp itself clearly and definitively support an in game alliance making the game pointless to play and unfair in all aspectsi should not have to bring up the whole bob scandal as an example but you all should remember how badly that went for the game as a whole and your company
1seriously why i cant possibly think of why one person would be a permanent member it doesnt really matter anyway since cfc has 40k votes x 3 for 120k votes in total so theyre guaranteed a spot anyway but this way theyre guaranteed 2
you mean like the ones they announced in the dev blog
yep the way ccp and the csm and elements of exccp employees now turned players and players now turned employees and beer drinking nights with devs go i dont think we or anyone can really trust ccp doing the right thing by its subscribersthe scam that is the csm a body put together to represent all players but who represent only a few can simply be ignored by most playerssomeone at ccp who has some authority really needs to step and put a stop to this whole dev  snowflake player bs because were tired of sneaky multi 100 billion isk drops to pl exdev leader events that feed newbs to null sec gatecamps and devs getting pissed with special playerswhere is the professional integrity not at ccp apparently where i come from we have a saying which goes you dont  where you sleep what is occurring devs sitting back watching terrible mechanics hand goons the i win button to eve is doing just that stop pandering to your friends and start doing your jobs
couldnt find this in search so in case it has not been proposed yetlots of industry folks out there some really do not care about getting credit for work they do they just want isk other players really want more immersion in their chosen play in eveeve has always been about immersion and building up more of it in pve pvp lore etc so here is the ideawhen you build a module or ship the game puts a date and time stamp of when it was created and by whom i think this is done in other mmos ducks from the wow troll comments i thought it might be an interesting concept in eve for a couple reasons1 those who enjoy building things may like this feature2 would be fun to buy a ship that was built10 years ago just for example3 if eve ever introduces more variation in industry products such as better quality products from more experienced builders then name stamps could help in buying more product from that builder etc could open up a whole new level of industry in eveanyways i though it was an interesting ideago have fun deus vult
they may have said its not functioning how they desire it and you may be able to cite those posts but thats a far cry from saying its an exploit glitch or bugso no they havent told meit may be an advantage but lets face it thats the whole point of a cloak although they are far from being covertbut you were talking of immunity and that goes both ways as and until the cloaker decloaks both side are as immune from each other the cloaker has 0 offence and no way to kill the none cloaker until he decloaks making it balanced and thus making your premiss flawedyou seem intent on moving goals posts in order to try and make your stance valid i have to say its not working so welldestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
total crap often cited and proposed but still total crap a cloaked player doesnt have to even decloak to kill someone all they need to do is sit near the uncloaked player done it many times myself to kill someone
oh dear lord this does not mean that the cloak was at fault it simply means the person who died wasnt watching local or was a part of any intel channelsbut hey lets move the posts some more before they settle in destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
seems like the issue there is cyno dropping not cloaking
you dont have a single kill under your name so you cant claim jack about flying cov ops the reason i afk cloak is because whining carebears dock up the moment anyone enters local and wait for them to leave thats the only reason not because im lazy or dont want to do actual pvp
lol its called posting on an alt you never post with your main on these forums its paramount to suicide you should know this just makes you an easy target
really because that sounds like bullshit im here who wants to target me
just to add to the silliness i have alts that i post on forums for certain things that i do not want to reveal who i am however i know seraph and he is quite well known this is also the same for nikk narrelin this instance we all believe strongly in our views to express on our mains however this is off topicthe only thing on the last few pages that has made any sense to me in regards to the original topic has been the afk notifier is an interesting option would this apply equally to all players i think i could see its advantageshowever it would still give intel much too easilythe idea of station kick out cloak timers and such has been discussed on this thread and others i was a fan at one time of having a timer on cloaks however i have since changed my mind having seen the horrible cons and possibilities as to cloaking in general ccpfozzy has stated that the afk cloaking mechanics do serve a purpose as a valid tactic for smaller entities against larger ones that is the psych warfare it is and has been since it came out in 2004 been admitted by devs and the community as needing work however ultimately it is very low on the priority list for obvious reasons and many members of the eve community are very polarized on how to improve it the original point of this thread was just one aspect of using cloaks to be fair to that end all aspects of using cloaks defence and offence has been offeredplease consider these points1 once a cloak capable pilot has successfully entered a system and cloaked up there is no viable mechanic to interact with that pilot as long as that pilot remains cloaked2 once point one is achieve there is no mechanic to effectively tell if the cloaked pilot is afk or not3 the threat of force projection is there regardless of whether the pilot is afk or not4 current pve mechanics encourage maximization of profit leaving most pve ships incapable of meaningful pvp 5 the threat of force projection limits targets for cloaked pilots and encourages afk game playit is my opinion that a non cloaked or cloaked pilots should have a reasonable chance through diligent effort to find and interact with a cloaked shipb a cloaked pilot should have a reasonable chance to avoid detection and or interaction c no mechanic should encourage afk play
it is my view that the two absolutes imposed on intel both need to be changed in order for either to be changedboth or none if balance is to be maintainedlocal must stop giving out actionable intel this is a chat channel being used as a substitute for player effort obviously tools need to exist and players need time to adapt over into their usagecloaks must stop granting absolute protection based off of the above being in place it would destroy a key game element should local tell players when to hunt cloaked ships in addition to being able to hunt cloaked shipsthere is a third element which i feel should also be respected leave the wormholes alone they dont want changes they are not a part of this environment being disputed they like not having local and being unable to find each other while cloakedlets not spoil their game to fix oursupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
theyre both related as you well know
cyno dropping is also related to locals intel ability every bit as much as afk cloaking is and for the exact same reasonthe need for cyno dropping only exists since it offers the only means to deliver forces to a target before that target has more than enough free warning time to evade the threatit is common knowledge that if a player can reliably avoid another player then they are effectively immune to the threat that hostile player could bringeliminate the predictable and overly effective warning and hot dropping will cease to be needed or usedin fact you can add a spool up mechanic to force it out of existence so long as balance is kept in exchangethe key factor i see too often being glossed over is that the devs have declared this to be currently in balance regardless of whether it is the ideal solution they would preferupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
completely disagree with you cyno dropping is related to risk aversion and the desire to get kills without having to pvp cloaking and cynos are not themselves bad but put together they create a stupidly imbalanced mechanica cyno turns a newb ship into a super carrier capable of carrying in its hold 36 trillion m3 of ships and pilots while cloaking the pilots from local a newb ship should be a newb ship not a ship capable of destroying a large fleet with a single module that takes 5 days to trainthe same goes for cloaky ships theyre imbalanced theyre constantly used and theyre an i win button that prevents pvp not encourages it i have never seen a dev post saying they think cyno dropping is balanced some of the developers though say stupid things one of them was that there happy with the way sov is and they have no immediate plans to change it sov is complete shite just because theyre a dev doesnt mean they know what theyre talking about very likely they say stupid things like the sov thing because they have limited experience actually in the game playing against playersid also like to say if you dont like local and its intel why did you join eve i joined in 2003 and there was local then we dont need risk averse people who cannot figure out how to kill people without cynos there are fps type games where you can camp spawn points and get teleported around killing people you are also more than free to go to wormhole space and pvp why arent you there if you hate local so much because you love local for yourself you just dont like people using it to avoid you ganking themedit case in point  in a small gang moments ago cloaky legion comes up the pipe known cyno dropper flys around and tries to get engaged while his alliance sits around a titan 10 jumps away did we try to engage him no because wed get dropped by 20 30 or more ships with capital support that player has effectively made himself immune from nonconsentual pvp and immune to all small to mid sized gangs in the area and you think were the carebears trying to avoid pvp
in point of fact you misrepresent the larger context of the pvp experience with what you saygetting kills without having to pvp did they tickle the pve ship to death perhapsnothe simple fact is that the pve ship in this context relied exclusively on evasion as a defensewhether it was because they were antisocial or simply because they could not gather others to help them with defense they chose to play in numbers too small to resist the attacking forcethey chose to rely exclusively on evasion simply because they had a near perfect warning device that gave them the ability to do this only by ignoring it to some degree does a hot dropping hostile have any chance of reaching their targetwhy pray tell would hot dropping be needed in this environmentbecause no other options are available with any meaningful chance to catch the targets before they reach safetyif you want to stop hot dropping your only real option is to remove the reason it is usedwithout it pve ships have a near perfect defense in sov null with only the limited fighting ability ships able to slip past gate camps to reach them at allaccept and repeat this all important truthwe want encounters to happen while obtaining a direct benefit such as transport or direct income from mining or other npc interaction no ship is to be exempt from encounters for any reasondocked cloaked logged off or sitting behind pos shields cuts off the ship from direct benefit so is exempt while under these conditionsupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
rubbish you want to avoid risk in pvp you want to sit in local cloaked and completely immune from combat unable to be scanned or probed while you warp around scanning and probing looking for an easy kill on someone that hasnt decided to be completely immune from nonconsentual pvpyoure the risk averse person not the person that is ratting youre the one thats hiding waiting for your chance to get an easy kill against a ship that for whatever reason ccp devs decided is not able to be fit for pvp and pve at the same timenow before you get all upset and stuff i have done this too but im not going to pretend its because of the uber intel of local its because i wanted kills and didnt want to get killedlets be honest if you want to fight its easy to get a fight in eve its easy to catch a ratter or missioner its just not uber easy as cloaking up and killing people when theyre vulnerable wormholes are great you can sit your gang in the entrance to a null and send one ship out as bait when its engaged you jump your gang in no cloaking in local required but people want it easier than many vs 1 they want to teleport entire fleets onto one target these days because theyre risk averse carebears and thats where i think the game is broken there should be risk to both sides
lol it is so easy to assume these details as you have clearly done for starters i have enormous risk control in pvp i am a minerwhile i have the skills and hardware to afk cloak i dont bother with it at allits just not my play stylei find it too boring to sit endless hours waiting for someone to assume i am not there when i am if they assumed i was not there when i really wasnt there it means nothing to mei dont care about causing resource deprivation reactions in othersyou want to be honest good lets do that1 i want exhumers and ratting ships able to fight effectively against cloaking oriented ships2 as part of this i would add a spool up effect to hot dropping being on grid with your target and lighting a cyno should be a death sentence to the cyno boat every time that pve ship should melt the locked down cyno boat like butter on a stove3 i would add in enough to the venture in order to make it practical to use in hostile areas so play could happen in more placesi want to play both sides of this conflict pve vs stealthed guerrilla assault because this is the clever side of eve where the game doesnt win or lose based on simple dps or sheer numbers being clever carries more weight and fooling your opponent is a victory unto itselfby contrast it sounds to me like you just want the socalled afk cloaked pilots to leavehow am i supposed to play with other players if they leaveupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
so basically you dont afk youre a miner well i am an afk cloaking pilot which is why my corp is called cloakers one of us knows what theyre talking about and one of us doesnt
no thats not specifically true they want to be able to play their game in what is supposed to be a safe area without being griefed or extorted they pay to play the game just like we pay to play the game it is not unimaginable that like us they may want to play their game their wayafter all i see plenty of threads with griefers bitching about being given suspect flags  criminal flags for committing pirate activities in highsec space they are no different then a carebear bitching about them not getting flags for committing what is in fact a suspect  criminal action with the intent to harass and or annoyit goes both waysthe solution is to simply make the game like perpetuum 1 8 to 10 will be the new alpha security space in which no wardecs can be made against anyone and pvp tageting and damage is disabled save for mutually agreed duals  wardecs2 5 to 7 will be alpha 2 security space in which wardecs can occur but where all pvp except concord sanctioned pvp wardecs or mutually agreed pvp duals is disabled 3 01 to 04 will be beta security space in which the same rules which now apply to lowsec will continue to apply with no changes4 00 will remain unchanged as wellthis will fix your issues after all highsec is intended to be a safe place for new players to learn the game without interference from griefers and some people prefer to play the game in an area like thisthis also allows for those that wish to gank and grief and otherwise cause mischief to have their area which they can do it in whilst being unable to harass those who do not want to deal with them or be harassed by themeves one downside and one of the major issues with retaining subscribers and new players is well greifers give pepople the above and your subscriber base will grow exponentiallyare you going to lose subscribers as well sure but i mean losing the contaminated  unstable and toxic part of your community isnt really a bad thing is it no i view it as a good thing pvp is one thing war is one thing pointless griefing just to feed on the tears frustration and anger of another human being is a psychopathic parasitical action and like any cancer and the patient or game in this case would do a lot better once it is removedi should also point out that 80 of the eve population stays in highsec anyway the griefers and gankers and 00 bears are the minority in the new eden universe this is a clear signal that the vast majority of people who play eve do not want to deal with the psychopathic mentality of many of the minority population in the gamealso ccp is a business a businesses job is to make money in eve subscribers make ccp their money and increaseing their subscriber base means that ccp makes more money and i guarantee you if this system was put in place all those subers who left because of continual griefing would flock back to eve onlineyou can post whatever you like and flame this as hard as you want but statistics and math do not lie it is what it is
i would agree with your point 1 if people could not mission or mine in those systemsalso as ccp stated many times high sec is meant to be safer not safethe fact that eve is gaining not loosing players tells a different story about omg people are leaving stop iton another note you mentioned statistics and math do not lie yet you presented none which tells me you do not have this info and decided that trolling the assembly forums is something you would like to doedit also reading your previous post i see that you are full of shyte and wont listen to anybody but yourself
id like to start out by saying that im one of those soloist players who enjoys mining in peace however thats not the game of eve undocking is permission to pvpmaybe you want to play a different game i wont judge  eve isnt for everybody youre viewing this game as a polished star trek universe  its not this game is closer to a rough firefly universethe game works as it is sure some people may get griefed and ragequit however those that calm down and redouble their efforts will find this game to be a very indepth topic where griefing may occur but is very rare this is a thinking persons game and if you use your head for more than a place to store your hat youll find this game to be a near utopiasorry but not supported
i dont get why this needed a new thread
actually this game is more like perpetuum then any other game with the exception that perpetuum uses robots instead of spaceships and that the areas are set up exactly as i described it is eve online1 the only difference between the 2 games is perpetuum due to its current obscurity does not have the member base of eve and that the bs one must deal with in eve on a daily basis even if your a pvper and yes even if your a griefer does not exist in the perpetuum universe due simply to the set up i have suggested above2 i did not say remove pvp from highsec nor did i suggest any real or major change what i did suggest simply removes a griefers ability to harass and grief a newer player or a highsec resident without themselves putting some investment into it ie wardec  dual etcyou can still dec people and grief to your hearts content you simply have to work for it you can still bumb people and annoy the  out of them no change there and you can still extort people through clever use of the wardec system what this does do however is ensure that in some systems people can avoid you if they desire and play their game how they wish to play while allowing you to play yours how you want to play it3 for the record i am not a carebear i am a beta player and a pvper marketer and builder industrialist this is an alt one of many which i made for posting because lets face it my views are controversial to the scum of eve and their desires and personally even though i love killing them im really not interested in taking on the entire scum of the universe by myself 4 on memberships i do not know if you have read it but the 2013 preliminary financial report for ccp put them around 118000 or something  in the hole last quarter this is public information and you can find it simply by googleing it so whether or not eve has more accounts does not actually mean they have a larger member base and in fact in that document it clearly states eve online has seen a decline in active member subscriptions in black and whiteso you are in fact wrong on this as ccp themselves made this statement in their own report
so what youre asking for is highsec to literally become truesec where ganking and griefing wouldnt be allowedim so sorry but thats literally the stupidest thing ive heard you do make a compelling argument for your carebear ways but it will never happen and you would instantly break the sandbox congratulationslowsec and nullsec would remain the same but highsec would become carebear heaven highsec is meant to be slightly safer then lowsec risk is involved everywhere in the game thats what makes eve so unique if you really want risk free pve literally go play another mmo not to be a  or anything but eve has been like this forever it will not change
my point still standsi will agree with you if your so called safe area does not allow people to mission or mine in it you are affectively creating an area in highsec that is voided of any combat which is complete against what eve is you also realize that new players wont be the only ones that flock to those areas come to think of it i actually think you will toyou mentioned finances as well you do realize that ccp has sunk a lot of money into other developments right dont tell people to google things if you want to provide facts then provide dont come here with airy fairy remarks about thingsfor somebody that has been around since beta as you want us to believe you seem to know very little edit i just realized i said that realizing that other people have said it as well in your other threadsperpetuum has been around for a while now if their way of doing things is so good i am sure we would have heard a lot more about it by now as the eve killer we have noti am not wrong since you have not even proven your own point yet i know ccp was in a hole but if you actually understand how corporate finances work you would not have made that statementi am however are off the opinion arguing you with valid points is going to be pointless since you have proven in your other threads you are not interested what others think so i will say this good luck and hopefully good riddance this will never happen neveredit the more i read your other responses the more it seems you are just trolling good catch
lilly naariplease stop making threads you dont seem very knowledgeable about the game and your ideas about how the game works or should work are pretty bad at this point 1 highsec is not safe it is safer than lowsec or nullsec but it is not safe 2 highsec should not be safe this game has succeeded for 10 years without the need for a completely secure area of space why does it need one now or ever 3 concord is not there to save your ship concord exists to destroy the ship of any lawbreaker you are the only one responsible for saving your ship so always keep that in mind when you undock 4 suicide ganking extorting miners and missioners scamming and being underhanded or heavyhanded is a legitimate part of this game it is generally very easy to avoid these types of players especially if you move to remote highsec lowsec or nullsec space 5 this is a survival of the fittest dog eat dog mmo make friends because the only safety youll ever have is safety in numbers even then there is always a bigger fish finally you can play the game anyway you want however you must account for the fact other players may interfere with your playstyle you are not guaranteed to be left alone no matter how much you may desire it
sigh this one againpoints to ultima online and trammel serverwhile what you are proposing is not necessarily a second server the idea behind it is still the same and the effects of it would be too it will initially create a huge influx of new subs everyone who is smart will move their money making activities to the safer area  which will then distort and imbalance the ingame economy because everything is based more or less upon ship destruction and production and the safe area provides a place for production and use without the destruction part there will be less of a reason to work together with other people people in safe zones have little reason to cooperate with others less secure places will become more depopulated as more and more people migrated to where most of the other players were ie the safer server youll start cutting into one of the biggest draws for many dedicated players the ruthlessness of itnow here is one of my favorite posts of all time on the forum
i actually agree with that post still isnt going to stop me presenting debates for solutions to others issues i enjoy a good debate even if in the end its pointless however since changes come from the forums all the time who knows
it should be obvious that im in an npc corp on my main to say that noobs are in npc corps is no more true than saying goonswarm or nc have noobs npc corp is a place where players come to learn the game with a helpful even if sometimes a little coarse group of players who enjoys nurturing the new generation to this wonderful gameactually eve is not a pvp game its a game where pvp is integral to the gameplay but its not focused on pvp in fact itd be roughly accurate to say pve has as big of a role in eve online as pvpeve online is a market simulator game pvp creates the demand pve creates the supply without either side the game would disintegrate in its current form in addition eve is the best market simulator game out there  college people have graduated thanks to papers written on the topic of eve onlinewell now we have a selfadmitted troll thats the first step in finding a cure for your problem who knows maybe youll eventually become a warmblooded breathing person until then tho gb2wow
eve online is 80 industry i consider pve as part of industry 15 exploration and 5 pvp if you remove the industry from eve online you remove the ability to play the game as without such you would have no ships no ammo no mods no nothing except for rookie ships and civilian mods pvp simply perpetuates the cycle of economic decline or growth as well as enforces the necessity of a continuous industrial backbone for corporations and alliances no matter how much they choose to deny it those carebears they make fun of are the reason they have ships to pvp with and gank them with if the carebears left eve a single round of ammunition would cost billions of isk or more 90 of all goods on the market are made in highsec by carebear industrial corporations or players just look at ccps production track charti agree with the post because it has some merits but like all things doesnt mean i 100 agree with it all as you can see from my above post
please note that i and a few others are using the term pvp in a more general sense not just ship on ship violencewhen you mine asteroids you are denying others the ability to also mine asteroidswhen you run missions and use lp to buy faction items you are increasing the supply of those items and devaluing it for everyone elsewhen you build ships mods and ammo you are increasing the supply of those items and devaluing it for everyone elsewhen you buy stuff you are denying someone else the sale and use of that itemwhen you supply someone with ships mods ammo you may be indirectly supporting others actions against others or even against yourselfwhen you do not supply someone with ships mods ammo you may be hampering the efforts of others to do what they wantwhen you put a pos or poco up you are affecting the efforts of others for better or worse in their activitiespvp is in its purest sense player versus player conflict against others in some form or another because everyone is in competition with one another this is the design of eve this is why safe zones of any kind would not work in eveyou cannot take out the ability to wage certain types of conflict in this case ship on ship because people do not like it but then allow people to wage other types of conflict with impunity ie economic conflict its hypocriticalhow is the warlord supposed to take out the economic base of his adversaries if war is not allowed in those areas how can you stop a more massive force from becoming more massive if you cannot cut the supply linestwo more things1 a miner industrialist hualer bp researcher pos operator etc are not necessarily carebears that term is specifically reserved for people who do whatever they can to avoid anyone else in the game from interacting with them in a way they do not like which they complain abouttrue miners industrialists haulers bp researchers and pos operators understand that they are targets like everyone else because they affect everyone else in the game and they adapt accordinglyexamplea freighter pilot is hauling goods from one place to another hisher ship is filled with cargo equaling hisher ships value already this is pretty risky heshe jumped into a system and then finds himherself being bumped by a stabber and is eventually gankedthe carebear will fume about this and complain about how defenseless heshe is that hisher billion isk ship should not be dying to disposable million isk destroyers the carebear will not change hisher mode of operation and carry on as usual because thats the way heshe wants to play and to hell with everyone else the carebear is ganked again at a later date using the same tacticon the other hand a good hauler pilot will first fume but then wonder how heshe was killed and if there is a way to defend himherself after some research and politely talking with the gankers themselves the good hauler finds out that avoidance is the best way to get around a gank so the good hauler begins to carry cargo values much lower than the cost to gank himher andor carries items that would be too troublesome for the gankers to snatch andor loads up hisher cargo with lots of low volume crap to confuse the cargo scanners of ganker scouts and for those highvalue hauls that simply cannot be avoided no problem the good hauler pays or asks for a favor from a friend or corpie to hop in a hyena with two webs challenge himher to a duel for limited engagement timer and to web the freighter at each gate making the freighter warp less than 5 seconds after decloaking at each gatethe gankers never get a chance to bump or kill the good hauler2 one of the dirty little secrets about every combat pilot out there is that we all have industrial alts andor know someone with one most of us make haul or research our own stuff we have to earn isk somehow righthowever most people dont exactly advertise this as it would just invite people to come over and complicate our liveseditfrom ccps own new player guidesection 53 in eve online any player may attack any other player if they choose to no matter where they happen to be this is because eve online is essentially a pvp player versus player game at its core
corp history has everything to do with consequences for your actions if you awox steal or act like a jackass the corp history allows your potentially new corp to ask your old corp what type of fuckup you are also you can see who you bought an item from after you made a purchase im also a fan of making financial analysis agents think locator agents to follow isk movement between players
employment history is used to identify alts it is used to estimate a characters historical activities and is used to identify their associates sure this may be bad for you but so what also a highsp character doesnt equate to a competent player and a low sp character can beat a high sp character when they know what they are doing
so much thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
while there are some space communes in the game most groups pve to supplement their own wallet i myself build ships modules and ammo for my nullsec corp and put them on the market at nearjita prices we have several members in my corp that regularly stock the market with reasonably priced goods some as resellers and others and producers like myself making us far more relient on logistics than industrialists i do not build locally as i have yet have a reason to do so i realize this is different than a large sov alliance which have many members that may mine the local roids providing access to cheaper minerals as well as those that may experience lower pos operating costs but these costs savings often arent worth the risks which only exist at the graces of others perhaps im too small time with my indy toons but i know what my industrial needs are and i get them met more efficiently in highsec than in nullsec also if someone is calling you a carebear it is not simply because you are risk adverse carebear is more than just risk adverse everyone in this game limits the risks to their assets because they will lose them if they dont no carebear is much more than that for example running missions in highsec doesnt make you a carebear a carebear will run missions while not only ingoring the reality that other players can still attack you in highsec but then raging ifwhen it happens with claims that ccpconcord should prevent it for example mining in highsec doesnt make you a carebear a carebear mines roids believing they have a fundamental right to do so without interference and then flips out when someone stops them from mining until they pay a protection racket fee for example hauling goods from point a to point b through highsec doesnt make you a carebear a carebearl hauls valuable goods expecting undisruptable movement across highsec only to cry on the forums that someone destroyed their ship to stealloot their valuable cargo for example buying goods and reselling them for profit doesnt make you a carebear a carebear trader incorrectly assumes all buy orders are guaranteed and flips out when they find incompleteable buy orders exist specifically to lure them into buying overpriced slow moving assets they cant make a profit on for example manufacturing goods in this game doesnt make you a carebear a carebear expects everything they build to be profitable and complains about how unfair it is others have cheaper sources of materials or rare limited edition blueprints for example being in a noob corp doesnt make you a carebear a carebear refuses to leave the noobcorp because they cant cope with the knowledge that in player run corps your corpmates may attack you without concord intervention fundamentally a carebear is someone that believes they deserve to operate in a riskfree immune to nonconsensual pvp environment
you are grossly mistaken here a a logistics player can bring items in at an affordable rate and the only protection they need is recon prior to lighting a noobship cyno there is no way in hell id sit around a belt for 4 hours watching hulks mine i fully expect those hulks to get safe swap to combat vessels and help fend off any gangs in the area b in this day and age major sov wars are won and lost by attrition of wills not attrition of resources smaller scale sov wars are won by overwhelming force not by attrition of resources if logistics was nerfed into the ground making it much harder to supply a region from empire your day may come until then your contribution will be classified as a nice size c please buy my market out ill just restock the market again and enjoy the profits your economic threat has little meaning to most nullsec entities d perhaps im not a real industrialist i generally have 20b in nonship sell orders i generally have only two toons producing i vary my production between items rather than producing at max efficiency and i typically dont harvest resources myself other than pi at the same time im ceo of a decent sized nullsec pvp corp and i can tell you that in the current environment we need players to move items from highsec to our local market we need players to stock the markets and contracts having inhouse industrialists to produce items cheaper is one of those nicetohave power window options that arent nearly as important as you seem to think from my experience the health of a alliance is almost entirely measured in how much content does your alliance generate for your members a strong industrial wing is not essential to the majority of playstyles
1 a logistics player can yes and the industrialist can simply buy them and stockpile forcing the price up repeatedly until the logistics player cant cope with itorif im feeling frisky i would just make everything dirt cheap it would be a loss to me in the short run but in the long run he would have to match my prices at the lower rate or fail to make money at which point i would continually buy his now cheap stuff and list it higher then when the time was right strip the market and force your alliance to pay top dollar or risk loosing your jfs to the invading alliances patrols and hot drops doing ferry runsas you can see your logistical pilot having limited income and resources would eventually cave one way or another thus forcing an alliance to do and pay what i desire anywaythe key here is industrialist think and play eve like chess thinking several moves ahead of you and your alliance and planing for alternate outcomes of events and situations whereas most pvp pilots and alliance leaders think days and weeks ahead and on occasion a month or 2 industrialist think months and years ahead and have multiple redundancies to their plans and setups we think about the bigger picture and how to control the fate of all involved2 on attrition of wills you may want to ask yourself what causes this because in the end the answer is always individual wealth an alliance generally does not pay for 100 of the members incomes and ships and fittings at some point in time the member has to fend for themselves in this regard and it is the members unwillingness to continue to lose isk and fork over ship after ship in losses that causes the loss of will as you put itan industrialist that is good at his job can usually but not always extend this life and desire by simply supplying the alliance with inexpensive materials and ships and ammo2b on the other hand for smaller alliances the industrialist can make it exceedingly expensive for an enemy alliance larger or not to take their space while yes you are correct the smaller alliance will be overwhelmed and ran out they will generally have become rich during the process and simply move to a better area as the enemy was most likely buying from the smaller alliances market and paying the exorbitant prices in their region to replace their lost ships meaning that while yes the smaller alliance lost their current space they became wealthy doing itwar can make even the poorest popper wealthy and even the smallest entity a giant with proper economic manipulation who cares about space ownership if your alliance becomes rich beyond its dreams while losing space do you really care about some rinky dink system not to mention with the prices your enemy is paying in your region they are weakening themselves financially so as they become weaker you become stronger and a strong financial backing is the first key to successcontinued in next post
2c its not about buying your market out its about forcing you to make inconvenient decisions at the right moment which in turn causes catastrophic failure for your alliance on multiple fronts buying your market out is something i would do only once i knew you did not have the resources to replace it you can have all the isk in the world but it does you no good if your logi pilots dont make it up to restock or if the enemy attacking you is depleting your ships and weapons faster then you can replace them let me give you an examplean enemy fleet is attacking your home system they already have their sov blockers up and you are fighting to stop them but for whatever reason the battle is going badly and youve lost a lot of ships your not particularly worried because you know your home station has everything you need to continue and win the fight on the market and youve made sure of itbut suddenly you notice when your pilots start coming out in crappy ships something is wrong you check the market only to realize too late that every single worthwhile ship needed to continue the fight is gone you immediately tell your entire fleet to come to the station so you can hand out the back up ships you have stored in your corporate hangers but this extra time has allowed the enemy to blockade your sovyou manage to push them out but just barely and you take heavy losses doing it the next day they are back this time they strike during your downtime but your secure in the knowledge that you reseeded your market and replaced the losses from the day before however once again you look at the market and everything you just did is gone this time due to the lack of resources your alliance fails to mobilize and the system is lostyou see i know exactly what i am doing and in this example i just killed your alliances home system i dont care if you made billions from it your alliance is crippled and your enemy just bought from me everything i bought from you they are now well supplied in shiny new ships fully weaponized while your alliance in deep 00 is struggling to mobilize and retain any type of force as your supplies are gone and you have few if any surviving shipsyou see you can have trillions of isk and tons of pilots but all things are based on time and if you do not have the right resources at the right time you die and trillions of isk and tons of pilots do you no good if those pilots do not have ships with which to fight and your isk is useless if you do not have a market in range with which to buy fromas i said the true industrialist is the real terror of eve or the savior in this example i could have just as easily saved your alliance as crippled it and nothing you can do can stop an industrialist from doing either should they so chose everyone is at the mercy of the economy save those who control it the real trick is to know how to use your enemies strength and turn it into a weapon against them yours is your self sufficiency your weakness is your belief that it cant be touched i just took your strength and made it your enemies and took your weakness and exploited itthe end result was the loss of your home system and while yes there are many things you could have done to counter such as i said before its all about timing and what actions are taken in response to such3 20 billion average is not a bad number honestly theres quite a bit you can do with that assets are what you really want though rather then liquid currency assets are for supply and defense and you should only ever have 25 of your assets on the market when playing this war game the rest you should hold in reserve but even that is not a guarantee of success it just means you might last longer which that in itself might guarantee you success just remember things not sold on the market to your alliance count as a loss not a gain even if sold as those are resources a possible enemy now holds and can use against you currency is for attack
or you have your logi bros sell fitted ships via alliancecorp only contracts thus ensuring no market fuckwittery this thread says otherwisein the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
that would only work for a small alliance based in a very small area due to limitation of  of alliance contracts allowed the market is 10s of 1000s of orders across an entire region and there are ways in which i could deal with that as well so no there would still be market fuckwittery as you put it and an alliance industrialist is still necessary to combat such effectivelyprove it the point is is that every alliance needs at least one industrialist and possibly their crew if they have one preferably more then one the issue your going to find is as i said one that actually wants to join you
my expereince in 00 says otherwise with jfs runs usually done in corp and alliance level contracts i have very very rarely used the market burden of proof you are making the claim that you know what you are doing i disagree its up to you to prove it not mein the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
fair enough i cant argue with your personal experiences other then to point out this is just you on a small scale with your corp mainly at least i gather from your statement and again like i said depending on your alliance it may work just fine this method is excellent for smaller alliances doesnt work so well with larger ones though unfortunatelyquotewell honestly that could go both ways i am not actually making any claims here save that i from my own experiences know what i am talking about the individual i originally quoted said null alliances were looking for industrialists i was originally simply pointing out why we were so hard to find and recruit being an industrialist myself though honestly i left 00 behind a while back i know from experience why i choose not to join or help any of the null bear alliances and thats basically what i stated from my experiences and perspectivein the end everyone has their own experiences to rely on and each individuals perception of the cause of something is probably different
your ignorance is overwhelming here the jf pilot that stocks the market gets paid when you buy out their items you do it regularly the simply increase the costs to make it worth their time you also cannot touch corp contracts which adequately supply many moderately sized corps and if we are referring to sov nullsec where you cannot dock in the enemy station what are you going to do with your billions and billions in stockpiled goods you cannot access other than remote sell  contracts you will run out of isk far more quickly than that jf runs out of energy especially since you are paying him every time you buy out the market to top it off players can simply ask on coms does anyone have xyz in their hangar and have it sold to them via station trading which is also something i often do now your just trolling you cannot compete with someone if you cannot get your goods into their station do you know what the staging system of your enemy is a year in advance before they conquer it while it is accessible i think not with your selfentitled imsoimportanttothegame mentality protectmesoicanmineinpeace mentality do you really wonder why you get ridiculed in then end it is not individual wealth that causes the attrition of wills fyi most people in this game arent terrible concerned with wealth people want enough for fun toys to use and lose but that doesnt require enormous wealth as making isk in this game is trivial attrition of wills happens through cockblocking structure bashing and being on the wrong side of a slaughter why would the conquering alliance by overpriced goods they can bring in their own materials at at a decent price and anything left behind is stuck where you can only remotely access it the conquered alliance usually takes a loss when they lose their space not profits have you ever been to nullsec or partaken in sov warfare
i assume that was rhetorical we all can make an educated guess based on the contents of this very threadin the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
1 actually on number i miss typed heit wasnt supposed to say that i simply forgot to edit it my point with that is you can make his trips worthless by placing your own items of the same type on the market lower in price then his ensuring that his do not sell and yours do thus he loses money in addition you can also hike up the price of jump fuel in his home departure region making his jumps more expensive and his profits less sure he can spend another couple of hours running 40 jumps to jita for fuel but time is money and thats a waste of time ill make good use of  i know when an enemy is encroaching on space yes and i can make assumptions based on their movements or if need be i can pay someone for information on their plans well ahead of when they are actually going to happen and be ready for it so yes i can everyone has their price you miss the point when i can build everything in the game my goods are always at the station in addition i can use services like redfrog for example to get me whatever i desire there i never even have to undock and the frog services are generally always blue with the vast majority of nullsec alliances i simply take advantage of your own transport services and use them against you if need be ill stick an alt account in your alliance and use your own logi pilot to bring me my stuff i dont mine you seem to have missed that part most industrialists simply buy the minerals off market at cheaper prices then their intrinsic values non of those things would matter if an individual simply had the time and resources to replace them though so yes it is a matter of personal wealth granted being overwhelmed is discouraging and seeing your  constantly blown up is also but then again if you had the resources pilots and ships to form a proper defense your  wouldnt be getting blown up now would it quotewho said they were over priced i didnt i simply stated that they bought from me what i bought from you maybe i raised the price a tad say 5 to make me a little profit thats not over priced though if you mean a smaller alliance being overwhelmed selling them that at those prices well the answer is simple people buy for convenience its a lot easier to pay that extra 10 mil for a bc now then to wait a day or so to bring one up from highsec or your home system people are lazy and people with money are willing to pay for what they want when they want it at whatever price its available at thats just basic consumer marketing yes i was in razor during the bob tri wars and remained in that coalition though i joined morsis mihi and later hydra afterwords so yes i lived in 00 for over 5 years never even came to highsec and i lived in a c4 for 2 years after they were released and only left it twice maybe 3 times during those 2 years i love wormholes not sure why shrugs i only recently moved to highsec within the last 23 years and mainly because i got bored with null and the politics so you could say i guess that i retired to highseci remember when poss controlled sov and when you had to meticulously destroy the enemies and anchor your own and maintain them and protect them to maintain your hold on spacedo you
redfrog only delivers to highsec blackfrog is not blue to the majority of nullsec the found of blackfrog is in my corp and id like to point out that you just implied youd need logistics pilots to move your stuff to the frontlines that is why nullsec generally needs logistics pilots while industrialists are simply nice to have furthermore the sop for sov nullsec is to deny docking rights to neutrals and hostiles this makes it very hard to move goods into a station making it very hard for your to produce  in an enemy station and finally the station owners can block your access to the science and industry services within a station which further gimps what you can do to compete wtih the locals even if you do have the supplies in station to build your stuff your hole argument is so full of holes it makes swiss cheese look solid
lol you might be surprised at how many alliances do not restrict services thinking restricting docking rights is sufficient you seem to miss the part where i clearly statedif need be ill simply put an alt account in your alliance i have not been unknown in the past to train an alt up on a clean account for 6 months before joining my target alliance so yea you will never know its me hell ill even join fleets and pvp with you all and be a good supportive member on that character anywaywith that ill have full access to everything any for your alliance members do including and not limited to docking rights factory refinery etc as an added bonus ill know all of your pos location your shield pws your convoy routs and much much more you think for a second i wouldnt use those against you to further the needs of my actual alliance which is probably the one attacking you in that example i gave you and when it is all said and done you will never know it was me for throughout the entire thing i will remain supportive on that character and will eventually leave in good standings even though it was that character that allowed your enemy to destroy youwelcome to eve onlinealso i can place buy orders on the market and purchase items from the market whether you have restricted services or not i do it all the time
so now to be effective as an industrial superstar  you need knowledge of your enemies movements prior to them setting up their staging systems  you need alts in your enemy alliances so you can smuggle resources in  you need logistics to make your industrial superstar plays possible  you need massive resources to buy out your enemys market  you need sentries to protect your mining ships and for this you provide cheapfree ships eliminate the needs of logistics oh wait maybe not and undermine their enemies by market manipulation all we need is an attitude change to appreciate your superhero abilities sorry if we dont jump on the loony bus with you your response has been noted now well let the thread die
um noall you need is the ability to supply your alliance with needed goods and manage their market  protect it from other enemy industrialists  marketers and provide inexpensive affordable ships and goods on itthe rest of that stuff was just rp and which if you can do in certain circumstances great most people cant and admittedly i delved a bit into the bo area of eve as i have a lot of experience with that as wellon the needs yes you have needs do you need someone else to do them for you not really you can buy and sell on the market whether you have access to station services or not you can always place buy orders and work with that from scratch but if your enterprising youll find a way to make an area work for you and whatever alliance happens to be in said areaif your in an alliance great if not great doesnt really matterthe whole point here was simply to point out that there is a reason alliances have a difficult time finding industrialists who are willing to help them i simply pointed out the reasons why they do not wish to join you all if you want to change that then change it if not stop whining about how you cant recruit them
i actually read that in angry sean connery voice tm
do you mean that he and the terribad attentioncraving blogger are both entitled to attend all the csm summits as they placed 1st and 2nd in the last election if so working as intended
no i mean permanent as in even if they are not voted in they still retain their postions on the council as is obvious by the huge bold letter that say say permanent attendee  csm next to their names on the listbeing a current member because you won an election is not the same as being a permanent membergranted goonswarm will never lose the election as they basically own ccp these days but still listing it publicly even if you do rig the election is just 
welcome to evethe csm is literally one sided with ccp and it always will beim very impressed that mynnna is even running a campaign might as well say im getting in regardless of what anyone says dont bother
you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means mynna is a permanent attendee not a permanent member if they were a permanent member do you really think wed have a ballot option to vote for them all csm members are elected to the csm there are no permanent player positions on the csm members with a large fan base like prominent cfc members with 25000 players supporting them will routinely get voted onto the csm thats how a democracy works
and whats the difference if he or she has a permanent spot there then she is free while there to sew her or his sides influence among the other csm so no there is no difference between an attendee and a member beyond words the result is the same someone who was not voted into the csm is still present and able to influence the csmif she is always voted in great i could give a rats ass less but the day she isnt and for whatever reason shows up to the council like she was thats wrong and thats really my point
im trying to be civil and not make fun of you please read the following and become educated in the future please do a little research on the topics you are posting on so you have an informed opinion rather than perpetuating rumors and unsubstantiated bullshit  all members of the csm must be voted onto the csm every election cycle  there are 14 members of the csm determined by the stv voting system  there are 2 of the 14 members designated as permanent attendees again determined by the stv voting system from the csm whitepaper now apologize for making such an ill informed post and request the thread be locked as to not perpetuate your misinformed statements
you just basically proved exactly what i was saying is correct those 2 are permanent attendees at every summit and meeting or gathering while the others are not why even have a full csm councile if only 2 people are going to be able to express their opinions in totality also there should be a limit to how many consecutive terms an alliance or organization can serve on the council in order to maintain a fair representation of all of the individuals corporations and alliances in eve
are you for realall csm members are elected the highest rankings of the elected most votes csm members must always be present at both summit meetings once again if it has not sunk in yet the 2 highest ranking members of the elected csm must be permanent fixtures at both summits you do know how they choose the highest ranking members right i am sure you do since as you mentioned you have been around since the betaif you wanti can go buy some crayons and it for you if it will help make you understandare you just picking the part you want to be true and ignoring everything else it is not that hard to understandand with your last statement now you suddenly move the goal post as other have mentioned before what game are you playing at
how unfair is it that the two most popular candidates among all voters are welcome at all meetings should we shun the majority of eve players and put the notsopopular minority at the all meetings and qq some more about csm members not getting enough of a voice gee if only the other csm members could attend these meetings by remote video gee if only the other csm members could present their viewpoints directly to ccp in the csm forum section or im channels gee if only the other csm members were invited to attend the meetings based on job performance and experience relative to the topics and as for term limits why so the capable competent and active members of the csm have to step down i could see implementing this suggestion if pisspoor csm members kept getting reelected but the truth is the csm is doing a pretty good job and they have regular new blood so your term limits really will do more harm than good
gizznittthere is no point every time somebody points out the obvious they add another ridiculous statement in the hopes it makes their point valid he is not interested in what others thinks or has to say not to mention his knowledge for somebody that has been around since beta seems extremely limitedat this point and though all the other threads he started it is evident he is just trolling
pretty muchthread
um you just repeated what i saidi simply added that i think there needs to be a limit on consecutive terms and a limit on lifetime terms for each alliance and or corporation or organization
there you do it again you were focusing on a single person who is always elected making it sound like she is a permanent member just because she gets elected as grizznitt pointed out does not mean she is permanent the day people decide not to vote for she wont be but that is not what you said you were under the false idea that she was a permanent member of the csm regardless of votesnow suddenly you have forgotten that trivial detail after you were proven wrong in your original thread and now suddenly have a problem with the two most popular members being selected to always be at the summit move post much cant you stick to you original assertion
ccp disagrees which is why they removed term limits back around the time of csm 4 or 5
just because i realize i misunderstood something and once figuring it out noticed another issue does not mean i am going to not post about it i despise politics because honestly their pointless as those in power will always be those with the most money and members and therefore any movement political or otherwise will always be biased toward the most powerful entities desires the same problem that exists in capitalism exist in every democratic systempower corruptsabsolute power corrupts absolutelynot a single one of the csm members do not have their own wants and desires in mind of which will better their alliances and or corps in their own way regardless of the outcome to otherschange effects everyone what is good for one is bad for another and vice versa the only time this is false is when a decision can resolutely have a positive effect on everyone involved which is an impossibility this being the case individuals delude themselves into believing that what is good for them is good fro everyone much like religion does when in fact the very opposite is generally the truthmany people on these forums have made excellent suggestions for in game additions but the major powers that be if deciding they personally would be damaged by such even if the game as a whole would be improved strike them down with majority vote coming form their singular source
oh you want an fight system ok here my 2 centsso eve is futuristic game so we can make an virtual realy sim on stationfor capsuleer its no diffeence it is in ship or in vr we can simulate anything from mine colony defence  gate assaults to camps even large scale fleet battles ships to this system however should be scanned from ships in your inventoryyou can make ques 5 v 5 10 v 10 etc all is up to you but biggest problem i see that eve hasnt collision or los so you cant outmanuver enemyall you can is to play with its tracking and spider tank
sounds like you need to go back to high sec
ad hominem for the win try debating next time perhaps it might have better results for youfyi i have both sides of this equation if you actually understood what i wrote i am a blops pilot as well as every class of covert craft in the game some in multiple racesi am also a miner with the skills to boost effectively from an orca or put any exhumer on the map with any t2 crystalwhile you are claiming to be a covert pilot who uses afk cloaking and are campaigning to have those options reduced so you will find that role made more difficult assuming it remains practical at alli thought you asked for honesty here is this how you demonstrate that qualityupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
griefing is against the rules if you have any information in this regard and can show that griefing is in fact taking place then please contact ccp with your concernsthe forum is not the place for thisyou should also do well by replying to any posts in their original thread also having a modicum of knowledge on the subject at hand will help before postingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
excellent start to a new thread ignorance in the first line you clearly have no clue about what eve is high sec is not safe its not supposed to be safe and it is in no way shape or form meant to somehow magically shield you from other players if this is what you expect from eve then you are playing the wrong gamethen go play perpetuum and stop trying to make eve into another game eve is meant to be harsh you are supposed to take responsibility for your own actions and choices and deal with the consequences accordingly not whine at ccp to change game mechanics to protect you like some kind of petulant childindeed statistics and maths do not lie eve has grown year on year for 10 years with its current UFFFDharshUFFFD mechanics statistical proof that ccp have made the right choice in keep eve hash and unforgiving unless you have actual subscriber statistics to prove your point then all you have is opinion and conjecture in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
3it is more true npc corps are literally where new players are put and it requires a concious choice and action to leave one it physically cannot happen that a new player joins the game and magically finds themself in a player corp at the losing end of a wardecthere may be as many pve activities as there are pvp activities but the game is focused on pvp that is why pvp in some can occur essentially anywhere whether a pve player wants it or notmarket is pvp too
oh my godi never knew
yes please1ccps sand box is eve online the sand is owned by ccp we pay them a monthly fee to throw the sand at each otherUFFFDUFFFDthat is all that is here so move along nothing more to be seen
which is inherently the core reason why corruption exists because of politics when an uninformed and uninterested electorate does not actively participate in the political process or disdains the political process due to negative exposure the only way to prevent the pointlessness of politics is actual active participation in the system not burying your head in the sand and walking away which is also hilariously enough the same reason capitalism is viewed as being corruptible by those who disdain it or only passively participate in its course
just remind me again who was the biggest advocate for the tech nerfi really am starting to think that this person is in fact a doomsdale altin the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
except that that is not what it means mynnna has to be voted in the same as anyone else there is no such thing as an unelected csm membermynnna was first elected on to csm8 he hasnt served on any previous csms
the problem with this is that its simply not true its a prime example of truthiness  something that sounds as if it should be true but is in fact complete rubbish with no factual basis whatsoevertruthiness is a quality characterizing a truth that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively from the gut or because it feels right without regard to evidence logic intellectual examination or facts1
that rather eloquently encapsulates the entirety of gdUFFFD
i am absolutely outraged or i will be once someone explains whats going on to me because i am absolutely sure there is something to be outraged about here somebody needs to be stopped

you do this with a recon and open a covert cyno for your 
its not you you never know what youre talking about and pretty much everything you say is a self motivated selfish liespeaking of which im still waiting on that 2 week skills 2 million isk 600 dps catalyst you promised me
1 for this iz burn jita is coming up and id love to be able to contribute that much dps at such a low price
who takes more riskthe cov ops bomber that has to sneak through dozens of bubbled systems spending days finding the particular target he can killor the ratter that sits in system with 50 allies ratting isk away lets think
launch space is limited to 500m3 now and the time between launches 1 hr now limits the total amount that can be exported this way i see it more of a check on pocos that seek to close a planet off completely by setting an ridiculous tax rate but it would definitely serve new players who have relatively low volume per day in our area lately im seeing pocos with a 55 tax rate  we are not even going to bother with planets like that unless it is to destroy the poco and cost the tax gouging bastages some cash
again they only get hammered until they spend some time training customs code expertise if you spend the time training it to level 5 you should get some benefit for it
seems like a lot of work for ccp to rework pi this way when my proposed changes would be relatively simple

ok i love answering a decent troll because sometimes there are some truthiness bits mixed in that others may accidentally mistake for truth itself1 politics is pointless because it is a fixed game i honestly think sometimes that this little gem is encouraged by the people with money and power so they can disenfranchise the masses through learned apathy why vote let us just run things for youbull if you want to run run if someone you think is the right person for the job then support them instead if there is power in a democratic system then it is there for the taking but it is easier to complain that the race is fixed and the decisions already made than to step in and get your hands dirty i challenge anybody to tell me what power block or big money got me onto the csm8 council2 power corrupts so if the game wasnt rigged then the people we elected will soon be so crooked that it will not make a difference how they got there in the first place that would eb a telling point except for the wee little detail of the csm being an advisory council and representation of the players with no true power so with no power we cannot be corrupt right wrong i love logic and the fallacies there in we are as corrupt or clean as we are when we started no more no less which leads me to my favourite3 somebody gets hurt if there is change well somebody often gets hurt without the change in ancient times surgeons were not doctors because of the do no harm clause we got over that one realizing that a long term beneficial game may involve some pain and sacrifice up front few changes can be made to the game that will be good for everyone so we try to advise ccp to the find the better good not the perfect move but good ones we look at changes from all the different viewpoints that we can bring to the table from mynnna with his expertise in hifinance in low places to mine in casual play and just faking it as you play a gamegame    you know this hobbyobsession of ours supposed to be fun for me it is hope the same goes for you and i have been and am still trying to keep it that waym
i think the confusion is the choice of the term permanent inferring never ending member a more accurate title should be priority member as this member has priority in attendance over the rest on the csm

lolwe as in those of us that fly sbswe all know that flying an sb is cakewe all know that an sb puts out as much dps as a battleship relitively speaking at 50km range doing 4kmpswe all know that it doesnt take days to find someone to kill  5 minuets reallywe all also know that 00 for the most part is empty space with very few gate camps and bubbles as you put itwe all also know that you can go from highsec to an enemy home system in 00 in about 1020 minuetswe all also know that flying a defenseless hulk which costs around 300 million in a 00 system with 50 people in it which is defenseless and dies like kindling on a roaring flame is a lot more of a risk then an sb pilot in a 50 mil max ship who can cloak aproach target volley bomb and warp out all in 56 seconds and kill thingsso no the sb  cloaker pilot is not even remotely taking a risk in fact your target is a free kill i should know i have plenty of them and most were in 00 systems that had 2550 people in themif your taking days to find people to kill or worried about gate camps well id advise you find another profession because being an sb pilot isnt the right one for you and it means you know nothing about them or how to fly them
your scenario is improbable and to expect this as a common occurance i believe goes too faryou found a fool mining unprotected in most likely an npc null system and you think this defines the entire experience in nulldo you seriously believe the rest of us have no experience with which to compare these claims and see them for the novelty event it really isor maybe you expect us to think you reliably find that many fools in exhumers operating without a clue anything is possible but shooting fish in a barrel sounds more challenging than beating someone in a defenseless shiphow your alleged target got the isk together and moved into null and then promptly forgot how to not get killed in eve thats the real mysteryexpecting this as a normal play experience is not sustainable precisely because your targets existence the way you described it is not self sustainingupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
when i set personal standing if i add the person as a contact i can open their character sheets and put some notes in there this is great feature to remember things about people be nice if i didnt have to add them all as contacts thoughhowever i dont see a way to do this corpwide can you please a notes box when setting corp also alliance standing so i can add notes when setting standings and my corpmates can see why a certain person  corporation  alliance is set to whatever standing was chosenthank you
to this end i can say this i have on two separate occasions been caught in a belt in null in my hulk the sb solo could not break my tank nor could i his as his first bomb took my drones first timesecond time he was able to take range from my drones but still unable to break my tank every other occasion a cyno was litin both occurrences neither party had a reasonable chance of success i have not on this toon caught a bs ratting in my sb and soloed him into structure his friends showed and saved him however they did not catch me either while the exchange was fun in reality neither of us had a reasonable chance of success that is all i have to say about that seraph you know as well as i that sb are effective in pvp in a group solo and with threat of force projection that current mechanics allow for a cloaked vessel can be and is abused i realize there is no possible outcome that will make everyone happy i am seeking solutions that help encourage active game play and allow a balance that will be better for both sides encouraging an engagement with a fruitful outcome
hey i want to chime in with two cents hereregardless of whether youre on one side and feel you shouldnt have to worry about whether someone is actually at the keyboard or not or on the other side and feel that people who dont come out when theres a neutral in system are cowards or any of the positions that are similar or fall somewhere in between heres the factswhen someone is afk cloaking theyre probably off playing another game by nature theyre encouraged to do so since just sitting in a system waiting for someone to maybe come out is rather boringwhen someone is afk cloaking in a system the natural reaction of the inhabitants is to treat him with caution and never assume he really is afk that in turn causes the player or players living there to be more likely to log off and go do something else whether this is a reasonable choice or the choice of a coward or whatever is utterly irrelevant as it is a factin other words what we have with all the mechanics surrounding afk cloaking is a game system that regardless of design intent is causing people to log out of eve and go play other gamesnow how ing stupid is thatso i believe there should absolutely be a way to harass ratters miners people out doing pve in space and ways to catch and kill the unwary conversely i believe that those who are wary and vigilant should be difficult to catch i believe that means should be available to simultaneously encourage a pve pilot to stay on field and fight instead of flee and reward them for choosing to do sopunish them for fleeing the ess is a pretty decent example of this unfortunately as it stands the definition of wary is far too low thanks to how local works note simply removing it is not the solution theres little in the way to encourage someone to choose to stand and fight and even if they do the nature of eve pve tends to require specialized fits that do not hold up well in pvp making that choice a death sentence address those things with a revamp to local  intel gathering more reasons to stand and fight and a pve revamp to bring pvp and pve closer together and youre most of the way there finish it off by adding some means of hunting down cloaked ships balanced such that those that are active and wary the same requirement were imposing on ratters can evade detection but the unwary or afk die in a fire and weve got a solved problemsimple right
you have grasped the exact premise of this thread it makes me happy that an active member of the csm has chimed in and recognized the issue any changes that will encourage active game play over afk or logging out is a must in this thread various contributors have put forth several various solutions all three of the main contributors have in their own ways brought to the point that no one single change will help or balance the issue some of the proposed changes found in the last published csm minutes go along way towards this the only thing i personally have found lacking is the addition of an alternative action based intel gathering system even with delayed local both sides need better intel of who is in what ship where or if there is even a ship thank you for listening and i hope that you will continue to input hereps the above statement in no way intends to or changes how i feel about goons as a whole in keeping tabs on the csm i believe that mynnna has put the needs of the game before the needs of the goons  at least i hope so 
simpleif only this was the casewe actually have a significant number voicing the opinion that the blue donuts very existence should preclude any need to do more than man a gate camp and possibly anchor a cyno jammeronce these are done they seem to effectively want very dull pve play where mining and ratting are immune from sustained threat short of a massive sov claiming fleeti understand many players view pve as the necessary evil to be overcome so they can do other things in eve that are not self sustaining with isk for thembut i find their desire to keep their perceived timesink to a minimum is actually dumbing down what i want to enjoy about the game clever play in ships not requiring massive hordes to operate withmining and equally ratting are valid primary play interests and deserve interesting interaction mechanicsthis game can be the antiwow and make the perceived grinding of other games into so much more than somnolent drudgeryupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
yes this is a miner i can support this mechanic must work both ways though just to be fair
i also love that quit corporation is conveniently next to leave fleet button and not first time flying drunk that ive mixed the two 
no way absolutely no as said its a resume or a rap sheet pick who you associate with carefully and for some its a badge of pride and identity
stealth bombers are tech 2 frigate size ships therefore should have a specialized rolea they already have very good torpedo bonuses that can deal with battleships and battlecruisers 4  bonuses torpedo explosion velocity flight time torpedo velocity and damagewhy do they need an extra weapon to kill battleshipscruisers bombs with an explosion radius of 400 and 3000 velocityb bombs should not be a weapon to clear of drones incl fighters  fighter bombers of the grid because this makes stealth bombers overspecialized they also have the ability to fit covert ops with 100 targeting delay after decloaking and can use covert ops cynosi propose that stealth bombers should be rebalanced asap and that bombs should be used to counter capital ship hulls onlyand have the stats on bombs reversed 3000 explosion radius and 400 velocity with covert ops level bonus to velocity and damage
first and nothe bombs are being used in a way they are allowed in the midst of those drones are generally ships you want to limit bombs to capships but the torpedoes are fine for other ships how you you put the bombs to a oh its not a cap ship so im not going to do anything  bombs are already limited by being used in null sec only and ive watched bombers bar take ojtf frigates with nothing but torpedoes
bombs were explicitly introduced to counter very large groups of subcaps
yes bombs were introduced in revelation expansion november 2006 adding a way to deal with close concentrations of ships and pi was explicitly introduced to create industrial colonies on just about any planet in the eve universe doesnt mean it should be re approached by ccp is the csm8 happy with the current iteration of bombs then or could you please give your opinion on my two points 
yes

i had another suggestion brought to me in game i think there are both pros and cons to it anchorable module  similar mechanics to i hub it can be upgraded with different modules lore module is similar to concord technology used to monitor criminal activity by capsuleers 10  08 owned by empire faction and would be at max level0706 owned by empire faction but not fully maxed  ship types cloaked vessels excludedconcord can already see cloaked vessels 05  01 owned by empire faction but upgradeable by capsulers destructible with faction standing loss00  10 anchorable by capsuleer organization with sov only destructiblenpc null space by npc faction and is upgradable destructible with faction standing lossui  works with auto scan d scan and probe scan in addition to whats already in place could be an additional tabthis module opens a system scan depending on upgrades from instant scans to 5 min delayed scan of pilot beacons in systemupgraded to include ship types dependent on level of sov and upgrade affect accuracy and update timeupgrade to include cloaked vessel type only dependant on level of sov and upgrade affect accuracy and update time upgrade to include boost to combat scan probe of a faction variant that will allow location of cloaked vessels within 100 km  15 kmaccuracy affected by level of upgrade and level of sovthis is the general idea i think it has merit but i know it also has drawbacks so far it is the most balanced idea i have been presented with i ask you all for your opinions
null to me is about pure effortbecause null has two very distinct sides to play i would split the intel along these lines as wellbasing intel off of one side and letting the other be unable to respond with its own level ends up favoring one direction in a manner which hurts gameplay i feelyou could call one side strategic and have it relate to massive fleet actionsyou could call the other side tactical and have it relate to small group operationsboth need to be vulnerable to their level of activity effectively meaning tactical would be vulnerable to everything but also be the easiest to establish or restore once losti made a system like this already which i am happy to repost here if desired its not too long compared to many othersupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
agreed i think the intention was that once in place the system would work for all pilots regardless of if they lived there or not nikk i like you idea as well please repost and give comparisons they are similar in goal but use different methods to get there

no offense but your word means literally nothing to me because1 youre using an alt name i can claim i fly titans using an alt even though i havent ever touched one2 you talk about 50 km range which means you efted up a poorly skilled bomber or youre using rage torps for something other than structures which again shows your inexperience flying bombers3 mining ships are actually pretty sturdy and dont die like kindling on a roaring flame to solo bombersim sorry but theres zero credibility here neither are your arguments good in and by themselves finding a target is one thing finding a proper target is entirely different and what about the 00 systems that are 2030 jumps in from empire you want to limit the range of access to bombers too because if people cant leave their bombers out in space theyll need to make a trip back as well you simply want to have your little theme park corner and are using fake credentials to talk about how you want pvp to be more challengingobligatory post with your mainnomynna while you have experience in eve it seems to be limited more so to the industrialeconomic side of things and thats great we need those things but you proposed things in the past that limit the little guy when fighting the bigger enemy for obvious reasons imo your last notable that i remember proposal was concerning the siphon units and oh how terrible it is that now people that own poses sucking billions out of moons might have to undock a ship and pop a siphon or twoin any case you base your argument off of two weak assumptions1 the cloaky afker is off playing another video game you have no way of knowing that this is just opinion2 likewise the cloaky afker makes other people go afk and play other gamesin this manner you frame the argument as if cloaking in its current form is bad for the game as a whole and this might work into scaring ccp to do something but im not sure were as inclined to follow through with the fallacy all you did was propose a weak and vague something needs to be done there is a solution but the ratters here seem bothered by it which exposes their line of argument better than anything else that solution is to remove the cloaked ship from local no more dreaded are they there are they not scenario you dont know and thats that ah but thats a problem isnt it because now you have to actually fit your pve ship as a pvp ship well there you go mynna this also brings pvp and pve more in line with one another and its all done via a simple patch

if it is done correctly and an intel system is put into place which both rewards effort and allows for human failing then it could be a really good thingespecially if one of the rewarded efforts is to gain knowledge of a ship which would otherwise go unseenthe ability to hunt cloaked objects as such only feels balanced when not being told when to look by a free and automatic sourcei dont want the game playing itself for me especially when dealing with aspects i feel favor my strengths as a player such as attention to detailupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
it fits perfectlyyour history is the consequences of the risk you take by trying to infiltrate a corporation or allianceyes and the risk is adding a male donkey to your group and having also having your organisations name listed in the corp history of the equidae in questionthey are by getting a boost in recognition amongst their kin possibly some tears and by having their actions verifiable by people who bothers to read the corporate history and contacting previous corpies or plain using googleevery person that youve had any market transaction with is listed in your journal together with its employment history
noactually yes please take away the one final thing that boat is passably decent at
watthis actually means no and what the hell at the same timedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
the torp bonuses are irrelevent to the bombing mechanics i am quite happy with the basic concept of bombs as a counter to large groups of subcaps although i do think that currently its a little too easy for them to keep bcs and bs off the field but thats a gameplay tweak issue rather than a mechanics reform issuecurrently the counters to caps are 1 supercaps 2 large concentrations of subcaps 3 specially fitted fleets with lots of capwar
thank you for your answer malcanis much appreciated to hear itstealth bombers remains a ship that can do a lot for its tech 2 level and sizeand for bombs i am curious what ccp will do to make bcbs medium size fleets possibility i roamed in interceptors before the latest vamp for 6 months in null because of bombs and bubblesand i used to fly specially fitted ships to drain the capacitor of caps because of the docking games in losecstill my proposal is my personal view ans sb and bombs and i hope it will looked at by ccp before the summer
i quite like the idea of a slow extrahigh explosion radius high damage bomb that would be basically ineffective vs subcaps say 3060 second flight time before exploding 2000m explosion radius so only 2025 damage against even bs if theyre not mwding
when i propose that stealth bombers should be rebalanced asap and that bombs should be used to counter capital ship hulls only and have the stats on bombs reversed 3000 explosion radius and 400 velocity with covert ops level bonus to velocity and damagethis include jump freighters and rorquals and all other capital hulls ofc to because of their signature size and ship velocity
well im sorry but youre not likely to find much support for that aspect of your proposal
i dont see what is so unbalanced about bombers in the current environment can you please elaborate that detail i find bombers very well balanced already
the rebalance is a word used to describe ccps program to look at all ships in eve online and tweak or change statistics  ship bonuses under the guidance of ccp fozzie and later on ccp rise
im pretty sure you can add labels to corp contacts
came across this thread by accident  great idea that i fully supporti cannot believe that ccp has left this idea to gather dust the way it hasi must admit that when i first started i flew through the early  ended up bypassing the later tutorial missions  all i wanted to do then was get out  shoot stuff i am not sure if this particular mission was on offer or notwhen i started some more characters down the track i actually did the tutorial type missions the soe epic arc  some other missions event  even though i breezed through these i did learn a lot about the lore of eve  actually grew to appreciate the game even more i gather thats the thrust of your proposalgiven proper rewards  incentives more people would no doubt do these missions  quite possibly understand the game better  even stick aroundkeep up the fight
skymarshallerthank you for showing support for this proposal and especially for the words of wisdom and encouragementdmc
you had any respect for him in the first place seriously though his is the kind of shallow uselessly flippant answer that you see all over this discussion every bit as bad as i should be able to instantly decloak the cloaker or make cloaks use fuel or some such garbage just from the opposite direction
yes i respect him i think that he writes very good articles on en24 and have told him soi certainly do not agree with the use of fuel nor do i think that there should be an easy way to decloak the camper i just hope that ccp has more dcs for ahem cloaky afk campers which may actually be what is happeningi have hunted cloaky campers a lot since i started playing i have also been camped quite a lot my first sov 00 alliance was sas and when i arrived in b7 there was some very effective stealth bombers run by test in the system it was me who setup a group of people who went after them in covert ops ever since that time i have hunted campers and pushed people to operate regardless of them in fact my latest kill on my second account is a fail afk cloaky camper which i manipulated over a period of time so that he had a vulnerability so that i could kill him seraphs suggestion would prevent me from having any chance of getting them its difficult enough as it is especially in terms of those that just do area denial this loser i killed was in fact doing area denial and smack and the smack part was his failureyou can interact with cloaky campers with the current mechanics its basically a case of forcing them to interact with you by using your system regardless then you may lose a ship but you will then get intel and if you are clever you can also get a kill or twoi dont like the way that they actually force people not to play eve but apart from that i like it as it isi have some suggestions forced dc after a period of inactivity or the very specialised probes requiring max skills and implants to get a fix within 20 km but even that one i dont like as a cloaked ship should be cloaked another alternative is to have the cloak ship blinded by reduced dscan abilities but the current system enables a certain amount of cat and mouse play if you are dealing with someone who really is a hunteri understand that ccp is looking at alternatives to local ccp has to understand that space needs to be vast so all this other intel like npcs killed people in system etc will have to go too if local is removed i could live without local if the hunters had to really hunt instead of opening up the map and saying ooooh npc kills in system xyz goes there and wham bang gets a easy killanyway i get the feeling that you have a balanced view of the issues which i like so good luck in working out the right balance on this issue from what you said its good to see that ccp see the issue around people not playing because of it though in reality if people do not have alternatives then they have failed in terms of strategic thinking for example the most stupid thing a renter can do is rent a single very high truespace sov system that has to be the most crass decision anyone can make blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i mean if people are going to complain about seeing the enemy in local there you go remove them from local i have no issue with the current mechanic but you have individuals that simply want a theme park adventure version of eve cloaky warfare more than anything allows small groups to affect bigger groups and limiting that gameplay lends eve to be an even more grotesque version of itself where if you are in 00 you have the choice to be aligned with the cfc or n3pl the individuals that espouse a way to nerf cloaking are people that value their own personal ratting industry and moon mining rather than pvp gameplaycloaked ships are balanced by their gank vs tank capabilities no tank all gank and most of the criticisms leveled against cov ops can be leveled more broadly over cyno gameplay over all eve is not a game where you can dive 15 jumps into 00 in a non cloaky ship and watch for the time to strike its a game that requires patience proper planning and some form of instinct some are incapable to comprehend that hence threads like thisi suppose its easier to insult me rather than address the fact that your argument is terrible
no bears have already gotten standings to disappear from public view employment history is here to stay
the fundamental purpose of the rebalance program is to address imbalances within the current ship classes youre hurry up and do it now tone implies they in desperate need of attention however this is not something ive experienced ive taken on sb fleets in frigates and had lots of fun ive fc large roams of frigate and dessie gangs having to fight around hostile bombers trying to wipe out my fleets ive used bomber groups to destroy ships in groups at the end of the day they are not easy to coordinate have a limited blast potential and really are a unique playstyle i think they are in a great place and am curious why you feel they are in desperate need of rebalance
people are not complaining about seeing an enemy in local they are complaining about not being able to interact with them of course that depends on the intentions of the camper i have an area denial and a smack talker at the moment smack being more important to him because he was in a t1 frigate with only a cloak fitted so when we ignored him and operated in the system to make a point he put up mobile depots with his smack on this enabled me to interact with him so i started reinforcing his mobile depots and he would pick them up and put them down again i was out there watching him with two toons cloaked up i timed his movements as well and he had a pattern so it was a simple matter to exploit that one dead t1 frigatenow imagine that being a toon linked to pl there would be no chance of interaction until they dropped on something and their level of escalation is way above anything that i could apply against them i cannot interact with that person until he drops a large blops fleet on me you say planning those pl players may have multiple accounts and have blanketed an area with their cyno toons so in reality its not planning or skill or anything like that its just waiting until someone wants to play the game then bang one dead playera stealth bomber is as you say gank and no tank in the past i have exploited that those excellent test sbs that were in b7 in late 2010 they were killing ratters there was three of them so i got a corp mate to go out in a apoc and had 3 covert ops cloaked up around him we got two of them the fun part is that they escalated by bringing in a cloaked vagabond to stop us doing that so we killed the vaga it was fun they were playing the game and they had my respectwhere i am now we have a large number of russian players who just leave a arazu or a legion in a system hoping that someone would think them afk and then drop a load of blops on them so people like me move systems it does not work on me and the people that listen to our advice having local means i can see them come in system to afk cloak camp me so i wait a bit then go to another system after about an hour or two they come in system and its rinse and repeatdont fall down to the level of the gank bears in terms of flippant comments i have the same contempt for whining idiots that put all their ratting eggs in one basket just as much as i have contempt for those doing blanket area denial afk cloaky camping in the hope that someone thinks them afk with the current level of force projection removal of local would be a disaster for evein the majority of cases eve pvp is simply getting the drop on the enemy to be blunt the cloaky afk camping is the most lazy way of doing itone of my corp mates was operating in bombers bar fleets sadly he has now left eve for good but i noticed one thing about most of the kills he was on they were in providence doesnt that say something about where bombers bar had to operate to get people who were operating in such a way that they were actually in space doing stuff a lot of people slag off providence residents but they were playing the game and they were being camped to hell because of itfact is that the only thing that ccp should do is have a automatic log off for people being inactive for more than say 4 hours to be honest just recently i seem to get a lot more dcs then i used to and i have been wondering if this is deliberate policy by ccp if so i welcome it blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
but to extent that choice of the cloaky ship of not interacting or rather when to interact is its advantage vs the locals who often out number the new comer and have a variety of options on what ships they can fly that pl or whoever can drop 50 redeemers on a single target is an issue all together separate from the one being discussed
you manage to get this far only by refusing to acknowledge that this line perfectly describes both sides involvedyou dont balance a game by selecting only one side for non consensual interactionthat shifts the balance and preselects the winner for encounters being involvedyou either choose both or none right now we have none selected for thisupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
seraphagreed however you do seem to miss the main point of this thread i nor my compatriots are looking for a theme park eve if i wanted that i would be playing wow dota ii or some other stupid whimsical theme park game we also believe that the little guy should have mechanics to affect larger ones i know you are a blops pilot and run fleets for that value and desire your input on the ideas being brought forth to ensure that what is suggested does not limit or is not adaptable to pilots such as yourself i have already listed several facts that solo covert ops do not have sufficient gank to do really shite against someone who is prepared and alert if the miner  ratter is afk by all means gank him i just believe the same should be true of the cloaked pilot i believe the cloaky camper should be active in game with his patience planning and cunning instead of playing candy crush while he waits for someone to be stupid while it is not your game play it does affect a lot of others and does cause many individuals to log out and play other stuff that brings the part of force projection and yes that is covered in this thread as well i have repeated myself many times reiterating the basis of this thread let me spell it out one more time as i realize you are very busy this thread is not about nerfing active cloaked pilotscan you read that please give meaningful explanations of pros and cons of the ideas suggested thank you
at the moment i am interacting with the tard who is camping my base system i manipulated him into giving himself a vulnerability which i exploited to get a kill and now i am ignoring both him and his mobile depots i know when he is active and when he is not now he is losing the will to log in his camping toon aaaah the shame of it this guy is easy but not southern federation who are now back in the area they however are fail because they use known to me campers but part of their game is really area denial i can move and set traps for them on gates and will do that i make them have to be active to impact me but what do i do if swamped in all 12 systems i can use by multiple cloaky campers that i cannot work out their active times and i know are backed up by an escalation capacity beyond what i can do simple i head back to hisec or go to another npc regionrenting to me is a fools game and the most foolish thing you can do is rent a system which is very good truesec and not have alternatives so at that point they are in trouble while i have some sympathy that such lame tactics are used against them they are the creators of their own downfall by their strategic failure at this point it seems that every man and his dog can do blops so while in b7 in 201011 we were camped it was not all the time now the best systems get camped nearly if not all the timenow the people who i had discussions on this subject before went on about having to do it because they could not catch anything well if they cannot catch anything with the interceptors how lame are they now as players its not about catching anything its about doing something that has no effortfor a long time now i have thought that the only answer has to be dcing toons that have no activity for a certain period of time at least that will make people have to be active i think 4 hours is a good number personally but other will disagree blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
dracvlad i do value your inputthere has been earlier in this thread discussion about dcing non active pilots this is the same as kicking no active players the valid argument is you should do the same to those in a pos shield those who are docked also the mouse wiggler macro was introduced to by pass such a mechanic in all fairness and i have to admit as i once was a strong promoter of this idea this would not be fair or in the best interest of ccp the way the game works and the fact that many many subscribers and plexers use multiple accounts for things beyond the scope in this thread from markets to building shipping and intel gathering to market scraping would be affected by this the two alternatives are to start allowing macros and bots never a good idea for game stability improvement and release of the crest api tools still there are many negative impacts this would have on the game how to tell if someone is at keyboard working another toon or notis that ship being piloted or is it just a random direction changeswhat timeframe is the definition of afkin a recent discussion via a support ticket a gm who brought in a dev to comment stated thank you we do not kick people of the server for being suspected of botting if a person is suspected of botting the person will simply get a temporary ban pending an investigation immediately up on loging back in the person would receive the message that the account had been banned you can find more information on this in the dev blog linked below
very simple the extreme safe nature of nullsec space with its stations and poses require us to be able to afk cloak because any time we enter in local most players dock up or hit a pos and then they go play candycrush i dont afk cloak because i want to go afk i do it because local gives too much intel for the defenders nobody gets a bomber and says you know what would be fun going afk in space for 72 hours yeah id love to do that its something that we need to do in order to hit our target which has most of the advantages of the home teamthe issue with you and dracvlad likewise bring up is the issue of numbers no you cant do anything about 15 deemers dropping on your hulk but the way that cov ops ship scale vs t1 counter parts is a risk equation which balances the entire interactiona 1 mil t1 frig will wreck a bomber likewise a t1 battleship will destroy its blops counter part at a fraction of the cost so here you have the cloaky ships which have freedom of mobility but at a high cost and the defensive force that has the home field advantage and can fight lose the battle but still win the war
on this part we are in agreement as to local however removing local without some kind of intel would be too one sided i firmly believe that you should not have to go afk to get results i think you should be able to slip into a system and have a reasonable chance to catch and defeat and equal counter i do believe that a fight between a tii frigate and a tii exhumer or t1 bs should come down to skill set fit and tactics i also believe your intended target should also have the same reasonable chance to escape or win a fight please do not lump in with dracvlad on the numbers game he and i have two different viewpoints on that front i am in agreement with you on the subject of numbers in the context you put in the above quote agreed however you and everyone else knows the only place you get an exact match is in high sec with a dual as i stated above it should come down to skill fit a skill in itself and tactics to me this includes knowing your area living somewhere should give you some advantage not total advantage as it is now1 there should be a reasonable chance for both sides for success2 all mechanics should encourage active gameplay current cloaking mechanics do not meet the above parameters what would you suggest to make it work within them
well an industrial ship shouldnt have pvp capabilities to any reasonable extent if the presence of someone in local causes the defender to dock up prompting the attacker to afk cloak to try to get that interaction its pretty simple to see that local is an issue you cant limit the afk cloakers ability to remain in system either though killing in a bomber takes patience maybe i get in system on monday i have to go on a trip tuesday i get home wednesday and id like not to have to jump 30 jumps back and forth for that when the defender can simply dock upreally i think the defender has the issue that they somehow simply expect to be able to be out in space in mining ships and that should be enough effort to keep themselves safe in essence the suggestion would be defend yourself get pvp ships to protect you however this isnt a fun activity for the defender if we dont want afk cloakers to cause the defenders to log off we have to remove local however defenders dont like this as they get no intelwell how about this when you cloak up you dont show up on local but at the same time you the cloaky ship doesnt see anyone else in local either just like a submarine descending your knowledge is limited to particular instruments as well
the only real solution from my perspective straddling both sides is to remove the incentive to fleethe only way to do this is to offer survival and possible reward to those who would otherwise run awaywe are not talking about pvp focused ships on either side those hostile pvp ships were stopped by the friendly pvp ships already and are out of the picturewe are talking about the ships which have discretion over their detection just like the current pve ships effectively havehot drops take those off the table for now as something resolved and no longer involved this presumes a degree of expectation needed on both sides which hot dropping betrayseach side makes itself pretty for the other by not appearing as an overwhelming target whether that means having similar numbers everyone is in a positive frame of mind concerning who will win a fightthis means the mining  pve ships must be able to fight on the same level as the expected covert craftthey can pay for this and avoid being used in regular combat service by being horrible at traveling but we have no realistic expectation of encounters so long as one side tries to always avoid itupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
seraph in terms of the blops i was working out a plan to go after what could be between 2 to 7 blops so i picked the brain of a exburn eden player who laid out to me just how tough well fitted blops are while not everyone is as fanatical or as skilled as burn eden i would say that stain empire one of my targets is not far off of them the ehp he detailed to me was just to heavy for what i thought we could have on field at the notice required of course these were extreme fits with specific implant sets but you have to plan for that level so i dont really agree with your point on a t1 bs killing a blops easily it depends on a number of factors who is using them home field advantage every single blops drop i have seen ended very quickly and all the attackers off field before anyone could muster a reaction home field advantage is meaningless in terms of a well executed blops dropwhen pl was dropping fleets of blops into goon areas the goons really struggled to catch them that they did in the end is testement to the organisation of the goons however the goon fc who i spoke to was for an extended period very frustrated over the inability to catch even one but your right here as once they caught them pl stopped doing itthe stain empire group i was looking at actually drop a fair number of widows and that really does cause issues in getting hold of them in terms of the reaction forces its easy when you have a mass of interceptors but one or two will get jammed out simple as blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
sorry wont work because there is all that lovely map information in the eve client and on dotlan they do not need local blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
well of course fittings matter but line up 10 blops battleships vs 10 t1 battleships with similar fittings and the latter group should win even if they dont hold the field exchanging 1 for 1 losses or even 2 for 1 will make it costly for the attacker in the end as you yourself stated you need to make it costly for the attacker and they will stop so you have an equivalent to local that is that exact up to date and convenient i dont think so
but they wont be similar fittings and implants and in any case its very difficult to get the bs on top of them very difficultit does not need to be now if you said that the claoked ships dscanner and theri probe scanner did not work either then you might be getting there which is something i mentioned earlier in this thread but would you have a delay on these systems coming online after decloaking after all with the map info they will know that someone is active wouldnt theyon balance when i went through this sort of thing before i thought the better option was to leave as it is it would start having massive impacts in terms of lag as it was another test that the server had to process so in the end not possible and when i say that you do know why they removed the secondary affect of active shield and armour modules when they were neuted out it was because they had to check the status of the cap before applying damage now work that back checking each ship have they got a cloak and if so are they cloaked people can change their fits with mobile depots or next to a carrier fleet you have to cater for this sort of thing nah its too messy blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
well you are right it wont be similar fittings the t1 bs fits will be more dps and tank orientedusing dotlan is no where similar to using local as an intel tool they just dont compare the point is moot
i see your point on their behaviour towards botters they do not kick them from the server so that kills that then the mouse wiggle thing i disagree with its passing active commands which could have been the test but in effect if that is their policy for botters they will not do that for suspected afkrs interesting post on the socket closed its amusing but i have noticed quite a few campers losing connections recently blind luck then oh well blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i sat down with the exburn eden guy and went into details with the fittings and implants and i cannot get anywhere near that tank its no competition but i am not going to detail the fits eitherso you dont think that a cloaked up ship not showing in local knowing someone is active in system while the ratter does not know he has a cloaker is balanced now of course he could sit down and do head counts every so often on that map data but that is really more of a hit and miss affair then what the cloaker has to deal with dotlan npc kklls delta we know how many in space how many in system so he would have to check the stations and ask people and in any case many of his own people may be cloaked so its a really bad ideaand you ignored the lag impact comment too blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
that free map data while something i agree gives out more than it should also takes less to reduce to insignificancesimply make the updates once every 24 hours and noone will know enough to target a system beyond a general sense of use in one or possibly more time zonesas to removing intel from cloaked ships no not the way you described above at leasti actually have an entire thread dedicated to my answer for local in my signaturei have another thread detailing intel gathering mechanics that i feel more than make up for what i would removeit basically involves making dscan more intuitive with some tweaks it costs cloaked ships a meaningful price too

if you are out of town and logged off that is not considered and afk cloak as you are not in game however if you are remaining cloaked and in game for the length of two days whilst not at home effectively from down time to down time this is afk play so which is it this thread is not considering logged off cloaked pilots any more than logged off scouts i have no issue with that however if you are gone and do not have a laptop or other access to computer and are gone from home how would you stay logged in from down time to down time without using a bot against the ulaagreed this is what we are trying to change to some extent in the extent of a pve ship or miner i was not intending the miner to be pvp fit or capable at a level of taking on a pvp ship however i do think that a well tanked exhumer with reasonable fit for mineral extraction should be able to use its defensive capabilities to a reasonable extent to succeed in killing an aggressing cov ops ship on the same note a cove ops ship should have reasonable capability to solo and exhumer i have and i am sure you have as well several encounters where a solo or 4 man cov ops gang could not take down a well tanked exhumer on the same hand i have been in the well tanked exhumer and unable to catch the aggressors who kept me from fleeing but could not break my tank this is part of the issue this is the basis of most of the ideas we have been putting forth in an earlier post in this thread that is the cat and mouse game i am looking for subs are deadly but can be found and identified both sides have a reasonable chance

i agree with this mostly suggestion 1 or 3 on the condition that missiles also gain similar benefits from tracking enhancers and tracking computers
yeah i could see the same scripts that i just talked about being introduced with reverse effects for tracking computers good idea

o csm8 and 9 nomineesafter the summer expansion moving compressed ore about in new eden will be more important then beforemaking compressed ore is done with a rorqual and is a nice mini career within eve but can not be done in hisecafter the summer expansion i honestly suspect that the demand will go up a lot for compressed ore could the csm please ask internally and behind the nda wall to look at the numbersperhaps this is an excellent opportunity for ccp with the help of the csm to introduce a personal deployable structure that can use blueprints regards a freelancerps i have the feeling that ccp tells nobody not even the csm any numbers related to how much minerals are brought into the game by miners but this is a question about mineral compressed ore being shipped around new eden
the medium intensive refinery is being turned into a compression array these will be deployable at all poss and provides a highsec means to compress ore your suggestion a personal deployable compressor will eliminate the entire purpose of the above module  it is deployable anywhere like directly in trade hubs  it doesnt require fuel  it doesnt require being in a player corp with pos roles essentially it has all of the benefits without the drawbacks this is unacceptable and id ask what drawbacks could we find to give your personal compressor to balance it perhaps the combination of the below will bring it into balance  compression time is lengthy perhaps unlimited compression jobs but each job takes 2 hrs to complete  freely engageable by anyone like the mobile tractor unit  limited bay size to limit how many jobs it may run
i can imagine a miner or two in hulks unloading into the mobile structure as they mine which is then stolen from or attacked by a highsec pirate
thank you for pointing out why it must be attackable by everyone if it wasnt miners would use it as deployable storage facilities that also compress ore while mining i cant wait for the tears this could generate
i meant it more as this may generate gameplay i think its neat
thanks for the info however till ccp fixes pos deployables could be the way to goi will let ccp decide with feedback from the csm and later on perhaps the community what drawbacks a personal deployable structure should have that can use blueprints
gotta let the tears subside a bit so that when the next one lands it starts anew as strong as before deliver too much too fast and you just go into shock and well thats just no fun now is it
well i wouldnt recommend bots obviously but i think having the game on and not being there is completely legitimate my guys do it often
hah so people want anti afk cloakingthe presumption leans towards anticloak with concerns over protecting cruiser  exhumer sized craftthe answer is low yield old school doomsday devicelogic most cloaking craft are frigates or cruisers none of them can engage an active tank while cloakedanchor a pos or system wide upgrade that deals 200 points per cycle of em damage 1 minute cycle timeacross the entire systemnothing cloaked could remain very long but local residents could tank vs em and use active or passive recovery to make up the differenceit would make ratting more interesting too causing the rats to burn out if ignored on their ownupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
no kill id found the few i did find did not have what i consider a decent tank in fact most did not have many tank modules at all or what they did have was not sufficient as such deserved what they got ok cat out of the bag while i cannot go into details i am former usn and a sonar tech who did anti sub warfare yes i could find and pinpoint location of subs and did so on a regular basis since it was not war at the time we did not blow any up however there exists many tools besides mines and depth charges to do so and my knowledge is from over 20 years ago however this is a game where the technology is very advanced past what we have in the real world so i am confident it would not be too hard to find and achieve a missile lock on passive emissions from a cloaked ship difficult yes impossible no shooting in the dark would be nice too if we could passively see a distortion in the star field current mechanics do not allow for that as to your first statement i agree that getting up to go to the head or to go fix a sandwich should not be worried about as far as afk or not however someone who is able to log on whilst doing something else becomes a non active participant a non active participant should not be able to affect the gameplay of an active participantso in this you and i have a large difference in opinion
this more or less if you want to sell something to your corporationalliance put up a contract all the major nullsec alliances do this all the time so feel free to take advantage of the functionality yourself
like many others i assume i buy and fit many ships many the sameauto buy from local market and auto fit based on your ship fittings feature pleaseneed i say more dont tell me you wouldnt love this
friends of mine make quite a bit by selling fitted ships and id hate to see them driven out of business
while there could be an interesting niche for a deployable like what youre talking about it should be to fill a niche not replace the pos module the compression array is perfectly serviceable and actually downright good as far as things you do with a pos go and it doesnt really need to be replaced in fact depending on the reason youre compressing in the first place its arguably better than a rorqual given the size of its cargo bay
bombers are fine  they can perform a selection of very specific roles have a relatively poor engagement profile on their own and add an extra dimension to fleet combat
thats because battlecruisers are in a really crappy place of balance when large scale is taken into account they have a bloated sig radius and in general insufficient tank to make up for ittheir entire class needs reworked
subs could definitely be pinpointed quite easily passive and active sonar are very effective against submarines and have been since about 194142 that would be why such a large number of naval vessels and aircraft as well as lines of underwater listening stations are part of most large countries antisubmarine warfare doctrinesthere are also mad which are devices usually on airborne assets that can detect submerged metallic anamolies theyve been around since ww2 afaik
its plane and simple a cloak should use a fuel and have a time limit its that simple there is a counter for everything in eve but this at the very least you should be able to probe them down will a third tear of probes
and what will you tell the wormhole players thats the really funny part about most of these suggestions is that they would basically ruin life in wormholes but that doesnt matter because a red in local gives you the badfeelz
you are assuming that afk play is either unintended or not balancedmaybe you would not word it this way but the result of your change would reflect this view more than any otheri must point out that holding sov grants limited but significant leverage not ownership of the space itself1 you have the ability to control access to all the outposts this is huge since players cannot mount combat operations without a staging area to launch them from2 you have already defined the ability to remove non friendly pos locations denying even their limited staging abilitythese two points force hostile players to travel from their staging areas or carry everything with them with risk of exposurewhen they need to travel to where you are you have the leverage to place combat forces at the bottlenecks needed by the majority of fighting craft blocking them convenient accessyour alliance is never relieved of duty in needing to prevent access by those who would shoot at youthe entire existence of jump drives as well as stealth cloaking is to bypass the gate camp bottlenecks so noone can be safe if someone is willing to make the extra effortits a game we dont want winners or the game endssummary blocking afk play as you suggested would result in the balance shifting towards sov holders by making access to their space harder to maintain by hostileswe dont want blob or gtfo game play and i feel this would push null in that directionupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i have never lived in wormwhole it does not fix the fact that it is a broken part of the game there is no way to counter it at all they need to make it to where you can probe down a cloaked ship our make it run on fuel bottom line you interrupting some one else game play for what ever reason witch i get but there should in turn be away to hunt you down and kill you it should work both ways you hard core vet that has 610 accounts can just leave a toon sit there all day

industrials and freighters invariably get bumped at stargates and then suicide ganked because they have loaded their holds with an inappropriate amount of valuable cargo unless you are unlucky it will be victims fault that they have been targeted the pilots that get involved in these activities are largely doing it to generate isk and will not gank you if you have not knowlingly turned yourself into a loot piUFFFData regarding bumping of miners it is a legitimate activity to use in roleplay scenarios to extort or ransom to obtain isk or to protect business interests introducing suspect status as a punishment for bumping mining ships is not required as miners are protected enough if suspect status was introduced i reckon there is a more than fair chance it would not bring the result you think would happen
im not sure carebears asked for pilots standings with npc corps to be invisible personally i always found it interesting and useful for many reasons to be able to read other pilots standings with npc corporations i have a feeling ccp want to get rid of standings entirely and npc corporations as well i think it might be a good idea for capsuleers to only be able to be members of npc corporations for a limited time and not to be able to rejoin them afterwards but i wouldnt want to see that part of new eden npc corporations eliminated from the game entirely im afraid its a case of dumbing down of the game again  theyre gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out  rick  find out what   abraham  theyre screwing with the wrong people  rick season four  the walking dead

anytime you feel its more appropriate to use market instead of contracts for a public sale is the same situation youd want a corp market instead of corp contracts when selling to corp vov
i think your proposals numbered one and two are probably not good ideas as this would no doubt be exploited by the null sec entities that have taken over many of the poco in high sec regarding your third proposal i think there is something there that is interesting and i believe it would bring content for all parties although it would be a slow way of retrieving pi material from the planets so the benefit to yourself and others who wish to do planetary interaction in highsec would be minimal there is a seed of a great idea within your third proposal to add an additional method of pi material retrieval from planets an idea that would or could really link dust 514 with eve online and provide an industrial element to dust 514 it would take some thought but i think it would possibly form a full crossover expansion it would almost be a martin luther king moment not wishing to insult his achievements there or anything i nearly got excited then shortly after the introduction of pocos into high sec and after a dabble in poco ownership i got sick of the hassle and it caused corporation arguments we havent bothered with planetary interaction since then and i suspect many havent bothered with it again either we dont sadly have access to dr eyjos qens anymore so there is no concrete way for us assess the economy and in this case high sec pi usage so its hard to guage the situation we may go back to doing pi at some point but it would involve a lot of work to restart it now  theyre gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out UFFFDrick  find out what  UFFFDabraham  theyre screwing with the wrong people UFFFDrick season fourUFFFDUFFFD  the walking dead  
miner bumping is one of the few remaining methods to disrupt miners or regulate and control mining levels in systems nowadays when mining vessels were given their first iteration a while back ehp levels were increased drastically so it is much harder to suicide gank them now the current changes to mining vessels being proposed and likely to be introduced with give increased drone damage capability to some mining vessels to my mind it is starting to go too far the other way and miners are maybe being protected too much a good idea may be to not allow pilots to leave corporations once a wardec has been announced then maybe we can get a little more control back mining of asteroids need to be done on a sustainable basis you know
im not sure you have read the dev blog fully if the current proposal goes through ccp plans to get rid of blueprints there will be a new pos array that can compress ore in high sec systems or rather a recycling of another current pos array into the new one providing you have the anchoring skill you will be able to anchor a small pos anywhere in high sec and do compression while in a player run corp this is virtually like having a personal deployable structure actually i think personal deployable structures are littering space everywhere atm notably at jita and the trade routes leading out from there hopefully ccp can use the personal deployable structure computer coding to develop a new pos system soon then the current pos system can be trashed and the ability to just plonk personal deployables  particularly mtus can be limited or brought under some kind of control a two hour time limit on personal deployables would be best  theyre gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out UFFFDrick  find out what  UFFFDabraham  theyre screwing with the wrong people UFFFDrick season fourUFFFDUFFFD  the walking dead

interesting i would suggest you go back a few pages and read what nikk has been posting he merely suggests that your idea would create more imbalanced play than it would correct i agree with nikk in that you will find on those pages several suggestions that include a way to find cloaked vessels however i think we all wish for it to be balanced so that both sides have a reasonable chance to succeed in what they want to do this is of course should follow the rules laid out in one of my post in respect to afk game play please read up then make informed suggestions please keep in mind that we need balanced game play for all regardless of if we like how the other side plays
nice i wish there were more interaction like this also the other way as i was referring to exhumer kills agreedthis is a delicate matter as you stated there are many aspects of the game that allows for interaction while not at the computer on this i totally agree with you i think the problem lies in defining what is active game play communication and notifications out of game is a standard set by ccp eve gate for example however how much should a person not in game be allowed to affect someone who is in game for instance i get a notification that someone is hitting one of my towers im at work i cant leave but i can text a corp mate and have them go defend the pos while this communication allows me to defend my pos it does take time and eventually requires someone in game to react to the threat this is different than if i was in game when the pos was first attackedusing the above example both the out of game and ingame players have a means to interact with each other however if i am away from the game logged in afk cloaked and just sitting while i go to the store or in your case a three day trip i may not be able to attack anyone but i am still affecting the gameplay of active players as they have no way to tell if i am there or notin that respect i believe the active players should have a way to interact with me current mechanics do not allow that this is different than be getting into a system cloaking up then logging off for a few days and coming back logging in and then active camping that sort of thing i expect and i am ok with

everything you just said is wrongan afk cloaked player cannot harm anyone a player at his keyboard is hunting you 100 legitimatelyeither way there is no problem and it certainly is not a problem if some cowards cant bring themselves to undock with a neutral in local
while i agree with you what he said is wrong however what you said is just as wrong there is a problem if you are cloaked there is no way possible to tell if you are at keyboard or away from keyboard that is why most do not undock with a neut in local and it is not just because that one neut is in local that one can become many instantly herein lies one aspect of the problem instead of spouting you cowards why do you not suggest viable solutions to the issue that would encourage people to undockif you care to read many previous post we have many arguments good and bad on both sides of the issue with several propositions that would have merit you sir give appearance that you want easily defeated ships to undock under your guns so you can get easy kills if that is so you are looking for the theme park version of eve i hope it never comes to that most of us that have been regular posters to this thread are seeking more interaction and more challengeif i wanted easy kills i would be sitting off the undock in jita or many other gank places and pop red pods all dayi like the challenge of the fight win or lose i believe that both sides should have a reasonable chance of success
the key element of an mmo is player interactionthis fact stands alone as it is the defining element itself the secondary aspect would be lots as in lots of playersmassively multiplayer online gamei want more interaction with mining and as this is a game we are all paying to play i want it to be chosen willingly by both sidesthat means no forced evasion mechanic such as knowing you have no realistic expectation to survive an encounter with another playerexpecting to die in a fire is a strong incentive to avoid interaction so should be reexamined as contrary to good playcloaked craft expect this from pure pvp ships so avoid interacting with them if possiblepve craft expect this of cloaked and pure pvp ships so avoid interacting with either if possiblehere is the key pure pvp ships at gate camps and friendly allies are able to effectively block other pure pvp ships which have hostile intent assuming alliance being competent of coursethat leaves just the cloaked ships effectivelyblock hot dropping and raise the pve ships to the same level of fighting ability and encounters will happen much more oftenneither of these changes is demonstrated as gamebreaking so i see a real opportunity to improve play hereupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
pve ships can all fit a decent tank and tackle then they call their pvp friends or mains to finish the jobif pve ships could fit tank tackle and guns they would be pvp shipsmake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
dont need tackle and certainly dont need to be on the same level as pure pvp shipsyou are oversimplifying the comparison which leads to suggesting a false equivalencymining ships for starters are pvp ships just not combat ones for two reasons1 they lack fighting ability at a practical level2 they lack speed to avoid being too slow for patrols or roamsif they had conveniently available pvp friends no issue would existguarding miners is a novelty event for obvious reasonsi would like to see mining ships elevated in fighting ability to match the level of covert shipping i would like to see cynos require a spool up period during which no beacon would be activeput these details in and encounters between mining ships and the relatively present stealth hostiles will become interesting to both sidesnot the run or diaf scenario we currently havethis will make it more fun for both sides as well we are playing eve so we can fly space ships with and against each other after all is said and doneupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i see what you mean but mining ships able to take on a t3 cruiser seems too muchi admit not being familiar with blops dropping miners but couldnt the miners just have a noobship with a cyno standing by wouldnt a single carrier jumping in within 30 seconds or so be enough to keep them alive enough time for some other friends to join the partymake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
a t3 cruiser has no real comparison short of a battleship in many cases i would suggest this type of ship raises the effort to a special level which should not be taken lightlythat said it effectively needed the covert package to reach the miner in this contextthat makes it interesting enough to consider although i wonder if a stealthy covert t3 would feel safe against a combat rigged skiff assuming the skiff was competent to handle stealth shipping of other t2 varieties that could get past a gate campas to having a miner with a cyno handy if only it were that simplekeeping players on standby long enough to coordinate a hot drop with the expectation of action after a reasonable time period that is one thing entirelykeeping the equivalent number of players handy for a drop that is conditional on someone else effectively attacking under the right conditions has no real expectation that action will happen only that it might happenthat puts the second group of players in the same category as those who are present and watching over the pve players nice to imagine but too dull and boring for real players to waste time with normallyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
as it stands now most sov held nullsec is safer than highsec
i came across a post a while back that had a pretty cool idea about some added content it was building off of the current wormhole content nebula contentreading through the 2 short pages there was some good added ideas its something i think would help pull people of different professions together as added by loridiahaving a dangerous but limited access area with good rewards sounds interesting and fun avoids blobs and demands a balance of professions to succeedwe need something like this please
as to the subject of t3 cruisers if you fly one you know that putting a cloak on it nerfs not only the damage and lock time but also the fitand it is a cruiser after all a well fit cloaked t3 and a well fit skiff should be interesting
also wouldnt a couple of falcon alts be enough to nullify or at least greatly reduce the damage that a blops gang can do to a mining opdoesnt even have to be your own alt just pay a corpmate or alliance mate 10milhour or so to park his falcon next to you while hes out doing other stuff on his mainor couldnt you just mine with throwaway ships if they explode who caresmaybe theres something i just dont get i live in lowsec but it seems that some people are overestimating both the actual threat level of a covert hotdrop and the effort needed to minimize losses maybe you should have at least a small bit of pvp knowledge even if you just want to pve in nullmake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
here is the part you are not gettingnull miners in many alliances are not allowed to fight backspecifically the concern is that the players harassing the miners will have a good time and come back for morethe call was made from an excel sheet not a fun to play perspectivemy view is that if we make mining something where evasion is not the only option we can stay mining as well as draw in more miners just for the fights themselvesmake anything fun and more people want to do itif harassing becomes fun it happens more oftenbut if mining becomes more fun as well as more rugged against opposing forces mining then happens more oftenpeople have fun everyone winsisnt that what we want out of a gameupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
now i see what you meanyeah in lowsec everybodys pretty much 1 a pvper 2 a free man the few guys i know that mine in lowsec are pvpers that mine on their alts to avoid having to jump in massive amounts of minerals that they need to build stuffso they usually fit tank  tackle to their mining ships and bring in their main  call friends if someone tries to gank themand yeah they tend to have at least the same amount of fun as the gankersmake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
i wise man once told me that unless you know without doubt do not assume anythingdo not limit the scope of what you think just by what you think you see behind that tree is a large forestit is good to see that you are expanding your horizions
and now that you have the perspective you may grasp that i want to bring the style of gameplay more like your experience to other areas like nullbut i cant fight emergent gameplay so i have to instead determine how to channel that so we get the fun we wantalliances are admitting that fun is a driving force in behavior that is why they want to avoid cloaked gank attempts from finding targets successful ones will keep coming back and that drops the numbers they feel they need for other thingslike pvp fleets or upgrades or even improvements for the alliance itselfi fully respect these are good things and should be worked towardsso i think to myself people want to do fun things and alliances need mining to happen with few interruptionssolution make mining fun so it happens more often and draws in more to participatethats where i propose the ideas i do i am connecting where we are now to where i think we find this desired gameat least i am trying to do soupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
demonstrably untrue ccps own disclosures on that show that the destruction of ships in nullsec vastly outnumbers highsecif it werent for those special people who use autopilot highsec would be even lower
very helpful for npc null and low sec groups that want to set up a cheap market for allies but dont want hostiles buying iti am not saying it is a good idea or that i would support it but i know my alliance would benefit greatlymoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is
the above is a quote from the mittani you might find helpfuli live in npc nullsec and our logi bros do a great job of importing doctrine ships as well as our personal shipswe have alliance rules about mark up over jita fuel costs includedwe seed the local market with very little as our foes could buy it at any timei like many of my fellows have an industry altsome of my friends mine to make iskif they asked for people to guard them doing it they would be laughed atif they didnt pvp with us they would be kicked 12 exceptions for some very important jobsonly pvpers are useful to us everyone in eve has a method of making isk and so we all have alts that perform useful support functions pure industrialists marketeers can do what they want but they are not welcome in our space without permissionmoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is

posting in an overview thread because eve  overview  industry and the overview is in some serious need for l u v
null miners in many alliances are told not to fight backright they are told not to be stupid as that brings back more of them being stupid as in not watching local intel channels setting a scout etc etc in which most of your jewbears out there do not do any of that thus they get popped because they are stupid if gankers cant find targets they will move on especially if they find a smart jewbear because after a few times they will just move on to something else because for every one smart jewbear there are 100 dumb ones
the exact wording may vary and it would be an odd coincidence if it were the same in each casethe point is miners are often told not to give the hostiles a reason to come backfor some alliances this means a strict non interaction policy not smart dumb or anything else but total lack of contactfrom your own experience it seems they gave you some wiggle room and made you responsible i would expecton a purely emergent level these decisions are being made partly from an accounting perspective the alliance needs income in order to functionif they feel comfortable that they have more than enough then they can be more relaxed about maintaining the sourcei dont feel this justifies a poor game play experience and i am not naive enough to go against proven game play styles being presentso we work with what we have and try to make smarter changesupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
the reason miners are told to not interact is because they are truly minersjews and the simple fact that most of these guys are so risk averse they will lose a tengu to an ares then they cry in allinace chat that no one came and helped them because they were tackled in a belt and normally that is what you get halp i am tackled in a belt and most of the time you spend stupid time trying to figure out where is your little noob they are good at building stuff digging in the dirt shooting ratsbut absolutely no common sense when it comes to deal with hostiles most of them just think that they pay for a game joined an alliance so now they should receive all the protection and no one should ruin their game so the leadership decided the no interaction  aggression to save themselves a little sanity this game has been dumbed down so much it has lost a lot of its original flavor and it makes me a sad panda the game is based on the premise that you use common sense and some form of cognitive skills to out smart and kill your opponent but unfortunately you have a chunk of the eve population think they are playing an arcade game have no social skills what so ever and can not grasp how some one killed their tengu with an aresedit also as far as alliance isk minerals yeah normally their logistics jewcrew takes care of that or has some minerals program for the pubbies

the search feature is your friend reading devblogs that mention similar things also helps
yeah because automation sans interaction from the player is clearly the way to go and will never be exploited
