quite a few more people gank than i think you realize when the impeirum does a burn system even lots of people who normally do not gank gank it is a very fun time hop in fleets and chat in fleet chat or on ts watching clueless freighters becoming burnt out hulks and even better turning them into burnt out hulksyou can login to relax in fact the burn events are fun and a good way to relax plenty of fleets the logistics guys have put up a crap ton of contracts so prefit ready to go ships are plentiful much more relaxed than a sov fight etcyou just cant be stupid about it and it doesnt hurt to understand the damn game you are playing you are safe nowhereaccept that and accept that youll eventually die and it is a whole lot less worrying when you loginas for those whining about the possibility of being ganked follow these steps1 click the start button2 click control panel3 click programs4 click uninstall a programproblem solved youll never be ganked againor you can change your attitude and accept ship losses as part of the game be it ganking or pvp look at it as a learning experiencehow can you do better
no  i am too old to change attitude i will uninstall the game the second i stop to enjoy it on my terms i am already doing it the best it can be donethere are many more games out there that are probably better and it is not up for me or you or anybody else than ccp to decide what they want from their gameout of curiosity  do you think that ccp should scrap the whole idea of high sec and retire concord entirely the game numbers should expolde right
only the crybabies like you would leave
why is that when somebody makes a point alot of people think taking the counter point to a completely idiotic extreme somehow refutes the initial pointperhaps you should invest in a dictionaryor heck just use google definition balance that should help you out
because someone had to bring it upour default underwear provision for both male and female characters is for want of a better word pantswhilst im not suggesting that underwear be necessarily introduced as an apparel item some customization options during creation  editing  both would be im sure welcomed with open arms by the vast majority of the communitythe first person who promises to champion this gets all my votes even if i dont particularly like thempvcthongsforall

whats your response to sions problems and how will you react to them if you get electedthis is already out in the public view so you should have no problems answering
i think many of the problems sion sugar sort and others faced were the result of mismanagement on part of ccp couple that with communication break downs and have you a recipe for disaster ccp appears legitimately interesting in salvaging relations as they have put new people in charge of the csm and made assurances of civility if by some misfortune remnants of these problems exist i am a very enduring and persistent individual i can handle being berated and insulted by people i look up too i wont be a better csm than sion or anybody i will be a different kind of csm i think even my worst detractors would agree that different is preferred at this juncture
certainly not your kind of different though not with your attitudinal maladjustments
you judge black and white  good start p
yeah it is better when campaigning without having any support from the establishment to have a clear message i am campaigning against the establishment you represent as you guys are twisting the csm role to your own ends and depriving independent players from a voice something you would know but not say as you are on a null sec power group bloc vote endorsements you are either a puppet or a decoy and i cant even say you put much effort into your own campaign this post is certainly noteworthy in that regard d for effort
fafer pings vote me for csm or kick from corp
thank you for the support
my previous post was designed to be provocative and accusatory you are the only candidate with high sec care bear so thank you for taking the time to answer my concerns i love this game and i believe in the csmi have voted in the last two csms this will be my third i joined eve a couple of months before a csm despite only playing for almost two years nowmr azariah was not a great highsec rep most of the bus mail consists of poor typing giving ships away to probably alts and trying to get newbros to join pvp fleets most of us where under no illusion that he would make high sec better but we had hope it wouldnt get worse and too mikes credit it hasnt however it is stagnant and it still feels like the community and ccp dont actually want us in the game that much i personally believe this is the root cause for the high sec apathy of which you speakwhen i saw your post on the candidate forums i though hoorah a high sec dude a beacon to hold back the swelling ocean of your not playing eve right voices of which there are many you dont need to represent nullsovlow or whs the game is dripping with players eager to represent these areas if your stating you represent the high sec care bear yes balance is key but at the end of the day you need to represent us the highsec care bearsi pi mineresearchcopyinventmake and run lvl4s that can no way be described as having to much reward the loot is pants the bountys unless doing missions like worlds collide or the extravaganzas are often only 2  5 million and the lpiskstanding from the agent with all relevant social skills at lvl5 is offensively low for the time it takes to complete most of themmy father always said only boring people get bored mining is a excellent time to read or even work i often have eve running while i work just sitting in a barge mining and popping into a wh for a bit of the good stuff is certainly not boring the mention of moving asteroidscomets is a outstanding idea or harder rats that come and say hello from time to timethis year there is a poor choicerepresentation for high sec esp with candidates like annexe and gorski car getting better  on the vote match for some of the high sec concerns both have clearly stated pve needs more work high sec should feel safe to a point no one sensible wants 100 safety and ganking should not always profit the ganker when cold hard killers and scammers take this position it shows clearly that true pvpers are not that interested in high sec or killing noobs there its a relatively small group of people with one specific ideal and nothing we cant or dont already deal withsoi would like to hear your opinions on npc corps building poss
so what again were you hoping to achieve by provoking and accusing megood for you then vote make an informed choice of candidate there are enough possibilities and blogs out there and motivate your friends to votethere you go again provoking work just got temporarily busy because of unplanned illnesses if i get the chance i will try and get back to this for more detail laternpc corps building poss  not a big fan of npcs building player owned structures not without such changes to wardecs and so onlet npc corps have access to station amenitys  i mentioned in my thread my last years thread and i think on my blog what i think about having options for social corporationlike structures iirc leaving npc corps has been proven to aid player retentionhow do you feel about allowing players to leave the starter corp but rejoin should the player corp experience not satisfy their play style  i always wanted to join minedrill maybe opening up the variability of npc corps might help avoid those hats you mention but i think we should be looking at ways to incentivise player created and controlled organisationsand lastly what do you think about letting dreadscarriers and lvl5 missions into highsec  dreads no not really carriers also not really lvl5 missions well i would like to see more variety in the missions but somewhere the line has to be drawn between high and other sec if we make lvl5 missions in high sec then we have to introduce higher lvl missions elsewhere which will inevitably bring us back to where we are now kind of like a circlethanks again for your time  if i wasnt being provoked and accused i might have taken more time on the coffee break to answer things more in depth o7 dont knock mike but well i dont really know what you were getting at in your post anyway the bus mails did not directly have anything to do with representing on the csm
just thought i would share a mail with permission of the original author that is fairly typical of the message i am getting from high sec people that might support me this is one of the reasons why i took so long this year before announcing my candidacy any high sec orientated platform irrespective of how reasonable it tries to be has to deal with the apathy of the high sec residents compared to the massive nullblocs every voter or supporter that stops because of disillusionment with the process or the institution damages the highsec candidates more than their nullbrethrenit is an uphill strugglere csm xi from a supportersent 20160114 2234 to lorelei ierendi list of other supportershi loreleiim not sure if there will be a csm endorsement list forfrom community this year i did it the last two years with the feedback from some others but by now im convinced that the csm as a whole does more harm than good  especially long term while im certain that there are a few individuals who really have the wellbeing of the game at heart and who do good and constructive work on the csm many others try to use it to drive the agenda of their respective nullsec bloc profit from it personally or worse are sockpuppets for their bloc leadersunfortunately ccp doesnt include an option to abstain from voting in order to differentiate people like me from people who have never heard of the csm or that there is a vote for it and there are many so not voting at all is the only choice ccp gives me and that is what i intend to doso unless somebody else steps up in order to dive into the numerous threads in the csm forum and other sources and put together a list of good candidates there wont be a csm list from community this yearhowever feel free to drop into the channel at any time to present and discuss your ideas with the residentsalso please be aware that this is my personal opinion not that of the community moderation team as a wholecheersa supporterhaving an option to actively abstain from voting is one of the things i would advocate a way to tell the difference between apathy and disillusionment

hehe thanks 
i read a lot of that and cant really find answers to some of my concerns which i would like your opinion onayou seem to be pushing for increasing wardec costs per week but this really wont help  at all as soon as say pirat is at the end of their costeffectiveness cycle on a corp or alliance another one of the big wardec alliances say vendetta mercenary group will just pick that corp or alliance up btheres still no way to effectively end the wardec you seem to get that the main problem with hs ganking is theres no real way for the good guys to counter a gank in progress or not many and every situation where there is not interaction and game play or the potential for those between sides makes for a very dull game many large wardec alliances have hundreds of wardecs with lots on very pvp oriented groups but they really know better than to try to get a fight out of wardeccers so they dont bring a fight to hi sec because they wont get one basically wardeccers have no skin in the game  just like gankers they can just do the deed and dock up or ratters can just warp to a safe when a hunter or gang is 5 jumps out i wouldnt mind wardeccers if you could actually fight back but the sheer number of large pvp alliances that are wardecced show otherwise as it is wardecs arent a tool for generating content they are just a way to get free kills off people who are ignorant of mechanics i have seen nothing in your proposals to actually make wardecs an actually opposed thing where the defender could win the war and be done with it which quite frankly is needed
a no im not for increasing the war dec costs im saying the cost should be calculated on the average age on all active characters younger average age makes it more expensive older cheaper protect newbies slaughter vetsb anti gankers need more tools to counter we need to buff the watch lists so war dec alliances can focus more on specific targets and need less wars no watch lists and they need twice as much wars
age means nothing with skill injectors now

come in and look out welcome to my campaign for 2016 csm the 11th alias ixcsm matchplaying since april 2013you will mostly find me in 00 than in wh and than maybe in low or highsecuse this thread for questions 
you are a funny please continuegoogle does not help when you lack basic comprehension skills you can google point but i doubt it will bring any result in your casei do not care about you and please do not feel entitled to care about me and my perception of a internet pixels game if i think the game is  because of x you are welcome to argue that i am wrong because of y arguing that i am wrong because i am z is kindergarten i will not change deal with itnow  back to the topicccp randomguys are developers they are paid salaries to design a game they can be hired and they can be fired they are in charge of the design but shareholders and executives should care more about the revenues and it is responsibilty of shareholders and executives to make sure design changes result in more money not less the mmo market has grown a lot in the last 10 years  has eve matched that growthif ccp wants to focus on the masochisticgambling types of gamers  that is a valid choice eve is not going to die  ultima online is still around however  if they want more revenues  they should do more for the game appeal to the wider audience
now you are being deliberately obtuse your counter example was completely and totally moronic nobody has advocated for removing hs andor concord ns and hs need each other so i have never advocated such a completely stupid and foolish position you brought it up try and be clever but you failed miserably and showed us you cannot provide a cogent responseeve has always been a niche game and it is one of the few sandbox games sandbox games mean you can do what you want so long as you are willing to face the ingame consequences making it so you can no longer do that is a fundamental change to the gamedespite being told all this when you first started playing you are playing the wrong game you sit there and want the game change to suit your needs despite the fact that the vast majority of players know what the game is about and changing it could drive out a very large number of players well before they could be replaced by players looking for theme park style gamesso your argument is weak at best and please spare us the there are lots of people in hs first not all of them view the game like you do second how many of them are ns alts i have 2 characters that live in hs and then there are those who live in hs and are fine with the sandbox nature of the game so just pointing to the number of players in hs is not at all useful
do not forget the plus sized figures even sports illustrated now has one source
are you on boosters why are you posting in this section of the forums
1and what do you think about having the t3ds suffer a skill loss like t3 cruisers to balance them out and avoid further nerfing them as they areas it is i think it takes 12 days to lvl 5 a racial skill for a t3d about 10 with a full respective remap 
saying it was ccps fault and not failures by all parties involved is just shifting blame the csms and the general population of eve are just as much to blame as ccp
this might amuse you xen jenshae puts on a tinfoil hat and dscans for nargles
you are an inspiration to me as someone who is very nearsighted i have to say that having a csm who fights for those of us who have trouble with the ui and not being able to see it clearly due to the lack of fontdisplay controls is hard to play eve with for instance there is no font control in the game browser what you see is what you get this is not acceptable the amount of obstacles you have overcome and the gallantry you display makes me proud of you i would love to have you represent us as a csmanyone with a limitation is just as capable at mastering the intricacies of this game and we should not have to battle with the ui to accomplish this thank you for running you are my number 1 choice for csm
i like this chick  how can i vote for this one
thanks for the support you can vote by going here
i vote for lord vaari for he has given upon to me the sacred promise of a tiara fit for my protuse neckbeard head my support for afk and provi block is as unwavering as lord vaaris faith in our god the high lady aswell the citizens of new eden and as such would make him in my humble opinion a perfect csm candidate
vote for vaari is vote for yourself
jintaansome questions for you1 what kind of improvements to the ui would you like to see that would help you fc large fleets better2 how would you handle rebalancing t3 cruisers and destroyers this is likely to come up during your term if you were elected3 how would you balance the isk making ability between high sec missions high sec incursions and nullsec anomsdeds4 what do you think about the proposed rorq change which puts it in the belt but gives it a massive aoe shield for the mining fleet do you think people in provi will risk their 25b isk shipsgood luck man
you get my vote
a few things i would like to see carried forwardtech 3 should be about utility not power power creep is bad for mmos more utility more skill required so newbies can still work as a team with more skill and beat a veteran in a high utility ship rather than be tanked and killed even if they have it scrambled and webbedthe longer it will take a new player to be significant and useful the less likely they are to stay in a game eve is a sandboxprovide more tools to fight to defend to take actions against other players the current direction of high sec where the mechanics try to protect players is not healthy for eve that is very wowishexample recognising coalitions in the mechanics or fleets for a purpose or subset groups taking on a role would be a few options for null sec to fly out and kick war dec corps in the soft spotsempower players eve will die if it becomes wow in space or progress quest eve editionmake eve deeper and widercreate different ways to play eve since incarna we have had iterations upon what already existed let us walk through the door and into a dust social arealet us make ship interiors for ccp moderation and implementationallow us to assemble ships with different balance templates in station like a projectile cycloneemergent play does not come from things like fozzie sov where you mine a structure with a laser that is less complex but very shallow mechanics
thanks for stopping by like i said yesterday the rest of the week looks to be catastrophically busy at work so ill save an in depth response for when i have time to formulate it properlybut have you raised these issues with the candidate that you support as i said time is pressing and i dont want to spend the valuable bits surfing through other peoples campaignthreadnaughts so if you could send me a link of his answers that would be valuable
steve i havent seen any statement from ccp about who will take over crest and 3rd party support when foxfour leaves is there some continuity planned or are we going back to the dark agesill bite his code quality could be better

it means less might be more accurate
it does as a young char with a lot of sp is still a young char aka newbie or alt of course and yes theoretically a corp could delete all characters create a new one inject x sp and play but i dont think many will do as your char says something about you and we are proud of our history only ones i could see do this right now are multiboxing miners or gankers in most cases they do it for profit and extractinginjecting skills is not cheap

thanks event 
greatthen you will love talking with me as my threads are used as references for solutions and i am sure you remember this and this and strangely enough a lot of what i suggest has been implemented in one form or another now i dont think that is because of me i think most of human invention is derivative of ideas that proceeded them it is just simply quite nice to see that i think in the right directions editthis is hilarious same as last yearif tora finds he can not talk and debate then he resorts to declaring war much like how a bully or thug would try and punch you because they ran out of wordsso what do you guys thinkwhen tora can not debate things with other csm members do you think he will try use some useless little wars to try and change their minds always good for a laugh thank you
any chanse you want to do something about afk cloackers

vote with your saqyour harry saq
im not entirely certain what youre asking about but additional api endpoints benefits almost every eve player whether its to check your evemails from your phone or to import fits from pyfa into eve directly or even simply to look at the killboards third party apps help make the game more accessiblefor developers more api endpoints means more tools to help manage characters corps groups etc i currently have a petition out to ccp foxfour hopefully he can get around to it before he leaves  to get an improvement to the fw map xml api for aspiring developers there are plenty of resources to choose from and countless guides online on how to read or access such data for nondevelopers what matters the most is the scope of what third party apps let you read or access while away from the client

since your a fellow pier you get my vote hopefully you will address the ridiculous lack of updates required to bring pi into the current modern interface of eve it is the only aspect of eve not upgraded and long overdueis it really necessary to have white mining extractor on top of a white ice planet over a white minerals overlay white on white on white is incredibly painful to stare at when doing pi please oh dear lord if someone could address this issue i am tired of banging my head against the forum requests to get this changed
there are times that eves default colour maps choices are  interesting  to the point of preventing some players playing parts of the game what i find difficult to read others find impossiblei should be fighting with other players or red crosses on a map and not with a colour pallettethanks niko rhivre and syrinx
soooooooo why am i not on the ballot did i miss a step in the process did i miss an email or something what
the main reason why my friends dont play eve is they dont have the time for itnever before in history man had so much leisure time like us but there are also so many things you can do with your time as ever before so why should someone spend or waste a large proportion of its free time for just one thing if during the same timespan multiple other equally fun things can be donethe greatest strength of eve is also its greatest weakness its the amount of time this game takes of your lifeafter thousands of hours in game even im not sure anymore if its worth it
i think that is part of the problem lots of players are now older and they have families careers etc that take them away from the game and in many cases maybe permanently and these players wont come back if the game becomes a theme park imo

1clearly isnt even showing what he actually is gonna add to the game aside from random nonsensecsm is thing to be taking serious and this gentleman is clearly not
im not gentleman im lord is it not taking seriously when i clearly tell my goals luxury stuff including new medals and other awards clothes and such or are you so poverty ridden peasant that when you cannot afford a simple monocle you take only  15 for some weapon or speed seriously
hi vaari1 what do you think about the addition of the longrequested lab coats and anime armor2 also what do you think about the addition of medalstudded jean vests like the one worn by neal breen in double down3 do you think that characters should get more hair options such as proper afros mullets bobs etc4 and lastly what kind of ship skin colors would you like to seei hope that we serve on csm 11 together
so ive been listening to your last appearance on the jeffraider show and i have to see im really glad i voted for you your point about the dichotomy about pve and pvp and the forced separation between pve and pvp fits is pretty much what i have been thinking about for a long time and i totally agree with the notion that making pvp fits the defacto fits would ease more people into pvp those who disagree think that it is not a good idea because they wouldnt get all carebears to start pvping thats faulty thinking fw plexes have not made all their users into pvpers but they still made some of them into people ready to sometimes stand their grounds this is what eradicating all those pve fits could do to eve as a whole ease people into being active in the tiskreward equation instead of the binary running away at the first sign of trouble anyway i really hope you make it into the csm we could use more people that are not afraid of the pvp potential of the game
why do you feel the free intel doesnt hinder gankers more than it helps them miners or haulers will usually be at predictable places ice anom ore anom belts transiting gates on the other hand a gank fleet can hide out at any spot offgrid but is easily seen in local
good questionan answer isgank fleets will usually have members that have a negative sec status and will therefore be at predictable places eg docked up to avoid faction police and only undocking to gank then they will undock and attack there are many systems where there are more anomalies and belts than stations
when csm 11 campaign started i hoped steve is going to announce his candidacy i encourage all industrialists to vote for you because we are the one who need you there not the other directionone thing i would like you to address with ccp please make citadel or other new structures more social friendly for manufacturers by protecting their assets and their running corps jobs maybe like not giving anyone the right to cancel your job and not allowing anyone to access your assets in a corps division unless you want otherwise we will still see those 3 altss manufacturing corps thanks again

thank you very much for your help
thanks for the support guys if you have time to give feedback on wardecs jason quixos has a great thing going with the wardec project and could always use more feedback
1 you got my votes
noobman do u have a comment on the nerf to wspace scouting coming in citadels  eg  ships are now hiddendocked in citadels so scouts dont see them when dscaning system where as before you could check for active pilots by dscaning a forcefield followed by warping to the pos this combined with watchlists removal means a signicant nerf to scouting and hence content creation in w spaceplease represent those of us that who dont just go to null for kills ppl need to get out of caves and they will see something new thats where eve is placed not in cave  zoonrkorsairs 
what about a script that instead of warp interdiction generates an inertiapenalizing bubble thus providing a chance to catch interceptors and nullified t3s but forcing a choice or teamwork rather than bubbles being a mechanic for catching everything
its like when you have a nice conversation going with people on numerous subjects and then suddenly some bully joins in starts talking on how important he is linking to all kind of irrelevant posts and thinking he is the center of the universe then you have to punch him in the virtual face and put em back in his spot hit hard enough to keep em quiet so the rest of the group can continue their nice chats the end happy one
it flies right past you doesnt ityou wrote crying is easy solutions are hard in reply to one of my posts so i then linked proof that i provide solutions that even ccp have acknowledged them and used them as a resource and you responded with a war  a war on a null sec alliance  that after years you havent realised that anything of importance is done by neutrals and not by blues so your war is completely ineffectualcongratulations you have demonstrated that war mechanics are broken but we already knew that again for years and no you have a distinct lack of kills against me to be claiming you have landed any punchesyour in game moves are as impotent as your csm plans to push your one agenda all you are trying to do is lobby for your own selfish interests and pretending to be weighing both sides of it
i see you are still trying to say that the rl tora and game tora are different then you post thisdo you remember the quote i put as answer to one of your forum posts i wiill repost it here for you incase you forgotlies have no legs they cannot walk farplease stop pretending you are bringing anything else to the csm table as all you are bringing is your ego and double standards
the man we all need
what is your opinion on monocles 
what is this joining goons business aboutthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
i am running completely independently not tied to any power bloc or other metagame influence i just care about the quality of the game and providing useful reasoned feedback
i owe my five supporters an apology while talking with ccp about proper id i apparently replied to my own emails rather than sending them to ccp so ccp never got my id and i was not put on the ballot goddamn it google why is your interface stupidmy bad ill be back next year though assuming we dont all die in a fire
ive wasted like 15 minutes trying to find where im supposed to votektnksbi
and there is an other issue the monthly fees i for myself dont have problems with that but if you dont have that much time why paying for something you may only play for a few hours per week there are a lot of games out there who are for freethat leads to the next problem multiple accounts as if paying for one account isnt bad enough if you look through the forums you get really quick the impression that you need several accounts with specialized characters to be successful that quadruples the monthly feeswell sure you can pay for those accounts with your ingame income but then you would play just to pay for your accounts wheres the fun in thatif you have no job or life this may be attractive for all others its a reason more to decide against a game that is seemingly only played by no real lifers
or you knowyou could have friends in game
or in real life whats your point
having alts is not a must have requirement in fact in many cases having several players vs several alts will be better on average
i agreethe reason why i mentioned it is because it was one of the things non eve players told me about this gamehere my experiences why they dont play eve are beside they arent into science fiction stuff on number one the time and on second place the costs
i think the first point is the most significantif you arent that into scifi why pick this mmo yes it can be a time consuming game however there are ways around that but yes then you run into your last pointmoney if you do not want to grind for isk and wait for sp to build up then you can shell out some rl cash and side step thatbut i dont see how that is any different than many of these free to play mmos people start out playing for free then they get tired of the grind which in some ways is worse in these mmos as it really does require your time whereas in eve you can at least acquire sp even while logged out so they get out the credit card and soon it is the special whatever to earn more xpin game currency then maybe converting psuedoxp into real xp i recall world of tanks had something like this in world of tanks next thing you know youve shelled a surprisingly large amount of cash but you didnt realize it because they were nickle and diming you or they had those nice specials you want to spend 5 but you see that 25 special offer that lets you get 7x whatever you were going to buy that is why i quite playing those games as they were morealmostsneaky at getting you to pay cash with eve i pay for a year and i know it is about 11month and nothing more

time for me to reproduce another mail from a supporter as a counterpoint to the one i posted earlier naturally reproduced with the permission of the authorfrom a supportersent 20160303 0722 to lorelei ierendihello ms ierendii apologize for the unsolicited email regarding your campaign for csmi am an independent industrialist ceo of corporation focusing on planetary commodities as well as eventually venturing into the production of t2 frigates specializing in exploration vesselsmy corporation is based out of empire space and tends to stay in systems over 6 due to the concord presence i have been overwhelmed with spam regarding the csm elections and have until now voiced that i would abstain from voting lets be honest most of the candidates are there to push their agendas to shape eves development around their nullsec feuds very few players care what happens in high sec and more often than not when i get involved in these discussions i hear the opinion if you want it safer play wow eves not the game for you i disagree and i feel that i can enjoy the environment as much as any nullsec playeron a whim i went to the csm campaign forums and found your thread i have to say i was inspired i have decided to get involved and to cast my vote for you theres a problem though i am a relatively new player and i have no idea howwhere to cast my vote is there a resource you can direct me to so that i can learn how to vote for youthank you for taking the time to read my email and i hope to hear from you soonregardsa supportercorporationso never give up never surrender
yup brodit is pretty damn cool
i feel like that would have a huge knock on effect what would stop someone using it against something like a battlecruiser or god forbid a battleship at the core of it this is an issue with interceptors and nullified t3s the driving force behind these ideas for change is a debuff to ships that are safe more than a buff to hictors
well the monthly fee kept me ten years ago from joining the game but now i agree eve is cheap in comparison to many free to play games that brings us back to the question why ccp failed for years to convince for example me to join its club of capsuleers maybe they simply failed to bring the message of a really cool game despite the fees to me who knowsbut people are short sighted with exception of you dear reader of course monthly fees  free monthly fees  free that people very probably will pay over time more for a f2p game isnt in their minds at the beginningi dont suggest ccp should change that the contrary but i still think its a reason that has an effect to some degree
this is true i see a lot of people who dont play eve saying a monthly sub is old fashioned and puts them off i of course file these people under probably wasnt an eve player anyway and move on with my life
for a large portion of loggedin time where im not in the middle of spaceshipcontent it would be much more enjoyable to spend time sitting around a table with my friends ingame avatars playing cards gambling with the backdrop of the solar system through a large windowed wall of the station and perhaps a bar behind usin such a situation im sure the devs could come up with some way of providing interesting boostersservices from the bartender perhaps integrate ingame attributes in some mannermore than anything just being able to enjoy the very nice looking characterscustomization in the presence of others playbet in a situation where i can relax as opposed to needing my full concentration as most activities in eve try to requiretheyd also drastically improve their aurumclothing sales plus any new boostersservices they could conjure up iskaur bothplays well into taxes and whatnotfor highly populated places like jita maybe have different decksfloors to represent instances with a capacitymaybe some mechanic for an entity to own a particular deckfloor charge taxesfees and change the deckfloor name to whatever they want to attract peopleperhaps a more successful strategy would be to allow holographic representations of avatars from almost anywhere in kspace requiring the actual placedeckfloor to be located in a real station somewhere and thus be contestedboughtwhatever but not requiring those wanting to participate to necessarily be docked in that stationdespite the repercussions of incarna i think most would agree that its not that players dont want wis stuff it was a scare from the climate of the time what was being packaged with it and comments by devs from those daysalthough im still surprised they havent tapped this fairly large resource yeti mean for me personally i bought aurum for some skill injectorsfairly large amount but theres basically no chance ill ever purchase cosmetic items if i cant actually wear them around doing anything even remotely interactive my little envisioning of playing pokerblackjack with some buddies would be more than enough to get me spend some iskaur on whatever customization i liked
hello is this thing on greetings csm im lulu lunette ceo of savage moon societydecided to do a bit of investigating the other day since is no longeri wondered if ccp consulted with either brave or eve university before just dumping the task of keeping an official wiki and howto to the generous third party community in our communityi dont really know anyone from brave so i ended up in eve universities diplomat channel and i asked them if ccp had even checked with them first and they said no i admit i was venting my frustration a bit in the chat and they did direct me to tell my csm about my concerns so this is why im here they also reminded me that it was okay because they are a charitable organization and have been around for twelve years hey thats great and all butdoes anyone else think that maybe open source is suddenly being taken for granted im not really the best for words on this topic because i didnt realize how much i used until it was gone literally from day one i had open i would not be here still without that site suddenly the joke about just dumping it to the free labor that is our playerbase is a realityshutting down was a bad moveif it was up to me like as a head honcho of eve university or brave newbies id make a similar sudden shift in policy and close uniwikibrave wiki to only students faculty and donors maybe their diplomats can coordinate and do it togetheri would like to ask if there is a solid date for an replacement there was mention that there was a future site for things like chronicles and lore stuff

the click fest is bad on pi i had to set up 32 planets today over 6 toons i think i have arthritis in my fingers i too think the fundamentals are ok but yes ui could do with changes auto link would be one but just in case you get a bee in your bonnet on pi and afer killing my hands today can i offer a few more suggestionswhen placing a factory and setting it for a certain blueprint say precious metals for example have an option that propagates that choice over all your factories that you have placed to place a factory set up a material and route it is 8 clicks per factory 32 setups roughly 7 factories per planet that is a hell of a lot of clicksif your route back from your extractor is over 100 allow the upgrade to happen assuming you have the cpupg to happened without having to cancel the route then clicking on the link to upgrade then trying to reroute againwhen placing factories launchpads etc allow a UFFFDsnap tooUFFFD feature that places them close together the pain involved in trying to make that gap small is horrendousi think even these 3 changes would drastically improve quality of life when it comes to setting up pi
steveim curious as to your answer to the following easy question
steve answered correctly on slack with some help from rhivre 1
easy he says
ya really want to stir the pot give a freighter the ability to do a one system cynolike jump with a long cooldown or for the group thing make a one system cyno jump possible for those ships lacking the ability via module the pilot will have to determine a host of things before making that escape like how soon before the aggressors jump into the system and find him or whether or not they already have people in there waiting to start bumping again they would have to be very diligent and it would make for some heinous cat  mouse activity a very large mouse a freighter pilot may still need intel regarding where hes escaping too and that would still require some help meaning its not a single player i win kind of thing
glad you are running possibly you are the only lorerepresenting candidate around here 1
ahem on a serious note uriel landed pretty high on my own personal ballot best of luck mateface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away his evil
great
admitting i have not gone through this entire thread but i will from a modders standpoint this should be easy to outsource after all the f2p kmmorpgs do pretty well just with clothing and item sales i have played a few because of friends being cheap and naturally gamed and game tested the systems in doing so basic things show up almost no collision meshes need be applied limited numbers of characters  and therefore players system rendering requirements can be packed into smaller instanced dungeons  corridorsbarscasinoshangarscqs certain physics can be completely writen off because why would you need to bunny hop in a station amazingly rendered plants animals and long view can be pretty well written off by the simple fact that stations are enclosed suvival spaces in extremely hostile enviornments and such places that do have them are homes to worthless non capsuleers beneath the notice of the pod immortals the real work would be in a new character design engine and alot of work making more individualized clothesapparelaccessories this is not hard i turned skyrim into something unrecognisable by myself in my very little spare time with basic free tools references will not be given this is eve but i point out that that particular game was made on a very obsolete engine yet looked fabulous even on a crap system like minetherer need be no combat this is really just about mingling and strutting your stuff in your pimped out non game breaking stuff station enviornments dont even need to be on the same server on the same continent loading screens can be avoided by premade and loaded access points like airlocks and elevators i have repeatedly said things like this could be outsourcedcrowd to the community the eve community is by and large one of the more educated and tech skilled game communities in the mmo world hold an art competition requiring the use of free tools so it is open to all hell you could open it up and say graph paper accepted and long as you have basic drafting layouts top front side etc give a free copy of maya or a similar 3d package and let us loose for enviornmentsenviornments only it takes alot more skill to do clothing and chracters rigging etc involve us eve is known for listening to and including its playerbase in creating and refining game tools we use for content it is also free advertising and game support eve is made by its playersinvolve us we want to help get what we want and it doesnt give anyone extra power or abilities the worst that can happen is that people get made fun of for bad fashion sense which is just generate content in space cause thats the only place combat will be happening
i am not good at numbers i would just use a smartbomb since my optimal range is forever i would be able to hit both targets

sorry but obama tried that crap on me twice and i wouldnt fall for  yes he won without my vote what reform you cant promise change without telling us what you specifically want to change and expect my vote  remove the cloaked from local free intel is the real problem not afk cloaking

thank you scheulagh  i enjoyed answering a different type of question and i learned something in the process
i dont have any specific ui improvements as regards to large fleets but i think the best change with regards to fleet fights that could be done is adding logistics to killmails some people might like being the quiet assistants of the fleet but many more want to wear their kb stats with pridetake away either 2 or all 3 rig slots from them for the svipul in particular id buff small arty fitting and nerf the svipuls powergrid i think its a way to nerf them that fits with their original intentthats a hard question and id want to discuss with a hisec representative as well but i think the best thing that could be done would be to provide group pve that is consistent to nullsec group work should always be worth more than solo work as it encourages the social dynamic that is the best part of eve i feel like hisec incursions are a little out of whack but they only need a little bit of shaving to be brought in line i really really think it will be numbers dependant i hope they provide something for the attacker to do whilst they are in their invulnerable mode and dont leave it open to abuse i like the idea of it providing a cyno as well but disabling locking on all invulnerable ships to incentive having tackle and a standing fleet to give the attackers a fight you bet we couldnt stop them if we triedthanks have a good day and thanks for the questions
lets start with some rl backgroundim an old fart age 66american veteran of the vietnam war having engaged in rl pvp i am not obsessed with blowing up pixelsage and injury put me at a disadvantage in a twitch contest with teenagerscurrently disabled and therefore spend a lot of time on linethe pve environment in eve has a base game that if developed could be great i have come and gone multiple times mostly because of the attitude of ccp itself i keep coming back in hopes the attitude has changed it is one thing to have a bias toward one play style it is another to kiss the ring of one group of players adding up ccps lost revenue from me is about 340000 the areas i feel ccp could improve eve in hisecgraphicsi am an armature astronomer with a nice 8 telescopeas seen from space stars would be distinct points of light in eve stars are blurred as if looking through an atmospherethe nebula as portrayed in eve are huge to be that close to most nebulae a person would be fried by xrays and gamma raysthe light diffusion as you look at the star in each solar system is that of again as observed through an atmosphere and not from the vacuum of spaceganking risk vs rewardthe gankee takes all the risk crime watch is an improvement i feel it would be better if in addition to the 15 min timer a second 24 hour timer was attached  perhaps black pirate icon  that would make them a valid target for the neighborhood watch these timers would be cumulative you gank 5 players youre a valid target for 5 days or until youre killed 5 timesnpc corporation faction loss similar to security loss i have 85 standing with say core complexion and you have no status you get negative status with core complexion get enough and core complexion wont let you use their stationspiracyim not sure where ccp got its idea of what a pirate was caribbean pirates with only a couple of exceptions used very fast lightly armed sloops against unarmed merchants the goal was to steal the cargo not sink the shipevolution of sheep ccp believes that humanity will evolve into a species that accepts lawlessness without exception something along the lines of an old west town terrorizing its citizens in perpetuity bring in wyatt earplicense to steal custom office monopolies granted to the select few at the time of the change these should either be returned to interbus or allow multiple offices this is an example of unfair bias in favor of a few and a demonstration of how much eve is not a sandbox the rules alone prevent me from installing a second officesandbox myththose who claim eve is a sandbox are those that the rules favorif it were a true sandbox i could make a wwii q ship an exhumer hull fitted with weapons and modules to gank the gankersnon pvp playerccp could most likely attract and retain many that are more interested in pve manufacturing and trade  expecting pvp diehards to respond with thats not what eve is about carebear why dont you leave then or any troll you want keep in mind what i propose is not for lowsec or null only high sec to aid new players and those that are not obsessed with pvp a change in player corporations add a pa private association category up to 3 members that are on the same account ie a personal corporation only other pas can declare war on a pa any logistics support in highsec is an act of aggressioni have seen overzealous wannabe pretend bad boys drive potential players away a brand new player less that one day old went to recruitment channel announced he was a new player some trolls immediately placed a bounty on him i added him as a contact but he had already logged off and 10 days later has not logged on again nor replied to the email i sent apologizing for the bad behaviorrant is long enough
hi1htfu 2players make the ingame content ccp provides the tools3i respect the fact you served an all but eve is literally everyone versus everyone4gankers are mostly all 10 sec status so anyone can shoot them alreadysomeone before you already tried to have all of your ideas implementedthat someone failed because the vast majority of the player base understand that theres a risk to get popped when you undock except the hardcore carebearsi started as a carebear then discovered pvp when someone got ganked near methen i started shooting people and never stopped sincethe pvp aspect is what makes people stay not doing level 4 missions and mining all day longand finally your pa idea would only result in mercs and pirates making pas to blap other paslol
1 nice biographical information but is it relevant i will have you know that i am the queen and reside in buckingham palace and do not pay tax or have a passport2 great so an armature astronomer wants to chip in with their two cents fantastic lets redo what the art department has created just to be more realistic submarines in space never mind about that3 the gankee takes all the risk brilliant dont worry about the fact that the aggressor loses their ship when they violence someone elses boat  dont worry about that at all were a player like you to have a telephone conversation with ccp i imagine itd go something like thisyou change the game its unfair to those players who refuse to interact with others but who get blown up without as i see it any repercussionsccp free and unfettered actions and the attendant consequences therein are the essence of the sandbox whats stopping you from exercising the killrights and blapping the guy who blapped youyou errrchange it anyway make a level playing fieldccp sorry no  it would destroy the game as we know ityou no u4 your analogy with seafaring pirates is flawed as  to my knowledge  caribbean pirates perhaps werent concerned with looting the modules from their prey in eve that is very much a part of the piracy experience loot fairy permitting5 you dont have to be obsessed with pvp to enjoy this game i im terrible at itdoesnt stop me trying though but you most certainly must accept that virtually everything in eve is predicated on social interactions and dependent therein its not a single player game with mmo elements its an mmo with some single player pve elements  that is the truth now and it has been the truth since the beta game servers were switched onaccepting that this is the way things are will do wonders for you if you cant perhaps another game may be more to your likingin a funny way by the way you yourself are now a criminal in the context of the forum as you have breached rule 3 with your selfadmitted rantfood for thoughtbumble steeples his fingersyour move cowboy
i know many love the way eve works now most of eve is open to the style they love i will not diminish their desire nor passion for the things they wantthere are others who may prefer other things pve trading and manufacture are a part of eve if ccp does not want the people who prefer these then remove them i recall when i started in 2008 2500030000 online was common i recommend eve to a friend because of this the statistics i see do not show much improvement in 8 years if ccps marketing plan is player churning fair enough personal styles and abilities should be considered by any corporation if they desire to grow and increase revenue i thought that increasing the appeal of a product was a desirable endeavor
pve trading and industry are indeed an essential part of eve  but they absolutely require pvp to be worthwhile gathering resources and making stuff would lose all meaning if this sandbox game did not have risk as well as feature permanent loss no one would want your stuff and be willing to give you anything for it you are asking to have your cake and eat it too pveindustry requires pvp to give it meaning and items in this game value and pvp needs pveindustry to make the weapons of war you cannot isolate players from pvp like you want yet still let them benefit from the shared game economy if you want that you can already minemissionbuild to your hearts content in 100 safety on the test server but you wont because if you tried you would quickly come to the conclusion that these activities have little value in isolation from the greater game eve is a singleuniverse competitive sandbox game almost unique in the gaming space ccp has tried to juggle the eternal dilemma of safety vs vulnerability and already highsec is extremely safe essentially 100 safe if you spend little effort no not 100 safe but this is by design and whatever risks that are left are easily managed you have to accept those risks or play something else ccp cannot provide the absolute safety you seem to demand and still stay true to the fundamental design of the game the customers that you say want that just cannot be catered to with this product
unfortunately the way incarna was botched put a bad taste in peoples mouths i fully supported wis i fully rejected incarna the important thing here is that they dont shove down peoples throats which is exactly what they did in incarna if done right it would be a welcome addition to new edenthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
376ms
 no i dont think so what was your process
i would totally vote for niko lorenzio since this is a person so familiar with high sec challenges and interesting creations in eve as well as higher risk things out in null and low sec actually i already did vote
besides afk needing more standing slots to keep up with the troublemakers of new eden and it being pretty ridiculous with all the random changes that in 2016 eve standing slots are even an issue anymore i cast my votes for vaari because he is a loyal alliance member a persistent diplomat a satirical mastermind and i know he will press ccp until the needs of industrial pilots are heard in such a way that is impossible to be ignoredraelyafk alliance executor

any questions for this serious csm post 
the only reform required for the csm is to have candidates that arent trolls or meta stars marveling at data about data vote in candidates whose platforms are about providing feedback and being the sounding board we were always meant to be and move away from the union thuggery mentality that has poisoned the csm in the past the csm is a pretty simple concept screwed up by those that have a status complex and want to see it as a chance to push singular agendas or make ccp beg them for approval to develop their own gamethe csm is only as useful as the people on it

you cant make a full contact sport like say australian rules football playable by haemophiliacs with osteoporosis without alienating the people who play it because its a full contact sport how would you like it if i had a no market pvp flag on my character and any sell orders i purchased from were automatically modified to npc prices because paying player set prices isnt my style

i can think of three areas to improvefirst  nuetral declarations for either systems or corporations inside an alliance that has wd a corp could be designated noncombatant and thus be illegal to attack enemy attacks on noncombatants would have the same criminal response by ccp as if they were not in wd if any member of the corporation either a attacks or benters the home system of an enemy corporation they would lose their noncombatant status second  pilot smuggling while we may be able to clone jump  sometimes thats not the preferred method i would like to call an uber corporation and be smuggled out no boats just pod and if your taxi gets popped both pilots have to be prepared to runthird  custom paint not those stupid decals they want us to pay for
with all the changes and balances in eve online i would like to see1 cloaking device need to use fuel 
that is my most important goal vote me
to be honest i dont know the exact formula for calculating those figures but i am a follower of your blog as i am a mathematics undergraduate in real life and really enjoy reading your analysis
i only actually changed to this corporation to stop my main corporation from getting wardecced and harassed whilst i am running for the csm as soon as the danger is over this corporation will be dissolved and i will go back to my main corporation again see blogs for detailsone of the things that i do not like is the frivolous use of reporting to harass people by getting their corporation names or player names changed up until now my corporation name has not been changed

hello lord vaari i wish you luck becoming csm you have my vote i would like to suggest fuel bays on any ship that can fit a cloak it is a sad thing when a red can cloak in a system and shut down the operations of 10 20 30 40 and sometimes more than 50 players in a system sometimes they camp for days while they are not even around their computer to be active some players can barely afford to run one account in one way to increase producivity al across eve cloak fuel conservation skills 15 could be added to the game the idea is that any ship someone fits a cloak to will pop up a new slot for cloaking fuel if the cloak is used it will burn up fuel to the point that if all extra fuel stored in the cargo of the ship is depleted the ship will uncloak without the ability to recloak this should take a few hours to allow for people to move in to hostile areas with plenty enough allowable time to make attacks without hurring players out of hostile areas we all know we dont want to be rushed to get our kills before running out of cloak fuel so the fuel would need to last maybe up to a 24 hour period maybe even longer than that we simply dont need players out there cloaking and camping sytems for days upon days wtih no regaurd to other players on person should not have tha ability to shut down great numbers of players profits for so long at a time after burning up any fuel stored in the cloak fuel bay the player would need to refill the bayfrom any extra fuel stored in their cargo hold refilling the cloak fuel bay should only take place when a ship is uncloaked and refilling should only take as long as it take to move the fuel i do truley believe this would keep more players more acitve all across eve people would have to be more serious about their game if this were to happen it also would be good to limit the amound of fuel that may be stored in cargo holds as due to the fact that some ships have much larger cargo holds than other ships we would want to keep cloaking fair across all shiptypes this is what i would love to see changed most about the game i hope other agree and respond dzazter thanks lord vaari for being around

i am being told to vote for vaari as opposed to be told why i should vote for vaaricsm is important but no one tells me why csm is important for afk i dont need any clothing and no skill respec is not heresyalliances should be able to award medals to people outside of corp i agree first you would need some personal thanks i have fought for hours with little or no thanks i strive every day to uphold our values without the need to be reminded or thanked i came down here to uphold an ideal i end up in a cult of personality if i speak in public about our ideals i am told i am out of my place even as a director in sov holding corp all i get is a nastygram by way of my ceo telling me i dont know my place there is no cohesive identity that is afk other than passive aggressive totalitarianism and hangers on give us a platform make a statement as to why we need a csm what are we after not a democracy that is for surein fact i already know the outcome there will be no discussion no forwarding of a platform just bruised egos pissing and moaning about that prick zhengyi sao i am not a prick i am passionate about what i do i need some of that back something constructivewhy should i vote for vaari what does afk stand to gain what does afk want to gainsorry macon
we gain prestige of course having a seat in csm council generates us prestige and especially to me that will help us in diplomatic negotiations
this is actually a mail i wrote in response to someone who asked me if it was on your agenda to limit not abolish the wardecs in high sechi thanks for being interestedif you look at my campaign thread from last year i got lazy this year and did not post everything again you will see that the broken wardec mechanic as well as the broken bounty mechanic is something that should concern all high sec denizensbut please do not confuse the csm with anything that has any kind of power elected members do not have the ability to force ccp to change things it works best although not entirely accurate to think of the csm as a kind of playerelected focus group that are elected by players to give feedback to the devs elected by their players to represent a point of viewcoming back to wardecs i do not myself have any great ideas about how the problems could be fixed whilst still allowing there to be war after all pewpew is at the core of the game one of my ideas that might allow people not interested in war to still have some fun in the game was 201508playercorporationshtml not a totally original idea but i believe i also mentioned it in my campaign last year and maybe even on the capstable interview last year cant remember just to illustrate the point that it is something that i have been worrying about for a whilewhoever you vote for you should vote you should get your friends and corpsmates to vote your enemies and all the guys in local if high sec does not sit up and try and do something then ccp will only end up listening to the 14 people chosen by the nullsec power blocks whoever high sec votes for we as a collective also need to show the devs that we are interested in the route the game is takinganything else i can help you with
1 good luck 
when are these forums going away should i have put this on reddit insteadi love exploring new eden just running the sites is not enough i take loads of videos and screenshots because this game is beautiful so many in fact i could make a really neat and elaborate guide i imagined my own long term endgame being an accredited editor of  a neutral site that anyone in the player base can edit i based lots of my own creative crap on what i read on  was the only place for lore if i wanted history on the nikunni relations between vherokior and thukker tribes etcive only been here 11 months so i lack an authority that someone whos been here since beta would have as far as experience not to mention i dont do this coding thing for a living what would take someone in the field to do a simple 5 minute html edit would take me an hour my contributions to were very small i made some grammatical fixes and i made a page for my own characters backstory which honestly was just a sort of classroom if you wanna call it that using the different tools and templates to make a page from scratch because as we all know was brutally out of datelosing this lore fluff took lots of this games romance out for me not gonna quit over but theres no reason to remove it just like there was apparently no reason to keep itwhatever
i felt scion was a good csm who went into it with an open mind he advocated on behalf of us paying customers and was ignored publicly shamed and barred from running again by an individual who no longer has her job interfacing with the csm have fun with xenuria and aryth please remember that you asked for this i do have a question for xenuria its clear and obvious that current csm members are leaking nda material yet ccp does nothing about it how do your csm reform proposals address this
why do people always think the csm members are some super wizards who poop out perfect solutions ccp would never have thought about as a csm member you have the opportunity to let ccp know how players think about issues and where they should put their priorities thats why you need to be open for discussions active on social media etc and together you try to find the best solution by discussing the problems for this you need a good eve background or else youre kid preaching to the teachers and yes i would also vote for xenuria well i did already
if you havent voted yet for the csm youre doing it wrong in my opinion
the way some players outright reject avatar game play is hilarious people are throwing money at star citizen with its ship plus avatar gameplay and it doesnt even run half as smoothly as the captains quarterspersonally i think what little we have seen of the station environments in eve are far more interesting that the ones currently available in star citizen in eve you can see the cultural influences of the four empires at work there is a real story behind why the station interiors look the way the day but in comparison the environments in star citizen are a bit generic despite their higher amount of detail
still waiting for that kickstarter to appear and for one single person to demonstrate that wis is worth 10 to them
xenuria despite being a little odd despite people ridiculing you you still stand up to be in csm and the more i see of your posts there seems to be a bit of sharp dry witkeep on trucking
since i cant force ccp to reprimand people for leaking i can only change systems in such a way that the leaker is more obvious id have to see how they have all their stuff configured but its easy enough to put something like that in place i think retooling is part of reform just as much as drawing up new ways of doing things is
constant noneanswers meaningless no content just blatant attention seeking
xenuriawhat if i gave you another clue to make it easier you can assume that both targets are at the same distance i have revised the wording of the question above good luckregards writings on some formal methods in eveonline eve math  physics blog
hello its me im backtherein campaign fundemanetls and goalsas a campaigning participant thereinby in this election it will be my goal to bring the players a deeper sense of fulfullment in their everlasting jorney towards the lips of the manguswishy washy pishy poshy people in eve have been becominating far too stagnant and settledand what about the space invaders first cloaked spiders and now all sorts of crazy entities have been just cruisning on into new eden what the helli have one thing to say too all of the jove and their band of the horrific whateversyou have gone knocking up the wrong beewe will stand and fight to repel all forces and invaders from our systems foreign or domesticmyself and cameraman will probe the economy with a mangusrod of the likes has hither to been seen in this reality slice all of reality is unsliced until it is slicedwe must find the slice points before they become sliced
mmos have lifespans maybe eve has simply passed its peakits certainly looking a lot more polished nowadays but for me personally its still pretty much the same game i quit playing over a year ago im back for a month out of curiosityplus there are a number of other space ship games out there that simply werent around 5 years ago so players have choices in what game they play personally i prefer the hands on flying of elite dangerous but at the moment it lacks the complexity and depth that eve offers and all players on the one server provides a unique experiencei personally think ccps current tactic is going to try and grow its customer base through multiple products valkyrie dustlegionwhatever rather than trying to attract more players to evei think this is a shame because i would like to see eve grow the lore is interesting and universe unique and there plenty of avenues for new and interesting game play wis colonizing planets interactingmeddling with npc empires but i dont think any of these will be explored because eve is just about spaceships herp derp

thanks for a very interest questionfirst of all assuming the said station is open to my docking request i dont need the mouse altspace arrow key d custom shorcuts all executed with my free left hand and im safely in stationif that wasnt an option it depends whats the size speed and mass of the hostile ship am i in my invul timer and what direction am i facing assuming its a smaller ship i might turn it on to make my mass bigger and the bump less effective i might also leave it off so its easier to turn back around to face the station if turning it on will not be enough to avoid getting bumped outthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
nikosometimes more information doesnt make things easier except for being able to pilot back to docking range which i expressly made impossible because of your burrito eating none of the other distinctions matter you can choose whichever arrangements for the other parameters that youd like regards writings on some formal methods in eveonline eve math  physics blog

i think your going down the wrong track with buffs to concord as concord is part of the problem carebears face look i cant drive down to london with a gun in my glove box if the police stop me i will be arrested if i am attacked at a service station or a layby i cant use the gun or display it to make my attackers back away or i will be arrested i cant hire someone else to sit in my passenger seat with a gun to drive away any attackers either or they will be arrested so i cant have a bodyguard all i have is an assurance that if im attacked beaten raped and left for dead at the side of the road the police will endeavour to bring my attacker to justice this is the current concord mechanicproblem is highsec isnt england its the wild west we need the same self defense rules as in dallas not london that means we should be able to fight back or flee effectivelyi would suggest the following buffs to carebears ecm doesnt provoke concord response miners and haulers are free to blast away with it either with the non targeted aoe or preemptively jamming potential hostiles who target them apply this to all e war even possible counters for the ganker include eccm and passive targeting modules so its not imbalanced bumping allows the option for the bumped to open a limited engagement with the bumper and shoot it legally freighters get armed seriously armed like did that obliesk just launch 10 geckos armed smaller haulers get either more ehp fitting options or more speed options by all means let people continue to haul antitanked but if i want to fit for safety either with a your gonna need more then 5 people tank or a gj catching this tank this should be doable its supposed to be a conflict driven sandbox right so let us fight back and bring some risk back to ganking that isnt just i got my math on my calculator wrongwhat are your thoughts
thanks for stopping byactually i did not think of what i was suggesting just as buffs to concord in order to address the problems we face i was actually hoping generally to bring more common sense to the mechanic at the moment it is more like if three policemen are there whilst you are getting beaten up by a gang they will stop one of them and let the rest get on with it until help arrives if ecm did not provoke concord response then griefers could fly around jamming miners to their hearts content most gankers are already negative sec and can be shot whenever or ecmed i just have to fit an ecm to my covetor and notice them warping in the expanded grids that we have give me more time to prepare to reactjust have to fit sensor boosters to get my locking times up i am sure that jita pirates sitting on the trade hub undock would like that if a collision sparks an engagement timeror how would one differentiate between accidental collision and deliberate bumping i love trucking and we just got a hull buff and the dc change which is better than a buff to autopiloters i think it would be a shame to fit freighters with weapons it would destroy my space truckers feel but then it also took me a long time to get used to having slots at all and actually i find the fitting options for smaller freighters also ok it is already possible to fit some of the transports so the gatewatchingthrasher cant alpha you whilst autopiloting this game is a conflict driven sandbox as you say i am not asking for a safe button things like my proposed concord changes would also bring a bit of randomness into ganking maybe the police are at the donut shop the self destruct device will let us rob potential gankers of all lootgains if we are prepared to press the button stuff like thatthose are my thoughts at the momentps it is hard taking buffs for carebears ideas seriously from someone with  as a signature
good points especially about the bumping ill have to think more about it
id really like to see some quality of life buffs to low sec to make it a more attractive place to go live hunt and play i can go roam a dozen low sec systems and find nobody in any belts or celestials so i come back to highsec and go blow up a retriever i totally agree about the bored pilots bit i have a solution for bumping as well make it activate a limited engagment between the pilots aka like a duel if the bumped pilot accepts now arm freighters honestly in such a harsh dangerous universe why would ship manufacters keep churning out unarmed ships lets make all ships capable of fight or flight and allow the pilot to choose which he will fit bump that oblieskwill it microjumpdrive out or release 10 geckos or is the pilot afk decisions decisionsedit while reading through some worthy candidates i had a chance to clarify my thoughts about high sec thus
following the goblin on this one csm needs to be more then a feel good pr tool to be worth the effort to votewhile reading through some worthy candidates i had a chance to clarify my thoughts about high sec thus

sorry but ganking and uninvited pvp has been the core of this game for many years and has been a big part of its attraction not the problemif you ask me its not any single change but the myriad of inconsistent changes that annoy the existing and dedicated players to no end large part of eves success depends on existing players creating the narratives the projects and conflicts that drive new eden sometimes it takes years of blood sweat and tears to accomplish the majestic goals and endeavors players set out on they recruit and include others in their communities which strengthens the loyalty of the players lacking the inspiration and motivation to get emotionally invested in such endeavors is whats causing its current declineif our efforts are constantly threatened by ccp development decisions if we spend too much of our energy fighting ccp on the forums instead of each other in space if we dont feel secure and confident enough about the games future then the game stagnatesthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
both are pretty slow and easy for a web  target painter  tracking enhanced huginn to hit
i endorse ecm not provoking concord do you have any idea how i would abuse utilize this in wars or gankers in preemptively jamming jammers and logi this would be amazing to kill assist incursion runners
you might consider reading the sticky thread about this in the cp forums
sorry i actually didnt realise this was a csm thread some ass hat linked that post in like 4 different spots
why are you asking whether the forums are going awayalso i dont see a csm response here do csm folks often come to these threads itd be helpful to have a csm tag when one respondsif lore is now being dumped much of the worldbuilding is also gone but whether its the wiki or the watchlist i dont know that any of the csm candidates have spoken much and even if they do will ccp care at all
already didi noticed even in the last csm minutes there is still no mention of the things ccp promised faction war players back in 2013 like timer rollbacks and better intel tools these were things with lots of player support now they switched out the teams that work on faction war and no one on the csm even mentions these items its like a brand new day then people wonder why players couldnt care less about the csm i hope joffy can change this make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
thank you for answering im posting all my solutions sometime this weekend best of luck with the csm electionsregards writings on some formal methods in eveonline eve math  physics blog
i sure agree on the language channels and the skill faucets not happy about those changes one little bit

just keep reminding us that you exist and do substantial things that leave good impressions sitting on top of ccps headquarters while drinking special quafe and singing in irish for 3 days might be impressive but might not be good
have you ever flown a super your prior comments seem to indicate otherwise 1
figured these forums arent the best place anymore since theres better third party sites out there could just them was being snarky
such a tag already exists members of the csm do check these forums but ccps response on the thing has been pretty final as well one of the current csms already has the dump hosted on his own websiteby your own admittance youre not much of a programming wizard take some time to go around looking at how websites actually run in the background and the complexity of managing multiple sites then come back and complain about not nuking something that costs a decent amount of time to maintain with minimalnegligible useill go ahead and throw this out there ive been playing this game since long before was introduced and i used it very very rarely a bunch of better more informative free openaccess sites about eve lore and anomaly information are available with a simple google search if ccp is focusing their efforts on a better easier to maintain lorefocused site instead of maintaining an incredibly outdated rarely used and poorly updated wiki i dont see a problem with that at all
if ccp is focusing their efforts on a better easier to maintain lorefocused site instead of maintaining an incredibly outdated rarely used and poorly updated wikilykouleon are they actually doing this i figured they were dropping lore to 3rd parties altogether and washing their hands of players who enjoy worldbuilding
such a tag already exists the csm members do have a tag but visible only once youre in the thread unlike the ccp tag which is visible in the forum listing i should have been more specific

directly quoted from the official ccp statement about the matterthe also contains a significant amount of prime fiction and official backstory reference material that has been worked on by both ccp and our fantastic isd mercury division this will be relocated to a new home over the course of the next couple of months so that all players have read access to it and isd mercury can continue to contribute to developing prime fiction and backstory for the eve universe  source
it would have been neat if they cancelled the day the new lore thing came out then tbh im over it already working on uniwiki
thats somewhat better then thanks for that headsup
so how is it going xavier azabu are we winning
definitely have my support
eve has probably lost me and my other account as i have noticed a huge number of players steeling loot from all my hard work i know it is the game but i dont want to spend 15 to 20 min its killing stuff for someone to be able to warp in kill the loot dropper and get the loot i feel i am wasting my time i could spend all my time mining but how boring thats the reason for me my son started playing and just in his trial he was ganged twice and had his ore stolen and getting completely ripped of endlessly he said he wasnt good enuff for the game so did not sub
because the citadel expansion will soon appear i would like to move up with a wellknown subject to the csmthe citadels will have within the management of an alliance certainly advantagesthe teamwork within the alliance is thereby strengthenedindeed the even other easy things which can have a huge positive effect for alliances are absent alliancebookmarkstherefore i ask the csm appeal for implementation of alliance bookmarks along with the citadel expansion

commander aze isnt naturally part of a voting bloc he is part of the leadership for an upstart high sec alliance im somewhat biased but i think he is a great high sec candidateits nice seeing established players take an interest in us new folk
of course they do they do need more minions all established powers are actively attracting newbros nowadays after they took care of eliminating brave which was a natural funnel for newbros before as a new player you should consider joining newbro friendly groups with no taxes or if taxes are levvied for the allmighty srp programs then these can give junior accountant role to all their line members so that anyone can see how the corp funds are really used make your choices with your eyes fully open

id totally vote for you if not for a candidate aptly named boycottcsmmike is a vegetable would love a real hisec candidate to show up when the current csm system is abolished
no to everything1 ecm griefing and ewar griefing will be a new thing we have enough grief decs and grief ganks to go around even with stupid amount of eccm and consequently no tank thus asking special olympics ganking team to come by with enough ecm applied itll eventually work and for ewar that will definitely work just imagine a sig tanking tengu webbedpainted in a mission from a safe distance no just no2 put your fat ship on jita undock wait for the freighter buuuuump freighter rekt really that said would support it if the accidental bumping is circumvented somehow there should be a countermeasure to not being able to move for hours until bumping nerd had his griefgasm and quit3 within current mechanics armament cannot prevent even the free gank not to mention actual gank or alpha gank 10 geckos on a freighter would make it a popular ratting choice though4 not sure what you mean about smaller haulers and dont see a problem with current haulers either you can fit a dst for more than 5 people and you can fit a blockade runner for gj catching this hisecwise of course do you even haulall ganking needs is a bit of skill component as opposed to enough bots with catalysts reduce concord reaction time to multiple offenders on the same grid now you cant spam catalysts actually need both character weapons skills for bigger guns and some math to calculate required people count and ship type to gank the target the beauty of it is that it does nothing to alpha ganks and ganking antitanked people is still easy but gives something new  a set of viable ganksafety fits which would require a bunch of really skilled and implanted gankers in taloses to bring down currently such fits are a joke since they can be simply overwhelmed by enough catalysts at almost not cost
so why are you posting in my thread thenand that at the end of the electionsdid you get hyperdunked or something i cannot otherwise imagine why you try to knock mikeas you say the current csm system is quite borked but it is all we have to work withvote your conscience just vote and remember you get what you vote for
if only there was a button to report posts for deletionthis is my csm campaign thread and i have already responded to this post other responses no matter how deleted to remain polite or what are not welcome especially since this person linked this post to multiple other threads why not respond therehowever you want to vote vote if you want to boycott post on gevlons blog leave my thread alone

lal tora pussydo trying againwell gonna laugh when he fails you couldnt do it when marmites were at least mentioned sometimes no way youre gonna do it now that everyone forgot who the heck marmites are
i cant say whether tora will make it this year although i can say betting against someone so close last year when practically no incumbents are running is a bit too risky for my taste regardless quoting for posterity
ok i have took time to read through your bs on war dec system and ready to criticize it to a piece of turd it is1 concerning player age  i see a new commodity on the market  a supercostlytowardeccorp with a lot of unsubbed newbros stacked in it for veteran players by veteran players calculating cost by age is therefore nonviableyour reminder is also a very good place when ccp goes and tells its not a problem despite half the present people rising hands when asked if that is a problem which shows the attitude of ccp towards that problem and doesnt show anything elsei mean if even someone like you can tell its a problemps stating you dont make money on wardecs is the new height of hypocrisy should i pass over to zkillboard and calculate your monthly module and cargo drops from war targets what a fat liar2 folding  attackers also need to do nothing to make defenders start seeking cover and take losses so you cant have one without the other restricting all forms of quitting the stupid war will only make the market for injectors for people grinding up wardec stupidity avoidance alts if you remove options other than staying docked for a week people will either stay docked for a week or quit and if war lasts longer with a joke of a cost it has now is that what you want everyone quitting who are you going to grief then thats stupid3 as you cant even mine without structures mining needs compression compression needs structure nostructure corp seems a bit too limited that said should citadels provide such functionality as they seem from the info it can be fixed with onemanantiwardecstupiditystructurecorp citadel as it is now with onemanantiwardecstupiditystructurecorp pos installation4 paying defenders for kills in hisec is just ridiculous as the current grief deccer spearheaded by marmites just docks up and cries at the very prospect of losing a single frigate to defenders its already a huge punishing cost for a defender to buy and train a useless pvp ship only to be blueballed by some chicken marmite in iti mean it did took me 30 minutes afk on jita undock in a merlin to get 3 marmites who docked up once i arrived to undock and blap my ship imagine if i come in a bc theyll wait till theres at least 15 of them for that within current mechanics grief deccer can fix it so that defender will never get a kill no matter how hard he tries spends etc5 allies are useless you grief deccers bring that allies point every time because of your chicken nature but the best thing allies can do is to camp your barge 237 and still have it killed in process while they take the rest of griefers on they are costly and they do nothing but scaring your pants full just forget about them already no matter how much you bring youre still not getting any attacker kills as youll just hole up like chickens you are and ignore them6 claiming you are contracted to kill the competition is ridiculous as well since everybody smarter than average grief deccer hauls with npc alt war dec me a pator tech school tora7 merc board is a good start but lacks one crucial piece of functionality currently allies are useless because grief deccer can hole up and dont fight them while the original defender still has to undock and be vulnerable to carry on its activities if only we had a way to transfer war decs to mercs entirely which would not be abusable by gewnies because in current mechanics mercs as a grief dec counter are useless8 nerf hisec tears are so 2012 and you still cry them omg to sum it up hisec has already been nerfed all over and there is simply nothing left to further nerf9 black pedro part  sorry i skipped it completely the lack of consciousness he displayed in complete misunderstanding of a problem and providing solutions that make the problem much worse was too much to bearoverallyour proposal is bs because it is1 abusable karmafleet age will rack your cost to dec gewns to the level of permanent excuse to never dec my gewn masters2 based on wrong assumption like that allies matter or that defender kills are possible or that an actual hisec corp which is not some npsi nonsense can do something without structures in the pasthisecnerf world or that people care about your stupid wars or that you dont make huge profit from war decs or that folding a corp not specifically designed and restricted to be foldable doesnt cost more than grief dec3 heavily favors grief deccer side4 promotes not undocking for weeks and quittting eve5 no we dont need t2 fedos or even t1 fedosget rekt son
well hisec is already bleeding subscriptions badly for yearsat the same time despite all the moaning nullsec ratting graph keeps risingif another nerf hisec candidate teams up with mike vegetablearia and the rest of the cfcsm pushing for it itll be the end of evenow for torayou and your lap dog pedro critically misunderstand the incentives issue the only incentive the target of a grief dec you throw around has is end this stupidity with minimal effort and back to whatever i was doing like said before to fulfill this incentive allies are useless ransoms are somewhat useful but as most posthisecnerf hisec corps cant even pay the grief dec bill and youre obviously gonna ransom them for more i wont overestimate their usefulness from something over a niche one no war dec fix proposal would be complete without a way for defender to end the war with their actions and with as much consent as you displayed throwing that grief decthere are many proposals that included those ways like endingpunishing wars with no kills allowing the defender to outcarebear the war introducing structuresmechanics defender and allies can aggressively pursue in order to conclude this war stupidity etc without that the grief deccer has all the control over the grief dec and has to do nothing to incure huge losses in isk and playtime on the defender enjoying complete and uneve form of safety nobody should be that safe in eve evermake a good use of that in your next proposal ill be here to read and blow it apart
mike azariah isnt even running again how will tora team up with him and ruin eve

vote judge for csm xi
thank you all for voting for me
its sad but by following a few simple rules not being afk not using direct warps between gates using comms brings you to find that nullsec is far more pacified than highsec 
of course and why would that be
something like that probably wont happen until the archaic corppos code is finally gutted
reddit and other third party sites as helpful as eve unis wiki may be are in a way a signal of ccps disconnect from its own forums and products read  it absolutely sickens me that ccp prefers to give priority to reddit when posting game information as opposed to its own forumsif someone accidentally pulls the plug on reddit and forces ccp to come back to their own damn forum to relay information to the playerbase i wouldnt shed any particular tears

this would end up lowering all of the cost of what will be farmed by those in those areasso think carefully about your shadow serpentis gun you may sell for lots of money later being a lot lowerits the cry of everything that gets farmedpi started out high as we needed to make the market people trained many many many alts to run pi and prices dropped and now all people do is whine even mission runners whine when they dropped all of the lp on stuff and prices fell

there are sov wars pos timers station timers system timers these involve big fleets and big operations many people enjoy smaller fleets with no tidi and more personal involvement there are entosis links  that should be the reason for these smaller fleets to happen but there are problems with these see below i propose a new solution to allow small gangs to be involved in harrassing the enemy space and this to be the reason for their existance to allow for skirmish warfare  something like what the native americans did small bands created on the spot going into enemy territory  for reasons these small gangs would be damaging enough to make the enemy come out but not really threatening to soventosis problems nobody wants to be the entosis ship does not get to shoot anyone and is the first to die and miss the fun getting to shoot things is very important in eve fleets shooting at a structure waiting for an enemy response is more fun than guarding the entosis ship waiting for enemy response entosis operations even done in small gangs are directly threatening to sov this should not be the defender has to run around chasing small entosis fleets with his bigger fleet sov threat is serious threat the response is always big the attackers end up trolling the defender ends up bored running around no fun sov should be harder to attack get rid of entosissmall fleets should have a reason to form  besides catching people on gates or trying to catch them ratting what if a small gang would be able to reduce the sov indices by rattingmining hacking exploration sites in the enemy system requirements be in an alliance this would not affect the sov but could bring a response out from the enemy anomalies would not be involved in this process else people will end up forming giant fleets to farm them to quickly reduce sov indices only asteroid belt rats and sites that are scanned down would be involved so a small gang in an enemy system would be slowly but surely be able to reduce these indicesthen  if the enemy does not come out with the sov indices at the minimum level it should take  20 minutes for a 50 man t1 cruiser fleet to put a tcu or ihub into reinforced 30 minutes for a station these timers will eventually be balanced after that  command nodes spawn that game mechanic is ok entosis is not ok with this small roaming gangs would feel like they are doing something when going into enemy territory and the enemy will come out  or soon his indices will be at minimum again  no entosis required the same effect is obtained  players without big guns can get into sov warfare if the defenders dont bother showing upthere will be the time zone problem  so alliances could have vulnerability windows during which their sov indices are lowered when enemies rat in their systemsalso see what i have written here about planets and sov a raiding system for planets could be implemented roaming gangs of barbarians looting and pillaging imagine this a small gang attacks a planet a structure near the planet  the gate to the planet maybe this structure has a vulnerability window and a reinforcement timer if it falls after reinforcement the attackers are able to loot everything on the planet and this would also lower the sov indices the loses would not be so great as to make the owners bring a capital fleet there but would be enough of an annoyance for local pilots to make them bring out their own small gang this could be implemented even in lowsecthen  once the planet is looted of ships and materials in building there there would be a third reinforcement timer if the defender misses even this one  the barbarians would be able to loot the local population of the planet and bring them to their home systems the population of a planet would have skill indices  how skilled they are in building certain ship types if they can build t2 or t3 they would be even more valuable  so looting a planet with highly skilled pop would be a good reason to roam players would be making isk by attacking the enemy directly players would be able to scan planets the same as moons but this new type of pi would be done by individual players planets would not be managed at alliance level so if a planet is attacked it would not be like a pos on a moon is attacked and would not always bring out an entire alliance fleet from the defenders
other stuff like this could be added stuff that does not touches sov directly but it rewards the invaders with isk or helps them lower the indices bounties for ratting in anothers alliance space could be increased 10 times for example also rewards for defenders for showing up to planet timers or fights that do not directly affect sov to prevent abuse  the defender of a planet would only get a bonus to his production if the planet was already looted after losing the first reinforcement but winning the second these things can be tweaked laterthe defender should also be helped  even if he does not usually rat in that system the sov indices should slowly grow back to a certain value not the maximum possible  in time ratting should not be directly tied to sov warfare it would be like something additional  good for indices but not vital for defence maybe players like to get isk by market trading holding sov the purpose of holding sov should be as i wrote here  controlling planets and using planets for producing stuff at greatly reduced cost invaders can pillage planets but only sov owners can use them for production space ownership should be its own reward much more than now not a stepping stone to safer rating isnt that what null sec means no empire control the population there should be at the mercy of the local warlord if there is no population they fled somehow to the empire there would be a mechanism to bring in population on the planets to put them to work stealing them from other nullsec planets or directly from the empire but that would be another topic
just because you have an inability to understand the difference between shiny killmails and being the guy who actually gets the objective done doesnt mean you can apply the same to every other person
quick background taking a class in college  uni about the legal history of disability in the us since i live here so its past midterms so we are getting past the ada and are at the point were internet spaceships are becoming a thing there seems to be a lot of technology involved in enabled people to do things they originally couldnt on the intarwebs please note before i continue this is more of a thread to get some feedback from the csm and possibly ask for some features down the road i may not have 2020 vision butso this has 2 main questions gamehow hard would it be to implement screen reader tech into the game possibly with auralike voice over i know gps of yore used sampling much like the original aura to generate somewhat natural sounding syllableshow much of the game can be played within reason with just the keyboard ballpark percentagesiteare the web pages of eve online up to snuff with w3cs guidelines

with npc skins available i believe that the alliances should have the ability to introduce their own skins ships and uniforms into the environment for other capsuleers to usealliance skinsskins would be developed by alliances and then voted on by the alliance for the top five skins submitted to ccp once submitted and a fee paid to ccp the ship skin would be introduced into new eden through either the clothing store or unique item drop from a combat site in alliance space that would have alliance npcs populating the combat site instead of the regular npc factionsalliance shipsalliance ships would be introduced into new eden the same manner that alliance skins are introduced the ships would be designed by alliance members of one ship per six months with a fee paid to ccp to incorporate the ship into the mainframealliance ships would be considered tier four ships and would be built around a specific alliance trait such as long range railguns  bonuses to a certain type of long range charges  bonuses to a certain resistance attribute such as 2 bonus to all thermal resistances for shields armor and hull allaince bpos would be purchased from ccp by the alliances in bulk prices meaning that the alliance could chip in a percentage of isk from taxes to go towards the purchase of ship bpos or ship tokens that would then be used to purchase the bpos in bulk alliance ship tokens would randomly spawn all over new eden from special event sites capsuleers could then take the ship tokens to the respective alliance to trade or sellalliance combat sitesalliance combat sites would be sites where normal new eden ships are used but are part of the local allianced control over the system attacking and defeating an alliance combat site would reduce increase the vulnerability of the system controlled by the alliance alliance ships or alliance faction ships would also be possibly present in the alliance combat site as well which could drop an alliance faction based module or alliance ship bpo anyone could attack an alliance combat site causing an increased state of vulnerability to the control of the system alliances could define capsuleer standings better this way by assigning loyalty standing points to those who defend against an attack as well as punishing someone for attacking their alliance combat site when an alliance combat site spawns it will be on a timer of one hour during that one hour reports to the administration hub would detail who attacked the alliance site and who defended against the attack attacks would be registered simply by a report being sent to the ah that capsuleer x shot at alliance x frigate cruiser etc defending a site would involve the capsuleer remaining inside of the combat site for at least five minutes without registering a shot at an alliance ship an attacker destroying any alliance ship in a combat site would receive tags to then turn into an enemy alliance office for a reward along with alliance ship tokens that could then be used to sell back to the alliance for isk or used to trade witha capsuleer defending the alliance combat site would report to the admin hub for their reward which would be based on how the alliance wants to reward the capsuleeralliance combat sites would spawn randomly and any number of sites up to a total of ten sites in one system
this has nothing to do with how the csm represent the player basethread closed
good luck toxicthe failure of the current csm to point out the obvious issues removal of the watchlist would have on diverse play styles including highsec content creators underscores the importance of having balanced representation on the csm after considering all the candidates i find you the most capable to represent those working hard to keep highsec an interesting place i have voted accordingly have patience fanfest will be here before you know it
gotta love op letting us know who his alts are
so voting is overi would like to thank everyone who voted and especially everyone who included me on their votes lets see if we can do better than last yeari would rather not carry on debating in this thread last year there was also some talking after the deadline if anyone wants to get in touch before the results are announced feel free to evemail or stop by my blog
agreed with last post vote for steve ronuken  top of ballot plse 
id like to thank everyone for their support during the election including all those who approached me with ideas for the betterment of eve id like to extend that thanks to the current csm for the blood sweat and tears they have put in over the last 12 months and to ccp for coming up with a mad concept like the csm in the first place only in iceland however the voting is over and the real work begins whoever becomes the next csm are only as strong as the backing they get from the community get involved send mails haunt the chat rooms start the conversation only with that can they say hear this is what the community is saying dont think that if your preferred candidate didnt get in you have no voice ive spoken to loads of csm members over the years all of them are committed or at least should be but they have your back talk to themfly well
id be delighted if they did id kick in a tenner myself if the project looked like it might have a realistic development goal and business plan wis still has the potential to be a fine addition to eve it would add something that a 13 year old game will always be in desperate need of new things to doive never been against the idea of avatars and avatar gameplay in eve im only annoyed by people being too childish to accept the obvious and repeated stated reality that it wont happen from within ccp
not to stick the finger in the wounds again and again would lead to the impression that we agree with ccps way of acting in this matterthe last information i have september 2015 is that wis wont happen soon reasons the devs wouldcould not tell  a statement that is worth nothing because you can interpret everything in itits strange how easy ccp can answer why we wont get pink skins for our spaceships for example because they dont fit into the eve universe but with questions regarding wis they fall into a kind of hibernation dont ever say or response to those three magic wordseven with kickstarter it needs the cooperation of ccp which i still miss a start would be an option for exporting the avatars captain quartiers etc so you can use them in other programs but thats property of ccp and i doubt they would give that out of their handsthat means for wis that ccp itself is actually its greatest enemy and leads to my first sentenceccp take the head out of the sand are solid objects floating in space the only thing you can accomplish show us that you can do more than that

i am dropping out of the running to become a member of csm11 over the past month i have been hit with a severely debilitating illness and due to its impact on to my health and thus my undergraduate degree programme the next six months for me are not what i expected i have been in contact with the always lovely uccplogibro who has pulled me out of the runningi want to apologise to anyone who may have voted for me who thus loses a spot on their ballot for someone else if i knew that this was going to happen i would have dropped out before voting began but sadly the long term effects to teh coming year have only become apparent over the last weekendfinally i would like to thank everyone for all the support advice and kind words during my campaign initially i was unsure as to whether i would be a candidate people would have any interest in but the response i got when i starting seriously consdering it and discussing it with others was overwhelmingly positing so thank you all for thatapoth 3isds please lock this thread
i feel like i have personally failed n making the clear distinction between what would be nice and what ccp are in fact going to do regardless of your feelings on the matter

a wonderful story sure to delight and warm the hearts of the htfu crowd
i approve of this messagehtfu
failed sounds too harsh wis is like world peace sure it would be nice but will we ever have it does that mean we should stop fighting for itthis thread is a testimony of how much ccp cares about avatar gameplay and definitely underlines your positionbut contrary to some opinions nothing is chiseled in stone do i believe that my or the other posts change anything about the current situation not really but i still prefer to take the chance how small it might be to do my part for the implementation of a feature that many player would like to have
get well soon i hope youll be able to try again next year
