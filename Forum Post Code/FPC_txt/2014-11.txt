tear jar i do think that a proliferation of unsolicited corp applications would be very very bad making the corp joining process take less effort will not help the corp or its people adapt to eve or survive the nuances of its metagame or the nuances of the ingame aggression mechanicsccp does anticipate us wardeccing all of these people into oblivion dont they
i think just dropping players into a faction corp after 30 days will solve that problem itll be either join a corp or still be a fw target sure not everyone wants to pvpbut everyone must be able to protect themselves this would have problemsof its own thougheveryone and anyone in corps with horrible leadership there are so many corps out there that exploit and misinform their members because like it was previously mentioned they either dont know themselves or they are just after the benefits for themselves these new corps with impunity will become the focus of mercs and wardeccers all over new edenand the complaints will roll in like the tide once again
couldnt have said it better
happy halloween day
i realize osx is a minority in the game but if you ban isboxer for the reason statedyes i read every page of thisyou will have to kill the osx client i dont and wont use win blows i am also not alone there are plenty of people who dont have ready access to a pcthat would certainly limit my ability to play to a point where it would be impossible to continue my subscriptionpeople would say if you make isboxer illegal you would lose subs etc but in reality if you kill osx then you would be killings subs for sure i have no way of logging in on a pccan you imagine the legal ramifications of declaring an operating system against the eula ccp surely doesnt want to get into a legal battle with a company with roughly 160 billion usd in cash laying around look at samsung they have wasted billions trying to fight and only have bills and a 11 billion usd settlement to pay for it
its not the software thatd have to be banned its what people do with it
decent idea having some way to see how rental rates will be affected by regional and system population would also be usefula map panel filter industrial index added to the map screen showing where rentindustrial fees are highest would give players a quick glance at where they might want to move their production or overall activity centers to enjoy lower ratesbeing able to mouseover a system and see the current rental fee average for offices in the system and the industrial tax index rate would be helpful
for you eve is about blowing up ships in space by that argument they shouldnt have industry because i dont engage in it and see it as a waste of resources you could simply seed the market with npc built ships just because some folks wouldnt use the feature doesnt mean it would not make eve a more inviting place for more playersi for one would like to see new things in the game as someone with 130 mil sp adding new destroyers to the game is a total lack of development resources imho nor do i see it as new content however i can see what player demographic ccp is attempting to appease with these additions id just like to see ccp look at adding some content to the other player types other than pure pvpers the roleplaying community is huge in the mmorpg communityid also bet that as soon as alliances can custom paint their ships many large alliances will be bucking up to do so and the rmt crowd will grow significantly
in my opinion a large part of the issue is that the complainers likely dont really learn to play the game in terms of all the possible things they can do during their time on the game whether short trial period or longer for instance players being booted from an npc corp dont have to join an existing corp they can form their own corp and if they get wardecced  dissolve and reform etc and then there is eve uni etc for newer players to look at using if they know about itif ccp wants to have newer players go into corps thinking that will somehow solve retention issues i think theyre missing the point that eve isnt for everyone out there this was a large part of the attraction for me  its not wow and the sandbox environmentattitude was and still is a huge attraction for meeves problem with new players is that eve itself is big complex and a sandbox that some people arent quite prepared to deal with while those aspects are a major attraction to myself and apparently a bunch of other long term subscribers it might can be overwhelming to someone not prepared to deal with it and expecting wow in spaceanother thing that this particular nerf does is make it much harder for highsec corps to practice pvp on a squad vs squad basis harder in hisec etc1  duel requests can get really cumbersome for more than a few parties involved2  going to lowsec to practice pvp just means the hisec corpies lose sec status and cant jump back into hisec until theyre no longer flashy red etc3  going to null or a wormhole for pvp practice between corpies is just begging to be engaged by likely better skilledarmedorganized local forces and a bit of a trek etcan additional thought to the quote abovemake being able to engage corpies a global onoff option within the corp for a specific member or role then the corp could use it as needed for pvp practice or internal discipline etc along with the other options given in that previous post
nobody removes awoxing friendly fire within a corp will wake up concord thats allif you read the csm notes you will see that they want to change it to lower the barrier to invite random people into your corp which might help noobs since the earlier a noob is in a corp the better for the noob
a corp that needs a lower barrier probably isnt a good place to be in nor would it help the noob adapt and learn evejust because a noob is in a corp does not mean he is in a good place and making it easy to join corps does not help the newbie navigate the social nuances of eve eitherin any case removing awoxing will not make it any easier to join any corp that has a real stake in the game
the real issue that ccp needs to be focusing their attention on is the staggering number of corps recruiting new players to sustain their personal tax farm while feeding new players terrible information that keeps them in the cycle until they quit
thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
thanks god nobody is removing or prohibiting awoxing
a bit late but i wanted to wish you the greatest frights and most wonderful sights taliah
in fact what i hate more is this pesky suiciders uedama njarjathis awesome systems are not safe anymoreplz ccp ban them fkn allthis is game not work freedom to all god damn whiners and looserhyyayaaaaa

hail capsuleers i will be running for a spot on csm 10 i have been playing this game since 2003 i have been in all the top alliances starting from ascn i have witnessed many changes to game mechanics and content to this game that i love i have been in faction warfare since conception in 2010 i have been exclusive amarr militia i am immensely happy in low sec and in fw i will never go back to null i am pleased with the recent changes done to fw thank you ccp i also have some ideas that would add a more faction dynamic ideas that would streamline low sec pvp ideas that would add game content to increase invlovment interaction larger participation volume those that know me from days past those that have stood with me and those that have stood against can all testify that the terms loyalty respect and the greater good are words that are never idly spoken of in my channels or fleets i respect eve i am loyal to the empire and to my capsuleers my name is moudib i want to achieve the greater goodfor my people and for yours long live the fighterswwwfactionwarfarecomsoldieringoninthebleaklandsloadeddiceandthesoutherninquisitorialcommandwwwyoutubecomwatchvxkzi8lqcw6omo
will be a great voice for fw
hes got my vote
my vote too
coming from a prior military stand point  positivesduring 6  9 month deployments can set your skill planner for the time and not have to think about how much time your wasting by not training skills nowsticking to the plan more complete skills lots more lvl 5 skillsbetter characters on the bazaar for me to make a profitless people logged in to eve possibly slowing down servers  just a guess not sure if it will speed it up or slow it downnegativesless active players due to no longer required to long insupertitan pilots say safe logged for 6 months get put in to stationtaking a major aspect of the game and turning it in once in a will look at it then leave it for 6 month thingoverall i think it is a good thing but to me it feels that ccp is taking away from the aspect of the gameolgaso yeah like my post olga
it sounds as if you are suggesting that ccp will lose to much money and inactive players will fully leave it is a possibility and one that has been considered however there are huge positives to this change as well the question becomes is forcing you to log in every so often to change skills really keeping you in hte game it is not motivating you to play except for a casual checkup with your corp your entire corp from your wording sounds inactive if you are not motivated to play now will you be motivated to play laterskill points are keeping you active not the skill queue we cannot get time back that is why this change is good for all of those people who want to plan out their queues and go afk for a few months they can it is artificial pressure if the game and your social relationships are not keeping you here i doubt the forced logging in once a month or so is doing any better
same
a great man and great presence in faction warfarethe fw community needs to be more apparent and active not getting lost in the shadow of 00s upcoming shake ups just hope even those in opposing factions can see past bias and know moudib will act in the interest of all faction warfare
try op for heresyon a serious note when can we expect iteration ccp
eve is by nature a social pvp game and the roleplaying types would love this not to mention it could balance the plex market through microtransactions for decorum new clothes and avatar items plex sales would go up to get aurum and thus help stabilize themi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this has been done to death in the fi forum already they aint doing it no matter how small or how much real gameplay the improvement may containwait for valkyrie and legion both with games of the year back to back so ccp has the cash flow to throw at ambulation again
it is pointless irritating and there are more wouldbe pilots spinning ships in stations now than ever beforeccp have already reduced jump ranges for jumpcapable shipsjump fatigue is just going to diminish fleet contentreally i doubt i am the only person who feels the same get rid of jump fatigue it serves no constructive purpose in evecoo  bene gesserit chapterhouse ceo  sanctuary pact alliance
i am right there with you thorn doesnt make sense to me 1
jump bridges are just useless now
doesnt make any sense what so ever 1
at the very least get rid of jump fatigue from jump bridges i can understand trying to limit large cap engagements but jump fatigue from jbs will limit good fights in null for everyone
come on are you going to get fatigued when using gates too im with thorn get that  away 1
get rid of jump fatigue or  we burn something
same here its daft 1
this i agree with im very keen to see the changes that have been brought in by the limited movementof capitals but jump bridges are a logistical device and help bring fleets together to actually fight without them even your own space becomes remote and difficult to move around in it will seriously limit engagement in fleets
remove the jump fatigue from jump bridges its absolutely ridiculous and stops good fights
remove the jump fatigue from jump bridges
i am right there with you thorn 1
i agree thorn especially on jump bridges adds nothing but hurry up and wait
1 for thorn proposition  jb fatigue is not good at all
10
jump bridges are just useless now get rid of this
remind me 2 highsec empire connections and only one side of your sov linked to hostile catch of all places please explain to me how badly your are going to be affected by fatigue in relation to the amount of whining in here already
10
ah the dreaded f1drone provi member not hindered by any knowledge of the game since the beginning of time
you want content  a playercreated selfdriven envoiment i think this is not the way throwing the hammer of doom to your customers in my opinion dear gamedesigners go back to your work be more creative like this it dosnt hurt reconsidering something that dosnt work correctly so 1
lol at these n00bs
there is several points of view  some at ccp might say remove jb as a whole so from that pov this is stil la advantage some say it s a jump and all jump actions get fatique some say it hurts daily operations to muchpersonally i feel the nerf was to kill the interstellar high way and that there are indeed other ways too tackle jb use wiin a regioni already proposed jb use within a region doesnt give fatique to subcaps jb use within regions will gave delayed fatique once and only if u enter jb metwork in another region jb use gets a gate cooldown timer  jb cant connect systems that are in different regionsi hate the fact i form up in a system in my region and all fleet members that arrive here in staging by jb cant jb or take the bridge and miss the evening within the csm not all share this view as npc low sec and wh dwellers will say about time we have never had jb usefor now ccp stands at that this is jump use and adds to projection hence gets fatiquei understand this is not what u guys want too hear but hope it gives some insights in the thouggts pro s and cons and the divided pov ccp stated this is all a work in progress and impact needs to be assessed and might change as with the bonus to fatique for jfgreetz core
no
why is my coalition being stupid me sighsthese changes are one of the best things to happen to the game since ive started playing please learn to adjust ccp falcon
as you see someone on the csm has asked ccp to reconsider these changes
id personally prefer jump bridges not giving fatigue since they are huge static targets that can be incappacitated by reasonablysized fleets nerf its hitpoints if you want but let people use the networks they have put together and work hard to maintainon the other side fatigue for shipboard jump drives seems to be working nicely this is one of my favourite patches in quite some time and i cannot get behind this kneejerk proposal
there are these things there called gates you are allowed to use them instead of jump bridges you know
ccp  my previous gameplay no longer works identically post patch i demand that you change the game back to ensure i never have to adaptyou guys all suckespecially you corebloodbrothers then teach your grunts that they need to be at formup with zero fatigue even if that means shudder using actual jumpgates jump clones multiple formup locations or whateverinregion jump gate spam usage is just as much a problem as long distance multijump routes
we should not get rid of fatigue for using jbssome scenarios im thinking of1 a roaming fleet decides to enter a region and harass the locals without fatigue and a solid jb network the locals can form up in the matter of minutes they can then take a few more minutes to get to where the hostiles are and proceed to camp them into a pipe this forces the hostiles to try to break the camp usually involving attempting to warp off due to being heavily outnumbered and outgunned since the locals can move heavier ships more quickly than the hostiles can move light ships the locals get to gank a few of the hostiles and no actual fight or content is created its likely the hostiles will bring an even lighter and faster comp next time to avoid confrontation and only search for gankswith fatigue from jbs the locals will need to stage closer together or deploy in smaller numbers with a comparable doctrine to the hostiles this has a much higher likelihood of creating an actual fight and would be beneficial to both sides2 subcap logistics across the region with jbs before phoebe was incredibly easy you could clear a full region taking one or two actual gates and if those were camped by hostiles you could always divert to another route to avoid getting caught this leads again to a lack of content since there arent ships in space along pipes for hostiles to catch the jb fatigue will generate a greater number of ships taking said gates leading to content for hostiles to catch them or heaven forbid an escort fleet to engage the hostiles3 the hostiles bring in an actual fleet comp designed to engage the local fleet they are looking for content and will regularly allow the locals to form up into a similar comp since they know they now cant get trapped as easily there will be more willingness from the hostile party to engage creating a greater chance for contenttldr the only content lost by removing jb fatigue is that of the locals ganking a small hostile roam it makes logistics for the locals slightly more tedious oh no i need to jump 8 jumps rather than 1 anyone who wants to get rid of jb fatigue is a cowardly riskaverse girlyman manlygirl
lol no these changes are amazing

just make jump fatigue little less time i have 30days to wait now i mean reallyfree ts3 hosting
1 thorn
check out this posting cta the jump bridge changes are great gg ccp
ideas and thoughtsplayercollaboration it really really hinders it  i feel like i cant be there for my mates when they need me fast that really is bad for motivationjumpbridges i mean this totally invalidates jbs  why would someone really keep a network of them when you cannot use them like the highway you built if i want to go through gates alone i can do that in high secbonus4usinggates or give people back time when they use gates the more they use gates the faster fatigue gets removed or anythingreduce 5 min penalty feels far too long should be half or lessasymmetrical warfare most of the corps holding space are the underdogs against the large blocks  jbs are an advantage for holders that can be argued with their better knowledge of the space they own the changes took this away i feel that now instead of forming smaller groups will just hug statins and poses and this will kill content not generate itjust my 5 unsorted thoughts
remove remove
ok whats with all this whining theres been so much groupthink asking for nerfs to jumping and power projection over the past 23 years and now that it finally happens you complain again the way ccp has made it now is great theres nothing to change really welcome to jump jail where even thinking about jumping in any way gives you fatigue as it should be you guys should just chill out learn to take gates again and enjoy the ride we promise well be gentle its gonna be glorious
i think i found my new place to grind for tears
nerf them buff me
dont mind ol doc just came by to upgrade a few tear buckets to barrels
wrongprepatch providence was  people would just up ship enemy gangs and use the jump bridge network to corner them in most people used jbs to get around in 00 there was no gameplay to be had in 00 as a result now you can still up ship people but you only have 1 shot to do it or you can go out and outplay them in fast ships now 00 will actually traveled be through opening up opportunities to attack logistics and bad players now you can go on the offence and not get wiped 10 minutes after taking a cruiser gang into a region by a defence gang from the other side of the regionif you want to be viable as a defence force it means that you have a standing fleet running something that provi is terrible atits painful to see provibloccers complaining like this get with the changes make the adjustments develop tactics stop being  at fcing and relying on jbs1 on vyshs comment about provi being stupid
making this thing applicable to jump bridges needs to be changed promptly the whole thing is hard to understand and it is pretty boring having to sit somewhere after jumping through a jb 1
1 i think the nerf hits jump bridges too hard as they are or were a means for daily traveling and convenience that added to the quality of life in sov null i can understand the viewpoint held by many in ccp that jump bridges are a jump but i would sugge
so to quote marlona nerf them buff us
wow one day and already the complaintsno i wont ask them to remove fatigue from jbsbut then i am a hisec carebear csm you failed to be specific in the op as to who you were asking the point was to limit power projection tell me how that limit would work if jbs were not included in the plan i and other csms fought to get jfs and blops a bit of a relaxation of the fatigue and managed to convince ccp to consider it but we do not take every request forward sometimes because we have fought that battle already other times because it is a dumb idea and counter to the proposed goalsill let you decide why i am not taking this one upmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

tldr wasting my timei think the tedium is the problem specifically the lost time reallife time i havent been around for ages like some people but small gangs dont seem to be what fcs hunt and it doesnt look like anyones gonna form up an especially large fleet to especially blob a small gang gangs like that get pasted by large fleets as incidental snacks  not always cos sometimes theres nothing big in providence to meet i dont know what other places are like but in providence small gangs pulled the brakes off the  train well enough as it was it seemed to me  and plenty make it out alive with loot and good on emsmall gangs in north provi sometimes get a comparable gang to meet them usually formed by whoever is in system or next door and do gangs say in local oh well let you form up some comparable gang not much i havent seen that very much has happened even one on ones but gah not much its kinda o7 but most gangs defendersinterlopers are out to cut throats scoop corpses  not hang about  they cut through blap whatever n runwe went rapeyroamy in catch and got blitzed really nicely by bni we were in snipey cormies they in extra snipey phantasms  it was great i didnt expect and never do expect to come home alive so do people want to just not die or something when they go araiding and how many times have i set foot out of providence n blap oh im in station le sigh again cant cry about that cos its funnyi dont mind ripping off the big girls blouse to adapt but on friendlyown turf with assets like jbs isnt it a little weird to make all that setup periodically irrelevant or at least problematic and tedious and what do we do if as the interloper hardly anyone shows up cos theyre miles away and couldnt form up quickly enough nor could catch us up via their jbs i mean the interloper is already formed why hamper defenders oh well just wait there for you hahaha fa sure fa sure is the problem a little deeper than some suspectquite frankly the problem that is biggest is my time some say eve is a boring game there is waiting and it does get boring this just makes things a little more boring hehe this is a game of waiting really and one needs patience but fatigue is already fatiguing if i find i have to sit and watch a timer or go yolo into whatever yknowjump clones and staging systems are great for avoiding desyncd fatigue timers but you can only jump once per day basicallyo r every nineteen hours or whatevs and if the pod express station isnt some kind of trade hub or if there isnt one closish and if you didnt foresee a big fight where you would have had stacks of stuff to reship into and you cant make effective use of jbs to get the ships or mods you would need to reship let alone get back to the fight then no more big great big fun epic fights just dudes dribbling in from whoopwhoop are we all expected to run the clockwork orange like rnk for a bit of the old ultra via ubertimed impeccability re what was simple logistical organistion and that on friendly turf now its a hassle problemfari enouigh i agree with some things ppl have said about adapting and that small interloping gangs might actually get a bit more bang for the possible pod express but this just bores me this is lost time fleets take long enough this gargles the dogs nutsphoebe is a goddess for everything but this really like the squeue change and the container searches and heaps more stuff but please reconsider fatigue zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzimma go brush my bronies hair now n cry
1 for sure
when i first started eve some umad guys thought me thatremember whenever you have a bad day in eve the right response isthank you ccp may we please have anotheroh yes a harder game more please
im not quite sure how a group so large and dependent on teleportation missed the anouncementsfirst teleportation dev blogteleportation forum threadupdated dev blog after feedbackhopefully this will help people cover ground they have missed on the changes
sanctuary pact more like saduary pact amirite
use gates stop whinning
so many delicious nullbear tears in here
come on  seriously you started a thread for just that  after we had a several 100 postings for this already in the announcement threads and you dont even try to get adjusted just  wow ccp you obviously really did the right thing
remove the jump bridges problem solved
100 agreemynna stop this  pls
good job 1olgaso yeah like my post olga
i do believe that it is expensive to lose a pod in evethe only thing i would offer would be to before player undocks after there pod has been killed is to have a pop up or something that remind player that there clone is not up to date every time before they undock its still up to you to pay for the lost pod implants and clone upgrade though this would be just another feature someone would just turn offfor price i think the price could be knocked down a bit 25 would be nice considering a pilot that plays for long enough hisher clone is going to start getting expensive say 100 mil a pop during long wars i have been on the completely broke side having to wait tell war is over before i can gather some more iskjust an idea maybe have titan jump clone bay have the ability to upgrade clones for free or reduced cost maybe have to pay out to the titan owner just an idea what do you thinkolgaso yeah like my post olga
yeah thats doable and ill tell you what id do id have me a personal rorqual whats your intended response from high sec players who cant have a titan or even a rorqual with them
i didnt say rorqual but i see your point my response to the high sec player risk vs reward is it worth going out to there to save iskrorqual  if you spend this much money to save isk on clones you clearly need to slow down and give the killboard a breakolgaso yeah like my post olga
worth it if theyre free just for the peace of mind to go out until i find trouble honest id be a roaming pvper
i stopped flying small ships and limited my fun because my 200m sp clone replacement cost a 6 folt of any small t2 ship that said i usualy station spin and troll a bit here
1 im not really into the wis stuff but ccp did promise it and i do like when they follow through on their promises lots of folks waited years to get ambulation and it was never fleshed out
i also agree while i do not like but can understand my ship getting fatigue when i warp i just dont see how a jump bridge can make me fatigued1
someone actually making a good point wowi guess i liked the big fights thing and well see less of that couldve paid attention earlier as though it would have mattered hahahaha but is that input precluded as of now and i find it hard to believe that noone in providence had no idea it was coming and didnt participate in announcement forums might be worth a snoop  tbh i personally missed the fatigue thing so tuff but providence is a bit different and so what if were kind of inbred about jbs we provide content  and we did that via jbs  and yes how else could we be everywhere ganking or dying i mean srsly you know why u come try find somewhere like it hopefully we will in what next year i can see ccps direction and that looks pretty good to me but i know i wont be in fleet as much bugger being stranded cos im fatiguedin the end i really would like to see the rest of null a bit like providence dynamic alive hands on for everyone instead of idk dead and the new space race might not get so full of itself with the larger alliances coalitions etc especially if they get stripped down a bit in the meantime  looks like a plan heheheblablablablablalupblahtldrblablahblablaupblahblah thanks for the entertaining snipes really quite funny xd saduary pact i loldfor goats 7o
came to read the tears was not disappointed
1 for thorns comment jump fatigue only inhibits game enjoyment
i could be wrong and i could be paranoid but i have seen ccp make decisions that make no sence unlessyou are willing to accept the possibility that ccp wants to make cap fleets more vlaunrablr to ganking and delay incomming reenforcements in whitch case jump fatigue makes sence but i feel it will chase away players who will come to believe that eve has become a killer game with no way to win in whitch case put the game devs on kosif they keep getting ganked maby it will wake some up in the event some game devs are reading this i say if it aint broke dont fix it
i am glad you understand teleportation was broken that is why it has been fixed in fact ccp does want to create new vulnerabilities and limit the distance that people can cross in a blink of an eye above i linked the relevant dev blogs if you are a resident of provi i am sure that core can sit down with you and explain to ad nauseum the reasons these chances have come to the game as well as some of the potential changes that may come to sov null in the foreseeable future
i get this feeling that some provi fc accidentally had the entire coalition max out their jump fatigue chasing a three man battlecruiser gang across the entire region using their jump bridges
i for one support ccps idea of the jump fatigue
pretty much this all null became was a capblobfest it just makes sense that they should be limited in some way rather than unlimited jump properties
holy crap not even 24 hours in and you are crying like a baby also there were dev blogs threads and the test server weeks in advance to the changes adapt or die
dont jump so much
can i get your evidence in the form of a graph or table i am sure you have some to long term statistical data to back up this statement
if they didnt realize the fatigue maybe they didnt get the rest of the message eitheryou are not strandedstucktake a gate honest    they work mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
why are people acting surprised by these changes its not like they havent been discussed numerous times in several venues
fatigue is good for jump shipsloading hours and hours of fatigue with a intie scouting via jb is frustrating i think we spend and spended most of the time to warp left and right than doing good fight in subcapthe poor scout are super bored to burn left and right
i like the changes should shake things up enough to bring change in new eden keep jump fatigue for jbsarb
 nail  head
fatigue has made eve feel like a vast piece of space and not a small neighborhood you can hop across in secondsi like the change
remove jb make them player owned stargates that only allow subcaps to travel through
open overview settings  tab presets  types  celestial  make sure the checkbox for stargate has been selected youll probably want to post these instructions in corp andor alliance mail so other pilots can also regain their freedom of movement
i can understand not following every dev blog  forum thread but you really should learn to at least read patch notes
1 jump bridges giving fatigue is a bit silly if i can only jump a couple times through bridges before having to use gates im not much better off than the hostile forces that cant use the jb network
how about a 50 fatigue when using a jumpbridge with this you would still build ab fatigue but at a slower rate with this you still try to avoid using it to much but are not as penalised as now
these changes are long past due and a breath of fresh airif your not prepared to even try to meet the challenge but have to crawl to the forums and cry about it as a default response i have no sympathy
jesus christ on a bikethe nerfs to op power projection benefits providence more than any other region most provi pilots are happy that every bored blue donut pet cant just 3rd party every provibloc fight at the drop of a hat anymore or hotdrop every ratter that dares to undock and here you all are whiningyou do realise that in order to nerf travel time its actually necessary to nerf travel time rightyoure an embarrassment to your coalition please stop posting
including provi forums
1finally the eve universe gets some scale back not sure whats to complain about back in 2006 we had warp to 10 and had to use bookmarks to get directly to gate jumpfreighters wuts that etceven being able to use jumpbridges once in a while is a mass
i am ok with the jump fatigue on capitals but putting them on jumpbridges was one step too much even stops the sub capital ships from getting to the fights this was supposed to change power projection with capitals not power projection with subcapitals or am i mistaken thereremove the fatigue from jumpbrifges
yes it was a power projection nerfthat includes both capitals and subcapitals take providence can do a full fleet on a normal day 23 full fleets on a omg all hands on deck cta cta this will steamroll most groups in the game when you count out capitalswill you let the afk empires that base out of x systemregion be able to control several regions with impunitylolz a small group is sieging our system 2 regions away lets form up and run the bridges 5 minutes later you nuke those poor suckers doesnt sound very fair now does ityes the bigger coalitions can still field capital support but they will actually have to think about how and when they do itprepatch you pretty much had to flip the coin wether or not the skirmish group you engage would pop a cyno if you managed to pin them down now the odds are they are notlikewise in providence prepatch if you get a few systems in you are pretty much guarrenteed to have people coming from every corner converging on your position within minutesslaughterpost patch sov owners actually have to make a coherent fleet and give the hostiles a fair chance with scout usagescouts prepatch for skrimish fleets where close to worthless due to the jumpbridges it was more a russian roulette kinda dealadditonallyyou got something called advanced infomoph psycology and infomorph synchronizing train them and use em

papers fine nerf rockscissors this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
agree with other posters here that it compromises the usefulness of especially jumpbridge networks
one carebear alliance cant be bothered to read dev blogs threads or patch notes socked when the world changes and they cant jump freighters full of ore all day long  quit being terrible
no i dont see it as making that big a difference the ganking of corpies was just a mutter point for peoplethen again the only ones being royally hacked off at the change are those involved in it and they arent worth flipflopping such things for  their loss wont hurt eve in any way
this thread is the sole reason that i have reactivated 15 ganking accounts thank you op for caring you are truly an inspiration to all wouldbe multiboxers
you need wirts leg in your cargohold before warpingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
negatives whats so active about logging in to update a skill queuesupers with all the capital changes going on id say wait and see about how things will end up and that is still fairly trivial i dont think theres been a kill to date with one of them just logging in to update a skill queuetaking a major aspect missing a n update a trivial annoyance when i sit at over 117m sp missing a day of training due to rl travel or what not  that effects junior style pilots far more than someone like myself with mass sp invested id look at this as more a positive than a negative it will help younger pilots like your bazaar alt sales far more than any of us senior types they need the skills to do things were just polishing up skills that are already quite functional
harsh but still all true senior people dont really care about missing a few days here and there but it was still a thrill of finishing skills and being able to fly that ship or use that gun you wanted to but you had to wait i feel this just takes away from thatolgaso yeah like my post olga
im sorry you no longer play but you pay a monthly fee to log into an account you dont use and your corp where over 100 members are no longer activewhy bother if you dont play why bother at all simply close your account and let it go you obviously are probably some kind of rish person able to pay for things you no longer need or require
thanks for the commentsmaybe my doubts are simply inertia on my part it is a simple change that has immediate appeal it will definitely help me over the next 2 months as i will have no access to eve elsewhere in the forums i have seen players consider it as just another example of the dumbing down of eve due to declining subscription numbers no idea if that is truei do not play regularly as i stated it is mostly due to an inadequate computer i do not quit as i have nearly 11 years invested in the game and maybe one day it will capture me again another example of my inertia i suppose 
this has not been looked at as a community properly for a long time and all the old ones are in skills and all posts are loced so you cant even comment on them before we lock it down as repetative can we at least discus it locking the thread stops people discusing it which is what its all about unless ccp locks it becasue they just dont even want to consider the option which in turn means they really dont give a crap about usi want to know when they will bring about a mass skil point reset over the years the game has evolved and changed i have have breaks and each time i come back somwething has changed they removed skills they added skills but then made the scanner stuff open to anyone i worked hard at scanning system to find nothing or stuff already used up now those skills are dead and wasting away i just want to keep the ships im happy with retrian all my skills but keep my agents and my stading im not asing for a full on reset buttom im asking about a one off token that will allow me to just redo my entire skill treewhat are peoples opinions on this we know ccp can do it as they have refunded skil points in the past when they chose to remove skillsthis is a token linked to the account it can only be used on character created on that account not on purchased characters and charaters with skill points reset and not spent could not be sold on the bazar you can sell them after youve spent the points but the token would be limited to one per account and non transferable
crossposting is bad as is reopening locked threads mmkaythe stuff people have to say was mostly said in your previous thread lets just say the opinion isnt for the change you will need quite a bit more than i want to persuade anyone around here be prepared to do very extensive analysis of pros and cons to change anyones mind ill copypaste the relevant points from tippias response to the skillpoint threads most of them still apply at least in partit removes the point of having skills to begin withit removes the point of having attributesit removes attribute implants from the gameit removes variety and instead encourages fotm and cookiecutter setupsit removes the uniqueness history and character of your characterit removes planning and choice and consequencesit removes goalsetting progression and any achievement in those areasit kills character tradingit massively boosts older characters over new onesand if you didnt find enough discussion about skillpoint reallocation heres some more links for you
im not employed by ccp but am a volunteer player doing a job in their place still this thread gets a lock because as far as my knowledge goes and i am pretty well informed to say the least there are no plans whatsoever to let players reallocate skillpoints in whatever way shape or form this could be doneno it doesnt ccp actually cares a great deal about us you me all players i assure you not planning to change one aspect of the game does not in anyway mean they do not care for their playerbasethread lockedthe rules17 redundant and reposted threads will be locked as a courtesy to other forum users please search to see if there is a thread already open on the topic you wish to discuss if so please place your comments there instead multiple threads on the same subject clutter up the forums needlessly causing good feedback and ideas to be lost please keep discussions regarding a topic to a single thread isd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls

easy to say someone sucks when u havent read or quote it whole i am not saying it should change  just gave a historic insights in pov as player and provi fc it makes my life less easy doesnt mean it should be rolled back u can asses if it achieves what u wanted its to early for that for now i see less activity and people logging of instead of playing i also see adaptits gona be intresting to keep track of kills and logins jb use fuel prices and so on i also stated wh low sec and npc never had a bridge however living in null shoudl have advantages else u can stage from high sec then again its more a way of live then a risk assesment ccp does monitor so much and making bold choices even more so too come u will seeboudn to be more tearsfor now i see a decrease in incomming reds too my region more security and a possibility to clear red assets how this will evolve in time remains to be seen we do go out more more small ship fleets to travel ground quick pl stabbed no tank ceptors last night hilarious btw also in the greater plan noone can deny hopefully that phoebe shook things up even when it wasnt release null was more alive then in ages cause of its arrival and this is just a start so much more too come nice to see how many jb will be anchored in a few months how much less cap jumps fuel price drops and so on also cost price on a cyno jammer jb upgrades call it dumb i call it pov and dont forget  there s 14 csm with often different opiions
im sure more people will becoming provi dont worryas for advantages in null you have jump bridges you just cant use them willy nilly good change 1
i love the jump fatigue its great
i want a filter for people  places bookmarks i want to filter out any and all bookmarks that are not for the solar system i am currently located at so i can have multiple folders open in my pp without irrelevant bms showing up for other systems some of my folders have 100s of bms
a bit offtopic but a great suggestion ive been annoyed at trying to find those green bits of text hiding in a great sea of everything else
thread
i take it you have watched the o7 show and know that things are changingif not watch
sanctuaryare you guys renters lol 
this power projection nerf is one of the best change ever in this game
this new jump fatigue thing will kill a bit more what goes on in fleet ops and in general the objective of the infrastructures created by alliances and corps in lownull sec i agree with thorn this is a very bad move
i agree with removing the jump fatige from jump bridges that was an overkill thing to do 1
i dont mind the jump fatigue i dont mind the reduction in jump rangedoing both at the same time is not so good in my opinion its using a sledgehammer on something that requires a scalpel jump fatigue alone would have slowed down the large alliances enoughas it is null is more of a pain to live in now you dont open up a section fo space to new people by making it a pain to get to
yessir i do
wishes answered etc etc etc
hah yeah and a squad of annual subs renewed when it goes live
welcome backmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thank you the thought of squeezing mains onto shared accounts like sardines made me pretty sad my only comforts were in knowing i would have reduced sub fees while still getting to visit them and i was hardlimiting med clone fees by the number of characters i could have out at the same time it was an equilibrium but a complete loss of my fanboidom im anxious to have that happiness back at rheaexcuse me for posting such a ragethread in your forum section i decided to leave my ambien rage post asis as a reminder to not do that any more also i dont have an ambien prescription anymore after telling my psych it wasnt working and that i often ended up awake but blacked out communicating on forums when i shouldnt be this thread was one of the biggest factors in my decision to level with him the new thing he has me using works better and people dont get it prescribed unless they encounter issues with ambien if this thread hadnt happened it would have been a lot longer before i made that change i enjoyed it too muchi dont feel weird talking about it its just insomnia
pretty much some people sopions on stuff and volunteers locking threads pretty much sums up why i dont bother playing any more i lost track of my characters i pretty much used to just log in and swap skill training now i have skills that were nervfed or taken out of play and given for free why is it that old players which we are many are back burnered so people can sell charactersi always though when uo got rid of us sages volunteers it was the best discision ever as it actauly annoys me that not even an employeee of ccp see posts that these volunteers lock before anyone has a proper c hance to read them and comment on them pretty m uch its the same knuckle head forum trollers that report said posts and feel big and mighty by getting it locked well i have just cancelled my sub pretty much putting my char in the recycle tube as i would never lower mysefl to sell my characters that way having no characters i will not be tempted to come bak which is what happens all the time going to take my shisp out to spcae and self destruct them for all to see then im goping to find those players selling shuttles for billions and but one and sell it back for the 5k people put buy orders up for them this is how this gasme makes me feel i have lost touch oer the years with the game and ccp does not give a dam about it all they care about is the money
me sighsi get it you are angry although about what specifically i am not clearid ask for yer stuff but i think you are doing the right thing in burning the bridges completely if that is your intentjust remember there was a time when you liked this game a whole lot morem
your threads were locked for being redundantwhich they were
thisjust because ccp decide to balance the game and change things which i might add you agree too when you started playing doesnt mean you are entitled to sp back for skill you no longer use you used them you had use out of them they are still usefulin other words lol nodestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

guess its time to find out where sanctuary pact lives
this is by far the worst change ccp has ever made to the game furthermore there is no real explanation of why it was done aside from ccp greyscale chuckling as he indulges in obvious ccp groupthink about the evils of hot drops exempting the impacts to combat cap ships for the moment the jump fatigue change entirely destroys the ability of players to stock the 00 market i acknowledge that ccp has been trying in vain since the original launch to find a way to create or force 00 inhabitants to manufacture in 00 but it hasnt happened since then and i dont see it happening now this change basically makes 00 worthless4 accounts
im having to agree this is a bad change that will drop many subsciptions
i completely agree that the current state of jump fatigue is a limiter on actual fun but for christ sake people you had plenty of time to contribute to the discussion before it was implemented
all i have to say to that is fight for your space or stay the f out thats how it was and should always be  your suggestion is nothing than another rental programme
i support either option 1
this is a good thread
providence 
aye tho sovless alliance semi amusing that they complain when they dont even own or pay for jumpbridges i guess its what happens when you get spoilt
agreed makes jb hard to work with fatigue 1
i would like to propose an  instead of getting rid of medical clone upgrade costs this would allow capsuleers to have a small chance to escape with their egg even in null sec
i cant think of a better fwlowsec csm candidate he understands the perspective of those who make fw their daily eve game
so according to
more like nearperfect success rate of escaping pods since you need to lock a pod after ship destruction to point it
when it comes to things like expanding the burner missions weve asked as wellwhen it comes to the tutorial missions ccp rise gave a good presentation at how they are working to bring players in and get them informed without a bunch of theme park style missions that dont prepare them for the gameeve vegas 2014  the new player experience when it comes to bringing back old content some things are more broken then others but the pve team has been working towards this area more missions are always good we need better then what we have and better accessibility escalations where just fixed for phoebe for instance however eves old mission mechanics are poor to be kind
graygor mr ed thehouseofed random mcnally and cypher khanthank you all very much for posting support to this proposaldmc
thanks for looking at this proposal and taking the time to reply this proposal is not intended to replace or even be remotely related to the npe this proposal is about bringing back and expanding on content that was previously available in the game content that worked great and could have been easily updated instead of being removed from the gameeach of the original 60 tutorial agents wrongly named were retired and replaced by the aura npe agent after a short while aura npe became the meet  greet tutorial in the captains quarters the aura npe agents located in the various stations previously occupied by the wrongly named original tutorial agents were then removed now all of those stations are empty and lonely located in deadend systems that players rarely ever visit reviving and expanding the original content could help make those systems more active by offering more pve content for everyone both new and veteran player alike these new political agents could even offer burner missions however thats a topic for another thread dmc
im more saying that revival should be thought of as rebirth vs refinishing

sure ill bite im totally for this change if and only if implants drop on pod kills otherwise its a  idea pods are nearimpossible to catch without a dedicated bubbler or ultrafast tackle when dealing with pilots not flying afk
i think that it is inevitable that ccp will have to revisit wis within a couple of yearsthe reason for this is that players of space games will be socialised into expecting avatars and given that avatars already exist in eve the pressure will be to expand on themplayers will be socialised into expecting avatar play by the UFFFDcompetitorsUFFFD of eve that are coming out in 2014 and 2015 in december the granddaddy of eve elite is launched as a cooperative multiplayer game and it already has systems for avatar play at launch the avatar will be locked into the cockpit but that doesnUFFFDt mean that the avatar isnUFFFDt there it is and david braben has said that the systems has been coded with avatar gameplay in mind then in 2015 you will hopefully also see star citizens launch finally it too has avatar play and it has from the startspace games will see a rennaissance over the next few years and like elite set the floor for games like eve and wing commander their pedigree will set the floor for ccp too with the player churn that goes on always that floor will make players come to eve with certain expectations formed by those existing standardsi believe that avatars will become standard therefore ccp will have to expand on wisccp foxfour  the what button oh god i didnt even know that existed brb
i agreei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im torn i love the idea of avatars and i love the idea of bringing eve into stationsbringing stations into the game really the potential to make the game much larger and much deeper is hugehowever the avatar in fact is a very difficult thing to pull off because humans are incredibly diverse things and so much social interaction depends on things like unconscious cues body language and tone of voice that are either caricatured as emotes that you have to type out or absent altogether when i played on textonly mushes this wasnt a problem because my character could do anything that i described within reason obviously in space its not a problem because a ship is just a big hunk of metal nobody expects much individuality or expressiveness out of themthough in my ideal eve there would be room for that tooas a result much of the communication between players is either done the same way i did it in mushes in the 1990s and through talk and vt100s in the 1980s text chatexcept that the mushes have vastly more sophisticated options than any mmo does so its more like the 1980s than the 1990s the only enhancement if thats what it is is that some graphical mmos put the text in a speech bubble over the avatar in addition to updating the chat windowthe rest of the communication is out of the game entirely and much of it is private and inaccessible even if every single one of the people talking are sitting on the jita 44 undockthis is not an easy problem to solve ccp could probably start by really committing to eve voice which will incidentally become much better when ccp has singlesignon for all a persons accounts and eve voice at the top level so that you dont have to leave and come back when you change characters but making avatars seem alive and human is a very hard problem and i have to say that as a veteran roleplayer i cant get terribly excited about avatar gameplay if it means my avatar standing dumbly in a room looping through his standard collection of fidgety behaviors while i type into a chat windowi can get more excited about avatar gameplay that involves doing things because running around wielding various items and interacting in specific ways with the environment is a mostly solved problemat least game developers have figured out how to fake it reasonably well
its a habbit or addiction wormholers noc null and low sec dudes never have nor had them attackers cant use them either almost to bad they werent removed woudl have been a clear detox as a fc i hate it for local defense and fleet forming but a few ceptors fix that travel with less fatique trough a bridge i use my badger now can jump alot
dude csm is like the us congressmost useless group ever
you really arent helping the cause if you admit youre using bot software to run 100 accountsisboxer software is not never has been and never will be a program that automates actions instead of the real person there has to be someone driving the locomotive even if 350 wagons behind it are just following in a giant congalineid have another point of advice for forum crybabies grow up and stop your crying
id rather just have clone costs removed
i just reread foundation by asimov and that got me to resub after some 3 months eve is an interesting universe after allit also gave me a few ideas right now the planets in eve universe are largely ignoredmy main idea is to bring planets into focus as the main source of wealth and power and the reason for holding space planetary interaction would change add or allow building of spaceports on planets a few hundred randomly generated landscapes for all planets greet the players when they land nothing complex no terrain generation for entire planets just a spaceport building and the view around maybe a random generated map for the planet with cities  for the inhabited planets  this would be purely aestetic the planets the inhabited ones would be the main reason to hold sov the sovereign holders would be able to tax the inhabited planets a planet would have indices population industry raw materials to be mined the most populated ones would be the prizes as r64 moons are now a corporation or alliance would be able to tax planets  for direct isk the isk would go to the corp wallet too much tax and the planet could rebel  requiring a transport of troops these would be clone soldiers produced somewhere in space by capsuleers or a lowering of tax or something like that a basic civilization game no too complexthis would be done by the corporation holding the space  through a simple interface where the players with the planet management powers given to them see all the planets owned and their stats it would be simple not like the nightmare that is maintaining a pos network right now  for the responsible players inside an alliance moon goo would still be there of course individual players could also interact with planets  by creating and landing at spaceports bringing the factories clone workers and taking up the raw materials mined by these this would replace todays pi or at least make it more fun more immersive a planets economy and also the tax revenue would go up a little with every player that brings a factory or a mine and clone workers to a planet just like the sov indices now this would be more immersive than the boring pi of right now individual players doing this kind of pi would also pay tax to the owner of the solar system  if they are not in that corp or alliancethe isk gained by taxing the planets could get directly to the corp members to incentivize them to defend or conquer space and planets right now there is a general tax on players activities  that goes to the corp also there is moon goo and from these comes srp a direct faucet of isk to the players would feel more like a reward for owning space the isk gained by taxing the planets could get directly to the corp members then to incentivize them to defend or conquer space and planets right now there is a general tax on players activities  that goes to the corp also there is moon goo that goes to the corp and from these comes srp a direct faucet of isk to the players would feel more like a reward for owning space even  having shares or buying shares into a corp could have meaning then
hey all iUFFFDll get right down to it iUFFFDve got 12 accounts 1 is active now atm i donUFFFDt have time at all to play eve now this is only a suggestion i donUFFFDt mind paying pls note ccp to activate all my accounts so that i can put in a very long skill training queue in all of them and then deactivating them again with the hope of them training skills deactivatedmy reason for doing this is i want to play in the future with those accounts and it would be very cool if they were trained up to some extend pls consider this it would be nice bursts of cash for u ccp if this would be allowed something to think about buinessesly speaking ofcregards rysh
i keep 11 accounts active and i pay for all of them for them to be active what you are asking is to have unlimited skill queue as it is now and also have it learn while they are unsubbedwont write anymore things here otherwise isd ezwal will lock this thread
why dont we just petition ccp to give each of us 1015 chars with all skill to 5 while youre at it you do understand that the benefits of skillpoints being awarded while you are offline is only relevant to accounts that are active cuz seems to me youd like ccp to keep spending money on their servers giving you the full benefit while you give them nothing in return
was it really necessary to post this here and in fithe feature you want was removed some years ago here is the devblog on ghost trainings removal
this is without a doubt one of the most asinine ideas i have ever seen on this or any other forum everseriously this has to be a troll this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
you must be new to these forumsop no
this was a problem that ccp defined back in the day as ghost training people would online their alts and put the longest skill possible on before the end of the account and they would get like 2 months of training depending on the skill which ccp deemed they were losing out on the money for their parties and have since corrected that issue
any consideration of the impact this would have on character prices in the character bazaar and the effect it will have in the long term on the value of skill points
no offense lof but this idea is so ridiculous that trying to have a serious debate about the pros and cons is like trying to discuss the pros and cons of curing ebola by dunking the patient in acid and lighting them on firesome ideas are just bad and they deserve to be culled based solely on how bad they are this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
noalso the isd should have locked this already as redundant as well as cross posting and reposting i could go on butdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ccp has announced there will be an occupancyrelated sov mechanic added in the future they have also asked for ideas and suggestions thus within and without ccp the struggle of ideas so that the best for eve may emerge is onhere is my idea it will be about armed spaceships and battles in space it will retain all the existing sov structures yes keep those bpUFFFDs but remove the necessity to grind through their high ehp you still may and it will be advantageous it will still disallow pingpong sov transfers the mechanic will scale itself according to the number of subscriptions and to the number and size of ships that will be in use unused system will be increasingly easy to conquer heavily patrolled systems will be fortresses it will reduce the number of tidi fights greatly and while the mechanic is in principle very simple it allows for a very varied gameplay and finally a seamless transgression from the current mechanic is possible and i believe it will lead to battles such as the dominion trailer promised us
the conceptthe only thing in my proposal that matters for gaining defending or losing sov will be military ships used in space greater military presence means dominance and supremacy the literal synonyms of sovereignty the basic idea as simple as it can get if you want to conquer a system you set its holding alliance to red and fly armed ships into the system if you vanquish the defenders and  or are the dominant military presence in the system for a few days the system will be yours to claimand here is how every system has a sovereignty index henceforth called si players can influence the si by having armed piloted undocked uncloaked and unposed ships in the system the larger the ship and the higher its techlevel the greater the influence if you are a member of the sov holding alliance you influence it positively if you have set the sovholding alliance to blue you also influence it positively if you have set it to neutral you do not influence the si and if you have set the sovholding alliance to red you influence the si negatively i would think of it as a point counter points per time increment recorded eg every five minutes are awarded to or deducted from the si for every blue ship in the system according to size and tech points are added to the si for every red ship again dependent on size and tech points are deducted simply put a red force attacks the system a blue force defends and strengthens it the more powerful force will prevail and it is or will become their systemas long as the si remains above zero nothing happens once it reaches zero the alliance with the most points on the next time increment will be new board leader and the si is henceforth calculated with them as the relevant alliance blue and red points are now applied to the si as the new board leader has been set by the other pilotsif the sov holding alliance does not regain the board leader position within 96 hours four days at least once they lose sov if they do the counter is reset to 96 hours ccp may deem other time spans appropriate but the principle is clearif noone holds sov and you are uninterrupted board leader for 120 consecutive hours five days you can claim sovthe current si board leader will always be displayed in the system so in case the board leader declines sov or if the si is contested between more than two parties attackers know who to set to red in order to attempt conquest of a systemthe si decays over time i suggest a 1 deduction every downtime sov holders have to use or at least patrol a system to keep their si up little used or unused systems will not drop sov automatically but it will be easier to lower the si if a system falls out of use by the current holder even if it once had a very high index
the resultsin this manner an alliance would have to be the dominant military power in a system over several days to gain sov and it would have to remain the dominant military power to retain sov to challenge sov an attacker would have to maintain a large enough military force to decrease the sov holderUFFFDs counter down to zero over several days the defender can choose to stay and defend making the attackerUFFFDs task more difficult or even stop him in the defenderUFFFDs main systems the attacker would have to be a lot stronger or maintain his attack longer to nullify the much stronger sov indexthis mechanic would even make UFFFDfightsUFFFD between different timezones possible albeit in a somewhat virtual way the attacker has his force in system during his times and decreases the index the defender logs in during his prime time with his UFFFDdefendingUFFFD force and egalizes the loss again or fails at it by fielding his fleet the larger force will eventually swing the tide as would probably be the case if the two alliances actually clashed and of course either side can choose to stay up until his opponentUFFFDs prime time to actually demolish the opposing forcethe mechanic would still reward having the social skills to organize large forces and being able to gather overwhelming numbers the existing large blocs will still have a considerable advantage in holding systems and rightly so as a reward for being able to cooperateon the other hand even a large coalition cannot be everywhere even less so with phoebeUFFFDs jump changes since you now have to be actually present most of the time to defend sov small groups can claim the space that the large groups do not care forand since the sov holders points decay even having 51 of the numbers of the nulsecdwellers would not suffice to actually hold all systems at once
the finer pointssi points are still accumulated when you have sov to make important  much used systems much stronger an alliance with capitals and supercapitals in space will be able to push the index very high and thus make important systems superstrong or literally UFFFDfortressesUFFFD there will be a reward for having your supers actually logged in and using them much like a real world navy that has to be unmoored to actually be effective in return super caps in space provide contentUFFFDopposed to accumulating points they also very slowly decay over time so unused  unpatrolled systems are more easily conquerable and years of holding sov will not make a system unconquerable for years to come this will also result in diminishing returns for having large fleets in only a few systems larger alliances will have an incentive to expand and send patrols and fleets around more contentsov structures will still be there and serve a purpose they give boni that is the plural of UFFFDbonusUFFFD to the sov holderUFFFDs accumulation of points thus making systems stronger ccp will weigh the exact amount correctly once ownership of a system changes hands the sov structures that an attacker may not have destroyed automatically transfer to ownership of the new sov holder this effectively means that an attacker may opt to either attack the sov structures thus making attacking the si easier or he may ignore and inherit them after a more difficult conquest more strategic decisions to make and sbuUFFFDs also have a purpose they grant boni to the deduction of si points you can still only anchor one per gate so dead ends tend to be easier to defend while crossroads offer greater assault potential
the difference between si and the present mechanic or why all the hassle we have jump fatigueas it is sov mechanics need large blobs even the most worthless system needs a valuable tcu this and all other sov structures have very high ehp which need lots of firepower to demolish the ships that have this firepower attract large blobs like honey attracts flies even from parties who could not care less who has or will hold sov UFFFD and to top it off the honey pot will be there at a time which is precisely known well in advance in conjunction with repair logistics this means in effect that the larger group can always hold the field if it so chooses and annihilate the smaller groupsUFFFD entire fleet with relatively few if any losses so a smaller group will be foolish to send their fleet to a timer their fleet will be doomed if the defenders do not want to lose their system and which alliance would willingly lose a system when it can help it the current sov mechanic prevents battles over territory because the outcome is determined beforehand simply by comparing sizes less contentif a smaller group can send their fleet and attack sovereignty and actually has a chance to not be butchered like sheep more content arises they can send their fleet if the necessity to battle over timers is removed the si idea does thattimers were introduced if gather correctly i started playing long after the dominion patch to end daily system and station pingpongs with the 4and5dayrule see above there will not be ping pongs either the alternative rule removes the need for timer battles which the current mechanic has but which makes smaller attackers stay docked or turn around and dock up if they can count the si idea allows smaller groups to go in and test the battle readiness of the sov holders and the sov holders if strong enough can defend their systems without being subject to the whims of smallish sneak attackersalso under the current mechanic you have to grind through massive ehp to flip sov even if noone is far and wide who would like to prevent you from claiming sov which may not be much of an issue since actually a couple of carrier pilots could do it but it still seems somewhat ridiculous to have to bring capitals or a large fleet of subcaps when not even a single ibis within 10 light years is there trying to stop you from becoming the local lordwith si points even a small subcap group can take a system if unopposed just as a single platoon of soldiers can take a village if unopposed well maybe not as quickly but you get the idea
other ideas under discussionfellow pilots and theorists have published their ideas nearly all of them as regards occupancy sov include indices based on all kinds of activities possible in a system from pvp kills over production and trading to ratting exploration and asking ccp to introduce it mission running i am somewhat uneasy about these because it means a lot of issues starting with complex formulas and not ending with weighing those activities fairly against each other as regards an index based on pvp kills itself UFFFD that would mean your sovUFFFDs stability depends not on how strong you are but really on how many ships other people send your way or how many ships flown by alt pilots you deliberately blow upUFFFDin my humble opinion this would also put too much emphasis on nonpvp activities in nulsec i found one particular comment in the eve forums on those activitybased indices which in words appropriate for the esteemed readership here said UFFFDthe day i have to go mining and ratting to conquer a system is the day i quit eveUFFFD 
the larger picture that unfoldshaving a huge bloc will still be rewarded with much larger and nicer portions of space the social skills to organize such large entities will still be greatly rewarded our large alliances and blocs will be here to stay at least for a long timehaving a huge bloc will however not be necessary any more to claim less valuable systems and enter into the sovereignty game jump fatigue will already make a huge step into that direction however as long as timed high ehp structure fights decide sovereignty the group that is slightly larger will still have a huge advantage theoretically your claim to sovereignty is as stable if you have only one more pilot than the other group as if you had 10000 more your n1 group only needs to show up for the timers and you are good to hold sov with the si mechanic your n1 group needs to roam the space you want at least as much as the other group and all of the time and the n1 group would actually pose a real threat to your sovereignty claim as a tiny red group of 2 would tip the scales or in other words a group of 1000 pilots can defend the current sov against two independent groups of 700 pilots only when the two smaller groups cooperate can they take sov away under si the 1000 could not stand against the 1400 which to me seems to mirror the power situation better and actually the three groups would have to slug it out between them all as none can claim sov against the other two UFFFD even more contentwith si as proposed each group has several options to plan conquest mainly cooperating with one other against the third and afterwards stay together or turn against your ally or wage a multifront war or sit back and watch the other two and then attack the winner under the current mechanics the only option is to cooperate with one other group against the third group and stay loyal or else the next attacker will see your alliesUFFFD exhaust fumes instead of the holey part of their gun barrels so the current mechanic will still lean towards very large blocs which as we have seen tend towards stagnancy si would mean vibrancyalso just in case jump fatigue does not diminish power projection as intended eve players are famous for finding ways around stuff the si mechanic would make power projection much less desirable let an alliance project their power to the far reaches of the universe and let them conquer a system by simply bridging in their cap fleet they will have to keep that fleet there to keep that system having their fleet at the other end of the galaxy means less si points and less defense in their home systems making it easier to attack sending the kingUFFFDs personal guard abroad now has a higher price than just fuel costs
and what about tidithe si mechanic will also diminish tidi which is another major drawback of the current mechanic it demands that you have to be in a certain system at a very specific point of time with as many pilots as possible with the result most nulseccers know and loathe while remembering that lag was even worsenot anymore at least not necessarily si points are gathered and deducted over the course of days and maybe weeks and if a system is contested and the attacker sends in large numbers and powerful ships the defender can choose to go into that system for a glorious large battle to defend the motherland which will probably cause tidi  or use the opportunity to send forces into the attackers systems taking advantage of his absence there or split forces or make a feign attack on the attackers home region and while the attacker in response recalls some of his assault forces to defend home turn around and kick the remaining attack fleet from the besieged system the same is true for the attacker he also has options instead of going for a single system he can opt to spread his forces to attack several systems at once possibly in very different locations making the defender have to choose and react this way or that without the predictability of timers which in turn affects the way how the attacker continues with his plans so location of pilots can be much more spread out and spread out means smoother gameplay the whole system of nulsec warfare would become much more reliant on strategic decisions  where to have your forces at any given time again phoebe will do a lot for this already too  and it would give a lot more choices how and where to attack and how and where to defend instead of having to pile everything into a single system where the timer is opening a very small sov attack window sov conflicts would become much more lively dynamic and interesting and with much less tidi
a game designerUFFFDs dreamthis mechanic also scales by itself with the fleet sizes that the eve community can muster  will be able to muster in years to come if fleets will be larger in the future they can deduct points quicker UFFFD but the defenders will also have larger fleets to build up higher indices the UFFFDbuffer tankUFFFD against sov attacks is automatically adjusted by the size of the involved parties so the difficulty of taking or defending sov automatically adjusts to subscription numbers and the power of fleets fielded theoretically if in ten years titans were as common as battleships are today then todayUFFFDs sov structures still an important part of todayUFFFDs UFFFDsov bufferUFFFD will be a mere side concern ehp wise if unchanged or if caps and super caps should fall out of use for some strange reason then grinding those high ehp will be a greater task than it is now making them greater obstacles to flipping sov than intended ccp would probably have to adjust their ehp manually every few years as they actually just recently did meddling with hit points and resistances to adapt to changes in the environment with an si based on number and size of ships the sovereignty buffer will relatively speaking always be the same sov holders sov attackers and obstacles to overcome to conquer a system will always be on the same termswhat elsehere are some more details that came along while thinking about the idea1 sov holder should always get updates about changes especially which alliances have deducted points from the indices and can set automated notifications when certain absolute andor relative changes occur 2 i am not sure if an attacker should be able to see the status of the sov holders claim and how much more effort is needed to cancel the current si 3 station mechanics should stay as they are difficult to conquer reinforcement cycles when belonging to sov holder easyier when not in an unstable system it is quite normal that you wake up and find that the guards are wearing a different uniform 4 ships near strategic locations such as stations stargates and sov structures could be more valuable ie a bonus could be granted by being on grid with them as in real life securing strategic locations gives better control of the area 5 sov can still be transferred the transferee gains the si from the transferring alliance and since both are probably blue to each other the si develops the same as if the former alliance still held sov joint conquest and subsequent division of spoils are still possible renting too if it survives phoebe 6 there is no six 7 point counter values might spill over to neighbouring systems so that a strong system could influence neighbouring systems counter positively towards the regional hegemon 8 migration from the current mechanic could be done by giving the current sov holders a really high si in the systems they hold to start with under the new mechanic so no systems will be lost quickly but with a 1 decay every downtime unused systems will become vulnerable relatively quickly a completely unused system will lose half of its index within 69 days if i am any good at mathsUFFFD sov holding entities thus will have time to learn to respond to invasions while at the same time serious attackers could relatively quickly gain the undefended systems of course a one or twomonthstasis period for sov could accompany a change in the sov mechanic in which indices already change but sov remains until the end of the stasis period giving all parties time to learn and adapti am certain there are important points i have missed i am looking forward to reading any commentsi used to call this idea in earlier publications the tugofwar with military spaceships
so tldr is to encourage a roaming blob fleet in over the amount of time needed to take a system unless the system holder shows with a equal or greater blob fleetalso the dominion trailer already happens with systems come under siege and the local fleet pushes back the attackers and starts conducting repairs to stations and such all the trailer is about is the enemy just shows up with a larger blob after the initial fleet was pushed back incarna could have been an example of space collapsing as the military came through but the alliance was also driven broke by the traitor or one seeking revengefurther more i believe if you had a fleet composing of multiple alliance as we have ingame in the big blue doughnut hence forth referred to bbd how would the system know who is helping taking it back who is helping in taking the system over instead of being pulled many directionsalso what keeps a few people roaming into an empty system from taking it over just because they are therei vote to keep it the way it is because it isnt hard for those guys to replace a tcu
why not remove the ability to shoot corp members without a concord response and use the existing duel mechanic

one thing that always irked me about capital ship operation was the seeming requirement for every super pilot to have a cyno alt for even the most routine if there even is such a thing for a super travelbasic thoughtprocess would tell me that the cyno alt requirement is no longer as much of a case since jumping is now such a rare and hot commodity
ill believe it when i see fatigue on jbs scaled to something manageable or removed as it stands even movement within ones own territory is a hassle much less getting anywhere else in a reasonable timefrom the formless voids gaping maw there springs an entity not an entity such as any you can conceive of nor i an entity more primordial than the elements themselves in its wake there will follow a storm as the appetite of nothing expands over the world the prophecy is true grayscale has come
the larger military force present over time prevails yesthat is decided by the blueneutralred status towards the current board leader as i have laid out above and the system displays who the board leader is so that can be sorted out easilya very good point you make indeed this is indeed one of the strong points of this mechanism systems not used by its current owner can be easily taken i am glad you like it tooccp has already said no to keeping it the dinosaurs are that way the question is what is the best replacement they can come up with

exactly you no longer need an alt now you can blindly fly your capital ships from gate to gate
jump fatiuge and jump ranges are fine they way they are now you guys just need to think of caps in a diffrent way take them thru gates who needs jb if they can burning to staging with a ceptor fyi carriers warps faster than bs so if u take a bs thru gate why not take a carrier

perhaps it is time that you took a lesson in comphrensive readingthe guy you quoted clearly was referring to the risk that if you remove multiboxing completely that its extremely easy for people to switch to more shady methods something that ccp will want to avoid you are correct in your assessment on how isboxer works but the reason you slag him off is wrongthink about it
by default there is an option enabled for all pilots that notifies them when they are about to jump into a lowsec system from a highsec system why is there not the opposite of this feature that notifies a criminal either by security status or by criminal engagement timer that he is about to jump into a highsec system and is a potential risk
salutations and a good day to youmy name is radu lupescu and i am officially declaring my campaign for csm10 i have been a citizen of new eden for a couple years now and ive embraced almost every facet eve has to offer be it intentionally or inadvertently i have been exposed to a full array of eves choices and consequences and lived to tell the tale of some rather unique stories that tie in directly to eves school of hard knocks like all of you i started out very green took me a while to figure out that a badger 1 isnt the best ship to mine in  but that same badger led to me accidentally becoming a hauler as a hauler i worked hard to build a name that people could trust and had always made sure to run square deals and stay clean over time that will to do well and succeed was recognized by those around me and especially my superiors in retrospect it was all rather quick but i climbed and was led all the way from base member to director in two wellfounded industrial corporations i have held dual directorship ever sincei have had to problemsolve through all stages of my personal developments and anyone whos ever been in corporate administration can tell you there is a significant amount of problem solving up top it took me a while to get used to the flow of helping run a manufacturingresearch and development corporation and a logistics corporation as well but all in all i can say ive always given both every bit of honest dedication that i could and can i have had to  negotiate with other alliances and corporations handle issues between my corporation and the customer find problem areas and propose solutions implement solutions review and renovate old policies craft industrial doctrines and policies create departments recruit teach new playersall the while i have continued working albeit more slowly as a hauler and under no circumstance did i forget where i started from or forget those that ive known since my beginning because of this as a director i have always done everything i could to listen to each and all members of my corporations i careful analyzed all propositions and looked for any way to implement them if they seemed healthy for the corporation and this entire wall of text ties in directly with why im running for csm10i need to preface with saying that i have no personal qualms with the current or past csms i as the rest of you am aware that theyve tried to do their duty faithfully and done everything they could to help the citizenry of new eden for that they have my respect looking at them one can see almost every demographic of eve being amply represented but there is a but though and that rests with the voices of haulers i know these voices well and i listen to them every single day between the various hauler channels antiganking channels push interstellar industries channels and local channels i have read and discussed many concerns most of them can be traced back to the feelings of nobody cares what i think and ccp has no idea what living life as a hauler in new eden means every time i hear something like that i purse my brows that is because something doesnt seem right therenow im not looking to take away the joys of gankers obviously its within the game mechanic and silence from the powers that be does equal consent so i wont go there what i am looking to do though is allow every voice in the hauling community to have equal say and representation to other csm members and ccp directly i also wish to review what can be done to even the scale between haulers and gankers and ill even add that miners could use some attention too so their voices would be just as well heard to me my number one goal though is for this gank targeted minority to be able to say they finally have a voice that they the csm and ccp can communicate with freely and openly i realize that it may seem a small thing to some  but to me and them i am sure it is something major given what i have previously stated about myself and being a director at push industries means that i am the right person for that job all i want is the chance to influence and help whatever ideas and positive changes however small come to life also rest assured if i feel i have done a poor job of it i will not run for an additional term further though i would at least expect to not be voted in again but i feel that if i am elected to be a csm10 as ive outline good things will followthank you kindly for reading and for you consideration fly safelyradu lupescu
isnt it enough that the faction police announce my arrival to everyone on the gate grid in every highsec system i visityes it is

its not like hes going anywhereid prefer if ccp had a fatigue timer on running and the sort of public transportation options that any huge sprawling airport offers so that you dont have to walk or run everywhere if you dont want to trains are faster anyway and the equivalent in the far future should be awesomeone of the major irritants for me in any avatarbased mmo is the overcaffeinated jumpingbean guy making a joke of himself because he cant take 10 extra seconds to reach a locationsomething thats not really helped by the fact that youre expected to get everywhere on foot but then im the guy who actually turns on the walk option and looks aroundand on that note rather than running everywhere id like to have much more customization of gait and posture the current everyoneisarunwaymodel default is fine for what it is but a whole station of runway models is going to look strange
i have searched the forums but couldnt find anything from ccp with regards to feedback about the industry teams sniping mechanic they released aka team auctions updated to clarify for people that cant read apparently think this is for contract item auctionsthe current team auction system is terribad not even an auction really if you happen to be the current auction leader the mechanic is such that you are nearly expected to try to snipe your own bid at the last second even if you are winning then it just becomes a guessing game of blindly throwing money at the auction when you have no idea how much money the other people trying to snipe the auction are biddingand mostly because this just happened to me i was even doing my due diligence and staying up a few minutes late to make sure i won the industry team auction refreshed the screen with like a couple sec to go nothing changes auction ends and the email says i lost but the screen was just showing i was winning next time i will take a screenshot at the 1s mark i know i made the classic mistake of assuming this was an auction and actually bidding on it instead of just waiting and playing the snipe gamethis team auction system is a mess and needs to be changed add a timer to the auction after the last bid so that the system can show everyone else interested that they just are no longer winning and have a chance to respond instead of the screen showing they are winning until they see the email saying they lost instead or since the snipe game is just a very shortened privatesealed silent auction then just make it full out silent sealed auction either solution would be better than what is currently in place this has come up in real life countless times it is not a new issue and by no means a new solution implementing this with the design flaw that allowsencourages sniping is a mark of either bad qa inattentiveness to requested feedback or complete lack of regard for feedback even after releasebut please get this fixedalso we need a true max bid value put in so we can tell the system to put a bid in and auto bid any other bids on that team until x amount you know like every other auction system in existence today
take it you dont do ebay auctions its just as bad there with sniping just before it endsalso the the pings dont hit all computers at once because when someone jumps through a gate or undocksdocks i cant insta lock them meanwhile if i do the same i get instalocked between a cloak dropping as my ship is towed into station
if you want to say this is exactly like ebay well its not ebay has a max bid feature this doesnt the max bid feature helps prevent those last minute snipes as if you try to just penny war the last bid at the last millisecond but the other guys max bid is infact much higher than the current highest bid you still losegood try though but please do some more homework and server ticks arent in question here the foundation of the auction system is please stay on topic
thats because people would go in debt bidding on an item or someone would over inflate the itemonly bid on auctions with a buy out so if you feel you cant win the bid then buy it out or just buy from the marketor adapt to the eve mantranot every little thing needs changin
you talking about talking about industry team auctions or item contract auctionspretty sure the first sentence of the original post says team auctions but your last post about inflating item pricing and you cant go into debt in eve the system protects against it unfortunately well you can if you are bad and ccp takes away your iskiesand team auctions dont have a buy out so again please follow the good old eve mantra and read and do your homework
surprised this hasnt come up sooner but what are the chances for some of us active characters to have a shot at renaming ourselves to remove whatever extra filler we had to put on our names because the core name was taken 8 yrs ago but has zero history probably due to being an alt or trial that never took off
its being considered as you might expect its somewhat controversial
that would be awesome then i and some friends might not have to have the annoying too at the end of our names
that sounds suspiciously like an introduction to plex for renames this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
hi everyoneso you have all noticed that prices are getting abit on the ridiculous side 1 billion isk in jita currently as of this postnow not every person in eve can afford that each month and have isk to spend on doing their own little thing i have spoken to 100 people plus and 80 of them agree with me that prices are forcing people to either spend real money via subscription or going to various websites to get s now obviously this doesnt effect the people in eve that are established and making multi billions of isk a month to them i say this doesnt really apply to youbut at one point in the game when you thought prices were hard to reach and it sucked alot of people i have met on my travels in eve and i have spoken to have either already or are going to leave multiple accounts to go offline until prices level out at something more reasonable my idea will upset a massive number of people who thrive on selling s and selling isk out of game you know who you are but ccp seed s in every market hub at say 500mil each with a unlimited amount so they cannot all be bought out and the same situation happens again or put say 5000 in each market hub and every week rest the buy order to a default quantity of say 5000 to stop people buying them all and making isk which in turn is forcing some players in eve to stop playing and move on if this was implemented i am 100 sure that people would come back to the game reactivate accounts create new accounts etc and ccp would in turn make more money from it and more and more people could enjoy the gamei know full well im going to get alot of hate for this post but im not bothered im only speaking for a vast number of people in game or out of game that have left prices need to be fixed at a reasonable price or people will continue to leave it fly safe all and start the hatemail po7

while prices do need to come down ccp will not seed s like that es are bought with really money and used or set on marketccps attempt to flood the market as failed and while i used to lime the company when it was a game company and not a business my alts that i finally got after years of not having any are inactive as prices exceeded 850m and looking at 1b now will stay offline with my own possible deactivation not having time to getisk neededmy alts went offline at the turn of the new loot compression nerd that killed the excess profit from a mission for itccp tried and it failed as the small number of people that can own the market can kill all attempts
o look this thread again
i can afford the 1 bil a month for both my accounts i am just simply highlighting a common topic discussed in eve and a effect that the prices are having on the actual players the people who bring money in for ccpits not in my interest to cry and moan about such a thing as i do market trading myself but i still believe that as not everyone can afford 1 billion a month or spend all month just to get it to restart again out of all the things that people control on the market shouldnt be one of them
the problem with these threads is it the same thing everytime make a solution for ccp and how to approach the issue oppose to complaining about it also this is more of a feedback and ideas thread than anything
ccp has repeatedly said that they will not directly manipulate the price of on the market if they feel the price is changing too rapidly they will act to control that rate of change but not the actual prices themselvespersonally i just converted my last account over to  and am selling off my stored for isk this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
i would like to make a suggestion about station containers i currently have 15 containers which the majority is comprised of station containers with smaller for blueprints and some 001m3 items i would like to know if it is possible to put a container in a station container if it is not i would like to make the following suggestionallow us to organize station containers and above so lets say 10000000 m3 with sections in real life that is a lot of storage space and a normal person would divide and store things in designated sections ie warehouse of varying sizes wouldnt it be just as feasible to be able to set a limited amount of sections in game it would create better usability in the game play and storage of items especially with some items being bigger then others and being able to adjust the sizes of the sections to fit our needs each section would be adjustable with a max number of sections of lets say10 so lets say 10 x sections  10000000 m3 or 8 x sections 8000000 m3  1 section  2000000 m3 something like this would be really useful and handy or just make a range of specific containers that can be stored in an assembled station container 25000  50000  75000  100000  250000 and the only place they can be placed is in station labeled containers and only if the station labeled container is assembled something like this would be greatly useful and accepted by many so that i could condense my long list of containers into just 36 station containers and at a minimum of 4 containers in a subsection of that container i am not a programmer but i can see one of these options at least somewhat feasible in some manner and would win the hearts of many in new eden
last time i looked the authorities were obliged to issue warnings to lawabiding citizens rather than miscreants such as myself i feel any such a warning would be a waste of the taxes i so scrupulously avoid paying

good eveningunfortunately for me the campaigning season is opening at the same time as my job is getting busy runup to christmas despite that i will read every response to my thread and i will be prepared to answer questionsinterviewsis there room for a on the csm someone that has the wellbeing of the multitude of high sec pilots at hearti would like there to be a high sec platform for a candidate for the csm if no one else wants to step up to the plate then i will if someone else wants to run for csm for the benefit of high sec gameplay then i am happy to step down and support them if they can do a better jobthe problem with high sec space is that the players there are all independent there is no feeling of we this lack of we is a problem the lack of we all stand together is a problem the apathy of the carebear is a problemthis i know i know that although numerically high sec has the largest number of logins accounts players i know that high sec will probably never be able to gather together enough in order to support a csm candidate but that is no reason to not trycome on high sec if something is important for you stand up for itwho am iyou have never heard of me i am a high sec carebear i am a high sec carebear and proud of ithigh sec carebears tend not to socialize too much and are only members of npc or small corporationswell this is not the first character i have created in order to play eve i have never been a member of a big alliance or coalition i have never been a member of a big corporation hell i have never left high sec spacei gained my love of spaceship games by playing elite way back on my zx spectrum 48k with a jammed shift key jammed as in raspberry jam back then it was possible to try docking with a space station and to accidentally line up with the back of the station and die whilst trying to fly through the back of the station to the entrance fun times  i graduated to frontier elite ii on a 486 pc and spent my time happily flying between barnards star sol and wolf 359 i should have been studying but flying a mostly harmless panther fully loaded with robots was more funi kept my eyes open for an online version of a spacesim and that is where eve comes ini really enjoy as in really flying transports fulfilling contracts and sometimes miningwhat would be my platform1 high sec is worth fighting fori want to do what i want to do i do not want to be a part of massive 1000 ship fleets i just want to transport stuff and occasionally mine things maybe a mission or two is that too much to askgriefers gankers bumpers content creators stop me having my fun and stop me wanting to play gankers have been nerfed and carebears have been buffed in the past but despite everything there is still no balance if i have to expose my miningtransporting self to the wild and evil whims of others then i would like to be able to have at least a 5050 chance of winning at the moment it is not so this needs changing you say that you are creating content but i dontt want your content i am creating my own content happily flying my freighterretriever around2 banhammersomewhen back in september a number of players belonging to a griefer community were banned from playing eve according to what i have read on the interweb and according to what csm member funkybacon said on his blog the banned players never got told what they were banned for i am all for aggressive banning of griefers and harrassers by ccp but i feel that anyone that pays for an account deserves to know for what they get banned especially if they have paidfor  game time still running on the other side i feel that having a public list of banned players and crimes name and shame would also provide assistance for other players esp high sec players in knowing who to avoidthe central register entry could look something like thisplayer xx banned for x weeks for harassmentof course if it is true that the same gm that made the ban is also handling the appeal then this also needs changing3 new player experiencethe new player experience also needs work and it needs people on the csm that are focussing on it and representing the needs of the new player if eve is to continue to grow and develop and exist then new players are of vital importance i know that ccp have already said that they are working on this but it should not be allowed to again fall into the background as it has clearly already done judging by the state of the npe as i started4 wardecsthe war dec mechanic is broken there have already been talkssuggestions about enabling player groups that are not eligible for war deccing but also not eligible to put up pos or pocos this is a central theme to new player retention and not to be ignored i am sure that there are many issues that are burning for someone that wants to represent the high sec player base i am sure that you have enough ideas of other things that need to be said the above are only the things that are burning for me if the normal apathetic high sec resident can get off hisher lazy butt and be bothered to vote then we can have a voice it doesnt have to be me but someone has to do something somewhen for the good of some peoplei am also quite prepared to representpush issues that other high sec carebears have even if i have not mentioned them above i think it is allimportant that high sec gathers behind a candidate even if it is not me so that our interests do not get swept under the table by the massedorganised nullsec coalitionsthank youlorelei
hello admiral rootpleased to meet you you say  speaking up for us and as such i take it you are therefore a member of the ganking culture besides industrialists and societal elites i always enjoy my talks with gankers too because they seem to have a unique perspective so im very thankful for your postbut lets get to the crux of what you said shall we if the balance is uneven one way or another i believe there should some form of fair equilibrium so let us look at this more carefully while maintaining an academic objectivitygiven that ganking has received a string of nerfs over the years without ever receiving a buff you said im somewhat puzzled by this statement would you please list what nerfs have effected gankers and how given im not aware of them as ive paid heavy attention to the mechanics that victims have to deal with more i yield to your knowledge of the nerfs and hope to see how they have slowed down the ganking culture from there if possible im sure a somewhat definitive conclusion may be drawn this is a very important point that you bring up so i hope to address this with you first admiral root before discussing further the second half of your statement  tools available tolooking forward to your reply  cheers radu lupescu
radu offhand i would say that root is referring to the mining barge and exhumer buffs that came along with crimewatch in the retribution era and this year we have seen freighter buffs in june and something called a higgs rig that was just introduced all of these increase the challenge of ganking however we do feel the changes have been rather one sided
theres also the decreased concord response time the sudden declaration of boomeranging being an exploit hardly the first time ccp has flipflopped the insurance nerf gcc preventing pilots from ejecting  boarding ships and im told the fact that you used to be able and allowed to evade concord to name a few there are nerfs going back years and years with not a single specific ganking buff nor a single nerf to the safety of carebearsif you truly want balance there needs to be give and take not an inexorable march to perfect safety with one more nerftm
hello amyclas amatini am pleased to also meet you thank you for joining in and thank you for your reply admiral rootill begin by making sure my initial statement remains clear here because it seems to be getting lost in my initial post i stated emphasis addedexamination of examplesplease keep the following statement and question in mind as we proceed what was the balance before and where is it now the underlying question to that question being is the balance between gankers and their victims even you bring up points that are more tangible below i restate them and add comments and or questions mining barge and exhumer buffs i have to ask is it possible that ccp did this because the balance between ganker offensive ability superseded miner defensibility  if yes then the next question is is it now even scale  if no then the next question is why do you believe ccp brought on the change and this year we have seen freighter buffs in june again is it possible that ccp did this because the balance between ganker offensive ability superseded hauler defensibility  if yes then the next question is is it now even scale  if no then the next question is why do you believe ccp brought on the change  came along with crimewatch crimewatch is rather straightforward regarding what it is it is first and foremost a documenting system for other players and ccp as stated by ccp masterplan theres also the decreased concord response time is a decrease in concord response time not of benefit to gankers if not please explain the sudden declaration of boomeranging being an exploit hardly the first time ccp has flipflopped as i understand it gankers use this so as to draw concord away from a ship being ganked do they not gcc preventing pilots from ejecting  boarding ships and im told the fact that you used to be able and allowed to evade concord to name a few how exactly does this hinder gankers  the insurance nerf  im not as familiar with this one could you describe it for me please and could you also explain how this goes against gankers if you truly want balance there needs to be give and take one question multifaceted and one statement here  can a freighter or hauling ship destroy a fighting ship also out of curiosity how or why not  purely for fun of thought would it not add more interesting content to the game if a freighter could destroy a fighting ship  if a balance is too one sided as demonstrated with rl liberation movements its just an example then there is usually a lot of taking from one end so as to give to the other so no you dont always have or need equal giveandtake to get balance nor a single nerf to the safety of carebears are you suggesting that carebears are too safe and therefore that safety should be nerfed there are nerfs going back years and years  two questions here  when exactly did it begin  why did it beginall in all besides insurance none of these are nerfs in the traditional sense of the term and this is not me picking at hairs mind you given that ganking plights have been brought up i am listening very carefully to understand the practical and exact nature of said plights that said nerfs remain undefined for the moment and every question asked is directly pertinent to the attempt of providing total clarity to the subject at hand only with that can we then begin looking for exact solutionslooking forward to your reply radu lupescu
quicklydecreased concord response time means concord responds more quickly which means more ships or more waves of ships are needed to execute a gankthe insurance nerf refers to a change where theres no insurance payout for a ship lost to concord previously you did get your insurance payout if concord blew you upwhile you have concords attention they will now blow up any ship you get into for example if you gank a bowhead pull a fitted ship out of the wreck and board it concord will blow that ship up toothe crimewatch revision streamlined things significantly which eliminated a number of loopholes that gankers had used to great effect such as having logistics ships get flagged in the middle of an incursion siteas i understand it being repped by a flagged ship flagged the ship getting reps so concord would basically show up and blow up a significant amount of the fleet if you did it right under the new crimewatch flags dont propagate anymoreyou used to be able to tank concord some years backedit you used to be able to outrun concord thats what boomeranging is essentially you gank something relatively flimsy like a barge then warp to your next target before concord spawns on that grid then gank something there then warp off before concord spawns etc for as long as you have targets now its an exploit to leave grid after youve done something to summon concordthere are industrials with various levels of combat capability from cheap ones like the venture the nereus and the badger to giants like the rorqual one of the pilots in my old corp blew up a stealth bomber with a retriever in a wh once they cant stop any serious effortthere have been buffs which have benefited gankers the blaster catalyst was buffed from a joke into a facemelting shortrange dps platform no fewer than three times in the last threeodd years the tornado and the talos were introduced the brutix was buffed into a monster during the bc rebalance the freighter buff improved their fitting variability not necessarily their gank resistance i suppose you could look at the general nerf to cargo capacity as a ganking nerf but thats stretching iti dont have a strong position either wayi have ganked though not in high sec but i wouldnt call myself a ganker i have flown industrials but i wouldnt call myself an industrial pilotbut thats a reasonable start on the state of things
anyone with any sense does not use that and still does that last second bid anyway i was stung once using the max bid feature never again in eve many would bid up their own item as they do on ebay so bad ideadestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
maybe you didnt read either bid up their own item why exactly would you do that on an industry team auctionso ill say it again this is for the industry team auctions not item contract auctions
well buying with your rl money then selling it on the market is practically rmting you just used rl money to acquire ingame currency thats what the raw definition of rmt is
that and reversing the flow which as i understand was attempted by another group
the difference of course being that it is the only form of rmt expressly permitted by ccp so long as the are purchased from them or an authorized reseller this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
i disagree but see you need to qualify your idea with the word practically but then there is the point that people rmt to make money not spend it dont they or are you confusing mt with this but even that isnt the samebut i digress as that wasnt my point to the op he suggests the followingso what is he suggesting herethat people buy with rl monies or isk then sell said for or back to isk then convert said isk back to rl cash not forgetting the risk of perm bans and for what ive not done the calculations butdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
 summer minutes csm9 sourcewe asked and discussed this topic before probably will again but no i do not support the opmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
just wondering why there is a restriction like having high standing with faction who owns the station to create clones isnt the skill training enough restriction right now players drop their corp just to join a corp where they can create jump clones so shouldnt it be enough with just skills as the only restriction
i have removed a rule breaking postthe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be toleratedisd ezwal
im interested in how you think you would be able to represent highsec when you clearly have no desire to represent some highsec players specifically gankers bumpers and other content creators also do you think your inability to distinguish bad guys griefers from good guys gankers bumpers and content creators would impair your judgement
hey i even got a responseof course it was not from a care bear because we care bears dont normally respond to things like thissorry for the wall of text i am new to things like thissurprisingly good question i expect that the gankergriefercontent creating community would support psychotic monk dj funkybacon or someone similar i am not antiganker in the sense that i want to completely stop suicide ganking bumping has been ruled legitimate by ccp and posted about on these forums i am procarebear there are a large number of people like me that do not want to be ganked are not interested in the content that other players are proud of producing and still want to play spaceship games eve is however a sandbox and ccp have in the main come out in support of emergent gameplay this is something we carebears will have to learn to live with and learn to work around if we want to keep playing spaceship games like i said in my initial post i want at least a 5050 chance of winningi would say that my stance on bans and a clear commentary from ccp about them is something that would interest the content creating community staying on top of the new player experience is also something that everyone could appreciate but let me try saying this and see if anyone talks to me afterwardsthe large number of independent carebears making tear threads on the forums and lobbying ccp to nerf all high sec game play down to nothing has lead to a large amount of nonconnected actions from ccp eg concord buffs bounties mining barge boosts low slots on freighters etc all of which give us carebears tools with which to defend ourselves from aggressors but no real plan concord is broken if a suicide ganker prepulls concord in a system by shooting a poco in a rookie ship then they get more time to do damage on their target before concord warps inhowever if a miner prepulls concord in an asteroid belt but having an alt in a rookie ship fire one shot at their mining vessel then this is potentially a bannable offense ccp should level the playing field here and either allow or disallow concord manipulation on all sides after all organised gankers could pull concord out of the asteroids just before ganking and awake and aware miners could see concord disappearing from their belts and warp off or react in time allowing the concord mechanic to be used by both sides is fair if the gankers dont pre pull concord then it is their own fault and under this system if the miners dont prepull concord then that is their own fault toobounties are brokenthat page that new players can look at the one about the different careers in eve says something about bounty hunter what if one could register oneself as a bounty hunter for a fee and then as a registered bounty hunter could claim more than the current jokepercent of a bounty let me say as i was considering if it was worth my time at all writing here i read through a lot of james 315s minerbumping blog the language used by some of my carebear cousins is unfortunate and shockingi do not think i have an inability greater than anyone else to distinguish between griefers and good guys i can see how you might infer that from my comments abovefor example one reason i want to have more transparency with the banhammer is to clearly define what separates a griefer and a ganker for example if i get ganked 10 times in one day by the same person whilst mining in the same asteroid belt using the same bookmarks am i getting griefed or ganked if i get ganked 10 times in the same day by the same person whilst moving between 10 different systems to try and get away am i being griefed or ganked dj funkybacon wrote a very nice post after the banhammer where is the line at what point am i being griefed how do you define griefing how does anyone define griefing once they get past the my shiny ship got killed tear posts i cant imagine that it is much fun for a cutting edge content creator to not know if he is somewhen going to get banned for crossing some imaginary line
welcome to the racei am the current hisec person according to most and may run again but i would love to see a second voice added to the councilmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
how could a highsec candidate not know about mike azariah
thank youwhen do we get to know if you are running againhi zappitythank you for contributing to my threadas you can see above mr azariah says he may run againwhether or not a knows about mr azariah until now there has been no definite declaration of running againif you wanted to ask how can someone not know that mike azariah is the candidate for high sec then the answer would behe has not yet said that he is running againif you have any questions about what i stand for or about something i have said then please feel free to aski read every post and if they are not obvious trolls i respond d
sure i was just responding to the tone of your op which seemed ignorant of the fact that there was already such representation egum yes there is although it is ironic that much of mikes support probably comes from outside highsecout of interest have you read the minutes
tldr versioncontrary to my first post i dont actually intend to represent all highsec players only those players who conform to my belief of what a highsec player should be
translationi have no clue who or what mike azariah is is it animal vegetable or mineral
the tone of my op was selected for a reason yes i read the minutes of the last csm every page even the ones that were heavily censored due to ndado you have a question about them
um thank you for trying to summarise my walls of text i know i need to improve on thembut i dont think you did it correctly if you have any questions for clarification or anything you want to discuss please feel free to post againoki am not interested in splitting high sec votes mike has not yet said that he is running again as you can see from his post above is he going to declare for csm 10 only time will tell but even if he does trying to mobilise the high sec people a bit well thats not bad 
its worth noting that none of the buffs mentioned by the honourable undesireable gentleman were introduced as buffs to ganking gankers just picked up some side benefits of those changes nerfs to ganking however were specifically introduced as nerfs to ganking personally i think it was pretty silly that we could get insurance on gank ships but thats far from the only attack on our play style weve seen over the years now either ccp are horribly inept at balancing the situation given that 11 years later they still havent got it right or theyre increasingly catering to the one more nerf crowd who think afk mining whilst watching netflix or even doing noncomputer things should be perfectly safe to doits worth noting that almost every time i pull stats for the same 3 ganking hotspots uedama niarja and jita theres well under 1 chance of ships dying for any reason that the api tracks wardecs duels going suspect ganks losses to npcs etc even when the new order is swinging the gank hammer at everything that movesout of interest if the antiganking people who are frequently vulgar make rl death threats etc want to feel someone on the csm is listening to them have they actually tried talking to existing reps if so how about they share the chat logsthe exact same thing could be said about ccp having no idea about ganking  more so because while their employees are allowed to go space trucking theyre explicitly banned from taking part in suicide gankingive got no particular axe to grind with the op though i wonder what his less rational more vocal constituents will think of him the first time someone gets ganked after hes elected
hello dersen lowerythank you for bringing more exact details to the discussion ill have to think about those points a little more before addressing them admiral root seems quite persistent though so i will address his first i hope you dont mindlooking forward to speaking more with you thoughadmiral rootas said many times before by current and former csm members the csm cannot make ccp do anything and i should hate to imagine you are not attentively reading what i have said thus far considering that you brought up the topic or are evading the subject if i am elected i cannot stop ganking to imagine as much is naive but i can represent a body of legitimate playstyle that has ships missions is the circulatory system of the economy doesnt get shot down by concord for doing what they love and is a staple of eve i can represent the people that spend countless hours moving an unfathomable amount of m3 because it is what they love and they take pride in keeping eve going and i can be their voice to other csm members and ccp  and loyal to them in all my decision making because i am one of them and wish to see them fair well haulers miners traders and all manner of carebear who have been ganked have rights too and rest assured that i fully intend to do all i can to help them play as they see fit in peace sir they have in some form or fashion paid to be citizens of new eden and they deserve a direct link to ccpthere is currently an extremist tide growing in high sec it is a group who wish to force their own version of eve upon the rest and they are attempting to subject the most defenseless group in new eden to their will so as to prove their point they are around us every day they blend in to look normal until they are called to kill themselves on behalf of their leaders cause and will and currently they have the advantage i suspected the scale was weighted towards them holding more power before but now im starting to believe that suspicion is well foundedvs that means that gankers have benefited and your chicanery and dismissal does not change the factcan you please for once tell me admiral root how is it that ganking is harder than being a miner or hauler this is essentially a derivative of the question where does the scale weigh heaviestand ill add a series of questions for you to answer as well given you seem an authority on the matterhow much time does it take to train a gankerhow long does it take to pull off a successful gank on average  how long until you can gank again after thathow long can a freighter be bumped until a game mechanic interveneshave gankers been biomassed and new ones made if so whyand why should ccp recognize ganking as a legitimate gameplay and further still and i believe youll like this one why doesnt a ganker run for the csm if ganking has been handled so unjustly  haulers and the like need a voice hence my standing up why dont one of your own do the same  and please know i look forward to seeing that candidate stand up and make herself or himself knownlogic reason facts details careful examination those are things that i hold quite dear and i hope the academic nature of this discourse may continue as such and that the plain truth of the matter may be fully revealed and further examined i am here to be a voice for my constituents and this is an example of that voice speaking regards radu lupescu
hello dersen loweryonce again i thank you for the much more detailed picture ill reply through your initial post in bullet formatquicklydecreased concord response time means concord responds more quickly which means more ships or more waves of ships are needed to execute a gank given that it is a criminal enterprise i believe that to have this kind of response is called for the premise being that were in a future where we can travel entire solar systems in a flash should lend itself to information traveling even more quickly so this makes sensethe insurance nerf refers to a change where theres no insurance payout for a ship lost to concord previously you did get your insurance payout if concord blew you up it also makes sense that the empires who founded concord and preside over insurance companies would not want criminals reaping the reward of insurance claims based on criminal actionswhile you have concords attention they will now blow up any ship you get into for example if you gank a bowhead pull a fitted ship out of the wreck and board it concord will blow that ship up too concord is obviously not intended to be a mindless drone but one that is capable of spotting a criminal in all forms of his actions their getting administered justice as with the bowhead example makes sensethe crimewatch revision streamlined things significantly which eliminated a number of loopholes that gankers had used to great effect such as having logistics ships get flagged in the middle of an incursion siteas i understand it being repped by a flagged ship flagged the ship getting reps so concord would basically show up and blow up a significant amount of the fleet if you did it right under the new crimewatch flags dont propagate anymore this also seems a logical system if the scale is to be balanced then i believe all loopholes should be closed so as to keep things evenfairyou used to be able to tank concord some years back we have rl examples of police and their vehicles using as much sophistication as possible so as to be able to outmatch criminals it makes sense then that in an intergalactic age you would get something similar if not even more soedit you used to be able to outrun concord thats what boomeranging is essentially you gank something relatively flimsy like a barge then warp to your next target before concord spawns on that grid then gank something there then warp off before concord spawns etc for as long as you have targets now its an exploit to leave grid after youve done something to summon concord i wasnt entirely aware of this before now im glad its cleaned up though what im left wondering about now is i hear that concord can be drawn far away from a future gank victim by another ganker using a rookie ship to pull them away to the other side of the system im curious what can be done to correct what appears to be a loopholethere are industrials with various levels of combat capability from cheap ones like the venture the nereus and the badger to giants like the rorqual one of the pilots in my old corp blew up a stealth bomber with a retriever in a wh once they cant stop any serious effort i knew before this that you can put a gun on a badger and other indie ships but their effectiveness is rather moot against a serious effort my somewhat playful question is if a truly effective mod can be placed on indie ships where their attacking power is taken far more seriously im obviously not entirely sold on the idea but im curious what the ramifications would bethere have been buffs which have benefited gankers the blaster catalyst was buffed from a joke into a facemelting shortrange dps platform no fewer than three times in the last threeodd years the tornado and the talos were introduced the brutix was buffed into a monster during the bc rebalance the freighter buff improved their fitting variability not necessarily their gank resistance i suppose you could look at the general nerf to cargo capacity as a ganking nerf but thats stretching it now these are some points that i find of particular interest that is because the catalyst seems to be the gankers ship of choice but ive heard of talos fleets as well now i see why  given all you said besides adding an additional step in the ganking process i dont see it being slowed down or hindered in any sort of way rather i see logic and reason being implemented where a series of loopholes once existed im curious as to how many more loopholes exist and if there are other system being abused gankersi dont have a strong position either wayi have ganked though not in high sec but i wouldnt call myself a ganker i have flown industrials but i wouldnt call myself an industrial pilotbut thats a reasonable start on the state of things again im very glad you gave a clearer state of things i can see a lot more productive conversation stemming from it regards radu lupescu
i remember saying two years ago that the reason highsec now deals with only fanatics is because it has become extremely difficult from anyone to make a profit from suicide ganking before you would have multiple casual groups killing a hauler here and there just to see what drops and maybe make a killing from it now only the new order and the clusterfuck coalition who are working together for numbers have the level of organization to gank sustainably and all day long without stopping to recover costs the extremism and toxicity the community faces in my opinion come as a result of forcing your average pirate out of business and you are left with fanatics who gank as a matter of passion and ideology of how the game should be playeda playing field that makes it nearly impossible for smaller casual groups of highsec pirates to gank will result in only highly organized groups remaining on the board what you currently face is simply malcanis law all over againi have no complaints about actual ganking mechanics we have always taken them into our stride and adapted our organizations to them though it seems to me that the mechanics are secondary what highsec wants is safety for the gankings to stop i dare say the haulers will never be satisfied until they are actually safethe real issue is that the gankers want your goods and income to be vulnerable to assault should it take a small army of volunteers drawn from a 50 thousand character coalition just to sink a heavily tanked freighter when that is the case your political and social situation becomes highsec vs the cfc game mechanics wise one more ehp buff will not save any freighter the new order and the cfc have the political clout and resources to conscript one more dps pilot one more bumper one more scout one more spy faster than you can say change the game mechanicson the other hand i know that hauling is probably one of the most boring jobs in the world though it is a necessary one coming from me i would still cringe to see them asking to be able to fly solo safely one of the best scenarios would be for haulers to recognize and adapt to the dangers of flying in space  which should go beyond fitting a tank and going afk your average welladapted hauler uses cloaks scouts exit cynos spies and every tool at their disposal and when people have to drive freighters through places like nullsec escort fleets are an item as well as wormholesi look forward to hearing more of your thoughts on this issue and hope to blow up more of your stuff
first of all id like to congratulate radu on stepping up and wish him all the best for his campaigni admit i was a bit surprised that the discussion went right into highsec ganking as logistics is a topic that for once actually isnt exclusive for any particular security area in eve its one of the major topics that intertwines so heavily with almost every other activitiy in eve that its good to see someone taking a step for more representation of iti am not following the statement of fanatics when it comes to the big organized groups of gankers  all that is just the marketing aspect to sell it well enough to others every major ops in eve has and will always be fuelled by economical ideas and profits as long as a certain group will control the gank market it will also control bluefees and who passes through and who not face it  this is about large scale market influence and control  not about a philosophy how to play the game the common pilot in that group might like to blow up things  but the minds behind the overall ops are interested in protecting their own market shares and income primarilyi do agree a lot to the argument though that it has put a entire group of players out of business  the original pirates who would pose a threat on a decent level that could be dealt with equally for both involved parties and they made the game fun and interesting after all because you had at least 2 choices how to deal with them buckle up and arm yourself well enough or avoidance of them the current state of ganking basically leaves only one option avoidance so why this change its not the mechanics  they have not changed that heavily at all when we look honestly at it its the players level of knowledge that has changed the acceptance for other player groups and the understanding or the lack of it of how much time goes into something hauling aka logistics is a time intensive process  as is mining and every other industry related activity a gank just takes a few minutes especially when its setup around a major trade hub where refits are easily accessible  a standard hauling trip easily takes 30 minutes to an hour so we are looking at a time used ratio of 13 herewhy is this important as an argument because its player time  real world time used not some artificial currency but real value as calculating isk per hour has become very popular and more and more dominant in players decision process what to choose as activity in eve the skill investment to fly those levels of industrials plus the time for each trip  the payment at all for a common hauler pilot in eve ccp has over the years introduced more and more content and abilities to play eve solo  but that doesnt account for industrial pilots quite the contrary with the current state of gankingi have stated this in other threads as well  the current mechanics for high sec dont really reflect properly how the empires should react to those kinds of activities in their space concord right now only reacts  which is great and shouldnt change but additional standing losses like podding and aggression in low sec should be seriously on the list for highseci do not want a safe high sec  but i want a high sec that acts and performs like i would expect it to do when looking at lore and story i expect to be evicted after several attempts of robbery  theft and aggression i want corporations to hate me when i blow things up in their controlled systems  because i scare away their customers
dwissi offhand id say you grossly underestimate the effort and opportunity costs that go into a gankif you are especially worth ganking we were probably stalking you since you hit undock most likely from the trade hubs with a bunch of neutral alts with passive targetters your trip in space would be as long as oursthen the logistics of ganking are a thing of itself sometimes it is outsourced to other haulers most of the time someone inhouse has to grab a freighter and do it themselvesthen for the actual manpower of the gank it is probably a matter of forming up getting all the timing and coordination together and then pushing f1 we have to hold you down first of course gank fcs are heroes among men it isnt a time ratio of 31 for most of the time the dps spends docked we are scanning scouting stalking setting up bumps ive once tornado ganked without bumpers 8 of us spent 3 hours stalking one 6 billion isk raven just to warp in push f1 and make it explode and then the loot payment came out to something like 25 mil per man that was probably the last time i ganked with a small casual groupon the freighterscale chasing down a specific freighter is a crazy hunt from one end of highsec to the other you undock with something valuable everything chases you it can be rather stressful to be honest
hello allvery interesting last few points here nice to meet you dwissi and thank you for joiningamyclas amatini must admit the initial effects of your latest post were quite profound it combines history with logic and addresses reasons it also draws a natural conclusion all in all it affirmed a past current and future state of things but after reflecting on it further my mental faculties caught up with me and i realized why there is great fault in your conclusions you see irl im currently pursuing a masters degree of military history so whenever i have the opportunity to reflect on historys teachings regarding military based matters be they the artificial history of a video game or fiction  or be it rl history i ask myself what is the pattern so although your assessment of the past and current affairs are quite astute there is flaw in the future you depict ill start with a short digression here by saying something that ive wanted to say since the beginning it is in accord with what you and dwissi have said too i feel incredibly bad for pirates these days not that theyd want such sympathy  but i must agree there was something honorable about piracy and you did have a more clearly defined choice with them as dwissi pointed out  not the onesidedness seen today i wish to also add that ccp endorsed this class and clearly has a problem of keeping it alive in light of gankers that is likely harder to resolve than balancing the scale between ganker and gankvictim with that said lets go onaccording a may 14th 2013 daily nexus article an online newspaper by the university of california santa barbara eve online saw a peek in subscriptions that year sitting at 500000 you claim that the cfc has some 50000 members code has according to its membership list of their ingame corporation attributes 888116412241 equaling  289 members and both parties recognize that they are well allied with one another therefore the numbers are as well none of this takes alts into account but for the sake of keeping the numbers clear we have to pretend they dont exist this means that the current ruling hs body of gankers can be at its greatest one tenth of the eve online membershipi will also like to address that the 164 you see in the list above is the new order logistics of course the cfc has quite a few haulers as well all in this means that my wishing to represent haulers extends to the haulers in both entities as well go haulersnow where does history play into thisgiven the nature of ganking as we both agree that it is a sport for extremists  be it religious philosophical or political the end game is to have things their way the only way that this can be done is by causing a surreptitious chaos and then after a period of time implementing their own form of government now there are two problems with this 1 eves landscape will always change socially politically and economically2 a government formed on open tyranny is always met with an ill end tldr as to why this is truelooking further your use of malcanis law also plays against your argument by overlooking the obvious a small example will help illustrate the point recently i was recruiting for a corporation in which i am not a director and a goon knocked on my door it puzzled me because the context was that i was recruiting for a hs industrial corp like all of you i had the thought of awoxer but talking with the fellow revealed some interesting points he had informed me that in order to make decent money in cfc ns it was necessary for one to have an initial investment with which to create a means of profitability he pointed to the need of a pos for moongoo a carrier for ratting and so on he further informed me that his wallet hadnt risen above 500mil for quite some time whether his story was true or not is besides the point the point is that malcanis law works for the elite of eve online not the common man or woman i am sure it is safe to assume that the majority of both ganking entities are common players and when subscription payment becomes an issue the common man walks away to go find moneyyou also forget to take into account that the cfc cant last forever and same with code today it is those entities but in the future it will be others this is eve after allthen you have to remember that it is you who are making ganking a common theme that we are all learning from and slowly adapting to over time the new players of today will use your same weapons against you and the integrity of hs will consist of people running gankers out of town sooner or laterthereby when i say i wish to balance the scale i am looking both at the current situation and at the future as well as a representative for my constituents i will seek to help nature take its course and whatever means necessary to tighten loopholes and balance the tide ganking is a self generating fad and if you look at what i have said carefully you will see that everyone from ccp to the csm to the player body will help it go back from whence it came and restore the balance and perspective of ganking being what it has always been something that people gather for to do whenever they see an occasional  financial  opportunistic  victim that is fair balance and a couple years from now maybe even tomorrow whether i had a play in it or not things will change and balance will be restored meanwhile all we can do is help it alongeven though ganking is forcing change that weeds out its cause the future of eve online is very bright and i hope to represent my constituents while this happens perhaps beyond as well if both they and i see that to be necessary from null sec to high sec im here to represent them allregards radu lupescu
im told a ganker alt can be trained fairly quickly but i have no idea on the details  as with my posting i gank with my maintime to execute a gank from the target being identifed to it going boom or not varies quite a bit though in most cases the target has sufficient time to get awayhopefully you already know the answer to your next question given that youre clearly going to be lobbying for further nerfs to our playstyle in case your question is serious the answer is 15 minutesif a freighter can be bumptackled in the first place which generally doesnt happen to competent aware pilots you obviously know that game mechanics dont kick in at all one would hope that youre also aware of the assorted ways that a pilot can get out of this situation  theyre well documented in various threads on this site and im sure someone of your obvious resources can locate themi have no personal knowledge of any ganker ever recycling an alt those who do deserve what they get when ccp catches themccp do recognise ganking as legitimate gameplayim surprised at your final question gankers are a minority  just how do expect us to get a niche candidate elected more to the point why should we have to when youre running as a highsec candidate were highsec residents so you should be representing us as much as any other group
amyclas i was certainly not underestimating it  but i consider the chase version more the exception than the rule of ganks most of the ganks the majority is referring to happens around or in major hub areas  what you describe would be part of a smal
im told a ganker alt can be trained fairly quickly but i have no idea on the details  as with my posting i gank with my main i believe finding a more exact answer to this question is pertinent so as to show the difference between how long it takes to train a ganker versus how long it take to train a freighter pilottime to execute a gank from the target being identifed to it going boom or not varies quite a bit though in most cases the target has sufficient time to get away this doesnt answer the question ill rephrase what is the longest amount of time it takes to gank and what is the shortest that answer should suffice insteadhopefully you already know the answer to your next question given that youre clearly going to be lobbying for further nerfs to our playstyle in case your question is serious the answer is 15 minutes thus far it has been established that ganking hasnt received any nerfs rather the criminal system has been updated and former loopholes unhealthy things those have been closed so ill be looking at what are other loopholes and potential abuses and how they can be corrected for the betterment of eve which is something im told most gankers say they want to begin with so it takes 15 minutes for a ganker to go from having destroyed a freighter to being ready to destroy another one as to where it takes substantially more time for a player to replace a freighter sometimes they have to mine for a week before they can haul again i wonder what can be done to balance this discrepancy theres a chance that nothing can be done but if there is potential for it i wonder what that would beif a freighter can be bumptackled in the first place which generally doesnt happen to competent aware pilots you obviously know that game mechanics dont kick in at all one would hope that youre also aware of the assorted ways that a pilot can get out of this situation  theyre well documented in various threads on this site and im sure someone of your obvious resources can locate them of course my questions are equally intended to both help inform a public that may not be aware as well as having people admit the truth for the sake of clarity which is necessary for proper discourse regardless of any spin the fact remains that there is not a single game mechanic regarding bumping this means hypothetically that a player who flies a freighter is potentially being subjected to not being able to play the game at all because he is stuck in a permabump so to speak meanwhile though the bumper is also spending equal amount of time as the freighter pilot due to the requirements of bumping the bumper can hold a freighter hostage as many hours as needed until a ganking squad arrives to sack the freighter this is obviously then a loophole and should be corrected for the integrity of the game again a point that code and the like make to justify themselvesi have no personal knowledge of any ganker ever recycling an alt those who do deserve what they get when ccp catches them i agree entirely i wonder if there has ever been a closer examination into thisccp do recognise ganking as legitimate gameplay can you show me where they have incorporated it into the game lore or where they state it as a career choice for a new pilot or point to a ganking mission storyline or show me a ship tree for itim surprised at your final question gankers are a minority  just how do expect us to get a niche candidate elected more to the point why should we have to when youre running as a highsec candidate were highsec residents so you should be representing us as much as any other group by this point in time i have been led to understand that regardless of mechanic change gankers will always be able to produce that one more pilot that is needed to overcome a mechanic i have also been led to understand that the cfc has 50000 people to choose from in order to escalate ganking as they see fit it is therefore easy to conclude that someone has the entire ganking coalition of the cfc and the code alliance to back them up that sounds like an ample voting body to me as stated i am here to represent haulers first and also the gank targeted demographic as well logically some haulers must be gankers but not all gankers are haulers  though i can represent industry i am not eying for hs i am aiming to represent haulers in all the sec spaces therefore i am not strictly a hs candidate but an allsec candidate for haulers  it happens that hs haulers require the most attention out of the lot and thats simply because of the ganking issue in conjunction with this issue are others who are forced to play eve online as gankers wish gankers victims therefore i do not represent gankers mind you i am not seeking to punish gankers im simply aiming to close loopholes and help however i can to maintain eves integrityregards radu lupescu
to add something i would generally like to see regarding logistics is an old request actually drones for industrials it is beyond my personal comprehension that this has never been pushed for decently on a larger plane almost every ship in eve has the ability to both be an active attacker and defender  just not industrials mining ships have a drone bay that allows them to protect themselves besides passive tanking  why not all the other industrialsin a real world that would function like eve that would definitely be the first thing to happen to a logistics hull  a drone bay i have been a long time in the navy and the concept can be easily applied to eve  at least when it comes to common usage of different ship models auxiliary ships are the procurer for minor vessels that dont have the storage capacity themselves these type of ships are capable of defending themselves beyond just being fitted with thick armor plating they are illequipped for a long term fight but can wield enough fire power to scare lesser attackers awayin eve that correlates to a drone bay basically instead of changing the hulls to provide more effective hitpoints only there should be a way to fit a industrial as flexible as a regular ship  including the ability for active defences like drones this need applies to every security level in eve  for some areas more tank would be considered necessary where in other areas more active defense would be the thing to go for a limitation of high slots and turret points would still make them industrials in their main role but would allow for more flexibility for solo players or smaller groups  thus balancing the need for group and solo play
if you seriously believe that the cfc as a whole cares one iota about highsec gankers then youve been inhaling way to much carebear propaganda
two things here1 would you then please inform us regarding the nature of the relationship between the cfc and code i ask this because i have heard several accounts of code saying they are allied with or however you wish to phrase it the cfc your statement thereby does not parallel this claim and therefore beckons that question2 would you please reply to post 18regards rl
o dwissii believe this is a very good idea it directly parallels albeit more seriously a comment that i made earlier regarding the defensibility and solo standing capabilities of hauling ships it makes perfect evesense and would help haulers with ganking i do imagine ill also add why is it that in the mammoth design that a freighter entails thinking about it realistically it does not have midslots highslots and rigslots every single ship in eve has that including industrial ships orca  the like but freighters do not granted one may imagine that for every slot used there should amply be a cargohold reduction of some kind but these are if thought about in the real world ramifications as we do with other ships enormous ships in scale i believe it would be justified for them to be brought more realistically into the eve ship treeline with the proposed i also imagine that it would make a big difference in making the scale even between haulers in this case freighters and gankers1 dwissi rl
what do you think the cause of ganking that is being weeded out is thenalso i dont quite see how one exam poor struggling goon relates to all of this
mr amatini was anticipating that you would have replied to the entirety of post 15 rather then pulling a quote out of the greater context in which it makes senseill repost a quote from it post 15 that should answer both of your points though and truly hope youll reengage the source post 15emphasis addedrelated quote from post 12 your post rl
so you would agree that more needs to be done to help smaller ganking entities otherwise code and cfc remain the only powers capable of fielding the manpower needed for say sinking a freighteralso i dont understand what you mean by open tyranny everyone in eve tries to vie for power over each other is slaughtering highsec miners and haulers part of your definition of tyranny
mr amatin1 i believe that by balancing the scale between gankers and carebears which up to this point has proven to be in favor of gankers is what will remove the grip that larger entities hold on ganking thereby in curbing the advantage that gankers have you help smaller ganking entities have equal footing with larger ones 2 the declaration from code and its membership insinuates that they are to be responsible of a new government in hs not only does this go against the storyline of the npc empires being the ones to rule and enforce hs law but it also goes against the nature of hs in general no player held sovereignty and given the intention though they will not be able to hold sov in hs they would assumed it to be their space all the same as they already have yet this perversion of the game is one that would be far more tolerable if the scale was balanced given what i have just stated the open tyranny is in effect codes statement and attempt to enforce it further as ive already said the only sustainable means for this is a form of government once this is solidified presumably with james 315 as the figurehead of hs the previously stated preceptspost 15 of what would follow take placeif you do not wish to endeavor in replying to post 15 that is quite alright i get the feeling someone else may venture to pick up that discussionregards rl
but but but eve online is all about having consequences on other peoples gameplayits been said to many times i know but there i said it againtell us more about how one more nerf will somehow save you from gankers that are forced to ever increase their level of organizationone solo player will never be able to defeat a small army thats out to get them not unless you are actually very very good at all aspects of pvp and are situationally aware at all times
good job
it is not about nerfing it is about having the same chances see concordif you have any specific questions i will be happy to answer them
no gamemasters confirmed this is legitimate gameplay
okay your main idea is that some sort of balance between miners and gankers must be maintained and that both sides must have equal opportunities for success fair enoughwhat i would like to hear is your specific ideas on the issue what exactly in the game mechanics should be changed to make such a balance workmy second question is what is your opinion about those of the highsec carebears who make zero effort to ensure their safety but feel entitled to protection provded by someone else
thank you for your questionsthe ganker vs minerfreighter issue is always the one that gets the most attentions on the forums because my carebear cousins keep on coming here and whining  at the moment the opportunities are not equal because some of the systems in place are broken i know we will never be able to implement anything that will save us from our own stupidity not watching dscan making sensible fitting choices et cetera ccp falcon quite clearly stated that ccp are not responsible for our safety and i am not yet stupid enough to stand there and say but mr falcon we really want it please what exactly in game mechanics well for example i would like to see a fix to the bounty system so that players actively engaging in bounty hunting as opposed to whoring off concord or other killmails get a better payout than the bad one at the moment that alone i think would make some difference in defences or finding people willing to sit around in asteroid belts waiting for the other good guys to show up i have some ideas that might work better than the current system but i think that ccp with their knowledge of the game etc should be capable of coming up with functioning valid changes and it is up to the csm to not let them forget about the issueand then there are other issues one could discuss eg the spawning of ice monotonous regularity always the same system always the same time if it was a bit more random then we carebears might have to move around a bit those trying to gank us might also have to move around a bit encouraging mobility encourages an increase in interactions with other players and also increases the chances that i might land in a system that doesnt already have its own hard and fast ganker team installedat this point i must say that i have done a lot of thinking about these things i would not be committed to pushing all my crazy ideas through the important thing is that someone is there especially if mr azaria is not running again to see that high sec does get the attention it deserves this is a complete and utter failure of the new player experience and that is in my opinion one of the biggest problems facing high sec today the fact that it is possible for someone who wants to play a space ship game to come here and undock and not know that they have to take care of themselves and that there are the other good guys out there that want to kill them at the moment it is possible to download eve undock and fly around without actually knowing anything about the gamei also think one of the things that misleads some people is that the space is divided into high security low security and null security changing the names to remove the word security might also lead to some of us carebears not expecting to be secure there sad but true
thank you for the correction i missed that one for i do indeed know people that say they got warned off maybe then for the other reasons that gm stated i shall be bookmarking that postone of the main problems facing high sec and why we of the more carebear nature do not ever manage to unite to do anything is our complete lack of communicationinteraction and sense of we i am sure it has not escaped my notice that really the only people responding to my thread at the moment are members of the other good guys that of course dont actually want a carebear on or anywhere near the csm
it is disingenuous of you to refer to yourself as a highsec candidate when in fact you intend to represent only one segment of the highsec community the same goes for mike azariah except that in his case calling himself a highsec candidate is downright insulting since he has been doing this long enough to know betterif you truly intend to represent all of highsec you need to rethink your platform concord has already been buffed and ganking has already been nerfed to the point where it takes an absurd level of teamwork and organization to gank anything larger than a rookie ship and making a profit doing it without reimbursement from outside sources is almost out of the question but guess what we still do it and more than ever  if the rumor mill is to be believed nerf ganking more than it already has been and i promise you this  you will only make the gankers stronger better and more organized we will adapt and thrive and more carebears will die than ever if you truly wish to represent highsec you should be advocating for some of the previous nerfs to be rolled back so ganking can return to its former state as a casual distraction as opposed to a primary occupation executed by professional squads with military precisionthe other priority for highsec should be rebalancing the corp mechanicswardec equation the goal should be for more wars and greater consequences for dropping corp to evade them give incentives to joining high quality player corps disincentives to joining npc corps or small pvemining corps and reduce war fees across the boardif you are still serious about representing highsec after getting all that done you need to work on getting ccp fozzie to pull his head out of his ass on the incorp aggression issue it is your role as csm to call ccps out when they are pushing forward with terrible ideasdo those things and you can call yourself a representative of highsec do the things you proposed in your op and you are just another entitled carebear pushing for one more nerf
thank you for taking the time to write a responsewhich segment there has been some discussion since the op admittedly not much what do the gankers wantneed i think trying to get the bounty mechanics fixed trying to get ccp to be more open with why they ban people to the people that get banned and improving the npe so that the people coming here know before they really start what they are getting into is all goodi have said that a 5050 chance would be a good aiming point and i have already said somethings about what i think could do that having found out that i can use a dedicated alt or three to get concord to spawn in my belt for me as long as i dont abuse altturnover or trial accounts is a plus pointif every high sec player were to vote on the issues that were discussed we carebears would get all our wishes passed because we outnumber everyone else when choosing to represent a group it makes more sense to try and appeal to the majority unless of course the majority are lazyignorant and think that not voting is also making a statement i have already stated that i do not believe it makes any sense to try and nerf ganking into the ground i also stated that i do not believe it makes any sense to try and get ccp to make afk autopiloting completely safe i have not yet seen an announcement that mr azaria is running and i did not want to hold off making my own announcement because the inertia of carebeardom requires as much time as possible to even have a chance of getting things moving ok i know there are lots of passionate supporters of ganking that are scared that a carebear on the csm will take away their fun but it might be more accurate to say it takes an absurd level of teamwork and organization to gank anything larger than a hulk that has been fit by one of my carebear cousins and there is a big difference between a hulk and an ibisthe concord thing has been taken care of if you browse the thread up there i am looking forward to trying it out if it helpsyes you do just look at your alliance killboard james315 will probably be endorsing other csm candidates anyway that is thing of the dedicatedorganised ganker vs carebear too many nerfs are bad and buffs are actually useless because no selfrespecting carebear actually understands game mechanics enough to know what to do with them see my position on the npehigh quality corporations might even be a question of definition i dont know but if we want people to join those high quality corps then those high quality corps have to be out there and then they have to be willing to take in new players an attempt to give an incentive to getting people to join high quality corps is the planned removal of awoxing which is not the right way to do it sugar kyle is running an intensive discussion on her blog about wardecs and i am following it with interest
do you not think that players have a personal responsibility to find out the rules of the game
i think it is more important to deal with a reality that with an ideali think that a large number of my carebear cousins would benefit from a good npe and the rest of the galaxy would benefit from having the carebears properly informed about the way things arethen no one can claim ignorance the people that think that this is wowinspace get to learn it right at the beginning
with apologies to dwissi as i dont really want to make this thread purely about ganking im going to make one more clarification on the points i raisedthis is one loopholeso youre camping a gate a target comes through you shoot at them concord atomizes your ship you warp your pod back to the farthest station from the gate dock and emerge in a rookie ship concord spawns at the station and atomizes that too as there can only be one concord spawn per system concord is now at a station not at the gate so you dock up wait for your flag to wear off then hop in another real ship warp to gate and either wait for a new target or join a subsequent wave of ships attempting to take down a big target thats been held from warping off by a bumping shiploophole 2 you have a flashy red undock and warp to sun for example concord spawns at sun and blows their ship up concord is now at sun rather than at gatemy opinion in this matter is biased so fair warning but i believe as you investigate this issue further you will consistently run into the problem that concord is stupid blind and lethal which makes it incredibly easy to game one way or anotherit goes both ways too i believe this has been declared an exploit but for a while it was a thing for miners to aggress one of their barges with a rookie ship spawning concord in the belt they were mining there are ways to draw them off of course but it was a trick that got used for a while obviously thats not nearly as easy to do if youre piloting a freighteredit adding when ccp calls something an exploit that means that theres a problem that they dont have the ability to address mechanically this goes back to my point about the funhousemirror distortion of gameplay that concord represents its so stupid and so easily gamed that it will naturally leave lots of exploits and caveats and dark little corners in its wake something to ponder if you intend to represent high secedit 2 recycling altsthat is creating them using them for some nefarious purpose then biomassing them and replacing them with another characteris a bannable offense ccp traditionally relies on player reporting for such things but this is less and less true as they gain more and more ability to monitor their game for what i hope are obvious reasons ccp are extremely tightlipped about any methods they use you will not learn about them in any detail unless and until you make csm and even then you should be aware that they are volunteering what information they give you they will withhold whatever they choose toalso if there is a gankerfriendly csm its probably dj funkybacon hes nominally fwlowsec but he has taken up the mantle of champion of high sec criminality
most dedicated gank alts tend to be trained until perfection i have seen very very few disposable alts both the new order and miniluv we use security tags if we need positive sec status and we find it more useful to train alts into multiple ships
how would you balance things in a way that changes the balance to help carebears and smaller ganking entities isnt this as much a social problem as a game mechanics issueand yes code and the new order which extends beyond the alliance framework does exist to control and influence highsecas with post 15 i think we both agree that ganking is mainly done by extremists but how do you think we can go forward in a way that develops both the constructive and destructive elements of the game when each side is highly emotional and seems to be playing a zerosum game the carebear elements push for ever increasing safety and greater balance while not adapting to the situation in eve insisting that they can play in a peaceful manner in a game about blowing up spaceships the griefers just get torrents of joy from blowing them up taking their stuff and forcing them to face their own ideal of the game can this ever be reconciled
im glad you sign your posts otherwise we would have no idea who was posting
hello gevlon goalpoststhank you for joining the conversationyou bring up a good point for a historical topic that i would like to share with you  briefly prior to the computers whenever someone had completed a thought or idea that they were expressing in writing and with the intent of imparting it to someone else he or she would put their signature at the bottom of the hand writtentyped text so as to identify themselves and also indicate a form of proximity these writings often called letters would go beyond the writers tangible distance you see with the advent of technology this tradition was maintained it was then realized as you pointed out and around the construct of the forum that the author could be seen in some for or fashion towards the top of a post so as to maintain the socially endorsed standard of a signature and the unique and claiming nature of it the signature was altered now you find in all forums a section usually under your personal settings where you can prescribe a form of identification tag so to speak this section is also called a signature modernitys way of tipping its hat to the past this then updates automatically on whatever post you place on a forum under a solid line at the end of your post you will notice that admiral root amyclas amatin dersen lowery and dwissi all have a forum signature under all of their posts you and i do not however i choose to maintain the propriety of both the historical context and the forum format by including my signature and often times initials  shorthand for a signature within the text i am writingthis also ties in directly with my campaign  that is because i plan to use many historical lessons whenever i can and incorporate them into modernity at every chance its something that i practice irl as well and i suppose you could almost venture to call that a signature of mine too but that might be a stretch given that many people do that besides myself  having a historian on the csm is another perk to my being electedthat said again thank you for joining the discussion what do you think about the topic at handcheers rl
hello mr amatini maintain that closing all loopholes on both sides will be a good first step to balancing the power difference mr lowery points out a couple in post 27 but this may seem one sided so ill tell you two what appear to be loopholes on the haulers side that i believe should be done away with as well they are autopilot and webbing  autopiloting is essentially a means of playing eve online without having to partake in the game at all to me it is more understandable to see a freighter sitting on a gate because something has occurred irl as has happened with all of us than it is to make the conscious decision of excelling in eve online without having to do the work yourself it is afk progressive participation and i do not agree with that idea hence why i believe it should be entirely done away with  webbing is a means with which a hauler shortens the time it takes to get into warp the shortening of the align time is something i see no fault with but it canshould be achieved with skill training and implants rather than a webber the webber was not initially intended to be used by haulers as a loophole and therefore webbing needs some attention so as to find a way to bring it back to its original intention ill couple this with if ccp endorses a means by which haulers can shorten their align time as seen with webbing then ccp should consider a means by which this can be achieved without the loophole of a webber alt as used by many haulersim also seeing many complaints along the lines of concord being broken to me that seems rather unsatisfactory to the rl ramifications of eve online and i believe this game system should be updated as well between post 27 my two points above and concord being updated i believe this will do a lot in the way of balancing the playing field and yes the social problem that you bring up seems to be tangible but society is often crafted around the constraints and freedoms of its environments constitution therefore if you alter the environment you alter the societyand yes code and the new order which extends beyond the alliance framework does exist to control and influence highsec as i said this is not what hs was intended for by ccp this then needs to ironed out or ccp needs to revisit what it wants hs to be they set the rules and constraints we follow but right now code et al have demonstrated that there is a problem with the design that either needs to be revisited either for endorsement or altering the designhow do we settle the difference between constructive and destructive gameplay in hs that is a very good question i believe that all ive posted to this point is a good start fix the loopholes and make sure that mechanically there is a well founded and logical balance i also believe there can be more developer content that can be introduced in which there is a greater necessity for both sides to work together after all of this has been exhausted then one can truly claim that the two playstyles destructive and constructive are at least in relative balance and from there all that remains is adaptation which i suspect shouldnt be so taxing given that hs will be cleaned up to be played as intendedregards rl
since the topic has been brought up already it might be a good idea to extend to the history lessons  but this time into eve history many older players will recall that high sec was a lot more restricted in many ways compared to today one particular difference to mention as an example is the requirement of standings to setup a pos i will extend on that example further downeve has been blurred throughout the years because players where shouting crying and complaining the original story how things should be has been ignored due to those complaints and things where mechanically changed to cater for the crying masses  but without the understanding of the long term consequences of these changes those changes are basically the same reason why we have an underpowered concorde and why we have a very limited level of consequences when undertaking illegal actionsit has become a sport to claim that any activity is supposed to be a sanctioned core activity  freedom off choice is the most used argument for this but to execute freedom one also needs rules and limitations  anything without them is just anarchy this is where we are right now with high sec  we are dancing on the line between freedom and anarchy with every new ship that has been introduced for the capsuleers there should have been a proper adjustment on the nonplayer entities as well  which imho did not happen properlyso why did i mention the pos example to extend into the standing mechanics and why this would be the way to solve many of the problems people are facing to allow simply everyone to setup a pos has been a very dumb idea  it eliminated the general understanding why we have standings and what they are used for in the eve universe on the simplest level a player can set personal standings  i dont like you  i put you on minus 5 so i can be warned whenever you enter my home system how i use the indicator is up to me personally as i have set this standing just on my level but on the next level things become a bit more interesting  the corporation level if i act badly towards a corporation chances are high i will get a bad standing with them on player level that is merely a warning tag or it might even lead to a war declaration if annoyance level is maintained for some time pos can be set to act hostile towards those people etc etc but npcs dont follow this picture consistently i pay fees according to my standing towards that corporation and i get access to their agents as long as i am popular enough but i dont get locked out from their stations when i behave badly nor is there any form of mid to long term consequences for me that is one reason for things being far too easy for the illegal or aggressive type of high sec player standings used to be the carrot and the punishment for certain things in eve they are a superb mean to steer and control certain aspects according to story and behaviour standings have been greatly undervalued during the last years changes because many have only pointed towards security status  which is also too easily circumvented when going into a bad direction risk  reward is not reflected in this area and is a typical topic that mainly affects high sec as well as low sec to some extend since its still regarded empire space this is a matter that has been completely ignored and needs some serious attention by the csm
so if we unsub some of our alts that run on  they will take notice also can we push for less npc alts posting incendiary threads in forums npc corp alts shouldnt have rights
nice dodge would you agree that the npe should include being ganked with an explanation as to what happened and why
one mans dodge is another mans answeri would personally think that if the npe continued to be mission based that it should rather include ganking than getting ganked getting ganked by npcs and it would almost have to be npcs in an organised npe is nothing like getting ganked by people especially if you know it is preprogrammed no risk no fun that would also then work as an introduction to concord an introduction to blowing things up and a look at the other side eve is after all a game about blowing spaceships up and once you have thought about how spaceships get blown up then you have a reason to think about how not to get blown up and at least thinking of  being aware of getting blown up would be a great help for my carebear cousins
a mission to go gank another player id be so totally down with that its the best idea ive heard on this forum all day
for all intents and practical purposes it would probably still have to be an npc that gets ganked otherwise there will be too many problems also with delaying the completion of the npe because there is no other player there but confronting the new player with the violence and waiting for concord to come and blow you up after you destroyed the target at the moment in the npe there are mining missions industrial missions fighting missions why not pirate missions on the eve website there was a list of professions and letting  forcing new players to try them all is surely a good thing how else will they know what they find interestingfun
regardless of whether or not youre elected to the csm i think you should start an fi thread on ganking being part of the npe
introduction vf program vf i am borat guereen and i officially announce running for csm10 office to represent the little guys the ones that truly play solo or with a very close knit group of friendsi am one of the alts of a player that has been in the game for more than 5 years and has been living the solo eve lifestyle successfully for more than a year now after going through various experiences ranging from living in low sec null sec and wormholes i have little experience in high sec being neither a missioner industrialist hauler trader or ganker my focus is around regular pvp i have fced small fleets explored unknown territories scanned signatures and flew and lost at least once most of the subcaps i do not pvp for the killboard but for the thrill of the hunt i have been part of the blue donut in null sec twice and have been one of the lemmings for each of the main sides i never flew capitals as i never saw them as the ultimate endgame and anyway flying caps has little interest for me in the current state of powerblocks controlled null sec even if i participated to br5rb i do my best now to avoid tidi as much as possible and am not a big fan of very large fleet fights in their current formplaying solo does not mean having only one character eve does not work that way and i have a few alts of my own they are not scattered across new eden but are all part of my small team to provide some reasonable control over the small corner of space i call home i do not have any batphone nor do i have alts embedded into various different groups within chao3 i am spearheading a new type of players coalition for new eden with some light role playing to spice up our actions in game and make it mesh with the lore as the speaker of chao3 i have chosen to represent the freedom fighters of new eden as a csm representative though i would represent the interests of all of you that can identify to some or all of my experiences as a rl person i am an open minded american citizen living on the us west coast and of french origin i have spent half of my life in europe and the other half in the us i am working in it and project management and i have my own company being master of my schedule allows me to have the capacity and organization skills to work for the csm while keeping my rl on track eve is my main gaming hobby and has been for these past 5 years enough said about me and my alts i believe the csm is a valuable interface with ccp and i believe ccp has recently shown great boldness in the steps taken with the last releases my only agenda is to help the game cater to solo or small groups more without breaking the dynamics of the sandbox which makes eve the unique game that it ishere is my program

hi iUFFFDm running for csm again as i said last year iUFFFDm not running on a platform iUFFFDm running on a skillset iUFFFDm still a goon my experience and space resume remains largely the same albeit a year more of it the only difference between this year and last is that iUFFFDd add to it my time as csm but what a difference a year makes if youUFFFDve read the minutes youUFFFDll know that i have a wide variety of opinions on a wide variety of subjects iUFFFDve written on tmc about the intersection of mechanics player motivation and psychology iUFFFDve done some investigative journalism and iUFFFDve also been party to public criticism directed at ccp iUFFFDm still committed to the idea that eve is about relationships at this point anyone voting for me should know what theyUFFFDre getting in the immortal words of popeye UFFFDi yam what i yam and thas all what i yamUFFFDin my campaign thread last year i expressed hope that ccp had a plan for 00 and an understanding of how nullsec works while there are a couple singular exceptions ccp lacks both a plan and understanding this is why iUFFFDm running again iUFFFDm quite sure theyUFFFDre all well intentioned but nullsec is a unique and complicated ecosystem i understand it far better than they do and iUFFFDd rather they not introduce cane toadswhen i started my term last year i had certain expectations of how the csm worked and what it meant for a hardened space politician i was unfortunately naUFFFDve that naUFFFDvetUFFFD is gone after hearing the csm called a UFFFDpr toolUFFFD by one of ccpUFFFDs public relations people i know where the csm stands after many of the disparaging comments made to me directly i know where i stand the new release cycle makes it harder than ever for the csm to have input and be heard the institution requires strong professional voices from people with the confidence to if necessary fight because thatUFFFDs what it takes not sycophantic ccp apologists not rabid anticcp detractors itUFFFDs a tough balance to strike and the people you vote in dictate the effectiveness of the institution itself vote wiselyiUFFFDm a straight shooter you might not always like what i say ccp certainly doesnUFFFDt but youUFFFDll always know what i think and why youUFFFDre quite welcome to mail me about various matters but if you have any nuanced platform questions please drop them here in thread as iUFFFDm not going to respond to evemails asking for multiparagraph explanations itUFFFDs nothing personal i simply donUFFFDt have the time to write a thousand miniessays i can also be reached 
hi thank you for running againtwo questions1 i know that the goons are a large group and take care of their own do you have any opinions about the development of the new player experience2 i read some posts on themittanicom and some other places and the thought that ccp might just might ban me for no apparent reason not tell me what that reason is and be wrong keeps me awake sometimes at night especially when i have to get my credit card out for something what can we do to better this situation
i wholeheartedly support the rerun of sion to csm xthere are few in the game with the level of calmness experience and greater understanding of the game as a whole do not let the age old grr goons sentiments cloud the facts of him being a solid and reliable member that will fight for the best interests of the game as a whole sion is honed in on the key topics right now and with eve in such a critical phase of developments right now we all will want someone in the team that knows what they are talking about has the years of experience and has access to data through the wealth of resources within his alliance to ensure ccp are full aware of their decisions for what its worth there are also few people in this game that i value on a personal level as much as sion he may be on csm but he remains very much down to earth and approachable unlike some other csms present and past vote for sion kumitomo
hello dwissithese are some really good points there is a reason why we have the eve universe divided into the varying sec statuses and essentially you remind us of the drive behind it besides being a voice for haulers  eve wide being a point of contact for gank targeted minorities wanting to push for equal balance between aggressor and victim i believe a cleaning up of the many loose ends that exist in eve is in order as well  why are standings not more important if i have bad standing with a an npc entity should i be allowed to dock at the station they own should all of my actions in a certain sec space not only be reflected in my security status but also with my standings as well risk equal reward so should i not be forced to rat  get tags  clean up my sec status before being allowed reentry into hs if that is the case should i not have to repair my standings before being allowed to dock once sec status is clearedkeeping in mind what i said in post 32 i find it reasonable to attach this to what was said there as wellwe must also keep in mind that the players of eve effect the longevity and player retention of eve online the new trailer that recently came out was a great boost for eve but i keep hearing that its the veterans game and that is highly problematic and the people that join eve today may not stick around when they realize the rules of the developers dont matter because you can easily overcome them in the context of what were talking about if there are rules in place that supersede all the players then we have a balanced environment if we focus on eve being harder to play in order to achieve success then were looking on raising the bar on player quality and longevity currently were seeing the new generation literally enter eve online were talking people that were far too young to play it 4 years ago because they didnt have the maturity to understand and appreciate eve but now they do and as eve gets older we have to be everconscious of this factor how can we expect to keep them for 10 years if we dont provide an environment that caters to the now and future of eve they will come in find the loopholes and ruin eve online unintentionally get bored and leave because they dont have the same appreciation as the older players who had to deal with a real environment survive adapt succeed again good points dwissi ill be adding them to my list of things to review and helpregards rl
no you just used real money to acquire game time
youre asking ccp to give away free game time  in the same sentence saying that ccp would make more money for doing this
only if we can also take the same rights away from the elitist bell ends that live out in nullsec this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
thanks for admitting that npcs are bad for the forum if you dont like something someone in a player corp says do something about it ingame
actually you have it reverse if you sell isk for rl money you are rmting if you buy isk with rl money you are soliciting rmt it is basically the same paradigm as prostitution was designed to fight rmt by offering an alternative that would be legal would create a closed loop between players and ccp in terms of money and ingame effortsin this respect has greatly succeededhowever it seems that some players have come to depend on as some sort of lifeline which it was never designed to behonestly is a nice to have thing and should never be a i need it to keep playing deal if you cannot afford a piddling 15 a month sub then you have more pressing issues in rl than a gamenot supported
once again coming polling day im looking for your votes as with the last time i ran my platform has two main legs industry and third party development theres a generous helping of other pve interest in there as well i spend most of my time in highsec so im sure youll understand a degree of self interest therefor those of you who dont know meim a industrialist doing relatively small scale t2 manufacturing in highsec doing so trade to feed the industry along with being an additional revenue stream im also a third party developer responsible for
i endorse this product andor serviceseriously though steve has been a great voice for the 3rd party dev community and an all round solid csm member

the carebear issuetheres definitely people that want to see highsec made safer and for it to become an area where players can safely generate wealth sometimes even totally afk that they can either hoard or use in fights in lowsec or nullsec i utterly reject this ideathese carebears claim that they mind their own business this isnt true a multiboxer running 10 skiffs stripping asteroid belts floods the market undermining the ability of regular miners to generate income a mission blitzer running sisters missions in safety in their shiny paladin directly harms the value of every other players sisters probe launchers and an incursion farmer pumps tens of billions of isk into the economy each month increasing the plex to isk conversion ratio and devaluing the concord lps owned by other playersthese actions are every bit as much a form of pvp as shooting someones spaceshipi want to see players able to set the level of risk they are comfortable with within some limits and obtain very low rewards for putting low value assets at low risk medium rewards for putting high value assets into low risk situations or low value assets into high risk situations and high rewards for sensibly putting high value assets at high riski would strongly advocate rebalancing those parts of eve that provide high income at minimal risk sometimes i would advocate direct nerfs for example to the liquid isk paid out for incursion sites and other times i would favor indirect nerfs for example providing more sisters level 4 mission agents in lowsec and introducing level 5 onesin addition i would lobby for ingame rewards for highsec miners to join player corporations of at least a few people and actively defend themselves from any predators that come after them UFFFD or to outsource this protection work to others presently miners are encouraged strongly by game mechanics to remain in npc corps or to form one player corporations changing this will generate conflict opportunity destruction and excitementa series of changes over the last few years to highsec combat mechanics UFFFD from the increases to wardec fees in inferno to the replacement of can flipping with the much harsher suspect flag the banning of the boomerang strategy removal of insurance on concordooken losses and the tolerance by ccp of wardec avoidance which was once declared an exploit have made UFFFDcarebearsUFFFD safer and made it harder for new players to have the sorts of experiences that broke me from the UFFFDlevel up your dominix until you quit eveUFFFD path the thing that has kept highsec competitive gameplay alive has been the increasing organisation and seriousness of our community its a problem that this is necessary as it adds a barrier to entry for rookie gankers mission invaders and wardeccersthe 50 million isk minimum fee to carry out a wardec is one of the most destructive of these changes as it forces wardeccers to band together into large alliances to reduce costs small groups of newbies should be able to experiment with wardeccing more cheaply rather than having to join a larger group like code marmites or the likenew playersi want to ensure new players UFFFD both trial accounts and subscribers UFFFD are exposed to what makes eve great not just to level 2 and 3 security missions the first half of the ship tiericide initiative was a mixed bag UFFFD it made new players more powerful in pvp engagements in frigates and cruisers a positive but it also increased cruiser build cost significantly and made it much more crippling for a new player to lose a ship this is a significant issue UFFFD when i was a rookie a vexor cost 6 million isk or about 3 hours of running level 2 missions with low skills and little game knowledge now itUFFFDs 11 million or about 5 hours despite the mineral price index being about the samei want to see changes that soften the blow of losing a ship for rookies so that rookies get into the mindset of seeing ships as consumables early in their careerwhether elected or not i intend to make a series of video tutorials oriented at rookies explaining things like the basics of tracking and why this makes small ships more than just a stepping stone toward larger ships basic fitting and the various effective types of tanks refitting ships for specific purposes avoiding predators in highsec and lowsec and suggestions for skill training i also intend to include advice on getting into predatory play as a newbiemost of all i want to teach new players that they can be effective in the game right now this isnUFFFDt world of warcraft where you need to get to 2 or 3 levels below the level cap before you can even scratch a veteran player i have known new players that have destroyed missioning battleships solo before their character has a quarter million skillpoints and two hour old characters that have earned ransoms of a quarter billion isk
sovereign nullseciUFFFDm aware that csm 10 will deal with a lot of built up issues related to the stagnation of sovereignty mechanics my csm pitch on this issue is simple iUFFFDll let the experts do the talkingmembers of sovereign null blocks that have the support of their respective alliances will likely comprise 3070 of the csm these people understand these issues better than me and i will listen to their expertise offer any suggestions that i think might be a brainwave and not push the point if the experts tell me iUFFFDm wrongccpUFFFDs attempts to fix sov null will probably be the most important single issue the csm discusses this year this doesnUFFFDt mean that every person on the csm needs to be an expert in itmy suggested voting platform1 sabriz adoudel2 tora bushido3 steve ronuken414 fill all of these out with candidates of your choice that are not mike azariah if you do not have enough candidates you care about pick ones at random or pick ones you think have a chance of being elected but that you feel are unremarkablethe reasoningideally id like to get voted up on my own rights however if i am not elected under stv a 1 sabriz 2 tora vote is almost equivalent to a 1 tora vote i feel tora is the second best highsec predator candidate and would be a huge asset to the csm whether i am elected or not and if preferences flow as i hope and i am eliminated from contention my voters might help put tora over the line steve r probably doesnt need help getting over the line but i dont think this should be left to chance the csm needs someone with his unique skillset hes also not a carebear but an industrialist who understands how to defend himselfmike azariah was instrumental in providing feedback that led to incursion changes while he presented these changes as quality of life changes they have been major balance changes that have further damaged the already seriously bad risk to reward imbalance present in highsec incursion farming eve was made actively worse by these changes regardless of any positive qualities mike may have as a person or organizer eve would be better if his feedback on game balance issues is marginalized or ignoredit may seem that his feedback is irrelevant if you do not participate in incursions yourself but the enormous amounts of liquid isk poured into the economy by incursions transforms the game economy considerably this is true of nullsec ratters as well but null ratters do at least drive small gang fights and occasionally larger conflictsunder stv it is an optimal voting strategy to fill your ballot with candidates that have a fringe chance of being elected if you wish to reduce one particular candidates chance of getting elected
heres my candidate interview with cap stable podcast
you have my votes
glad to see that youre running again sion i commend you to the players of new eden as someone i think should certainly be returned to the csmeve down under  a community for players in the autz
1 goonswarm has a long history of bringing in newbees and in general being a newbee friendly organization what weve found largely mirrors what ccps statistics indicate people who get involved in the social component of the game stick around longer so while there are mechanical aspects that can be changed to flatten eves vertical learning curve the biggest single factor is getting new players involved in the community my focus is therefore on ways to get players the tools to help make that transition from npc corp to player corp as smooth and intuitive as possible 2 ive yet to encounter a case where someone was arbitrarily banned for no reason whatsoever and if you ask everyone who is ever banned will say that theyre innocent that doesnt mean that ccp doesnt make mistakes and that there isnt room for improvement but if it legitimately keeps you up at night go find some truly innocent people and make a case study out of it push loudly and publicly for reform offer some practical solutions dont just toss rocks or concern trollthanks for the endorsement dude its great to see you back in game too hey bam thanks for the kind words im still hoping youre kicking around that conversation you had with me and others in vegas just sayin
theres nothing wrong with a little prostitution
depends on where you live selling and buying is illegal in most of the usselling and buying is illegal in china but enforcement is at best laxselling is legal but buying is not in sweedenselling and buying are more or less legal in germany
i live in a civilized modern society that doesnt oppress women
it was great talking to you in vegas and finding out that you also have a lot of diverse and constructive opinions outside your main jam of 3rd party tools and industry the amount of progress that ccp particularly foxfour has made in the last 12 months with the api is pretty obvious even to meeve down under  a community for players in the autz
steve is pure awesome and i fully endorse him for another csm term
im better known as a destroyer but i do a lot of production and invention too it may surprise you but i encouraged people in the minerbumping community to vote for you last yearso a question steve how do you feel about the balance changes that happened to production as a result of crius and phoebemy feeling is that the reduced amount of player input required for inventing and building modules ammo and ships and the general reduction in production hours required for most goods has led to increased overproduction and a fairly unhealthy economythis has real advantages its cheaper for newer players to buy those tech 2 modules they can fit and its certainly made ganking cheaper but its also problematic in that newer players taking up production see less of a return on the capital they invest in things like module bposalso why arent our alliances at war i need to get a director to fix that
absolutely producing things is rewarding but making isk while doing so is better 
my general feeling is that the time for most t2 modules and ammo has fallen too far so the market is swamped though you have people moving to the next thing letting it drain a bit im not a huge fan of that being a requirementthe lower prices are nice and all for the consumer but the market doesnt exist to make mass production really worth itas for war well id prefer you didnt id have to relocate production from the pos to a station and contract people to move my stuff and turn the pos into a dickstar and thats just annoying
i dont understand this need for reform if the null blocs make up a large portion of the active player base using many if not all the mechanics in the sand box then what exactly is the problem with them having many members on the csm or are you suggesting that the csm should be made up of insular mission runners who couldnt care less about sovereignty or in fact anything outside their level 4 mission or incursion
reform is a good thing it means change with the end goal of increased efficiency in the case of the csm i feel strongly that the process needs to be overhauled a very small portion of the player base even knows what the csm is eve is about the players the csm can only be comprised of players to that end the process needs more transparency and fluidity the members of the csm also need to be held to a higher standard one that precludes them from using politics as an excuse to advocate for their constituents
ccps lacklustre promotion of the csm is the reason for that nothing else voter apathy is different but it isnt linked to any one particular cause its a bit like quality assurance  if youve worked in software based product development  no one is interested in talking to you unless something bad is happening right now ccp isnt screwing up so no one gives two hoots about their virtual union reps although im sure certain csm members will be the first to tell you its all their doing in a horribly smug self important post i dont mean mynnna or sion either
i know and i agree with you about quality assurance i think you will agree with me when i say that just because there is no sign of rain in no way means all efforts on flood prevention should cease ccp is doing amazing right now because of ccp seagull and her unprecedented vision the csm is still a valid and relevant mechanism just because ccp is being guided by some beautifully androgynous genius doesnt mean the csm should stop restructuring itself for better function
are are you santaeve down under  a community for players in the autz
could you expand on how the wardec mechanic is broken i agree with you for the record but i would like your view on what can be done to make wardecs more fun and meaningful for all participantsdo you agree that central to this problem of wardecs is the fact that there is not much difference between npc and players corps so there is little to motivate players to stay and fight if so which concrete changes would you support to improve the desirability of joining and fighting for a player corporation do you think nerfing npc corps or buffing the income of player corps is a solution to this problem
well i can try but please remember i am a carebeari find it absurd that simply by disbanding a 1 man corps can avoid a declaration of wari find it absurd that simply by disbanding the corporations of an alliance have an easier time avoiding a wari find it absurd that wardeccing corps can cause newinexperienced players to not log in simply by declaring war on themwell i think that nonconsensual pvp has limitsthis ties in to the descriptions of coporation lite that have been circulating having a corporation that simply exists for social interaction without any of the pospocowardec components of the game is imho a good idea the key to new player retention seems to be involvement in a social group interaction with other playershaving then social groups corporations that want to take part in pvp sov pocopos things and also wardecs is a step up motivation of players to stay and fight is a big theme why would players stay and fight in high secone possible answer is to improve the new player experience so that new players can not start playing the game with their wow sense of entitlement or at least without knowing that eve is different i agree that there is no motivation for players to fight for their own corporation as an npc corporation member i can safely say that i have not had any problems with war decswhy can one not wardec an npc corporationthis is again a very good questioni would like to remind you and the audience that i am a carebeari see the main roll of the csm in checking what ccp is doing and trying to let them know when it sucks i dont consider myself savvy enough to tell them that if q1 then is worse than if q11 thendescribing the complicated changes that are necessary in order to bring balance is difficult i am not setinstone with any particular set of changesbutnpc corps should be wardecable but wardec the caldari state then the caldari facpo are also gonna fight backplayers should opt between social groups no dec fixed tax no pocopos etc that cannot dec and are not deccable social groupand corporations that can do anything that a corporation anywhere can do if one assumes that the model above is set in place then anyone in a wardecced corp gets a flagwardec this flag remains for the duration of the war so no running away any shareholding member of a corporation can call for a vote to surrender any wardeclaring corporation gets the wardec fees refunded equal to maximal 110th the killed enemy aggressors can recruit allies just like defendersit is a complicated subjecti would be the first to admit that i am a carebear and am not happy when i get wardeccedbut and i would like to emphasise butdeclarations of war have a place in eve and should stay i think it is important to enable these playersif there is a mechanic in place that allows high sec players to opt out of such things at the expense of not having anything from their corps other than a chat channel then i am all for it of course that then needs to be balanced with high sec resource production iceore etci would like to say that the csm is not there to present fully finished solutions to all the problems that have developed in the last years in this game but are rather elected to represent interest groups of playerserm sorry i seem to have got distracted i hope that you have managed to get an idea of what i am thinking and if you have any more specific questions i will be happy to try and answer themthe most important thing people should vote for the csm only in voting are we sure that the csm represents us
oh thank you for the interest in my csm campaignunfortunately after much research i can report that santa has actually a lot of free time at this time of year there are enough elves and little helpers that spend the time caring about the minutiaeeven his wife mary has more to do than he hasany further questions please let me know
i agree the question is how to fix it i also agree the corporationthatisreallyannpccorp idea is fine with me as long as it has almost all the restrictions of an npc corp and almost none of the benefits of a player corp then really nothing has changed in terms of gameplay except that players now have a shared identity and corp channel this would help player retention but does nothing to solve wardecs thoughok let me ask you what would it take to get you out of your npc corp and into a player corp and further what would it take to get you to stay in that player corp and try some pvp even if that isnt your main playstyle to defend itwould raising the tax rate of the npc corp to 50 do itwould being valid targets to players of the opposing faction militia do itwould a playercorp only buff to your income say missions pay you and increasing amount up to 100 more but only if you as a corp put effort into building a structure and defending itwould a playercorp only buff to your mining yield that requires an moderately expensive and destroyable deployable structure do iti agree that players should always be able to take refuge in an npc corp to rebuild in case everything they have is lost but i also think we need some ideas to help encourage people out of these corps eventually one way to do this is to make living in a npc less profitable than living in a player corp and attach some persistent bonuses for staying and defending those player corpsi agree eve is about risk vs reward to fix wardecs there just needs to be a way to make living in player corps more lucrative than npc corps and some incentives to stay with a particular corporation if players are totally riskadverse and want to spend their life in a wardecfree corp lite or npc corp  fine  but they should earn significantly less than players who take responsibility for creating maintaining and defending a player corporation and its assets best of luck on your csm campaign
please remember i am a carebear that is why ccp get their big bucks i would say as a member of a voluntary player organisation eg csm that it is more my job to tell them that their solution is  and to point our flaws etcon the contrary to solve the problem of wardecs you have to solve the problem of corporations and new playersany mechanic that enables a war dec to carry on and maybe shoot something well that is a good mechanicwithout addressing npe and potential corporations changes it is impossible to talk about serious relevant wardec changesnerfswould raising the tax rate of the npc corp to 50 do itwould being valid targets to players of the opposing faction militia do itwould a playercorp only buff to your income say missions pay you and increasing amount up to 100 more but only if you as a corp put effort into building a structure and defending itquote1 raising taxes does not help new players new players dont know any better2 letting militia target people that declare war on an npc corps would be a good thing but the npc corps must be deccable see an earlier postplayeronly buffs to mining yield are less important the vast majority of care bear experience says that the vast majority of care bear players sad but true are not influenced by anything that anyone else does
oh coolim with ya
i fully and enthusiastically endorse this candidate a vote for sabriz is a vote for chaos and conflict in the universe it is a vote to embrace the values upon which this game has its foundation
may seem a bit silly but there are 2 sides to the coin of the position you put forth i wonder if you could perhaps provide some clarificationyou spend a lot of time talking about care bears and risk versus reward while i do tend to agree with you that the rewards of high sec are in some was disproportionately high when compared to the risks of highsec straight up nerfs often tend to be a poor method of changing the balance though in some cases necessary i have seen ccp with the nerf hammer before they often hit far to hard and miss the true problems it would be a bit of a shame to see the robust incursion communities die when the nerf hammer hits much like it contracted significantly before i remember after years off null sec taking a break to run some incursions and it being a breath fresh air that reinvigorated me and many in my corp in the game due mostly to its unique mechanics and communityyou speak prominently of the issues surrounding war dec avoidance cases of isboxingmultiboxing and the plight of newer players and while this may be unfair your own alliance operates in some ways that is discouraging to newer pilots who operate in highsec while granted the highsec freightor pilot who flies through udema is likely not the most intelligent individual or even particularly new the fact that he is often ganked with nothing in his cargohold suggests that maybe risk vs reward is in fact not very in balance in both directions additionally along the same token while carebears are certainly guilty of wardec avoidance the same often apply to wardeccers who use a variety of mechanics to skirt the boundries of wardecs such as neutral repairs boosts scouts ect i have heard that some of the wardec groups are even in agreement to not dec each other as that would introduce to much risk into their trade also to be considered is correct me if im wrong a wardec can be maintained particularly against a small entity pretty much indefinitely i know im takeing awhiel to get to the point but the basis of the examples im providing is essentially how do you propose to balance both sides of the risk versus reward equation in highsec from the agressors point of view and the defenders point of view as while i agree that isk generation in highsec is not particularly balanced neither is the pvp side hope that was understandable just found myself reading on here and decided to ask questions from the view of an outsider who does not have much involvement in highsec
vigilanta in response to your questionsleaving incursions asis undermines a whole raft of other activities why put a 13 billion isk ship at significant risk to run level 5 missions when you can earn better isk by grinding highsec incursions in a budget incursion fleet why risk a 50 billion isk capital fleet to fight over control of a c6 wormhole when the ingame rewards for doing so are only marginally better than fielding a 15 billion semiblinged incursion fleet in highseci want to see highsec incursions pay out in a way that accurately reflects the level of risk involved if i were a game designer id change the reward scheme for highsec incursions to be primarily lp based with little liquid isk and keep the liquid isk payouts in dangerous spacewhen the tengu was unquestionably overpowered it was nerfed because the existance of an overpowered option invalidated other options players felt obliged to train into the tengu whether they wanted to fly one or not this is happening with incursions  there are people running them that actively enjoy running them and there are people running them because the isk added to the economy by incursions and also nullsec ratting affects the purchasing power of the isk they earn via other means drop incursion isk somewhat and some of the present incursion runners will take their pve skills into wormholes level 5 missions nullsec exploration and pirate faction level 4 missions while those that enjoy incursions will continue running them this will add to the conflict that makes eve funit will indeed disrupt existing communities but the status quo does that too as nullsec residents or wormholers spend time on their incursion alt in preference to playing in the space they lay claim toon the later points newbies and wardecs newbies cannot fly freighters or afford them anyone with those sp and resources is not a newb our primary targets are exhumers a month to train into orcas and freighters multiple months and mining barges as a low priority which still require more sp to sit in than battleships newbies occasionally lose ships to us but of the roughly one trillion isk in damage we do a month id estimate five billion maximum is to rookies i generally provide any newer or obviously clueless player that i blow up tips  i had one just last night that lost a ship and pod but learned how to use their overview and gather intel from the local chat channel to protect themselvesa small swarm of newbies in frigates is terrifyingly effective against predatory wardecs if they realise it and mobilize i prefer to provide them with tips and training so that they can fight for themselves  which is what any corp ceo should do when facing a wardecwith respect to the wardec tricks  neutral reps dont work well try it neutral boosts and scouting are universal in eve and this is a consequence of how powerful warfare links and intel are there is definitely not peace in the wardeccing community  my alliance is presently at war with marmites pursuit of happiness and probably a few others as for maintaining wardecs  its a minimum fee of 50m per week which hurts to maintain long term
and my gila
you are paying me a gila to run i accept your bribe i mean donation to my campaign expenses fund
thank you for running for the csmas a fellow candidate exploring high sec issues what do you think could be done to improve the lot of the war deccing player
i fully support sabriz during this campaign and all of my accounts will be putting sabriz as 1vote sabriz vote for action vote for an eve universe worth living in
hi sabrizthanks for donning the cape of the pvp crusaderyour manifesto was a thoughtprovoking read for me and it wasnt long after i finished reading it that i realised why this and my other accounts will be supporting your candidacy for csm 10eve is about pvp all of it the division of the gameworld into low null wh and highsec space is as irrelevant as it gets because wherever you live pvp is what the game is about a candidate who not only realises that but also commits to preserving and extending it gets my voteson a personal note you have helped me with game mechanics and other questions i threw at you i trust you and your advice has never missed the mark that james 315 included your vexor ganking guide within his own article on ganking is proofpositive of the respect youve already garnered within our own community now you have the opportunity to represent the pvpers of the rest of new eden and to bring to the csmccp table your experience in other areas too wormhole life for example i wish you success
responsing quickly to sasha i dont pretend to know much about wormhole life i know enough to use wspace to support my kspace operations for instance using wspace to get access to nullsec bypassing camped stargates or using wspace to hide some of my forces when fcing a fight but ive never lived there in particular i have little to no experience with the system effects in whsi do follow wh politics somewhat however and follow the bigger fights that occur thereso if ive appeared to you as a wh expert im notill assume from your question you are only talking about highsec wardecs wars have some uses for lowsec residents too letting you shoot first under gatestation guns but im only responding in relation to highsecfirstly i feel that the ability to dissolve and reform a corporation with no consequence for a corp without a pos or merely moderate inconvenience for a corp with a pos is the single biggest issue facing wardeccers wardec avoidance by corp shedding encourages people to wardec anyone and everyone in the hope that a quarter of those wars will result in fights and the cost of doing this requires wardeccers to form huge alliances whether they want to or not adding carrots for defending your corporation andor a stick for not doing so will thus be the focus of my answersecondly excluding people that use pos services mission runners are the only highsec dwellers that receive any clear benefit for remaining in a player corp incursion runners and miners in particular are actively encouraged to be in npc corps by game mechanicsas for concrete suggestions apply the npc corp tax rate to the isk component not the lp component of incursion payouts this gives incursion runners a reason to join a corp and combined with the next suggestion to actively fight off anyone that wardecs them rather than merely surrendering apply the npc corp tax rate to members of very new corporations ones that are less than 7 days old this seriously discourages jumping ship and reforming corporations find some way to incentivise miners joining and remaining loyal to a player corporation i dont have the answers here  perhaps a pos module that provides a 3 mining yield boost to corporation members within its system scale the cost to declare war differently it should be based upon the size of the aggressor corporation not the defender and it should scale more slowly than linearly as the aggressor corp increases one possible formula would be x05  10 million isk where x is the number of members in the aggressor corpalliance and the total cost is capped at 200m for an aggressor entity of 400 people or more consider having the npc corp tax rate be on a sliding scale currently the tax is 11 of any taxable event equal to or exceeding 100k isk and 0 for taxable events under 100k isk and a taxable event is an agent mission payment agent mission fast completion bonus payment or a bounty tick id be interested to see the result of changing that formula to be min0 02x300000 for taxable events of x isk this would make the tax smaller on newbies running level 3 security missions slowly and larger on veterans blitzing l4s
hello friendsi am gorski car i have been playing eve since 2003 on multiple characters i was recently added to the current csm after some dropouts and i am now running for reelection and i really hope we get all the votes this timemost of the time in game i spend doing solo pvpsmall gang pvp in every part of new eden i have been doing lowsec fw 00 and recently i joined rvb to pvp in highsec i have participated in two alliance tournament teams and the new eden open i also try to show up for most ingame events most people know me from my postings in the channel bringing solo back and for my stream at
having pvp experience in lowsec and highsec i am curious on your views on the current game design philosophy of risk vs reward and the relative profitability of the various spacesdecisions by ccp over the years have lead to the strange situation that while many people enjoy pvp in lowwhnull space they return to highsec to make the isk to support these habits this is because the reward of operating in highsec is far too high for the almost complete absence of risk forcing people who may prefer to live and generate isk in the more risky spaces to return to highsec to make an income as it is more efficient and thus the only rational choice counterproductively this depopulates these nonhighsec spaces and reduces the chances of meaningful pvpcomments from members of the current csm imply that they and perhaps ccp are fine with this design do you agree that highsec should be where the majority of pve and other incomegenerating activities takes place if not do you have any concrete suggestions on what could be done to encourage players to spend more time earning isk outside of highsec do you think the better approach would be to reduce highsec rewards or to increase highsec risk
well there is concrete information out there that banned players have not been informed by ccp why they have in the concrete case been bannedwhilst i am sure that the players that were banned must have done something ban worthy not informing them why their account was banned as in concretely for what seems kind of weak a practical solution would be for ccp to say you have been permabanned for being associated with erotica 1s bonus roomi am mostly disturbed that ccp does not always offer a reason and therefore the chance of an appeali guess djfunkybacons grey area left me all nervous
hi allso there is such a proposal why not make necessary for all ships to pour fuelofcourse for small ships it will cost lesser then for large onesperhaps the introduction of the parameter for ships fuel consumption or something like thatthese changes will translate economy on a new level of realismpeople will have to consider the logistics how much my ship eating how much the road will cost etc just like in real lifeyou will see a huge new industry in finding mining processing and saling the fueli know about existing of such for jumpers and poss but its a whole different levelthis will affect all activities in eveps sorry for my english hope youll share my views
whyhow does this benefit anyone who doesnt live in highsec with incredibly easy access to market hubswhy should there be a game mechanic that forces people not to roam deep into hostile space
well the only attractive thing in lownull secs is hightquality resoursesso we can placing there or using already existing there resourses for the production of fuel for some types of shipssimple examplefrigs and destroyers uses fuel i that can be extracted and produced in hilownull seccruisers battlecruisers industrials and battleships uses fuel ii that can be extracted only in lownull seccarriers freighters dreads uses fuel iii from nullsthus further increasing the attractiveness of lownull systems
at a time when ccp is doing a lot for the new player experience you want them to take a huge leap backwards
ive always thought that eve ships were more like a bussard ramjet in the way they produce power they scoop up free floating hydrogen in the intersteallar medium and run it through a fusion reactor to produce energy for normal operations no need to add fuel just lfy around this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
ikr how dare eve make it easier for new players to come in and want to stayalso when was the last time you saw a vehicle with a nuclear reactor like a naval ship need to worry about fuel on a daily basis they done maybe like once every 20 years but still you want to worry about fuel go jump cap ships around and theres your fuel burn or put up a posnot every ship should worry about fuel constantly because why you think this would help it would cause fuel prices to lower as more fuel would have to be sustained for ships and then people still wouldnt want to dealing with the reduced prices in high risk areas
and i obtain this in hostile space byand i obtain this in a system with no station byand i obtain this 15 jumps away from my regional market hub bywhy do you want to make it much much harder to live away from highsec why do you want to remove the entire concept of extended roams or living in hostile space how does this benefit me the line member and pvping member of a nullsec groupand hell clarify your damn idea is this racial like isotopes or do all frigates use the same fuel what happens when you run out what possible benefit is there for any of this
players would  whine and moan more than ever ive wanted the same but i dont ever see it happening
i believe lordservants started working on this behind the scenes already so lets keep that ball rolling there is a lot of drama misinformation slander name calling and anger from both users and haters of multiboxing i posted my thoughts in multiple locations but i have a fairly condensed post here
your synonymous use of the words multiboxing and automated input are quite disingenuous the dramatic stance youre describing has been as such for botting read automating input infractions for a while now isboxer slipping under the radar was really more ccp turning a willingly blindeye towards it while it would be interesting to know what prompted the internal discussion lets not act like this is some major shift in what ccp views acceptable and unacceptable
i disagree for years multiboxing ment using one mouse and keyboard to be able to control multiple toons at the same time ccp is trying to walk back 7 years of confirmation that this was ok while providing little explanation or taking into account the half dozen work arounds to accomplish the same thing without much downside to the multiboxers today right now i could easily implement a very simple change in isboxer and get around 90 of the mouse and keyboard duplication ban with zero hassle the other 10 will simple take me a few more button presses to achieve so instead of arguing among our selves i would like to speak directly to ccp and to show them the errors of their policy and to also dig into what really their issues are whatever they hope to fix will not go away people will still be able to multibox with little difficulty only some inconveniences
no discussion is required and most of the csm in the past have believed that isboxers ability to clone commands needed to go you can still multibox just fine hell i do with three alts everyday you just cant broadcast to the three characters not that difficult to understand imo no discussion is needed this is a good rule
what error you want them to roll back the ruling or completely ban isboxer and other things which have other benefits and if you can get around the ruling then why are you complaining
follow the rules of ferengi acquisition and you will have plenty of 
do not buy ingame anymore do it for dollars or whatever your currency islower the demand ingameand stop this stupid f spam everywhereand what the hell should mean a menace not to any accounts anymore you want me to lol onlyingame are already paied its no odds who use it finallytheres nothing wrong with a living marketnobody should request market manipulations for his own advantagei have no  i use no  easiest way to avoid disadvantages1 from me
ill be glad to see you again
you deserve alot of it though people dont see how much you have been pushing for all thisbefore i ran last year two step said how getting steve on the csm was super important i can now appreciate how much this is true hes worked really hard totally has my support good luck on csm x
i agree they are related but i am not sure we need to implement that before a wardec change there really isnt any difference from a game mechanics view whether a new player stays in an npc corp or in some new unwardeccable corplite that is really just a form of player controlled npc corpthere are and still will be player corps and we need ideas to make wardecs between them meaningful and more engaging i dont agree that anything that enables a wardec to carry on is good ccp could just make decdodging an exploit again and wars would go on longer then but people would still just dock up and play an alt or worse go play another game entirely we need ways to make players want to stay in a player corp otherwise if there is no incentive or desire to defend it but we force them to endure the whole dec they just wont log in ok so you think making npc corps more dangerous or punitive might be better than enticing carebears with carrots to player corps do you think carebears would put up with this increased risk or would they quit the game i really dont have a sense of the carebear thinking on this
doesnt that mechanic already exist in the form of chat channels wouldnt making your noncorp corps a game mechanic just move the problem from a handful of big npc corps to a whole bunch of smaller ones at the cost of a bunch of time coding stuff
greetingsim corbexx and im announcing my intention to run for csm xlast year was a bit of a rush for me with me deciding to run at the last minute this year im much more prepared being already on csm 9 means should i get elected i can hit the ground running and hopefully accomplish even morei started playing eve over 5 years ago after some real life friends moved in to a wormhole i joined them and spent 4 months in a c3 wormhole then we left for null sec for 10 months and became a director i got tired of that and then moved back to highsec and spent a couple months doing level 4 missions while i finished a few skills for my first big wormhole corp ccres after 6 months i moved on to aharm and am now in exceed part of noho i also have a successful t3 production and cap building corporation some of the things i have done while in these alliances include lots of pvp running reaction poss in nullsec i was the diplomat for aharm planning and executing invasions on other wormholes helping to defend wormholes helping organise large multi alliance wormhole fleets being part of some truly great wormhole fights probably the most memorable was taking a armour fleet with triage support and an officer fit moros in to a pulsar against 3 times the caps and coming out on top representing wspace on csm 9 im running mainly as a wormhole candidate again as thats what i know best though i do have a lot of industry experience as well some of the work i have done this year on the csm c1 to c4 pve testing leading to some nice buffs to wspace loads of pos research with over 100 questionnaires sent out and the information sorted for ccp a wormhole general little things thread leading to loads of small upgrades sigs ids staying over downtime d scan and probe scanner being split a wormhole pve little things thread multiple wormhole townhalls attended all sugar kyles eve uni chats pve sounding board with players and some ccp developers which has been really constructive managed to attend all meetings with ccp except 1 approximately 30 or so be incredibly available to wspace people with over 370 people now having access to me on skype and answering 20 to 40 eve mails a week written up more than my fair share of summit minutes what will you get from mesome one who has very good wormhole knowedge and experience while my main lives in a c6 wormholes i have alts in several lower class wormholes and understand issues they have in them im some one who isnt affraid of work and will happily put in huge hours to get stuff sorted i have good communication skills and will happily chat to anyone about issues someone who is no nonsensebe you a solo player ceo of a huge allaince or a ccp dev if your idea is good ill tell you that if its terrible ill tell you that as well experience i have a much better understanding on how the csm works now and how to get the most for people im representing
reserved for endorsements
fully support corbexx and will have him on the 1 spot on my list he goes out of his way to reach out and get feedback and opinions from every wormhole corporation out there from all classes of systems and demographics if you live in wspace and you dont vote for corbexx youre doing it wrong and you should feel bad
all of no holes barred back corbexx for csm x we are proud of him 
corbexx has been doing an outstanding job on csm 9 and i am happy to fully endorse him next time around he has been putting a ton of work into the csm process far more than i ever did and he has been getting results if you live in wspace and dont vote for him i will personally invade your hole and evict youcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
1 corbexx has been excellent this year and i expect no less going forwardalso i am slightly afraid to not endorse him after he picked me 90kg up and threw me over his shoulder like i was a sack of flour at ff a couple years agobest of luck my 
corbexx has been an outstanding csm rep both in general and for wormhole space in particular he has worked his tail off for both lowclass and highclass holes i dont have to wait for my annual endorsements post to tell you i endorse him wholeheartedly for csm xhe should be at the top of your ballot if you care about wormholesthanks for all your hard work corbexx keep it upauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
youve got my vote buddybeen great to have you on the csm this year looking forward to a second term  stuck in here with me
i will be voting for corbexx the blue loot buy order increases have made it much easier to fuel my pos and still make a profit in a c2 wormhole all by myself and thats just my favorite thing he did
corbexxx has been good to work with even if his name sounds somewhat like that of a male pron star hell be on my recommendations
finally a candidate i feel strongly about supporting thank you for doing this sabrizyou have my vote my support and my axe if we had axes which we dont but imagine we do and you have minea vote for sabriz adoudel is a vote for keeping the true spirit of eve online aliveo7
hi sabrizits clear ive confounded you with someone else i suspect it was malcolm shinhwa who did abide in a hole for quite some timethanks for correcting that error
is it voting season alreadyyouve convinced me to keep my second account subbed
sabriz your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train why are you so popularmore seriously your understanding of what eve is and your ideas of what eve could be make you an excellent candidate for the csm the amount of time you have spent helping new players understand how to play the game shows you clearly care about eve and have a deep understanding of game mechanicsyou have my endorsement i believe you would be an excellent representative for highsec players of all stripes not just the content creators that live there
i think there is a risk vs reward problem for almost all pve content in eve they are currently designed in such ways that the best ship to do them in will have next to zero chance in pvp every part of eve should have the things needed to support people living there in my opinion i dont think that sov 00 people going back to highsec incursions between call to arms is a good idea i think the better approach would be to encourage people to try more pve outside highsec by changing rewards and the entire way you do the missions ideally you would have equal pve payouts in all types of space there is also the problem where you cant force someone to fight and people tend to be very risk averse when the fastest way to run a mission is a 2b tengu and no one is going to bring their 15b incursion vindicator to lowsec for a tiny bit more isk i used to farm incursions in deep hostile 00 and lowsec when they were first released and the payouts they had back then with increased payouts  blitzing was actually kinda good for lowsec and you certainly had risk and my group even lost a couple of machariels but we did all the sites with full pvp fits so it wasnt a slaughter when some fleet showed up i think this was a awesome example of how people who normally do pvp could do a pve activity in hostile space and still be able to fight back if someone tries to pull a jackmove on you
i agree that every part of eve should be able to support the people living there in some wayhowever i am a little confused with the rest you think pve should be equally rewarding in all types of space by changing rewards and the entire way you do the missions if that was the case why would anyone leave the safest region of space highsec if they are only going to get the same reward if they moved to a more dangerous spaceshouldnt more risky space have more rewarding pve payouts otherwise why would i risk my ships there for pve
i meant that there should be greater rewards for more dangerous space you should always reward the brave there are less people out there doing pve and they should be able to at least compete income wise with someone who only runs missions solo and never really interact with other people in a mmo
honestly surprised to be the first one posting this
um noi am just wondering if this is a stealth antiafk cloaking threadmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
no
i see far more negatives than positives with this proposalnot supported
no theres no need for fuel1
if this is true why is all your drama necessary
it should be noted that we talked about input multiplexing at the summer summit
its extremely clearusing isboxer to control multiple clients simultaneously is now finally illegal alt tabbing is notthe end
nousing isboxer or any other hard or software to send one click or keypress to more than one client is now finally illegalexcept for out of game stuff like login and settings
no it makes no sense to revamp a working system completelybut i see the idea behind im sure it would be much easier to create audit log containers user configurable in sizes between large audit log container and station containerelse it should be more useful to have more flexible content filters in hangars and containers
how do you intend to give carebears a 5050 chance of winning the chance of winning an encounter varies drastically depending on circumstancesi mean an afk hulk has a near 0 chance of winning against a ganker a skiff has a near 100 chance of winning against the same ganker properly tanked he has a 100 chance of winning against 5 against 7 he has a variable chance of winning depending on how much attention he pays to local if he mines aligned has bodyguards etchow do you intend to give carebears an even chance of winning given how variable circumstances are
the fundamental problem is illogical player behaviorwhich as a dev you have to account for there is a certain prestige and mindset with joining a corp that you dont have with joining a chat channel so a lot of players createjoin corps even when they are clearly better off joining a chat channel and mailing list these players are also the reason awoxing is being removed and wardecs got nerfed eve is a social game and you really do want to encourage the userbase to be sociali would support a corp in name only status for the social players this would allow ccp to attach better risks and rewards to real corporations
i can appreciate your point about the prestige of being in a corp though its not something i personally experience im a member of the minerbumping channel o and i certainly agree with you that more interaction between players is good for them and for the gamehowever i honestly dont see these noncorp corps changing anything other than eleventyone of the dang things when everyone deserts the nowdeccable npc corps its moving a problem not resolving it
i can not speak highly enough of what having corbexx appointed as the wormhole delegate has accomplished in terms of building understanding with ccp in regards to the wormhole communities unique needs and concerns we can at times as a community be a divided house of cats it is my opinion as a pilot as a member of the wormhole community and as the ceo of a wormhole corp that we could not ask for a better representative of our needs and culture to ccp then corbexxthe man has proven himself more then up to the task and is always available to discuss concerns or hear ideas on how to make our little piece of eve a better place you can count on unbounds voting support for as long as your able to provide your time into the future and will continue to have our gratitude for all the time and effort youve already put in for us tldrstep 1 vote corbexxstep 2 profit
1 voted for you last election and will do so again you were the character that got me into wormholes and i havent looked back sincecorbexx has gone above and beyond what is required for the wormhole community during his time as a csm member the wh to
oh thismakes me smile want to talk join my channel in game house forelli
i would consider changing this to apply to members for the first 7 days they are in a corpany corp otherwise people will just create corps on alts and swap to them once they get deccedadmittedly this does have the side effect of affecting all new corp members but i view this as a minor downside
for the record if you send me a link to the voting site once voting starts so i dont forget it i will vote for you
sion really knows his stuff its as simple as that been a great asset to csm tbh he wont need help to get on but he more than justifies his position
hello radu before i continue let me wish you the best for your csm runi think this is a little disingenuous the powers that be have made it pretty clear that ganking is meant to be in the game and a challenge for haulers to overcome in several places most recently by ccp falcon in this thread all his comments summarized herebut that aside i more concerned with the overall risk vs reward design of the game and curious to hear your views on the issue highsec haulers have some of the lowest risk in the game and as such the profession is notorious for afk and even actual botting behaviour perhaps this reputation is unfair  i dont know  but it appears that many haulers feel entitled to move their goods for their own profit through highsec with near impunity while away from the keyboard now i have no problem with active haulers actually playing the game being able to move their goods in safety and it seems to me all the tools exist for this to take place  instadockundock bookmarks warptozero jumping and tanking your ship to be unprofitable to gank what you are hauling being the main ones however the years of ganking nerfs have made the actual chance you encounter a ganker vanishingly small many haulers either dont know about the risk or perhaps rightly consider it so vanishingly small and ignore it and continue to overloadautopilot their ships this wouldnt be a problem if they just got blown up from timetotime and accepted it as the cost of doing business but many of them choose to come to the forums and complain that it is unfair ganking is too easy and the like even though they were the ones who made themselves a profitable target by overloading their ship and then leaving the keyboard to do something else than play the game to protect their stuffso what do you think could be done to better educate haulers that space is indeed a dangerous place and they must take responsibility ill throw out some ideas not necessarily ones that i support though just to hear your thoughts removal of or a cost added to  the autopilot function very rare but nonzero chance a powerful npc spawns perhaps tie it to the sleeper lore that will after a few minutes destroy a ship where the pilot is afk but is otherwise completely avoidable by a player at the keyboard a highsec deployable that does nothing but shutdown the autopilot of ships an ingame mechanism by which a player especially a new players can tell if their ship is overloaded and profitable to gankaside from the issue of bumping and freighter ganking something that happens so rarely in new eden that i am not sure it should be a plank of a csm platform it seems that haulers have all the cards to avoid pretty much every gank except the most motivated and targeted ones and even those if they make the effort to fly a ultratanked dst are there other specific issues unrelated to highsec ganking that haulers face that you feel should be brought to the table via the csm
i have no idea in which eve universe you play  but a simple look at a filtered kill board will show you that freighter kills and ganks are definitely not something that happens rarely  look here you will notice that most of those kills happen in high sec by the way and not in general hostile space
hello senior pedroand welcome to the discussion i want you to know that i have read your comments and certainly have a reply to your pointsbut for the moment i simply wish to say happy thanksgiving to all and everyone  whether you celebrate the holiday or not  may you have a warm home full belly and wonderful day i hope everyone can take the day off and treat themselves to some rl rest and relaxation ill get back to this thread tomorrow and reply then best wishes rl
if you actually look at that list i see a total of 8 suicide ganks on that list in the last week all done in one session by code and in fact for the other 6 days there were zero suicide ganks of freighters in highsec way more freighters were lost in the last week under wardec than to suicide ganks of course whether this is rarely is in the eye of the beholder but certainly compared to the number of ships lost each day in eve or the number of safe freighters trips the number suicide ganked freighters is a fraction of a tenth of a percent in fact ccp relatively recently said that suicide ganking was at an all time low a fanfest 2013 presentation maybe and with the recent buffs to freighters they are safer than ever before to me though it seems that freighters even autopiloted and overloaded are statistically one of the safest ships you can fly in the game
what is so bad with being a hauler in new eden your chances of being violenced in any manner wardec gank etc are so miniscule that you can pretty much operate in complete safety if you are at your keyboard and taking active measures to avoid conflict actually playing the game the chances drop even more dramaticallyyou do realize that removing autopilot will hurt ganking because everyone will be warping to 0 and that in combination with removing webbing will only reinforce the need to have large numbers of friends to gank because the only things that will be easily catchable will be freighters with their terrible align times smaller entities will have to roll the dice more often because scanning will be harder to do without all the slowboating going on which discourages ganking anything smaller than a freighterquite frankly all i see here is a severe lack of need for any sort of highsec hauling representative who thinks ganking is a problem or that haulers have it bad on the csm especially considering ganking is at an alltime low and becoming harder with every rebalance patch to up the ehp of ships and that wardecs are so stupidly broken as to be nearly useless highsec doesnt need to be any safer its already had plenty of safety measures installednot to mention that you sign your posts
your ability to count seems to be very off  since when can anyone declare war on a npc corporation to begin with it seems that you stopped counting after a single day  that is very shortsighted for this kind of discussion which doesnt seem to be in your interest to begin with considering your statements in the thread of the candidate you already support and the statement of radus candidacy was very clearly pointing at logistics  and not as a high sec representative or antiganking rep logistics happens all over of eve  not just in high secedit and since the 3 of you are committed to another candidate i would actually appreciate if you would state so if you want to be treated with any credibility and not just like trolls in another candidates thread
actually youre right  i missed several cfc ganks6  in and about jita but still there are more nonsuicide ganks wardecs or suspect flags in the last week than suicide ganks marmite alone has killed 11 frieghters and 5 jump freighters in the last week war targets get 24h notice and getting a suspect flag can be avoided with a safety setting so these losses are completely avoidable  and yet they are still more common than falling victim to a suicide gank which shows you how rare the suicide ganking of freighters actually is edit we are quibbling over numbers here which is not my intention it seems unlikely we can settle on the correct number of suicide ganks there should be in highsec especially since we dont have all the information  like how many trips are competed safely as for my voting intentions i have made up my mind to endorce one candidate so far as disclosed in my signature so i will be treated with credibility as you say however the ballot is long i fully intend to seriously consider everyone who throws their hat in the ring perhaps we should wait and hear what the candidate has to say to my questions
lets look at the mechanics then in general  which are seriously broken and everyone is aware of thatwar declarations the only place in eve where that matters is high sec it prevents concorde from getting involved in those infights who declares war on whom since you love numbers  the number of serious war declarations between 2 opposing corporations or alliances is minimal in most cases we deal with a wellprepared high sec war monger against a lesser prepared entity  be it because of lack of knowledge or ignorance or simply the fact that they mainly consist of peaceful playerswars have not been declared for years between any serious eve entities as they reside in null sec or low sec where there is no concorde intervention to begin with this mechanic has been broken for years and that has basically not changed despite some adjustments to itsuspect flag most carebears have never once changed their safety settings as they never had need for it those who have this flag deserve of course to be a common target but interesting enough no one cares about blinky pilots in combat ships  everyone chickens out or tolerates them to begin with so that argument is a pretty lame one to begin with and you know that almost every suspect did his action deliberately and most of them know exactly what to do to become one or what to avoid others  especially newer players occasionally get tricked into actions to become suspect  this has been a common practice since eve exists the number of suspectflagged freighter pilots per day wouldnt even need the fingers of a single hand to count them
trolling all candidates should back up their claims against anyone who asks it shows credibility and suitability for the positionactually its not a lame argument at all its up to the chicken pilots to make things dangerous for blinky pilots ccp has literally given players a means to police themselves and people like you just  on it and ask for more nerfs and safety instead of providing consequences for crime
since you change tone you might be careful who you accuse of what here you dont know me nor have you any idea about my stance towards certain elements and how i deal with them eve has more than enough systems to express ones will for violence and pew whining about nerfs in a policed and regulated area that was never meant to be the central place for violence is just what i expected from you eve has always and will always have to deal with common demographics of players that includes builders caretakers haulers and pew orientated people eve consist of a full sized environment that was meant to be played by all these different groups  not just the last stated pew groupon top of that people tend to split into 2 major factions  the forum warriors and the people who simply want to enjoy a game for whatever time they can afford for it the latter group does not necessarily voice themselves as heavily in forums as the more outgoing aggressive players  its simply not part of their nature to begin with over the years eve has seen different groups who tried to take ownership of how eve should be played or what it should be  and it has led to an awful collection of errors and failed tweeks phoebe started to get rid of some of them already and brings a lot of the original eve back  which has nothing to do with nerfing its always a give and take and the original problem has never been solved since many years back  the mechanics in high sec dont really reflect a policed and regulated area at all the mechanics are still mainly used by a minority in that area to satisfy their bloodlust which could easily be satisfied in more than 3000 other system that are designed for exactly that
its definition has not changed multiboxing is still using one kbm for several clientstoons that hasnt changed no they arent its a change in how they view input broadcasting it has nothing to do with their stance on multiboxing
so was wondering if there are any possibilities like 1v1 2v2 such as so where in the players get rewards for making to the top i think it would improve gameplay and there is a lot of pvp capuslers that i think would enjoy this feature rewards could be plex ded space items bpc even bpo to each player and also having different categories like the burners missions frigs only or mixed categories where in say its a 5v5 and theres has to be a command ship 2 frigs a support ship and a crusier t3 or not just something along those lines i think it would be sweet it may have been proposed before but hey it worth a shot it would be cool maybe even have an entry few also have caps in the tournament only 30 pilots and enter maybe even giving a medals for winning and for loosing
here is a link to my blog of ideas to make eve an even better gamesnip  spam post ideas on fi  isd supogodomanark cohost clueless space nerds podcast
nope not going to feed your blog adverts post the idea or gtfo
the are an in game item and the prices should be treated like any other in game item your ability to use fictional in game currency to buy game time is a matter of convince if you can not pay real money to play a single account for eve then you have other issues then prices of course if people stop using to buy game time and then drop since they cant afford the real money fee then ccp may reexamine their fees  as that is how supply and demand works sobad idea all around1
is ganking bad
i am in the minerbumping channel too so i understand what you meanit solves the problem of corps are one size fits all once you have a corp for social people who arent interested in the risks or rewards you can change mechanics for real corps to give real benefits and risks
yes there is no difference in terms of game mechanics but in terms of social player mechanics and social players are happy players the most extreme of my carebear cousins will simply go and play the hello kitty browser game whilst waiting for a wardec to expire you will find that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink except if you use the camelbrick strategy but that violates the human rights of the cameli think that there is simply no way to make a player take part in a war dec if he doesnt want tobut if he is in a corp with a poco or a pos then losing his stuff is punishment enough and if he doesnt want to fight then spending a week or two just docked up is punishment enough and damages his miningfarming for plex then it is up to the player what he does
ok so you think making npc corps more dangerous or punitive might be better than enticing carebears with carrots to player corps do you think carebears would put up with this increased risk or would they quit the game i really dont have a sense of the carebear thinking on this quotei guess it works like thisi think that some of my carebear cousins will take the path of least resistancebut ccp statistics shows that they are more likely to keep playing if there is some kind of social connectionnpc corps are poison for the soul of eve
trust me before your average care bear gets informed enough to join a chat channel he has already given up and gone back to wowbeing a part of a corporation in name only is something that gives carebears a chance to feel as big as the members of the cfc or code or nulli secunda etcremember feeling is as important as being
good questionat the moment fitting tank requires a very big drop in potential mining yield or cargoi could support a variety of ideas that allow players to actively as in not afk to switch between yield and tanki have some ideas but once again i present the theory that csm should control the ccp plans and not present their own ideas too strongly especially when they have no idea about how hard or impractical something should be to codeone of my ideas especially for freighter pilotsthe caldari navy intelligence self destruct devicethis device was developed for caldari navy intelligence once activated it guarantees 995 the complete destruction of the ship and the cargoso when it is fitted the pilot simply has to be not afk and he can deny potential gankers any loot whatsoever
hmm
well the brick strategy is especially cruel for male camels
i have no doubt but im not convinced that a camel can have human rights
are you trying to derail my csm campaign with some petty ethical distractions or would you care to comment on the state of the game today
well its hardly an ethical distraction an animal would clearly have animal rights rather than human rights im not making any comment on whether any particular practice is cruel or not
and your opinion about the state of the game or any of the eve related issues that have been mentioned herei think it would be a shame if the csm was elected based upon the differences between camels and humans
i think the game is in a better state than ever most of my concerns about specific issues were canvassed during the summer summit  i think the current csm is doing an excellent job tags4standings is about the only highsec issue i care much about bring it on i would like to see highsec separated by lowsec to make the trade hubs more independent thats about it reallyoh except for dynamic system sec status that would be fantastic
why and in what direction do you care about iti personally think that tags4sec as it is well it is a bit easy easy for some antisocial gankertype to just spend a few hundred million isk and get their standings backwhat do you thinki dont think having the only route between jita and amarr going through lowsec space would make any great improvement for the game trade hubs will develop where they are economical and if the map is changed then after a time the most popular trade hubs will change with themof course this makes a horrible disadvantage for the new players that are just starting but then well maybe theywe should have started playing earlierdynamic system sec status do you mean that sec status would be system specificplease explain more
donUFFFDt let corbexxUFFFDs extremely high level of competence fool you heUFFFDs also a super fun guy and has a great sense of humor heUFFFDs a great advocate for wh space and has been and is still pushing ccp on important wh matters if youUFFFDre at all involved with wh space this guy should be at the top of your ballot he also rocks hawaiian shirts
and dont forget that we carebears are not so bothered by corporation taxotherwise tdd dominators would not have had the success he had 
all of hydra backs the gorski car
my tags my pride
complete safety even in only a small number of systems is anathema to the wartime economy that drives eve any time you undock to affect the universe you should be vulnerable especially if you are injecting isk into the market willynilly unfortunately the trend has been towards making highsec safer it doesnt need it and this candidates stated ideas will only reinforce the general trend of making things safer despite what he believes that makes him a poor candidate
you are right that here is the core of the problem but it is in your expectation that is the problem not the game mechanics eve is not a simulation of a space utopia where everyone gets along  it is a dark gritty unsafe universe where many of the game mechanics are explicitly design to induce player vs player conflict i have already linked ccp falcons recent comments confirming that this is the design of the game and it is still the devlopers intentions to keep all of new eden including highsec and unsafe place highsec criminals are suppose to exist wars between highsec entitites are suppose to exist suicide ganking is suppose to exist all of these are clearly coded into the the game and not by mistakeeve is fundamentally risk vs reward and without at least some risk everywhere or at least everywhere that can influence the greater game world and economy the game pretty much breaks or at least the sandbox part of it does now if you or perhaps more appriopriately the csm candidate whose thread this is can give me specific issues where haulers are at an unfair disadvantage or there are some quality of life issues that could be addressed by a csm representative i am eager to hear it if you both are just complaining that haulers can die when then dont use the myriad of tools to protect themself as i outlined in my original post i fail to see the point of electing a representative whose sole campaign plank is ccp falcon is wrong  highsec should be totally safe
repeating the same argument over and over does not change certain things and comments of a ccp employee can be linked from sources in here  linking to the outside sources of manifestos and alike doesnt make it any more valid  we finally entered the level of trolling there has not been talk of removal but being broken  and i am simply taking part to prevent another high jacking of another thread by you guys your own candidate has only repeated the words of another person actually james and your interest is not to throw in your hat for anyone else but that candidate  so you are trolling i am sure radu will be happy to answer in depth if you indeed had any serious intentionsand using ccp falcon now to protect your weak chain of arguments is just another low we are not discussing what he said but what you try to imply which was never said or stated to begin with or to use the words of your beloved candidate high sec is the targetriches part of eve and making sure that its a hunt and not a battue of the targets is all that happens here
i apologize you felt that link is trolling  that was not my intention ccp falcons responses are scattered all through that thread so in the interest of making my point concisely i used the most condensed version i know of i could spend the time to go through and link them all again directly in this post but i am not sure that would add anything to the discussion since the accuracy of falcons words are not in dispute the point is that ccp falcon was clear about how the game is designed how it is intended to work and that design includes haulers being destroyed in highsec further i dont see how using the words of a lead ccp developer who clearly states that highsec is a dangerous place where you are responsible for your safety to back up my view that hauler violence in highsec is working as intended is another low i am just pointing out that this is how the game is designed haulers are suppose to be at risk in highsec  i am not sure how many times i need to repeat thisthis is not about any other candidates  i am seriously interested in what radu has to say i even bet there might be an issue or two facing haulers highsec or otherwise that are worthy of attention or perhaps he has some ideas on other issues like wardecs which i have been asking other candidates about but i am not at all convinced that the ganking of highsec haulers is an issue in light of the design of the game  which is suppose to include the ganking of highsec haulersbut i await radus reply perhaps he has something to add that i have not considered
we might even want the same but our approaches are very different here for many players  and especially older players  eve was not just a game but a complete world and as in any world there should be different levels of aggression complexity and threat levels eve basically delivered the framework but has moved further and further away from fixing things from a perspective of a entire world towards fixing single elements as used in a gamesmart players  which eve is full of  will and have always managed to circumvent and twist mechanics towards their need and flavour which is why eve is such an interesting environment but as it stands currently there is basically no room for transition between different levels anymore a simple look on the map will show massive ship destructions in high sec  which is policed and regulated the reaction of the owners of that space does not reflect a logical level anymore if that space would be player owned massive ejects of players from stations in that area would happen organized hunt of criminals would happen etc etc the current players in those systems are guests in empire space  they dont own it so a natural attachment to protect and clean will not happen as ownership will not change  which is one of the highest motivational factors in eve you expect roleplayers to fight hardcore gamers  that approach is simply wrong high sec by its nature attracts mainly people who would role play or require guidance towards goals  thats what missions etc do for them faction warfare and sov null sec on the other hand provide a vast field of sandbox elements  the players make the rules and decide how to execute them and on what level of escalationthere are many things  not just from a ganking perspective  that require csm attention when it comes to high sec faction war players suffer from a broken mechanic that hurts their sec status  influencing their ability to use high sec as well gankers suffer less negative consequences right now than a player actually fighting actively for that factioneve used to have a natural progression from high sec towards low and null sec with the current mechanics there is no incentive anymore thus a growing number of targets is available for those who play the current empire mechnics for their own purpose the fixing needed would not only affect gankers but many more groups of people logistics is the natural connector of all these different groups as basically nothing can be done properly in eve without at least some level of it
good morning gentlemenquite a few things were said here throughout yesterday as i said i was away due to the american holiday of thanksgiving but am replying today as promised this post is a placeholder for the post to come i just wish to express that i hope the conversation may pause while i draft a formal reply in the interim it will be an edited post of this one thank you for understanding and please check back periodically for my actual replyregards rl
yes and thats why it doesnt need to be safer or easier or why there necessarily needs to be a csm platform based upon it its in everyones interests not to mention one of the best ways of defeating your opponent in a war is to disrupt their supply lines over the years this has become harder and harder to do through various mechanics tweaks and additions and npc corporations and broken wardec mechanics only exacerbate the problem ganking is one of the only ways this can be done close to the source of goods
i think that it could be a great addition to the traveling system in eve if using fuel allowed us to bypass the use of gatesit could be maybe used just in subcapital ships instead of traveling from gate to gate using fuel grants us the ability to travel to the star of an adjacent gateconnected system instead of forcing fuel into all of us just add the fuel usage as an alternative of our actual traveling systemthis is such an excellent fondonapproved idea that i think it deserves its own thread i might do it someday
i just assume that all threads that mention fuel are stealth antiafk cloaking threads
i vote for steve so that i dont have to think about industry i love your site manfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
why do i think the game is better than ever so many fixes since crucible and now starting on the fun big stuffi didnt say tags4sec i said tags4standings as in faction standings my views are on record  i think the current grind is awful
they can already do that we have mobile depots and orcas both let you switch between yield and tank on the flyit honestly sounds like you arent very knowledgeable about the game which is a common problem for carebears
yes there is and that candidate is sabriz good luck with your run thoughfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
flying an orca is probably really boring and with the changes coming to isboxer i am not thinking about multiboxing any time soonwe carebears need all the help we can get including a voice on the csm that is my opinion
ah now i understand so your key point of distinction with mike azariah is that you are the proisboxer candidategood luck with that
nopenot in the slightest but im not about to start trying being a oneman mining fleet nowand i am looking forward to seeing mike starting a campaign thread
corbexx i voted for you last year and i greatly appreciate the work youve done for the wormhole community the new shattered wormholes look awesome and im sure youve been weighing in on their development my primary point of concern i the fact that you sat through the meeting in which ccp announced their decision to remove high sec awoxing and said almost nothing could you elaborate on your feelings on this topicfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
not everything from the meeting is in the minutes going back and looking through them there is actually a fair bit i said in them i remember that meeting very well as it became pretty heated first i think you mean the corp on corp aggression not axowing as awoxing is differentcorp mechanics are incredibly complex very unintuitive at the moment the optimal way to play in hisec and be safe is to be in a npc corp removing the corp on corp in hisec is a good thing for newbies who just dont understand the game mechanics yes there will be issue yes it will affect rvb and eve uni but on the whole i think its for the better you can still infiltrate a corp and steala nd rob them blind no issue thereevery month i go to both of sugar kyles eve uni chat and this is brought up every month as a issue
thanks for the reply would you agree then that encouraging new players to join corps in high sec is more important than keeping a number of veterans in the game that use this as their primary playstyle i realize corp theft is a major point of gameplay in wormhole space but it in not available in most cases in high sec corporations in high sec dont have in space assets in general and function more like communities than cohesive entities these groups will be virtually impervious to intracorp aggression unless massive amounts of resources are thrown into suicide ganking their mission ship if this change occurs there will be no reason to join corps in high sec at all for theft or aggression because a wardec or suicide gank will be required to achieve the same goal i have a number of friends that are ready to cancel their accounts if this change goes thoughfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
unfortunately this has lost you my votes you were in my top 5 last year i do not agree that this change will be an improvement to gameplay for anyone there are ways to protect yourself from intracorp aggression and simply removing it only helps the corporations that cant be bothered to take the proper measures as far as im concerned this will do harm to eves position as a violent and treacherous game world without actually providing any benefits people will still remain in npc corps to avoid war decs
the first part all depends on numbers which im affraid i just dont haveyou do realise you can still do corp on corp in nullsec lowsec and wspace so your friends can still do what they have been doing im not sure why they have to stay in hisec to do this but if there is please mail me lettering me know
my counter statement to that would be that it means corporations who chose to remain in hs are immune to it if i want to bring down a corp im going to have to infiltrate and either steal everything or convince them to give me shares which is true in all space but if i want to just dish out some quick justice without actually destroying the whole corp i can now do this anywhere except hs step 1 to making hs a theme park
stop thinking of this as a you can pvp anywhere thing let me use a real example i had someone i wanted to target that is a high sec mission runner my ability to suicide gank such a target is extremely limited especially since he was flying an armageddon with an extremely heavy tank any attempt to gank him would cost far more than the ship is worth and require many people wardeccing would just cause him to close corp and make a new one this leaves three options1 get him to leave high sec ccp kindly added popups warning that you are leaving high sec this isnt easy2 trick him into a limited engagement i was assuming he was smart enough to not fall for this3 convince him on an alt to let me join his corp this is not a new player he has been playing eve significantly longer than i have so i doubt cheap tricks with lying about game mechanics will work my only option was to gain his trust but with the changes in the future this will be uselessalso the move to low sec suggestion is insulting i do pvp in low but it is an extremely target poor environment unless you join an extremely large corpalliance null is even worse for small groups and is even more inaccessible from high sec and as much as i love wspace the gameplay there is very differentgood luck on your campaignfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
you have my wholehearted support anything i can do to help your campaign please let me know
friendly bump 1
to throw a curveball sabriz do you support the addition of new pve content in high sec god knows pve in eve is in a boring state right now what should be done to improve the game experience for those playersfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
sion kumitomo id like to pose the same question to you that i posed to corbexx you were in the meeting where ccp proposed the removal of high sec awoxing and barely spoke other than to suggest that suicide ganking is a decent replacement for it is this actually your opinion and could you elaborate on whether you support this changefounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
hello allregarding ganking please see what i have quoted above it is the tldr of the entire thread in short that post 32 covers all the basic ground work of what it is you wish to know it also points you to post 27 which adds to it but i would very much prefer you read the entire threadyour entire discussion from posts s 3550 could have gone an entirely different direction had you simply read posts 1 through 35 and in their entirety therein you would have realized that the points you bring up have already been talked about and logical and fair conclusions drawnwhat i have noticed here are two sides that represent their social spheres rather well but there was very little constructive communication going on because one side was proceeding without the information from the previous posts while the other side assumed those were already read though dwissi showed signs of realizing you had actually not read so before we proceed in constructive discussion please take some time to digest the entirety of this thread and then go on otherwise this thread will simply become rehash statements straw man arguments and become a complete waste of peoples times including those who post willingly uniformedmy next post will be regarding actual subject matter rather than the nature of the 15 post debate which has just been describedregards radu lupescups  theres a history lesson post that explaining why i sign or initial my posts as you read youll come across it
hello mr pedro and mr hobbonce again welcome to the discussionby the time you read this post i imagine that you have taken time to read at your leisure this entire thread and are thereby now amply informed on where i stand why and what mechanics of mental faculty led me to my reasoning and conclusions hint balance equality and the integrity of eve online may be a few  you also understand that im not as specifically interested in high sec as i am in hauling and haulers but many of my hauling constituents have a stake there and therefore necessity and concern drew me to more closely examine it as well that has been done and i feel comfortable with the drawn conclusions so as to approach them when talks between the csm and ccp regarding high sec arise pending my being elected of course but what has this discussion of high security space and ganking demonstratedwhat you see is a candidate that has a very specific platform yet who is willing to listen to the concerns of all from new eden you have seen where i was not informed i asked questions when i received answers i asked more questions and the questions did not stop until a clear picture presented itself after that point you saw how i went through each point carefully and used logic and reason with a dose of history as the governing factors in my conclusions in essence a representative of the hauling community was able to reach across the isle and allow representatives of the ganking community to build my conclusions with me and that is a democratic system and how i function and shall function as a csm 10 memberi will say now that you may rest assured that i am more than willing to discuss subjects outside of my platform and the process of adjudication will once again be repeated until a clear picture of the new subject is presented as well rinse repeat find the logical conclusion to the new subject its that simplei obviously have no idea how the other candidates for csm 10 function or reach their conclusions i can only hope that it has nothing to do with the devilish word bias i say that because the last thing that eve online needs is more bias currently it would appear that bias is outweighing objectivity in eve ranging curiously from ccp and blatantly to many newer players and that is a very dangerous thing because the moment that bias is a factor emotions are close to follow and once youve gotten near that stage no constructive conversation may be had that is exactly why in my life as in eve i apply every method known to me in order to remove bias from the adjudication processits difficult to question my platform given there is simply nobody that solely represents hauling in eve but ill be happy to examine any hauling related questions with you and now that i have a good taste for going outside of my sphere of knowledge intrinsic to my community i look very forward to the next question that stirs the deliberation processthank you and clear skies radu lupescu

hi steveyou wont need my vote to get elected but ill be giving it to you anyway good luck in the campaign
you have my support 100 the terminal end of the digestive system
excellent questionill elaborate when not at work but the answer is a qualified yes  as long as the new pve content is designed to drive a bit more conflict and player interaction
in this long thread much has been written but frankly i still dont have a concrete idea of what ideas you want to bring to the csm i have a sense of how you and dwissi view the game and that you think there is too much ganking in highsec but not much else being a csm member is not a ceremonial position  they are they to provide specific feedback and ideas on the development of the game from the players not just represent a player type therefore i would kindly ask you consisely and directly answer the following questions so we as voters know what issues you will prioritize and bring to the attention of the csm and ccp during your first summit if elected1 what are the top three issues facing haulers today in eve are there any qualityoflife issues facing them or is there a need for new ship types or tweaks to make their game play more engaging are there issues for new players getting into the career2 in your op you say that your number one goal is to give a voice to the gank targeted minority from the rest of the thread it is clear you think ganking is too prevelent a in your view what is the proper amount of ganking in highsec you can answer in any metric you want eg 10 of what it is now 11000 chance of gank per undock none at all etc but i am trying to get a sense of when and in what situations you think a player should be gankable b what specific changes in game mechanics would you recommend to the csmccp to make highsec haulers more safe3 do you agree that eve as a game is designed to balance risk vs reward if so from your point of view which activities are most out of balance in the game today  that is pay too much reward for too little risk or are far too risky for a small amount of reward i would appreciate as direct answers as possible similar to the ones you would give to ccp at your first csm summit
hello mr pedroill begin by saying that i enjoy how you are now bringing disciplined command to the thread you are certainly the first representative of your community who has done so and for this i am grateful  but now i must address that your structure is based off of a false premise that you mr pedro almost managed point outyou were very close to identifying what happens between the csm and ccp but i have recently spoken with a member of the csm for counsel i have also paid close attention to what other csm members have said in open source during the course of conversation and examination a very clear picture was painted for me one that has absolutely nothing to do with what a csm campaign runner suggests is his or her agenda but rather everything to do with who and what that member represents and the constitution of their character and personality those things are what is most needed in delegating over matters that ccp brings to the csm given that the opposite the csm bringing things to ccp is rare you will notice that every member who runs for the csm again does not attempt to repeat the silly notion of having 3 things that he or she will boldly throw at ccp for examination now you know why i hope you wont mind but i will take your quote and adjust it for accuracy being a csm member is not a ceremonial position  they are to provide personal insight and thoroughly thought out opinions on subjects that are brought to them by ccp for player input ccp has gone to csm members that represent their constituents and presented ideas to that csm member but it is available for all members to examine if there is any inaccuracy in that corrected quote then i will accept the amended version from any current csm office holders and them alone i do however suspect they shant disagree with this understanding in mind i will address points that you bring up that remain pertinent after the facts1 because of the vast array of potentials that eve holds new haulers stand a chance at starting in the career of hauling missioning is available to them and if they are able to find a mentor or proper group they also stand a chance at making money the idea that a new hauler can make enough money to plex for the month is absurd though because the rewards at this stage of hauling is something that most people would scoff at  i have already addressed what changes need to occur to the freighter in a previous post the nature of blockade runners and deep space transports has been touched upon by ccp already and those ships are in fine shape the bowhead is a great addition to the field of hauling and its ramifications are linked to my freighter changes post besides this the orca was not designed as a professional hauling ship therefore it does not count as a middle step between industrial ships and freighters this means that the creation of a midway ship should be considered as there is currently a defect in the industrial to freighter progression2 this is a straw man argument as i nor dwissi have never stated ganking is too prevalenta you need specific statistical data in order to pass such a judgement and that means  of mining ships and hauling ships destroyed by ganking this would prove an interesting statistic and we could go from thereb i have already addressed this in a previous post please avoid rehash if you can3 hauling is far too risky for too little reward the only place where the pay is good is at the jump freighter level though this necessitates having at least 2 accounts in order to be achievable 6 billion for the ship and several billion in collateralall of your questions have been answered based on understanding the premise with which they were written therefore take note that your questions have been answered thoroughly two of the questions you brought up were already answered in previous posts indicating those posts were not read so please know i would rather wait a week for someone to read the entire thread thereby becoming knowledgeable and answer that persons informed questions than dignify another question based on lack of interest the greatest enemy to knowledge is not ignorance it is the illusion of knowledge  stephen hawkings regards radu lupescu
this was not even an argument at all strawman or otherwise i am just asking for clarification on your view of how the mechanics of highsec ganking should work when and where should it be possible and how common do you think it should beif you do not think that ganking is too prevalent i apologize for putting words in your mouth but that was my interpretation of statements like yours from the original post and from dwissiif you do not think that ganking is too prevalent then i am even more curious what your views on highsec ganking arei am not trying to engage you in a discussion i am asking a clear and specific question about your views on how highsec should work if you do not think ganking is too prevalent then what exactly are your thoughts on highsec ganking and the game mechanics that regulate it and more importantly what should be changed to make the game better
mr lupescu the reason people keep asking you the same questions is because your replies are just a lot of hot air without much substance perhaps you could deign to answer questions in a concise manner instead of avoiding them right now i cant tell if youre having too much fun trolling or seriously trying to roleplay an american politician yes or no is perfectly sufficient in most casesccp has already stated that ganking is at an alltime low based on that do you think that ganking is still too prevalentis this rewards for missions youre talking about or hauling contracts considering that players create such hauling contracts and set the value to their satisfaction how do you propose to fix this perceived imbalance
mr pedronow we are closer to being on the same pagealright so you are actually touching on two separate subjects here equilibrium between a capital ship and noncapitals quite a notion that and the nature of high security space low security space and null security spacethe first has already been well covered i want you to know that but i will digress to recap the initial premises of the drawn conclusions currently the talos brutix catalyst and others have received buffs that make them favored by gankers this combined with loopholes in high sec and the issues with concordpolice forces yield the balance in favor of gankers the only nerf to ganking in the classical meaning of the term has been the insurance nerf regardless of what angle you look at this subject with you will find that the balance which i referred to in my campaign announcement post is in favor of the ganker  therefore when you read the conclusions drawn on this thread you will see how if they were implemented there would be greater equilibrium it is not a question of ganking being too prevalent it is a question of balancing the offensive capabilities of ganker swarms and the defensive capabilities of the hauler now first point is a separate entity from the second point and yet is a part of the second point mind you that this too has already been covered on this thread however the conclusions arent as specific as for the first point so talking about this isnt quite as rehash albeit borderlinewhat we have here is what dwissi brought up in the quote you shared but for all intents and purposes we must look at what distinguishes the 3 security spaceswe have all heard it said at some point or another that null sec is safer than high sec ironically there is a lot of logic in that statement but how is this possible what is the difference what we find is that there in no concord or police presence in null sec well hold on that thought for just a moment as another question needs to be answered in conjunction to moving on what does high security space mean the only parallel we can draw in order to reach what such a term means is to look at rl examples given the term is based off of rl premises so what are examples of high security irlhigh security accesshigh security camerashigh security fenceshigh security jobshigh security lockdownhigh security prisonshigh security residenceshigh security storageshigh security truckinghigh security vacationshigh security vehicleshigh security zonesthese are all easily recognizable rl examples of high security so how does it work in conjunction with eve first and foremost we have 4 specific areas in new eden controlled by 4 different npc governments 2 of these are dictatorial in nature caldari  amarr the other two are democratic in nature gallente and minmatar and there is a slue of eve literature that stresses this so the term high security necessitates meaning different things although similar as just pointed out in the different spaces in caldari space and this is simple philosophical postulation one might image that it would be a very dictatorial place to live perhaps similar to the former soviet union in amarr space one might imagine the stringent precepts of something like religious law and therefore the term comes closer to what most of western culture is used to when imagining high security in gallente and minmatar space still something to be very mindful of but nowhere near as badly as in the other two npc runs hs players run ns and there is supposed to be a happy medium in ls and as dwissi pointed out and alluded to before this means that standings and security status should be on all high security space residents minds first then their professionsthe current state of affairs in high sec does not represent any of this though and given the amount of literature and terminology that has been crafted by and or endorsed by ccp this means that high security space is far from what it was intended to be and if ccp is satisfied with the way things are then the simpler solution would be to rename the three spaces and strongly consider doing away with standings and security statuses players adapt to the environment you provide and having proper definitions is the only way to know what that environment is that is how it works irl and that is how a realistic and science based game needs to function as well so i am not against what ccp decides the definition of things should be i am doing what should be expected of any any csm candidate examining what the content providers have created and waiting for them to solicit my opinion so that i may help them as best i can on behalf of the player body as a representative of that body i sincerely hope you see the logic and reasoning in all of this and i hope you see how the combination of the two points you brought up mean something very different than the commonly thought of means for looking at themregards rl
mr hobbi answer questions quite thoroughly and your suggesting i answer with hot air is disingenuous and insulting please dont become a troll i suggest you examine each of the statements said in the past and back your claims rather than attempting some form of tom foolery and no i am not playing a politician i am who i am in a more relaxed environment i can be fun too but were not here to have fun were here to take care of matters that affect thousands of people across the world and they literally do given the emotional attachments that players form to the games they playnow to your points regarding the tired straw man claim that ganking is too prevalent please read post 58 although the rest of this thread should prove informative for you as well regarding rewards being too lowi was referring to both missioning and contracts created by players one can be adjusted by ccp and the other can be adjusted by something that i would like to see come alive in new eden hunehune stands for the haulers union of new eden unlike pvpers haulers have no collective decision making abilities at the moment my being elected on the csm is a good first step but more needs to be done hune is a means of giving the hauler the a similar collective experience as pvpers currently have it is something that i am hoping all hauling corporations can unite under and include all independent haulers as well further to the point by being a union hune would be able to collectively set prices for hauling in new eden and one might imagine that hune could provide many other benefits for haulers as well and before you begin with assumptions again let me answer you no there would not be any union dues regards rl
i think that sort of answers my question if i understand you you feel that the name high security space is a bit of a misnomer and does not actually represent the level of protection offered by the current game mechanics now for an actual argument i would counter that ccp falcons comments suggest that high security space as it currently is regardless of its name is exactly what ccp intended it to be a place where there is risk i see no need for it but i would not strenuously oppose a change of name to better reflect the level of protection that ccp has currently implemented for highsec if you think the name is misleadingi now have enough information to make my decision on whether your views align with mine and whether to cast a vote for you thank you for your time but i would encourage you to to try and be much more clear and succinct with your views if you want others to seriously consider your candidacy
58 is nothing more than you going over semantics and what ccp actually intends by the words high security in other words hot air presumably if ccp changed the name of highsec to probably medium security but call it whatever you want youd have no problem with the state of it is the definition that important to you or would you prefer to see some mechanics changes either way what if ccp intended highsecurity to be in relation to the other areas of space rather than in relation to a realworld definition would you agree that highsec is indeed higher in security than lowsec spaceregarding ganking since you seem to have trouble giving a straight answer i will assume you think it is still too prevalent even after all of the nerfs to make it less attractivehauling missions run virtually no risk whatsoever why should they pay more as far as your union good on you i hope it works and that youre prepared to strongarm undercutters
thank you mr pedroim sorry that you did not find my replies informative enough but i am glad that you feel you have an informed opinion regarding my candidacy and are ready to make a decision based off of thisregarding ccp falcons comments i have seen his name used a good bit by you and others as reference for ccps official stance this is problematic though given that he and a seemingly strong contingent within ccp have null sec based history as their reference although ccp falcon has made statements about this i would be curious to see if everyone else at ccp especially those that have been working there longer feel the same its fine that he feels that way and it makes sense but a small inquiry simply to see if its a unanimous statement is called for i believe supposing they all feel the same after said inquiry then i would do my best to help provide opinions on what can be done to still close loopholes and adjust the balance between defensibility and offensibility in high security space and also pending that they admit it is a misnomer would be happy to help by providing opinions regarding placing solid definitions that make it very clear as to what is the desired environment of that space thereby needing adjustments throughout the rest of new eden as well mind you this renaming is still something that opposes the historical context of high secsupposing it is not unanimous then a redefining potentially more content creation and what ive talked about before should be examined as well again i would like to be apart of that process toobest of luck to you mr pedro and thank you for your questions rl
mr hobbim afraid you are neglecting the first portion of post 58 i suspect it is simply because you like your stance and wish to ardently maintain it rather than have open minded and intelligent discourse as other members of your community have had on this thread please read post 58 in its entirety and reconsider what you have just typedi have given many answers regarding a complicated matter im sorry that yes or no is the extent of your inquiry into something that cant be answered that way i am not concerned with the prevalence of ganking i am concerned with balance provided there is equal ability for balance and things get tightened loopholes and the mater is settled mechanically and dogmatically then the game is running fine until that time though it is clearly not the posts by mr lowery clearly point out current flaws the posts by dwissi show the dogmatic discrepancies the posts by mr amatin show the nature of the ganking situation from the inside the posts by admiral root raised decent talking points the posts by mr pedro offer decent cross examination and the posts by me have offered logical and reasonable conclusions had you read then youd see why your statements are uninformed i have given you all of the resources available so that you could ask questions that havent already been answered i am more than welcoming of fresh questions to your credit you did ask one and fresh topics but if you ask or say another uniformed or out of context thing i will consider you a troll and leave it at that good day to you mr hobb rlanyone wishing to ask questions based off of previously made conclusions or introduce new topics are more than welcome to do sothank you for reading over this thread and thereby having an informed opiniono7
