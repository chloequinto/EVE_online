2 bil thats just stupid expensive make it only doable once per year and youve got your safeguard weve beaten this horse dead already with ways for people to keep up with who has changed their name so there is no need to get ridiculous with the reqs
i have a proposal that brings out a balance cloakie camperreconintel still can stay cloaked with no issues but local sov holders still have a chance to track them down bring back the pos module system scanner but anchor it outside the pos shields anyone with roles create a role hell can activate the scanner once every 3 hrs and proceed to use the hackingarch minigame to launch a system wide hack burst for all cloaked ships now before you go nuts and say omgwtfbbq the pulse will activate on all cloaked ships in system the exact same type of minigame that they have 1030 min depending on a new skill hacking avoidance to complete the minigame again just like the hackarch sites  it will take what ever skill the originator used as the type to be defended against if you fail 2 times you decloak and your cloaking device is locked off for 15 min during this time the system owners can attempt to track you down
i am glad to see that you prefer the status quo then we have something in common then the op has however quite rightly pointed out that there is currently no way to interact with afk cloakies there is no paper rock or scissors with them and this is the issue not anything to do with being able to or not operate within the current structure his view is that there is no possibility to interact with the cloaky in system with in game mechanics now take your mind back to an earlier period when the trick was to get into a sanctum and stop it from despawning this was used against people with a single sanctum i remenber waiting until we were pretty sure that the cloaker was afk and we went through the sanctum with multiple interceptors with drones assigned to a pattern and we could not decloak him the reason i suggested that we make it so a top skilled prober with specific probes can get a 20km fix on them if they have a cyno onboard is part of the intelligence game and adds risk to those wishing to apply force projection you have that benefit then have an added risk and if he does not then he wont show up at all and that changes the risk equation and people can chose to take that risk thefeore making the camper more likely to prove himself as a threatthe issue with local is that without local people will have to mash dscan continiously and i have to say this is not fun i used to do it in npc 00 when i operated in a contested system in stain for 6 months and while i can do it its one of the reasons i have never bothered with wh space though my main reason is the lack of security in terms of your ships in a corp pos its a pain to do it a serious pain but if ccp would have something that did it for you then i would be ok with it however if local goes so should all that juicy vectoring information on the star map and dotlan because that makes it too damn easy to find active people because to be blunt the balance needs to be right between the hunter and the huntedit is a difficult one that is for certain blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

hello alli have been playing eve for close to 8 years now and in my time i have grown to love and hate eve at the same time i love the free sandbox experience where you make the game your own and decide how you want to play on the other side of that coin i hate that i have to pay a monthly subscription for that experience the problem many of the old guard are running out of things to train due to their character age this is resulting in useless skills being trained so that we dont miss out on the sp though the argument could be made that the very simple solution to this is train skills on your alt the solution allow people to play eve for free but restrict the training of skills to paid premium accounts which have all the benefits of the current subscriber account these free accounts could be restricted in some ways but that restriction would have to hold true to the eve experience and not tie the hands of the player the way trial accounts are restricted being able to trade create contracts and play the game how you choose should not be impacted by this free to play model only the ability to train skills should be the defining factor herediscuss
no
any elaboration or counter argument there
well no one likes to pay for anything but if you want to play you got to payold guard running out of things to train seriously dude i have 130mil sp and i finally got a round to to training light missiles to 5 whatno pay to win and wot is something you seekgo play that if you wish
part 1 yes i understand that if you want to play then you have to pay but consider for a second the increased player base from a free to play model then consider how many of those players who enjoy the game but would never have considered playing eve to begin with due to the restrictions on trial accounts bundled with the pay to play subscription model eve currently uses in the end i believe we would see an increase in player basepart 2 specialized characters is what im referring to here if you want to train industrial skills and make yourself a cap pilot while having sub cap skills maxed then you will have plenty to train but if i wanted to have a specialized bomber pilot then i wouldnt need all 130mil sppart 3 this is in no way pay to win at any point you can stop or start up a training subscription to further your skills in eve once you get to the point where you feel you dont have to train anymore you simply stop there are no premium items no special abilities no one else can have simply an alternate system where you can choose to train and pay a subscription fee or not train and play for free but be inhibited by a skill gap if youre playing a specialized role in eve you wont be affected by the skill gap
eve already has its own free to play system which means players can use in game money to play and ccp still get rl monies although not strictly free to play all it will cost you is the time required to gain the isk for tradeyour idea would mean a loss of income and these systems tend to be put in place when a game is dyingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
true games which have already been a pay to play subscription model do only go to a free to play model after interest has been lost in the game and yearly revenue is falling below operating costs that is not to say that free to play games solve a companies financial problems but if executed properly they can be profitable
being for free to play would not bring in long lasting members this is a niche game period it always has been it is not for everyone thus there is not another game like it anywhere and that alone is worth the pay to play plus it makes absolutely no business sense to cut your own throat it is all about the journey man i find my self doing all kinds of stuff and rounds out this character all though i suffer from 5 or 6 years of nul wec doctrines i feel fortunate to have those skills even though it looks like i have the case of adhd my alts i pay to play train and focus but if i do not paywell then all my cynohos and spies would not be online to do their job so to that the function of pay to play forces me to pay for my alts or not use themkind of an equalizer however the ability to marshal an army of free to play alts does make a huge difference and flying around multi boxing jewing up your isk not right and as far as the skill there are no skill gaps in eve just in the heads of the nerds that have not figured out eve yet
infinite cyno alts infinite pi alts infinite ice mining alts rattng alts courier mission alts or anything else that doesnt involve much in the way of attention being paid
you provided the counterargument yourself if you feel sp will be wasted train an alt however considering that no percentage of training in this game can really be wasted i fail to see the argument that you can ever waste sp i created this character in 2007 after biomassing a 2006 character i still dont have every skill trained to perfection that i want to nor did the 2006 character i likely wont have all those skills trained for another 23 years considering it takes last i checked about 18 years to train every skill in this game to perfection not including the addition of new skills from the recent patches and new skills ccp intends to roll out i fail to see how anyone can run out of things to trainthus i feel your idea is simply a cry for waaaaahhh i dont want to pay but i feel entitled to my space person make my space person easily accessible while ruining your subscription model which therefore is a bad idea
i understand your view of the skill training process and there are adjustments that might be worth considering but for me there remains one reason that i am playing and paying for this game  it remains the most challenging and difficult gaming on the market as long as ccp continues at keeping the gaming at this level ill will be here playing and paying thats my 2 isks worthccps sand box is eve online the sand is owned by ccp we pay them a monthly fee to throw the sand at each other that is all that is here so move along nothing more to be seen
i would like ccp to give me a pony

listen kids i dont care what you saw on tv or what you heard at school do not huff snort or drink any of the substances from the cupboard under the sinkthis is why
i would love to see this t1 fit you are talking about from what i have seen it take careful planning of training skills and blasters ammo rigs for a single solo ganker to take a t2 mining ship in hisec before concord pops them i assume we are talking about mining ships if we are talking mission runners or a hualer than they are really really doing it wrong
thought it might be fun if we could get ccp to release the existing art assets for the captains quarters and get players to remix them into upgraded versions of the cq as a competitionthe winning ones could be included ingame somehow purchasable from the lp store perhaps
the only reason i say 2bil is because it needs to be painful enough that the average scammergrieferobnoxious little hit wouldnt want to do it 2bil is high but if you really hate your characters name and youve hated it for awhile 2 bill is worth itcourse i dont hate my name so i can say it should 245 trillion no skin off my backbut the point is it should hurt the iskies enough to make it only worthwhile to people who loathe their name
this is just semantics and pendantic to bootthe issue is that a player camping a hostile system accrues advantage while afk if someone jumps into a system looking for a fight ratters and miners usually just safe up if someone sits there afk from downtime to downtime after a while people will get desperate or carelessand with cynos one neut can become hundreds in a matter of secondsim all for the ability to camp someones space while cloaked  by active players seeing a neut log in after downtime and stay there 235 hours suggests they are not being actively played and while afk they get the advantage that other people drop their guard theres other significant downsides to this behaviourit disproportionately punishes small nullsec entities the more systems you have the easier a cloaky camper is to avoidit makes the game boring the best attack is to log on cloak up alt tab and play a more interesting game the best defence is to log in check local alt tab and play a more interesting game at some point the players playing those more interesting games may come to feel theres not much point ever tabbing back which is bad for eve as a businesstheres reasons eve has less than 5 of the amount of players wow hit at peak boring gameplay is the main one
nobut i would pay a plex for removal of unwanted skillsyou do not get reimbursed for skill points or price of skill books
your suggestions the little i bothered to read of it does not make it any easier for smaller entities to gain a foothold since the problem isnt the fact that there are messages generated when somethings attacked the problem is the week of grinding you have to spend to grind through all the timerswhats needed is a system which doesnt have the timers were looking at and which doesnt let the defender wait until the final timer to come and actually defend something like a variant of the old posbased system where we link the sovereignty to the planets instead of the moons would be better because it would make it harder to defend large swathes of space thus making the entry into null for smaller entities easier
streaming music through eve radio would not be a legal nightmare these days there are 3rd party service providers that you pay a set amount to and they handle any royalties involved with the broadcast which i would assume is how everadio does it tracking the number of plays of each and every single song vs the peak number of clients during said song and then determining who to pay for each is quite a nightmare if you dont go through one of those services im not complaining about the jukebox being removed i am talking about how since they are integrating 3rd party software they should do it with more than just twitch eve radio would add a whole new level to the political climate of the game also your statement about them needing help to integrate it you can access audio streams in just about anything with little difficulty hell windows media player has a feature to do that
1 relying on a third party to handle matters through another party to track access back to a licensor islook i cant even begin to explain what a nightmare that presents2 youre seriously underestimating the costs legal developer resources etc that would go into integrating a thirdparty radio station to actively steam data into the client would be like versus twitch which takes the directx output and stream it to twtichs services theres no ccp developer hands mucking about in twitch when the client data goes out and lapses in twitchs services is on twitchs head the opposite is true of taking data from another service and piping it into the client and raises issues with quality customer support code maintenance and relying upon everadios technical backend for the service
heh ccp fix sov mechanics good one
is it bad that i actually understood what the op was saying
i dont agree about the mining crystal change but i have to say i agree with the changes to rorqual skills nowadays when an industry character approaches endgame all they have left are the rorqual skills and those skills are not polite unlike all of the other capital skills which are quite wellmannered the rorqual skills are downright rude this is offputting to new players and completely the opposite direction ccp has stated they will be going with regards to industry pilotskeep all skills for the rorqual politeonly no rude skills
very bad please do not do any more lines of scouring powder it is not good for you

i think its pretty clear plexgoodccp is out to make money its a business not a charityconsidering that in a business the single driving force is   moneyf2p games just use a different tactic to make their money usually by saying their f2p but are really p2wwhat ccp has done with eve is by far the best balance between making money for ccp and keeping a balance for the playerssure you can sell plex you bought but like people have said shiny ships arent the endall beall advantage that most p2w players want first theres leveling just because you can afford it doesnt mean you can use it second there is module balance yes the dead space module reps more but it uses proportionately more cap third there is ship balance roughly meaing oh your in a 3bil battleship well that means jack  when i point you and orbit under your guns fourth and my favorite the longer you think there is a way to buy a button that you push to win the longer youll have your credit card out continuously flooding the market with cheap plex to replace your blingy waaah mobile that once again got popped by veteran pirates who just bought your cheap plex so they can keep playing indirectly off your money thats not only balance thats the goddmn circle of life its beautiful absolutely brilliantdont cry about people selling plex they are the building blocks at the bottom of the food chain that feed the world that is evedisclaimers i have sold a plex or two to buy my blingy ships i dont pvp and i pay a subscription sorry if i stepped on someones toes the said vets
if it was possible to mine in high sec with zero risk of being ganked then the people that build mining ships would go bankruptif all ships were perfectly safe then the need for ore would have vanished years ago and there would be no miners what you are asking for is unreasonablemoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is
thank you guys for your supportalso thank you for bumping this thread from time to time
i appreciate all of the support that this idea has been receiving and the csm did take notice while that is good we are going to need far more support to get this implemented keep fighting the good fighti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
its the ability to see the afk cloaker in local not the use of a cloak which is causing the problem here if a cloaker dropped from local and was denied local as a balance then it would not be possible to afk cloak 235 hours a day to cause players to drop their guarda cloaked vessel would have to be active to do anythingcyno mechanics may have to be addressed here i dont have enough experience with them to make a suggestion apart from tie cyno lighting with the cloak drop targeting delayjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
as in previous arguments before this one just be cause you cant see him does not mean he is not there if we have no means of intelligence to know it requires a lot more effort to keep a sufficient guard up if that were acceptable everyone would be living in worm hole space so doing away with local without another means of gathering intel from the system your in will not work the biggest issue is that there is a lot of empty null space due mainly to the ability of a cloaky camper to wait until someone lets their guard down  this is an issue of force projection ability that is out of proportion of the ability to defend against it i am not saying it cannot be defended against it is just not in balance the end result is space remains empty or boring as no one is doing anything due to the threat of force projection we have several good ideas we still need ot get the attention of the csm and see that this balance issue is given the attention it needs
ok lets take it another way i am coming in a system that has conquerable stations you have 15 pilots in system i want to track them down and kill them how do i go about doing this if you have x number of pilots in station and afkthere should be a way from me to hunt them down and kill them should i then have an option of hacking the station pushing the eject button and have them sucked out in space so i have the ability to engage them
simple get probes out check dscan if you dont find anything then they are likely in station so move to another system easy isnt it also the map shows average people in space last 30 minutes and number of pilots currently docked and active also dotlan has the npc kills delta which gives you a very good idea on activity and you have the new improved interceptors coming and if all else fails you can just blast the services until they come out blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
well then they can do the same thing and see what kind of activity etc etc etc you have completely missed the pointthe op is asking for interaction the ability to hunt a target that is what i was directly replying to him as far as what he wants to do
shoot the medical fitting and repair services tends to get a reaction but i cannot see anything similar that one can do to a cloaky afk camper actually the new personal depots we can go shoot those yipeeeee blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
frankly there are two imbalances that afk cloakers highlight within eve 1 local chat being a perfect intel tool getting intel is extremely important for pvp unfortunately our current tool is so powerful with no ambiguity that even the most dangerous areas of space become supersafe because you can tell at a glance instantly and with 100 certainty if there is a hostile in system to combat this people put afk cloakers in system to deny you that sense of security you shouldnt nerf afk cloaky unless you nerf the intel system at least a little 2 hot drop mechanics dealing with a single ship in system is very easy and if the afk cloaker only represented one pilot you would be an even bigger moron to stop using the system simply because it isnt 100 safe hotdropping allows an enemy to bridge a pragmatically unscoutable force directly on top of a target that simply lights a cyno the cloak mechanics themselves are very well balanced with local chat perfect knowledge on who is around paired against perfect location obfuscation really if they address hotdrops afk cloakying should become a nonissue for any competent player
shooting services with a hac or recon or small gang of afs i am not sure that will get any one excited to undock lets be some what reasonable to what this is all aboutthe supposed afk cloaker no one really knows if they are or not none of your business any way annoys the op to the point where he wants to touch the bad guy somehow and interact with him again i am talking directly to the point a very narrow point here as to his basic want the ability to interact with the cloaker nothing more than thatshooting poco and or shooting services does not adress the issue of interacting with possibly afk windowlickers in the station he is wanting to actually be able to hunt down the baddie and kill him or at least die trying shooting station services is not interacting with the afk dude in the station directlynow does it
so being pinged phoned saying it on comms while playing wots thats what happens in terms of the afk cloaky there is nothing i can do to get his attention apart from undocking a shiney and warping to a sanctum and if he is afk snoring his head off he will ignore that juicy bit of a km blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
you are still missing it he wants to actively interact with the cloaker not hit the bat phone he wants to actively hunt him down and interact with the target period and as far as pining peepsit only is broadcasted when there is an actuall threat a small gang is not a threat and it is not normally pinged on coms either people just dont drop their game of gt5 or whatever they are playing for a small group shooting services they wait until they are gone and undock pospreys

you saw at once at band campcongrats
multiple times actually in so called carebear alliances and those leet pvp alliances are sure to be better at itedit so what i proved here is that its still possible to interact with people afk or docked in stations using the mechanism of shooting station services i can see that it had an impact because something about band camp what ever that means was thrown in my direction also if anyone does anything to change local then all that data given to dotlan and on the eve map should also be reduced in scope and accuracy perhaps removed entirely blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
seen it multiple times really meh you just proved you do not read comprehension is blinded by your own agenda and you dont know 
an afk cloaky hunting mechanics would have two goals to gank people afk to force pilots to leave the system so you can operate unhindered in perfect safety are any of these goals good for the game i think not
people shooting services and getting a reaction of course i have seen it been in it tooand you dont have an agenda yeah right as i said the person that you detailed coming in system has a way to interact with the people in station you should try it unlike teh cloaky camper blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
he is talking about shooting someone in the face the specific person in question you know the boogey man everyone is afraid of and please stop talking about what happens in null you really do not have a clue and another thing the cloaky camper is a balance you cant shoot the cloaky just the same as you can shoot the dude in the station you have no idea if both are afk or notso guess what draw it is balanced
you know as far as i can tell the ops real complaint about hotdropsjust remove all the cynos and make supers use gates
with the new soe ships coming out shouldnt the soe corp get level 5 agents somewhere
this seems reasonable if they are in the appropriate place for example in their nullsec territories pure blind both roiry and jcijv could use some sister agents in the sisters stations and theyd be a good place for lvl 5 agents to boot
youre not my dad you cant tell me what to do
lol so why are you talking about people in stations then as compared to people in spaceabove is what you said resorting to personal attacks makes no difference to this fact the truth is that in your example you come in with a gang to fight and if they stay in station you have the option to impact them by shooting station services that you do not do it is none of my concern i am merely pointing out that there is a mechanic there to interact with them which you do not have with a cloaky afk campernextedit i decided to look at your kb and i find you were podded in madirmilire that makes me laugh moving around with a pod in that pipe indicates that you dont have a clue lol blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

hello thats not a troll thats not a taunt thats very serious im tired to see my character with this annoying haircutwhen i created him three years ago he has long hair and cool clothes hes now something like a kind of gallentecopyman and has absolutely not the thing that did make me chose intaki as the race of my character  bring us back intakis haircuts  thats not difficult you just had to transfer that cool haircut of the amarrs to the intakis  im waiting for this since tree years this and walk in station but thats not the subject thanks 
supported my intaki character wants his long hair back and not in dread form why was it not done with incarna in the first place how hard can it  be some of the decisions ccp makes are real wtf ccp there are off buttons for ship explosions missile effects turret effects etc immersion does not seem to be harmed by those so upleaseu give us a persisting off button for the jump gate and autoscan visuals
you had me until you said tree years
yes those good old years of the trees when earth was blue and green and not grey and brownseriously xthree two what the difference we want back our hair 
we jinmei need our hair back too ive been waiting too tree years for mine but seriously wouldnt mind some long hair and i agree on the not dreadsbut if amarr give us long hair do we have to give them sunglasses for avatar balancing purposes or are our glasses balanced by their hoodies
hair is overated imosignatured removed ccp phantom
ccp  give us the power  the power to decide what haircut we want  the power to decide what will be our destiny an our appearance  add some barbers into the stations i dont know but do something

im tired of looking like snape did 1976 call and demand their mullets back

definitely would like my long hair back

who needs fancy hair when youre standing heroically in front of a burning mushroom cloud
remember what is hair today may be gone tomorrow

after much discussion i still have not received a valid argument against the original proposalcloaky campers  no game mechanic to interact with once established in a systemconsensus isno nerf to cloak as it is concerning ship fits or durationmost liked suggestions including in game discussion in no certain order1 cloak with cyno is scannable2 new scan probes or skills to scan cloaked objects within a 15km area3 change local to only those who speak  add automatic dscan for every 30 sec  add pilot transponders to dscan for every pilot in system in space this will mean you have to dock to see who is in station ship types will not be linked with transponders4 pilots in space that take no change or action includes burning in one direction direction 30 min are auto logged off now i ask for thoughts pro and against each item
1 i think its the difference between getting a ping or not on a cloaked ship in this way you get the intel that they have a cyno therefore pro but have to be special probes2 in terms of 1 yes but not for ships that do not have a cyno as the issue to me is force projection so only for the ships in 13 i am wary of making that change to local due to the issue of force projection that being said i have like many suggested that ccp create a new 00 without local and out of capital jump range of existing space then see how that develops the issue with the lack of local is that for solo players people playing in low numbers tzs like aussies and those operating in npc 00 it becomes even more difficult also because of this i would highly recommend removing all that data about npcs killed and people in system otherwise it becomes too easy to find people and too easy to catch them leading to less people in 00 so against4 i am so so about it maybe an hour or two pro sort ofother possibilities are to make it so dscan does not work when cloaked forcing them to decloak when active or perhaps limit the range of the dscan when cloakedthe issue is that i actually like it as it is perhaps the interceptor changes will change things so people will afk cloak less blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
hiive moved this thread to the assembly hall forum as its a subject for the csm to get involved inthanksbisd suvetar captaincommando b
ok thanks for the moving so csm  yes you csm  make ccp change this and add us some hair  you ear me csm  go 
allow all hairstyles for all races
i feel this issue needs to be directly addressed toward the csm and to be brought forth to ccp in an article posted by the mittani here
with the recent revelations that ccp spawned unique ships for a player organisation to give away gave the same organisation 30 slighty less unique ships earlier this summer and dropped extremely rare monocles which incidentally were at an earlier stage also given to the player organisation mentioned before in an event it seems that ccp is regularly spawning items worth many billions of isk in the name of community engagementif ccp feels this is the right thing to do they should by all means go ahead but i do feel it is important that any such spawn is fully disclosed not only for the community to check who are the beneficiaries but also because  and i think this is at least as important  to make sure the eve marketplace operates efficiently and transparently a stealth giveaway of 30 ships of which only 81 were known to exist makes those 111 ships overvalued as the marketplace thinks only 81 existstay the course we have done this many times before  ccp hilmar june 2011
dont expect a response from the csm those that have responded appear to support ccp in this regardless of the fact that the csm was created to combat exactly this sort of thing consider our sandbox effectively full of cat
i wish you guys would settle on one thread to whine about csm never responding this is like putting out brush fires you also need to decide which way you want to whine and not come at the issue from both sideseither there should not be things given out in which case you should leave out all the other deserving folks you listes and the not so deserving you added for ironyoryou shouldnt complain about things given out demanding they be taken back and instead focus on creating a more equitable system for ccp to issue community giftsme i lean towards the lattermmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i thought about this and would like your opinion on two questions that come to mind1 do we want a listing of every niggling thing and who got it a list of the first 500 to eve vegas so we can see they got a model bs do free drinks in the bar count2 would it generate even more tears of those who think they are also entitles he got a bigger cookie than methe secrecy issue of the isws was questionable and i think above a certain arbitrary limit there should be a level of transparency but not a complete tell us everything how would you have this information disseminated and how would you combat the entitles who declame that their actions are also community oriented and they want their piece of free pie as wellm
regarding question 1personally i would be ok with simply notifications like the first 500 people to book fanfest will receive x the first 500 people in the door at fanfest will receive y two free drinks to anyone drinking with ccp at eve vegasregarding question 2i really dont have an answer to that one if the process for determining 1 is fairly transparent  has certain requirements set out in advance it will help with thatas an example not saying this is exactly what id want just thinking of a quick examplecommunity groups will be chosen once a month at most by an internal random lottery at ccp the pool of community groups is limited to those who have been featured in a dev blog  have not previously received a prizei dont imagine it would make everyone happy people would protest the lottery was biased but at least we would have some idea on how things were done
i am more concerned with the ingame market effects of spawning valuable items anything worth more than x billion which is inserted into the economy should be disclosed anything which is unique ie not freely available via either production or lpaur stores should always be disclosedmore transparancy and a clear explanation of how and why receivers get selected will probably lead to less rage than the current situation where we dont know who got what but do know that one organisation got quite a lot on at least three seperate occasionsa forum thread a regular dev blog a site page anything which is publicccp can defend what theyre doing or they shouldnt be doing it talk explain be considerate be transparent then ignore whoever is still whiningstay the course we have done this many times before  ccp hilmar june 2011
just read through all this and must of missed something as i am unclear on two points1 will the cargo hold be scanable2 when the ship blows up what happens to the ships inside do they explode as well dropping their loot or disappear like in a maintenance bay i know we dont want fully fitted battleships dropping as loot also prefer calling them ferry class rather than tug class because ferries are what i do
1 sure why not2 imo they shouldthe tug should be hard to kill too ofcedit to clarify i believe the ships should drop as fully fit
1 is a nerf to cloaks seems your problem here is the cyno not the cloak2 instant win button for gate camps3 i would prefer so see cloaks drop from local and be denied local to balance this makes cloaks actually act like cloaks and makes afk cloaking impossible4 this would lead to massive macro usage plus why just apply to players in space people afk in the station are affecting you in the same way as afk cloakers showing up on local and being unable to be interacted withjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
jint i appreciate your point of view 1 is a nerf to using a cyno  not the cloak 2 unless you have a really really pro scanner no it is not the intention is to make it difficult to scan a cloaked ship but possible3 dropping cloaked ships from local further increases the imbalance and removes any current means of protection this would make a cloaked cyno ship an unreasonable amount of undetectable force projection and just the opposite of this argument 4 ccp has macro detection software and accounts using this is against the eula and would be banned please keep in mind this argument is two fold i am looking for more solutions or a better granularity of the ones presentedplayers should be active mechanics should support this there is not current mechanics for interaction with cloaked ships once established in system
if your intention is to claim that player should be active then your solution should address all inactive players not just cloakersas for your reply to 1 making a ship scannable just because it has a cyno is a nerf to the cloak if your problem is that a cloaked vessel can drop a cyno then address that fact ask for the cyno to be tied into the dropcloak targeting delay or something2 even with a crappy scanner all it takes is one ping to tell you if a cloaker is close to you this has nothing to do with finding an afk cloaker as they will not be within 15km of a warpable point anyway3 once again its the cloaked cyno ship thats a problem starting to see a pattern deal with the speed of a cyno pop and you are golden 4 go to jita so many people sending the same spam chat every minute 235 hours a day thats a macro ccp does effall 4 buy a wiggler its a usb device that flicks the mouse one pixel left and right at a high speed used to keep machines from going into power save when you dont want to adjust the settingsalso there is not current mechanics for interaction with cloaked ships once established in systemthere are may ways to interact and deal with a cloaker in a system not to mention if you are that adiment that its your system why not protect it and not allow a red to become established in the first placejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
are you actually suggesting and supporting that i and others use attachments and software to enable afk game play and if you are do you realize that you are advocating people to violate the eulaas to the rest of your arguments i suggest you re read all the previous arguments
as this does not violate the spirit of the rules ccp would not careseriously you can get the same effect from a mouse with a flaky optical reader on the wrong surfaceupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
indeed lets be honest here afk timers would simply not work too easily bypassed and without breaking the eulaplus ask yourself do ccp even want it seeing as afk players have next to no load but add numbers to the server i doubt itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i just watched a video of someone warping under the new warp system using an interceptor which of course has immunity to bubbles the speed is just amazing and i think that even the most hapless gank bear who required 2 minutes delay on local should be able to catch something the fun part comes in that it changes the way that he game works to a huge degree local is not really that much of a protection in that you will have swarming masses of interceptors running ahead of the roaming fleets on many afk cloaking threads you chaps have gone on about local being the reason for afk cloaking as people cannot catch anything with local so you can imagine my interest in seeing just how this pans out and the impact on the those afk cloaking if what you said is truein terms of the mouse thing yeah that would make it difficult good point even if it is technically against the eula blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

really this sort of reply is coming from the exact people we elected to whine on our behalf how about a third option where you speak to ccp and tell them this was a dumb idea and to simply apologize then leave it up to ccp to work with the csm to come up with some ideas on better practices while handling community giftsits not that hard of an issue to handle but apparently the csm taking rude and insulting defense of ccp on this is making it far more involved poor play ccp and csm so farthis really could be put to bed quite easily
wasnt going for rude not my stylebut tell me in what way would you see that this could have been put to bed quite easilyi said where i stand how about yoummike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i guess you didnt read this thread that was posted a week agojint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the only person whining here is you never once did i state the csm quote never reply if that were the case why would i make this thread in the first place perhaps you should have contemplated the csm position entails more than a free trip to icelandthank you for a warm and more than adequate response and being a shining example of why the csm truly are the players voice in new eden
indeed a week ago on a subject entirely different from the one we are discussing here perhaps reading between the lines and speaking out sentences slowly can paint a better picture for you
wait did you seriously write this why should it be my focus on creating a more equitable system whatever the f that means anyways isnt that your job no of course not why perception being 910s of the law ccpss checkered past with t20 and other entities garnering favoritism and the more recent embarrassment over other somer practices why surely who would have ever thought wed need a more equitable system for dividing favoritismyes a daft idea i agree completely or rather i have an idea for you i never voted for any of the csm here i voted for monk personally because i already knew my play style and voice would never be represented anyways and your cold and begrudging response proves my gut feeling correcthowever that being said one would think as an elected member of the counsel of cough stellar management you and others would actually hold ccps feet to the fire instead of bitching about the very people you represent asking for exactly thatso my idea is simple do your job instead of throwing your arms up and kicking your lego blocks and going home why not listen for once why not understand that trust in ccps practices have come into question before multiple timeswhy the very creation of the csm was in turn due to a breach of this trust you are supposed to be an emissary of that trust and quite frankly you and the rest are doing a very  poor job of ever convincing myself or anyone else that we can truly trust ccp to not be favorable toward an entity againtheir very actions past present and yes potentially future have proven this time and time again
ok fine ill bite post signer an ideal and equitable system must have the following qualities1 rewards given by ccp must be entirely impossible to monetize ie not items that can be sold for isk or used to gain additional isk the only exception being alliance tournament prizesships or similar ingame events with open enrollment and correctly publicized2 complete disclosure of the process used to select the people who received the nonmonitizeable items or honors and how ingame entities can become eligible for them3 complete disclosure of who received the itemsbottom line no free isk no transferable items find other ways to honor people put up monuments in their favorite systems put constellations of stars shaped like a groups leaders smiling head viewable in their home region do this with mittani and deklein please do something creative for gods sake in a game as big as eve im sure ways could be found to honor communities that do not involve large amounts of rare ships given to people behind closed doors
see now this is what i was looking for1 about the only way i can see there being no isk value is if we did some sort of bound items gimmick locking it to a character not entirely bad but a bit artificial 2 transparency while i agree wth this one strongly you might want to set an arbitrtrary petty cash limit for minor prizes so there is an encouragement for more people to get smaller things rather than one entity to get it all3 the petty cash line might keep us from being inundated to the point od the signal being lost in the noise but other than that hell yes saying that stuff gets given and to whom is a good ideanow how do you feel about prizes for less than ttally open events say a pvp tourney at fanfest or vegas it is only open to those who paid to be there and in that respect limited same question to any swag gifts at live meets would you expect complete tranparency of who and what in all of thatand yes i end damn near everything with the m think of it as part of my sig above the linemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
you know perfectly well im not advocating any form of eula violation im just pointing out how easy it is to bypass any type of afk kickoutnot to mention that the two that i pointed out are not eula violations anyway if they were then jita would be a much quieter place to be quite honest i wish macroing repeat messages to the local channel was a violationjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
step one be prepared done this means being aligned or in a ship that aligns fast enough to make no differenceit may not be the most efficient way to work pve especially compared to a minmax fitting but it makes me impossible to catch unless i screw it up firstso long as local lets me hit warp before you have even loaded grid you have no chance to catch meupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i like receiving all the good arguments and discussionplease lets remember what this thread is about interaction with cloaked ships this is the situation  ship enters system finds a safe and cloaks up later people come into system or log on following the only protocol that is safe for this situation is to stay in posstation or leave and go somewhere else this leaves the system unused and effectively shut down as there is currently no mechanic in place to know a is the cloaked pilot active or notb is the cloaked pilot carrying a cyno c is there a threat of force projectionthere currently is now mechanic that allows you to interact and remove this threat if they never uncloak i know i have heard all the arguments and it leaves much to be desired as i am pointing out an imbalance if no one approves of the suggestions made scannable cloaked cynoscannable cloaked ship with probes and skillsremoving local and adding in new intellog off mechanics then please give me a viable suggestion for a mechanic that allows me to if not hunt and interact with a cloaked vessel under the above circumstances then at least interact and remove or change the situation after a reasonable period of time
first off your foundation is flawed the system is not shut downyou can still operate if you do so as part of a group or make preparations to deal with hostiles directlywhat do i meango undock do pve with others covering you a group working together even with individually weak ships can handle threatsworried about a cyno block them with a jammerworried about covert cynos dont be easy to kill covert hostiles are more expensive to put in the field and that is how they are balancedif you cant beat em leave fit stabs plant bubbles around your gates use smart bombs align to your exitone or more of these strategies puts you back in the gamein null sec effort is the price of admission and if your opponent is making a current effort you need to at least match itas to limiting cloaked ships they are already balanced the most agreed upon trade off for detecting them in a new way is to require effort for the existing methodthis translates as not being listed for free in local as a trade off to being able to scan them downupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
thanks for the reply nikk but as you know you have not addressed the issue if i was a renter i might agree with your tacticsas one who does pay the price to live in null and again i do not rent i want to remove hostels from whatever systems i want to use here are some facts to keep in mindif i did not want local i would still live in a wormhole there is still a lot of that space left unused as wellif i wanted to gimp my pvp fit to escape i would simply rent space  note im not a big ratter and yes i mine but it is not my main profession as to intelligence gathering and system use technically speaking no the system is not shut downlet me ask you this how many empty systems do you fly through to get a fighthaving the ability to deal directly with a cloaked ship gives more options to pvp it also would give more options to those who would use the space for things other than sitting around afkit would also increase the amount of people willing to use space in pve fashion and would provide more targets as some have pointed out i for one am looking forward to the new interceptor balance and its new role along with warp changesthis alone is said to make afk cloaking obsolete i do not think so as there are many out there who either looking for easy isk by sitting in a system waiting to be paid to leave or have a grudge to grind and want to deny spaceafk cloaking is a cheap way to cause disruption in a system or constellationthat is what i am seeking to balance
answering the underlined more specificallyi dont go looking for fights so much i am a mineras such i rely on hostiles to act as a filter and get rid of those who would also be minersi prefer if they are more effective against other alliances or corps but either way the quality of my efforts is more significant rather than the quantity hereas the hostiles are mostly impotent on this aspect i instead observe the returns on my time being somewhat limitedthe problem you are facing is that hostile free environments are not normal if you avoid them too often you lose the will to take risks or operate at all with them presentbeing around players flying spaceships who want to blow you up is the point of the game remembercall their bluff make them unwilling to risk confrontation instead or take it on your termsupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
laughs softly i like this answermy bounty currently is 39 612 223 isk i have it now for a long time i would say i nourish it because i got it from someone i respect in game however i do not fear troll bounty i do not get attacked for it or anything else there is no real effect for itof course i am living currently with my clan in minamatar space so in high sec bounty is not worth much without being a suspect criminal or an active kill righttake others for example my favorite example is here karl strane who has earned a solid ganker reputation with a big bounty stack however you will hardly be able to earn the bounty since he flew as long as i saw him fast locking destroyers worth only a small faction and the payed bounty is payed on the base the ship you fly not the bounty you haveif something should be changed by concord it is that if you got caught in the middle of something serious like being a suspect or criminal or a kill right as been applied to you a multiplier should get active to get a nice portion of the bounty set on youi believe that this would benefit the and would be in favor on the opener speaker since you need to do something maybe it would be also nice to buy a kill right the higher the bounty the lower the price but maybe the potential for abuse is to serious for someas of now i take bounty raise on my head as expression of likes

 okay cant answer this as aischai clearly doubt you have heared anything from gebUFFFDhreneinzugszentrale gez they are matter of effect a nightmare to google over the last years at least from user perspective but i guess for google toothey demand damn lot of money if you are able to play something the fact that the windows media player has this function does not mean microsoft has not payed some agreement for it or does diobolic things with your computer  like drm  to enforce these rights on youi respect the descision that the jukebox went missing i rather have a good game then a bad player you get wonderfull and a lot better onesm then eve yould offerfor radio fire your favourite player up and alttab from the game i guess radio does not need much attion does itmy regards
and juste to say  thats not a joke i want my hair back  there absolutely no reason to refuse to allow me grow my hair 
alright you answered me fairly and ill respond in kind i worry that even that might not be enough as people would still be able to hock the character with the bound items for isk still binding might be a reasonably good way to dissuade sales more importantly though i believe that communities should be honored through nonmonetary means look at the kings of lowsec event the winners flag was hoisted at ccp hq thats the kind of recognition i meanwell one way or the other disclosure is important even relatively immaterial things should be disclosed in my opinion though id be fine if they only disclosed material gifts assuming the materiality level was within reasonyes all should be clear in the open and in a place that can be found without pulling teethas to fanfest  vegas event ingame benefits i suppose i would be fine with it so long as the gifts were suitably immaterial in isk value and announced well before the event begins and while the event registration is still open id shy away from too much value on these items as it would be more painfully discriminatory against people who cant afford travel otherwise

there were a lot of things i didnt understand about corp permissions until i started my own it was a big aha moment the mess that is corp managementUFFFD needs fixed bad its just not intuitive or easy to use a lot of things dont make sense some things are too ambiguous and others are so narrow focused that you have to keep adding things in until it works then that person has so many permissions they might as well be a director pos permissions are definitely the worst though imho it amazes me that anybody even wants to run a corp at all and has put me off from trying to grow the corp in the future
erm it was more about endorsing it than being able to use it anyone can use it via alttab but if it was endorsed then more than just veteran players would know about it and it might become a large facet of the game
if major labels start hearing about how their music is being integrated into a forprofit game they will demand money for it they will consider ccp to be making money off their music and will likely take ccp to court over it for lost profitseveradio is free right now because of legal protections and allowances that exist for nonprofit radio stations they dont need to pay the same kind of prices somebody playing it within a subscription fee would

exactly my point they need to clean it up and make it a more streamlined and sensible process furthermore i also feel there needs to be a base fee for corp creationmanagementmaintenance to discourage people from making a bunch of garbage tax dodging corps all in all the whole entire field could use some attention 
i will not support the removal of corps for the purpose of tax evasion spreadsheets online okirs online no way in helltaxes arent something that you should have to pay just because
i see that got misconstrued a bit firstly let me point out a fee for creationmaintenance of a corp is not my primary request just some love to corp permissions is and i would be happy with that however what really should be done is an entire overhaul to the business and economic side of eve after all the game is based on an economy please note im not saying enforce taxes just because look at alliances they cost 1 billion isk to form and have an upkeep fee of 2 million per member corp thison a psychological levelprevents everybody and their brother from making their own garbage alliance and cluttering the skies with a bunch of one corp alliances all peacocking that they are some massive conglomerate  i am recommending thatas part of a larger updatewe add a base cost of say 100 million to form a corp and say 200k isk per 50 members per month this wouldon a psychological levelbe enough of a deterrent that it would remove a bunch of the 1 man corps from the record as well as serve several other useful functions also i can tell you first hand that this amount is a joke sum as it costs about 23 million isk per month to rent a station and about 80 mil or so to run a small pos per month its primary function would be again a deterrent the main benefits immediately noticeable without additional programming would be massive decrease in the rate at which namespace is being consumed idk if you knew this but alliances and corps share the same namespace my alliance had to be named sovereign stars plural because sovereign star was a corp name furthermore it took forever to find a ticker symbol because alliances and corps share those too and we eventually had to settle on so because nothing else was left namespace is reserved forever even if a corp closes so this alone is a serious concern consolidation of existing and potential corporations leading to the average corporation size being much larger making it a more likely that your corp and its function will be recognized look at red frog black frog and blue frog some people still dont know about them because there are so many garbage corps to look through in fact as far as i know they do not have a competitor even if they did it would be hard as hell to find out who it is a corp should mean something and be recognizable ease of recruiting because less people would want to pay the fees to make their own corps and the fees would be easier split across more people increased size of the npc corporations leading to more experienced players being in reach of newer players which goes hand in hand with ccps new player training they want to do and their complaints about how specific knowledge is so far out of reach of many newer players however the biggest benefit comes with point number 2 increased recognizability this would pave the way for those pesky stocks to actually mean something i mean the main value of stock comes from its perceived value the more well known and successful the corp the more it is worth on a market that said it would be nice to see a stock market emerge in which corporations that were both a a certain age and b of a certain size could become publicly traded and sell their stock for some quick cash this feature of course would be part of an expansion that would also include a complete revamp to the contracting system making it viable for internal infrastructure a revamp to permissions so that it would be easier to make several jobs within a corporation and of course many updates to the ui that would increase ease of market interaction namely a button in the fitting panel titled buy all or buy and fit which would buy all of the modules available at the station that you did not have just like if you were browsing and hit the buy button from the descriptive panel rather than the view market orders button some other features would include a the ability to sell bulk amounts of items all at once just like right clicking and hitting sell of course it would pop up warnings for any item that was about to be sold for well under market value just like it does now the fee for the corp would only need to be implemented if we were to add all of these other features that required a reduction in the number of corps and an increase in the size of the ones that existed i would not necessarily want it to be added under the current context as then it would just be a needless fee edit as an added note in order to balance this new economic sink there would be a new economic faucet which would likely come from a revamp in the base pay of missions to be higher andor an increase in npc trade orders ccp would be well aware of this as historically they have always tried their best to steer the games economy away from depressive states well without making it obvious that that is what they were doing of course
yes it does nerf something cynos thats the entire point of your suggestion your suggestion specifically exists solely for the purpose of nerfing cynos come out and say it have conviction for your ideals dont start backpedaling before youve even begun if you believe cynos have to be nerfed then convince me good luck on that though your suggestion is so completely rediculous and over the top that im not even going to bother aguing against it
id prefer that if a system has at least 1 belt the belts contain enough ore in volume that that system can be upgraded to level 1 industry in one go from one downtime to anotherwithout the need for industrials to have to open up and clear combat anomalies and mine in those who contain oreofcourse everyone keeps saying its totally understandable nobody would however like a missioncomplex where the goal of the mission appeared after a certain ore type was mined out the community would be in an uproar
alternatively allow black ops cynos to be blocked by the new cyno jammer moduleone ship roaming around cloaked and nullified ie practically invulnerable shouldnt be able to project fleet sized power at will while risking very little in return black ops bs might be weaker than a normal bs but they also can drop on a target obliterate it in a few seconds and then clock up warp to a safe and hide in complete invulnerability to retaliationor make cov ops cloaks disallow the use of cynos for x amount of time after the cloak is disengagedsomething anything to put an end to this cheap mechanic that enables people to gank while avoiding risky pvp to do so
you see the blops things was to allow small groups to hit targets soft and what not and cause disruption of a an alliance you know gorilla tactics it is working as intended
just putting this back up so others can show supportits a good proposal definitely cant be exploited and its not game breakingdmc

i just watched the video for the upcoming new patch and when listening to the section on certificates i had a thought of a way to reward players who reach level 5 for a certifigate groupthe devs talked about players wanting to become awesome by getting all the skills in the new certificate groups skilled so they can say they are certificate level 5 in say navigation or gunneryto make this an added incentive what if there was a bonus applied to players for reaching level 5 in each certificate groupso say gunnery certificate and reaching level 5 u could get an extra 1 for all skills in the certificate groupin the same vain as the implants and having all the slavecrystalsnake etc implants and getting a bonus for having all in the setrestrictions could be imposed so skills found in multiple certificates could not be exploited to gain multiple gainsie only 1 for any skill no matter how many level 5 certificates the skill is found inthe bonus could also vary and 1 was given as a basic example but other things like an extra skill level so essentially they would be level 6 in those skills could also be donethis would entice players to train all the skills to gain the level 5 certificate rather than what most players do and train a skill to level that allows them to use a moduleitem and not worry about the certicate that is attached to that skillit also rewards players who have patiently been with the game a long time and have trained the skills up to level 5 and adds the factor that not all players are clones of each other with identical skills as not all will have the level 5 certificatesas it looks like now the system will be very nice but players get nothing for actuall achiving a level 5 certicate apart from bragging rightsa bonus would give motivation to skill those long skills up to level 5 to achive the certificate and get that certificate bonus on top on their skillsexamplesome1 with all gunnery skills up to level 5 would obviously qualify for the level 5 certificate and therefore get a 1 on all skills in the gunnery groupbut some1 who only trains certain gunnery skills to level 5 and then moves onto other skills would not qualify for the cert or the bonusthis in turn means when these 2 toons meet and battle it out the advantage would slightly be with the person who has the cert bonus as it should be for some1 putting the time and effort into his skills and being a master of that groupcertificatethis now means certificates actually are worth something in game instead of just a woohoo factor i finally got he certificate thingthis mechanic is already in game for the implant sets and i believe it would not be hard to include the certificate groups into the same mechanic in gameie ca1 ca2 ca3 ca4 implants all get set bonus which affects all aspects of ship flying as does all the low and high grade implant setsfor consideration
no
not unless they introduce level 5 missions for pirate factions and the rest of the subfactions thats a hell of a lot of missions to add to the gamesoe is not an empire faction it is a subfaction like the pirates as such it should not offer any missions of higher level than the rest of the smaller subfactions
i agree every faction missing them should have each level of agents with the usual caveat of no level 5 in highsecits not like you have to create new dungeons just copy paste the missions from other factions
do you have a source for that statement
the years of wailing to the csm and ccp to allow the little guy to have have the ability to poke the big guy in 00 using small groups of players the problem like most ideas the player base come up with is the fact they are so focused on what they want in a such a narrow view they do not even understand that once you allow this to be everyone including the bad guys you and others want to nerf so badly will take the same tactics and punish you with itand thus this swirls own the shitter as the push continues for a ehonor solution to have wot type conflict that is arbitrary and artificial tldrthe game is too hard i want to change the rules
new rule people i like have a 99 resist speed and lock range bonus and new rule people i dont like have a 99 dps speed and lock range penaltyat last with this simple fix eve is finally perfect
what an incredibly nonconstructive postcould you please address the original issue itself instead of making sarcastic comments that add absolutely nothing to the discussioncynos are a way to project power across many systems combined with t3 nullified cloaked ships that are practically invulnerable we have a situation where that projected power can be brought to bear with little risk in return after the warp changes are put into effect well also have to deal with cov ops ships that can enter a system and warp to an asteroid cluster in 10 to 15 seconds and light a cynothat isnt much time to react
perhaps you should have some combat support ships to counter these fast cyno ships such as but not limited to griffinkitsune support people cant kill anything they cant pin down with the cyno ship jammed and thus unable to point anything it takes a good 5 to 10 seconds after the cyno ship has landed decloaked and popped the cyno for people to jump in and load grid by which time you should be gone because you should have been aligned andor aware of hostiles in system due to local artillery support scared of that stealth bomber or interceptor have 2 sensor boosted thrashers fit with artillery ongrid with you pop the sucker as soon as heshe lands which should be easy as these ships dont have a tank even when tanked
example if i have an 80 or better standing with a corporation and i want to find the nearest station that has a medical facility within the corp i know i can look at the corp info and see all the stations and locations they own but it is slow searching that way maybe make it an addition to agent finder just add all the services to the end of mission types when looking under a corporationmy ship finally came in but it was the kobayashi maru
jasmine assasinthank you for the supportdmc
keep in mind to move a ship in a different direction a click is required as such a button would need to be pressed

heyso to make things a bit interesting and to give people the chance to cause some mayhem remove all notification mails when a structure is under attackthink about for a momentyou can leave a pos tcu ihub station poco etc all sitting in space and never have to keep an eye on them simply because as soon as somebody fires 1 shot the owner will get a notification mailby removing the mail notifications it will allow people to make sneak attacks on these structureas far as i am concerned if you put a structure up it is your responsibility to keep an eye on it
somake the game more frustrating for structure owners and drastically reduce the number of fights then
ccp is moving away from nauseating tedium that favours larger organizations not towardshouldnt have paid for that game design degree from the university of phoenix bro
you could argue it removes fights or you could say it creates more opportunity for smaller entities to put some hurt on the bigger entitiesthere are so many poss put up in systems which are rarely used simply because if anybody attacks them you get a instant notification
and when someone comes along to poke the pos for fuel silos or whatever the small guys are just going to get a hundred dreads dropped on whatever theyve put up surely is taking down say a pl staging pos somewhere in lowsec really worth the effort and energy given what will happen to everything you put upand you could argue that as has been said it forces people into bigger groups so they can keep an eye on all their stuffand you have still not countered the removal of fights
you could also argue that the larger entities have the numbers to really make this hurt in the timezones the smaller entities do not have representation in thereby making it more useful for themgrr goons
this is true as well however the way i see it the more stuff that gets blown up the better 
while stuff getting blown up is always good this suggestions hits malcanis law pretty hard not gonna lie
youd think that people in the spacefuture would have come up with some pretty nifty ways of telling if someone was shooting their things like house alarms but for giant mechanical monstrosities with soulcrushing tons of hitpointsoh wait they did
in our world laundry machines can textemail you when you need to come get your clothes out and you want me to think that in the future they wouldnt have notifications saying hey somebody is shooting at me better come check it out really now just from a practical standpoint these notifications should stay in
initial post edited to bring the ideas of this discussion forward
this not an open discussion it is a closed and narrow discussion you want everyone to stay with in the perimeters you set if yuo want an open honest discussion you are going have to listen to the player base that practices such tactics you know the tactics they some how prevents you from doing whatever it is you have to do it has been brought up many times and yet you have not explained how an afk cloaker prevent you from doing anything
this is an interesting idea for the old certificate system i can somewhat see the logic behind it the whole is greater than the sum of its parts type thing with regard to studying things but i think that balancing it with the new system would be difficult itd also give advantages to veteran players which isnt the direction that ccp has been going but if they were tiny advantages say 1 or so per certificate level it could be primarily cosmetic
this already happens someone will still fly out to the structure to investigatea whowhat is attacking it andb when it comes out of reinforcedstructures dont need to be watched in the same way that corporation assets dont need to be watched just dont be shocked when some spy has stolen all your 
alternatively you could just send one fleetmate to fly about shooting random structures in other systems to spam the inbox of your target thereby hiding your actual activities
cloak should mean cloakif a cloaked vessel manages to get itself established in your obviously poorly defended system then you should fly in a way that protects yourself from an enemy vessel after all this is zero security spaceif it was up to me a cloaked vessel would not appear on your all seeing eye of local after all its local that is causing an afk cloaker to interact with youjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
im not a fan of local as in intel tool and to a lesser degree im not a fan of ships that are completely unscannable i dont see the removal of local happening in kspace any time soon as too many people are opposed to it however if the new warp mechanics allow for a substantial improvement on the ability to catch people at belts and titan bridging to some effect was rebalanced does anybody see a scanning down option for cloaked ships
not unless i can shoot whilst cloakedas it stands i can not do a god damned thing while i am cloaked
cant support thisyou would just be widening the gap between new and veteran players if the bonus was significant enough to be meaningful and if it wasnt what would be the point
nrds only applies to shooting people it doesnt mean we just merrily go about mining while neuts are in system a neutral that pops into local provokes the exact same response as a red so im not sure what impact that has on anythingthe big difference is that were close to empire space and have a high population there are people constantly roaming around looking for targets and thats fine its far more fun than living in deep null where you can go 10 systems without seeing another playersure it adds risk but risk  fun up to a point once you reach that point people stop risking things and go elsewhere then nobody has fun even the people doing the drops because there are less targets to shoot at
im sorry lets be frank hotdrop bringing in a pragmatically unscoutable force directly onto the field of battle capable of fully engaging 10s after the cyno goes up is a bit overpowered i agree that the ops suggestion is not a good solution but your being delusional if you think hotdrops are fine as is i personally believe the time to traverse the bridge protal should be mass based a frigate can do it very quickly few seconds a battleship should take much longer to hit the field 30 s ships with their own jump drives wouldnt be altered by this so you can bring in capitals and bos instantly this is a much better balance than you cant target for 60s after bridging uhg
fyi after you jump you have an 1 minute or is it 30s invulnerability timer as long as you dont activate mods furthermore bubblers dont need to target to put up a bubble
not saying this should be fixed because this is eve after all butyou can call this hunting but with no method for people to hunt you back it seems like a stupid annoyance to people trying to play the game the only solution people are given is dock up and dont do anything oh thats cool this jagoff could be alt tabbing and playing around on facebook for hours but if i try to do something for two minutes hes probably going to come back and gank me maybe i should facebook friend him we can play farmville since were going to do  all in eve while we wait for eachother
i want this so muchthink its a good thing1 year  10 skill reset freeand if u want more u can buy 1 plex  5 skills reset
i honestly think that allowing the new deployable cyno jammers to block cov ops cynos would be the right thing to dopeople will still be lazy and not use them but for those that want to go to the hassle and expense of setting one up it would afford them some measure of protectionideally id also like to see a module that could be fitted to a ship that would prevent a cyno from being lit you could even give it a cooldown from being immediately reused that would put a little more risk on the cloaked and nullified t3s that roam everywhere in near invulnerability unless one makes a mistakejust like when you engage one you have to wonder if its got a black ops cyno fitted now the t3 pilot has to wonder if you have a cyno jammer module fittedmore risk so everyone should be happy with that right
i think this is a great idea anything that adds variety to missions and highsec i also have always felt that its pretty silly coming back from years of being a lord of nullsec being best friends with concord for shooting the bad guys and having to get into a rifter to grind missions
fightingmoosethanks for posting support for this proposal your reply seems to indicate you like option 2 since that would incorporate the use of all ship classesdmc
remove cloaked ships from local problem solved
actually you have something here remove afk people from local and this problem goes away when he comes back from afk cloaked guy appears in local giving the same kinda of oh  reaction people annoyed with this problem expect to have
this wasnt a good idea when this thread was started and what do you knowit still isnt
no
i want to see at least 1 new 00 region that has npc stations but has no local chat same as wh spacethe reason i want it is to have more gameplay variety in game im sure many people will enjoy living there this new space will not take away anything from anyone it only adds to the gamesince there would be no local thus increased risk the rewards not moon related should be about 2550 greater than similar 00 region with localit is important to have npc stations there so alliances cant lock it down for personal use itll be open to anyoneideally such a region should have many entryexit points not just 23 so its not easily locked down
1st ever supportedfeels weird
two points1 i have yet to read an idea of how to determine if someone is afk or not that cannot be bypassed or does not log out someone who is simply sitting cloaked watching and waiting2 dropping someone in and out of local based on whether they are moving clicking the mouse chatting in corp chat clicking on their wallet or not does not simulate the actions of a cloak you are either cloaked or notif i was in a covert ops vessel cloaked doing nothing but watching some target your system would have me drop from local but if i moved still cloaked or even spoke in corp chat you would have me appear back in locali fully agree with anjuan any cloaked vessel should drop out of localsome proposals to balance this they are denied local as intel while cloaked they dont know who has entered system cant see local chat etc  the cloakers intel needs to come from sneaking around and looking for people maybe a minute delay on dropping out of local so they appear for a minute when they enter a system gives the residents a clue that someone may be in system some form of delay on cyno popping i understand this is one of the major concerns with afk cloakersjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
should a cloaked ship drop from local the people who are active in the systems would not know of hisher presenceresult this would make it even easier to hot drop and apply force projection on any target in the systemthis would increase the element of surprise it would be a gankers dream come trueyou would be able to operate in any system with impunityshould not the local in habitats have any tools to prevent protect or combat thismost of you who post on this thread would say no we want free reign to hot drop or gank who we want whenever we want and we do not want them to know about it until it happens if you do not believe this is a fair assessment than go back and re read what you have postedthe effect of this is before long you would not have anyone to gank as they prey would simply go play other games no one wants to play a game where there is such an imbalance that you cannot do anything yes properly fitted ships and aligned out would not matter as you the ganker would just bring enough to counter you would effectively over hunt and no more fun for anyoneyour job is too easy as it is you sit in a system cloaked check d scan every hour or so while you post pink ponies on facebook waiting for someone to be stupid or you do it out of spite knowing the those who are there can do nothing while you are cloaked so you log in in the morning on that account and leave it all day while you play on another account please explain how the play of the above is balanced  afk or not i want to hunt you if you cloak up in my system if you are active the hunt will be more challenging but not impossible as it is now
even though local is used as an intel tool ccp states that it is not intended be so kind of like the political speak but we have to just deal with it here is the issue i have when i read these threads it becomes two camps kind of mantra the reality is in null we all live under the same circumstances and rules we all have to deal with a cloaky possibly sitting on the cyno bridge or where ever all of us have to grind up isk to pay for ships or shiny bobbles all of us have to deal with hot drops in losec you are not a special snowflake that only you and your little buddies dealing with this we all do and most of us have learned how to deal with it and turn around and use the same tactics on the other guy what most line members lose sight of is that this tactic is not to signal out just you you are not that special unless of course your space rage is so great that posting your rage in local on their forums makes for a great thread it is used to starve the corp or alliance it is used to cause havoc and internal strife with in the alliance  corp and it apparently works very well it is a viable method tactic and apparently way above your paygrade
baaldor  yes i know how to deal with it and no i am not a special snowflake and nor do i alone and my friends feel special we all know how to deal with the problem that you and others do not address is that in dealing with it results in lots of space remaining unused this is something we should have tools to deal with that is all we are asking for a lot of the bigger entities in null even ones hostile to each other have pacts agreeing not to cloaky camp each other yes we all have the same set of rules and the purpose of this forum assembly hall is to bring forth ideas and changes to those rules that will help the game improvei am not space raging to be honest i make most of my isk in jita and if i like could play without un docking to make isk for my other account to pvp with that would be boring point being i really like this game i think there are areas to improve balancing the afk cloaker is one of those areasif you like the status quo then you are entitled to your opinion i welcome open discussion of pros and cons for improvements of the game we all play
well i believe all afk people should be dropped from local regardless of what they are doingthis idea of cloaked people leaving local is interesting but not quite what i would do as it will cause even more panic edit as for why this is preferable the ship wouldnt be removed from space afk miners are still there afk cloakers are still there people just wouldnt necessarily know but when someone is infact active in their vessel they will join local again you cant assume where these people are but at least you know they are playing and not fapping
local is a chat channelthe unintended fact that it can be used for intel in many ways does not remove this as the primary reason for its existencelocal providing intel that influences decision making in the game dumbs down game playwe should be earning the intel not having it handed to uswhen we earn something we can compete to out perform other players and in turn get better results by giving us perfect results for free intel is dropped from competition except in the remaining areas not being defined by localyou expect these conditions in a tutorial where you are learning the game not to have such impact in areas widely considered end game by manyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
dude it is just this simple the afk cloaker is in your head there is no fix from ccp you the dude behind the key board is allowing mr spooky to get in your head there is nothing in game they are doing to you to prevent you to do what ever you want to do and especially if there are so much unused spacego use it because the cloaker is not there and if he follows you he is not as afk as you thought and what bigger entities if they have a pact then they are in a for a world of hurt especially if they fly nrds
i fap fap fap when i play
this any afk cloaker has stories of well organized campaigns against himher that worked there are well known tactics to get intel on that person and to bait him i would say that about 50 of the systems where afk cloaking is done counter with such tactics the other 50 do not want to spend the effort the point of the null sec is that it has risks that you cannot control this is why the rewards in null sec are so much higher eliminating or nerfing cloaking even afk cloaking will reduce the risk side of that equation dramatically particularly for ratters
if i remember correctly the juke box was taken out because it was a code nightmare or some suchwell developers i have a proposal perfect time to design something that can read mp3 files from the harddrive or play eve music like the juke box cant be that bad were talking look into folder open files kinda stuff
oh my godwhat has happened to these forumsnot one eve has sound
im all for it as long as the feature costs about 500bill
and why would anyone support an idea that obviously lends an advantage to bigger alliances null is null wh space is wh space theres a difference for a reason
this space would offer more advantage to small adventuring corps than big alliances since there are npc stations alliance wouldnt be able to lock down the region against people who choose to live and fight there its that simpleeven if big alliances were to receive greater benefit theres no reason to not have this feature since it only adds to the game nobody loses anything only gains
so syndicate with out local
yes something like that would be great
k go to syndicate and close local v0v
you know it doesnt work that way however id be happy if ccp removed local from syndicate if they dont want to make new region
you forgot to mention that in the world of eve 96 of people are warfare pilots and 4 are industrialists and since the needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few the industrialists have no choice but to sit back and use the tools they were given so far
all for innovation but industry just got a major boost with the rebalance of rare ores and the current ships out there do just fine the idea of a new capital ship is interesting but the role of capitals by far is to support a fleet this applies to combat or industry typesand honestly the mining barge changes from the last time around gave us more effective solo mining options even the venture has been seen ninja mining here and therei think ccp innovates industry just fine the only thing people are really crying for quite understandably in fact is for changes to refining arrays at poses which im sure will be addressed when the pos update finally happens its coming people somedayedit and if anything the next t3 will probably be battlecruiser or maybe frigate level i cant see them ever making a t3 indy talk about a waste of resources
lol whatyou want bacon bot actually to be put into the game
guristas are caldari and gallenteangels are matari and gallenteserpentis are gallente and matariblood raiders are amarr and matarisansha are amarr and caldaridoing the math we haveamarr 2 primary no secondarycaldari 1 primary 1 secondarygallente 1 primary 2 secondaryminmatar 1 primary 2 secondaryin other words amarr  caldari are required for only three factions one being sansha so however gallente and matari find their way into four out of five pirate factions the latter is somewhat understandable as serps are basically angelsbut lets look at is this wayserpentis are rentacops the lore states they are angels but not why not make them gallentecaldari vindicator with missiles oki guess what i am saying is the variance isnt there maybe if moru was a bigger player it would help having a sixth faction to fly would allow either two primary and one secondary or vise versaone more thing before i forget the actual way the skill requirement  parents are setup should matter a sansha ship that requires amarr cruiser and caldari cruiser should be different from a ship that requires caldari cruiser and amarr cruiser for instance the primary skill determines the ships offensive capabilities the secondary its defensive this means the first ship uses lasers or vamps and has a shield tank the second ship uses either missiles or rails and has an armor tankui 3 logisticsu pilot of all t2 logi and my shiny archon deceased also a chimera which may or may not be horrid i dont make games i play them i get that ppl are passionate about change i post here to plant seeds you see your idea as is holy  you win so lets post and see what the devs and our peers use
i dont know what fantasy world you live in but in the real world and eve you dont ignore intel because it wasnt earned you know someone is in local you do not do anything in system simple as that or as was brought up above you organize pvp and try to bait but you dont ignore it and pretend it doesnt exist edit if your intention was to support or suggest something you might want to make it clear im not sure what you would prefer to have happen
thats the problem eve is not the real worldhalf the things that exist for gameplay reasons in eve would make no sense in the real world because gameplay is the primary considerationgenuine cloaking and stealth is not fully unlockedyou cant hide from someone who automatically knows you are there unless you are playing a childs version of hide and seeki would suggest this idea
well put this is another example of tools needed if you read a few earlier post there were several suggestions for intelligence tools that required some effort the most supported idea was to make local like many other chant channels where only those who spoke up would be visible for intel and auto dscan that ran every 10 to 30 seconds would show pilots in system but not show location or ship types a more active scan would be needed please expand on your ideas and give your thoughts on what intel tools would be best for the game keep in mind we still want roamers to have a reasonable chance to find acquire and engage targets before they could escape while at the same time giving the local guy a reasonable chance of escape should he be alert
i think its a great idea as a test for nolocali am extremely confident that an eve 20 would not have local its just too ingrained from the early days that it cant be reversed across the board without a huge backlash however if there was an npc region and the gameplay was noticeably superior with no local then a gamewide change would be much easier to push through
actually if you think about it quite a few fly with local closed anyway in large fleets cuz the local spam spews forth and you are pretty much lagged to  or tdd to  whatever we are calling it now
there is are a number of individuals and organisations showing a severe and flagrant disregard for the tos avoiding naming said parties id prefer to address the bending and outright breaking of this rulesellingreferring sales of etcs with bonus isk credit breaks this rulethis is blatant and arrogant disregard for the rules and an obvious long running attempt to launder in game gains for out of game profits some of these operations will even allow you to simply withdraw this supposed credit for its isk value within minutes of receiving it without using any of the services provided no matter how you try to spin it this is rmting for isk at its most stealthiestthis has to stopthere can not be one set of rules for the average player and another for people selling etcs this is rmtingrmt laundering no matter how anyone cuts it this etc with isk is no different to selling a paperclip with isk on ebay other than ccp getting a few dollars for the sale of an etcmy main concern is this this promotes botting and makes the sale and purchase of botted isk simple and clean for the buyer once the botting cartels catch wind of this if they havent already its a slippery slope and can only end in disaster since once you remove the fear of asset stripsaccount bans for isk buyers it will become a pandemic problemim not calling for account bans but a warning with a blanket pardon for everyone who has been breaking this rule seems fair then strict enforcement from here on in
i approve this message
since the op is against botting i wholeheartedly approve this  shouldnt even be an issue
ive seen a lot of these lately do a bunch of people have reason to believe theyve found some kind of hole in the tos the text itself seems pretty clear on this point at least maybe not on a few others but thats neither here nor there so i have to wonder if theres something ccp has done or said that might make people believe the tos does not really apply in this case
i dont see how this contradicts the tos if anything it makes those wishing to violate the tos even harderyoure buying an ingame item with ingame currency this item improves your ingame capabilities by allowing you to fly for another monthlikewise the people buying the plexes are purchasing an ingame item for outofgame currency directly from the manufacturer which doesnt violate the tos either its the same as buying the collectors edition and getting the golden pod or for that matter its the same as anything on the aurum marketthe plexes make it much harder for rmters to do business as ccp is very efficient at stopping those who rmt as well as those who buy from the rmters it provides a way to use rl currency to help your character out without destroying the effort of those who have the isk to spend rmters find it hard to compete with the player prices for currency exchange especially with the thousands of bans that ccp have enactedif you see some people botting as you so adamantly claim then report them and ccp will switfly bring down the banhammer on them if you just dont like the fact that people can do this in the game in complete compliance with ccps business method then wow is a quick download away
no the bonus isk trend makes it far easier for rmters to operateits as simple as thisreferrer a directs to an etc for 10 with no bonusreferrer b directs to an etc for 10 and offers an in game 100m isk bonus when buying through their referral linkbuyers assuming this is legal will buy from retailer b every timethe latter is stealth rmting or rmt laundering promoting the purchase of etcs with itemsisk that arent part of a ccp bundle people will always look for and take the best offer
i see what you mean now but this will never be easy for the ones who offer this first off if the isk was gained through some illicit means ccp will track it down they keep records of every transaction in this game and the paper trail will be obviousits always been advised to buy etcs from reliable sources the people who buy them from the illicit dealers will have their 100m taken away and maybe even the etc will be invalid while its good to keep ccp informed about the tactics of the rmters i dont think this is something to sound a klaxon alarm abouti met and talked to dr eyjog when i was in iceland during the csm summit i have experience to say that ccps crack macrormt team either has this under control or soon will
this is right up there with everybody claiming people in region x rmtif they really were and on such grand scales as people like to think that ccp would let that slide please remember that ccp has a very good reason to prevent rmt as that steps on their toes in regards to plex sales good grief just because you have issues with something doesnt make it wrong
im strongly against this idea the whole reason there are singleperson corps is because ccp wanted to get people out of npc corps this would counteract the effect as most people would be better paying the 11 tax on only bounties and mission rewards rather than the relatively high cost of keeping the corp open it would also serve to cause the market to enter a minor recession as liquid funds would be eaten away quicklymissions already give a good payout i highly doubt ccp would want to increase this margin the economy is healthythis would make the cost of running any corporation more of a headache than it already islikewise the cost for running an alliance is very high alreadyyoure basically talking about doubling it or more since every corp in the alliance would have to pay the monthly cost as well as every person in the corpif you dont like the singlecharacter corporations wardec them that is a huge reason why ccp encouraged people to leave the npc corps im sorry but i find this concept of yours impractical and poorly thought through
im all for more ships in a spaceship game however we can get them
 per single spim all for the idea of people moving skills where ever they want just not for evei can predict consequences of nightmarish proportions and im not even psychicand on the idea of letting people wipe sps ccp would start getting so many oh noes i clicked wrong lost carrier v please fix even if there was 5 screens to say do you really want to do that just because they have a cat that is awesome at just hitting the y keysuch an idea has lots of potential but its got far more dangers dont see why ccp would risk it
i petitioned this months ago they said theyd investigate it since then they have given them free rare ships i wonder if i ever hear of the petition again
thats quite a charge youre leveling against an organization that although its record is marred it has provided a service for many capsuleers with the amount they make from the lotteries i highly doubt theyd need to macro for isk gain at least as an organization as a wholei dont like what ccp gave them either as they obviously didnt need it and the people who won those ships seem to be selling them on the market immediately however ccp is examining everything with dedication and they definitely do not want a repeat of the t20 debaclethe isk is not being laundered as youd need to get it back for that to happen theyre simply offering a bonus to those who buy from the particular seller since the gtcplex price is the same for both sellers
skill that add1 remote refining and2 remote reprocessinggive them the same range control and standings as the other marketindustry ranged skills eg visibility
ccp places warning popups all thru out the game to insure you understand the consequences of your actions if you ignore them then it is your fault  not ccps  you are stuck with itits like me saying to ccp oh noes i clicked the wrong button i jumped my titan instead of hitting the bridge to button ccp please give me my titan back  would ccp give my titan backits like me saying to ccp oh noes i clicked the wrong button i jumped into lowsec and a gate camp blew up my officer fitted cnr ccp please give me my cnr back  would ccp give my cnr backccp already gets thousands of whinners putting in petitions for their stupid mistakes so nothing new to them they are use to it
the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and since the old guard are the few in this case how about noyou want a complete change to the game because 5 people in eve dont have anything to train anymore in their 265mil sp chars well tough luck start another character or something
wait what is considered an old guard anywayand i do believe there are more than just a few
yes as you said train those skills on your alt
apparently if you have the golden pod implant from the collectors edition and use the captain quarters view the pod remains green a dev had confirmed that this is intentionali dont think this is fair mainly because i didnt pay for a half done jobsecondly where is ccps attention to detail this is meant to be part of the 10 year celebration where is the pride in their productor is it an intentional reminder of ccps ability to leave a job half done
again as i literally just explained to the last person who didnt read everything i am not suggesting we just add a fee to corporations as the game is right now i am only suggesting it as part of a larger broader scale change my main request is a revamp of the permissions segment of corporation management and a revamp of contractingthe rest is a suggestion that would need to be taken as a whole not individual parts for an expansion based on white collar occupations because ccp tends to only change things in large quantities via expansions i rarely ever see patches that fix one or two problems anymore look at odyssey they could have just fixed the scanning program but they didnt they decided to go overboard and revamp all of the exploration sites rename all of the anomalies change ice belts into anomalies and make all oreice anomalies visible without scanning  they also added a scanning overlay and redid the scanning skills then they added a bunch of scanning modules and renamed a bunch of other stuffmy point is ccp wont listen to a request for something easy to fix they tend to only do complete overhauls of entire segments of the game i am only requesting a revamp of permissions and contracting the rest is a loose suggestion for an expansion if need be
nothis would be terrible for evecan you imagine the amount of free accounts doing the following miningblob warfaregankingtradingspamming scamsetcthere is so many things you can do in eve with only a few months skillpoints all of these things will be done with free accountsjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
according to the eve lore the pod remaining green is a station security feature as the golden pod is so valuable when it exits your ship you are immediately transfered to a standard pod while your golden pod is vaulted this prevents scuffing of your golden pod due to wearing against the railings of the captains quarters more importantly when wis in implemented 175 years from now this substitution prevents thieves from breaking into your cq and hijacking your golden pod
maybe it just doesnt have the golden sheen when interacting with artifical light because space magic
nevermind drunk
supported ccp need to know that people shouldnt have to accept  like this if they wanted to sell us a half baked product they should have said so when they advertised itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
this would be like the arm tattoos only appearing on your avatar but not in your cq ccp really have become experts at managing to  off a lot of people all the time this is my signature there are many others like it but this one is mine without me my signature is useless without my signature i am useless
how came customers dont get what they paid for golden pod is the golden pod make it golden anywhere i dont eat half baked bread or half roasted chicken hell i dont even go half way to the job to work therecustom ship skins character creator style repaint bring it
supported
just want to remind you that what you see wihtin your pod is a interface not the real world thus you can see as golden what its still military green in reality much as you see lasers and listen to sounds in the void of space
posted in the test server section tooseems to come with a general lack of concern from the devs for cq and wis after the outlash following incarna focus just seems elsewhereyet with enough support im sure players can get them to care more about cq and wis againwe have a topic going in the ideas section of the forums about this located here
kicking this can farther down the road150 dollars and the person cant get there shiny new pod to show up in a stationthat is really not right
the golden pod is included on the eve the second decade collectors edition and guess what it works as advertised your pod is golden on eve mmorpg gametry this press enter ship hangar its should do the trick
rmting doesnt need to have anything to do with macroing they have a legitimate way to make lots of isk like many others in eve the problem is their sale of isk for  rmting which ccp seems to allow because its coupled to the sale of a gtc if this is allowed then i might just start my own gtc webshop with an isk promotion would be even easier if ccp just said give us x and you can sell all the isk you want
rules only apply to the lesser folk like you somerblink is eve royality they have the connections with ccp which rightfully place them above you nothing is stopping you from openning a lottery partnering with an plex seller and engaging in rmt on your own thats what the sandbox is all about finding ways to cheat and then using your connections with people who run the game to get away with it
if theyre offering the item for the same price as the competition how is that money laundering theyre giving people a bonus to shop with them thats good business if they were selling it at an inflated price and delivering isk in return that would be rmt if it can be shown that they were provided those etc by ccp through a gift or at a reduced cost then this is another gifting issue which ccp is really looking into if they sold the etc for greater amounts than the competition then its stealthrmt if they simply want to share some of their insane wealth thats up to themin either case its not money laundering if theyre simply adding a bonus to the fairprice sale i dislike their track record in dealings with ccp but im not gonna wag a finger at somer for rmt if there simply is no evidence of it
just giving the thread a bump every once in a while as i want to see this happen
maybe make the cyno increase sig radius when cloaked but i would still like a way to hunt down solo gankers
soooooobecause someone is cloaked and you cant attack themthey are taking away your space  because you have to flee if hesheit calls on hisherits friends when you go after them or near them did i understand that correctly i can understand the frustration of someone just sitting there and exploiting something but isnt that what you do too you exploit weaknesses of other players you blow up their ship and take all their things please do not complain about not getting your way with people
hell yes no more useless ones on my skill sheet i never wanted mining etc yet ccp gave it to me for no reason
large fleet gameplay is quite different from regular eve experience local is absolutely essential tool of intelligence gathering for both attackers and defenders the pirates and carebears everybody is heavily relying on it to provide instant and accurate information about potential targetscreating a space that has different rules of intelligence gathering will create different type of gameplay and different more player skill oriented type of gameplay even those large fleets you talk about actually rely on certain people within that fleet to provide accurate tactical intelligence just because you can safely ignore local doesnt mean your commander can ignore it fleet commander relies on that information as much as anyone and makes the decisions for you
i agree itd be nice if the pod was golden everywhere id even be willing to trade in the spinometer for seeing the golden pod when i lean over the railing on the balcony
its frustratingis ccp completely unable to ship any kind of complete productthis is not an unrealistic expectationcsm
and all through the eve universe barely any cares were givenid like to thank the art department for concentrating on things that will benefit all of the eve community rather than redesigning the cq that hardly anyone usesanyway as you can see from this thread  dev comment on golden pod in cqits that way by design so you did get a complete product jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

theres a reason for that high number of players using cq by default new players have the incarna station environment activated thats the main problem ccp unfortunately forgot to change the default settings on the client most players dont even know they can remove incarna from the game completely thats always the first tip i give to new players starting eve online remove the deficient incarna cqso if ccp someday changes the default cq load options the number of players using cq would be negligible

just think of the practical applications and the possibility of another new career path arms smugglingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i dont do well with elaborate explanations so  here goesi think that roles should be defined by the manufacturer of the ship tech one tech two  anythingtech one ships get a defining role by the corp that invented it this is defined by that corps mission statement so for instance a domi bpo would be purchased by capsuleers from creocron creodron focuses on drones obviously and this shows so if roden shipyards were to make a domi bpo the mission statement of that corp would change the loadout and bonusesthis would provide a way to focus tiericide and eventually allow for customization based off of the parent corps influenceto take the previous example further lets look at marauders the kronos was invented by duvolle labs but what would happen if creodron licensed the bpo well they would apply their influence to it bonuses would change and more importantly  they would more than likely use their own hull so now we have a layer of complexity that adds  interesting results a kronos could be a mega  or it could be a domibut the kicker is that this influence  it can be balanced vertically in other words the mission statement dictates how effective the ship is at specific functions any change to the mission statement changes all the ships that corp has designed the concept is both unifying and able to add depth to the gameremember a rose by any other name this can be applied to the current teiricide effort one corp may prefer support whilst another prefers attack this would be in their mission statement so the hulls line up that wayui 3 logisticsu pilot of all t2 logi and my shiny archon deceased also a chimera which may or may not be horrid i dont make games i play them i get that ppl are passionate about change i post here to plant seeds you see your idea as is holy  you win so lets post and see what the devs and our peers use
somebody has to pay for the game more paying accounts equals healthier game with more devs etc
the cq was taken out of the npe ages agothe fact that players use it despite its lack of gameplay speaks to the fact that players want it
by default incarna cq is still enabled for new players
no it isnt its been changed to randomly place new players in either the cq or the hangerlook it up
ive only been running incursions for about two months so i have little objective knowledge of how things used to be but from what little exposure ive had to intercommunity politics and the infantile temper tantrums resulting from lost insite contests the current state of incursions appears to me to be brokenin recent weeks one or two shield incursion communities have taken it upon themselves for whatever reason to ruin the gameplay for all incursion runners by killing the mothership as soon as it appears lately within 1216 hours of the incursion first spawning rather than leaving it up for a few days so players can get a chance to run hq assault and vanguard sites without having to travel 30 jumps every day to get to the next spawnat the risk of incurring the wrath of those who claim eve is a sandbox wah wah wah whenever somebody complains about a broken game mechanic id like to make a suggestion to fix the problemsince the primary motivation of the above referenced shield communities for popping the mom appears to be to grief the entire incursions community as punishment for perceived offenses committed by one or more armor communities i suggest changing the spawn mechanic to remove the detrimental effect to the entire incursions community this can be done by respawning another incursion in the same location as the one just killed if the mom is popped less than seven days after appearing overfarming of the mom site can be prevented by removing the reward for completing the site if it is run within a week of the motherships appearance it doesnt need to be a week just a reasonable length of time to discourage childish temper tantrums which diminish the enjoyment of the game for the greater communitywaiting expectantly for the rants of the griefers whose entire reason for playing is to think of ways to make as many people as possible angry 3
eve is real this is the motto of the game or one of them like real life you cant reallocate your time once it is spent i learned to ride a bike when i was 7 or so i havent rode a bike in 3 or 4 years i cant go back and reallocate my time to learn something i would find useful now like coding c or learning dreamweaver or other fancy computer techit sucks but the idea is to get players for the long haul anyways and in relatively short order those 25m skill points will be dwarfed besides if you did something like this now players would swap entire roles over night or push their skills further with no time investmentbesides one day you might find those skill points useful just how if i ever get off my ass and take my bike to the gas station to fill the tires with air i might ride it again
currently you can train a secondary character in addition to your main for a plex a month without said plex you still have access to that said character i can see how from a logical perspective your argument holds weighthowever this would lead to a massive increase in gank alts and cyno alts furthermore you would risk destabilizing the economy of eve by making plex an optional thing to buy and interestingly enough arguments could be made either way on whether we would be facing super inflation or a general decrease in cost regardless changes to the price of plex directly affect the changes in the price of everything in eve if you dont believe me go take an economics class or twoon top of that you completely change the fanbase of eve to be mostly a bunch of snot nosed kids that otherwise couldnt have afforded eve and now get to run rampet shouting obscenities and ruining the role playing and political environments of eve one thing that has always amazed me is that the people who play eve interesting enough on average tend to be older more mature players with jobs and responsibilities just all around no i could go on for days about how you would completely ruin everything that is eve if you dont want to pay for eve but still want to be in eve go play dust a free to play model would completely ruin everything

that sounds interesting but i worry that it is too restrictive to general public my main idea is that new region is easily accessible to anyone who wants to give it a try not just the organized elite players
any of you who are ceos of corporations or able to alter permissions of individuals likely feel my pain the interface needs to be completely revamped it is old bulky and confusing furthermore each and every permission tends to do nothing without the addition of other permissions which means when making a title before you know it the title has access to everything and you might as well have just check marked director main changes i am looking for are listed below the bold ones are ones i feel need to be done asap wallet access divisional  currently it gives the ability to withdraw and deposit isk from the account at will but without added permissions from other categories you cannot spend money from the wallet on things for the corp this is silly and counterproductive and encourages people to withdraw from the account and intermingle funds this should simply allow the player to set it as his active wallet and view current balance no withdraws no deposits nothing titles being a way to organize and filter permissions  all permissions should be in reference to other permissions found in the title to which they belong therefore a title that contains the trader permission and divisional wallet wallet 1st would allow you to use wallet division 1 for purchases but a second title assigned to the same character that contained divisional wallet wallet 2nd and contract manager would make it so he could buy and sell with wallet 1 but not wallet 2 which he could only pay for contracts with jr accountant  currently this allows you to view bills for the corp but not act on them and only if you have wallet access which as mentioned above allows you to withdraw freely you cannot even see the journal for the wallet that is ridiculous this should allow you to see the bills and see the journal for any wallets the current title gives access to accountant  currently this allows you to view journal pay bills and buy and sell things for the corp it has jr accountant and trader built in this should be changed to allow you withdrawdeposit isk see above change about removing that from default permissions of wallets view journal and pay any bills with the wallet it should not allow you to buy and sell things with corp cash like it currently does contract manager  currently this allows you to spend corp cash on contracts regardless of who they are assigned to also currently when a contract is assigned to the corp anyone in the corp may accept it that needs to be changed the way this should work is when a contract is assigned to the corporation only people with this permission can accept it personnel manager  currently this allows you to view and accept applications this should instead allow people to add titles to members as well as accept new members meanwhile the current personnel manager roles should be built into a permission called recruiter hanger access based atotherhq permission sets  currently if you set someone to have access to hangers at based location that location can not be a pos and can not be hq that is ridiculous on both accounts we should allow based at permissions to combine with hq permissions and we should be able to base people at a pos other is currently the only way to give permissions at pos and orcarorqual and it gives permissions everywhere that they are not based and that is not hq honestly based at should overlap with everything and be able to be put on a pos or hq but i do feel other should not overlap with hq this is so that hq can be considered a separate entity which is a common setup i love the ability to create dynamic queries we need to make sure they continue to work after changes i will likely think of more things and post them here when i get around to it point is i am sure i am not the only one upset by some of this crap please be sure to thumbs up if you agree
the general look and feel of the whole thing needs a major overhaul as well the interface needs to be streamlined and a bit more user friendly as well some of the specific changes i am looking for as far as the actual interface itself goes are listed below as before bold are what i feel most strongly aboutchange the check boxes under the various hanger permissions sets to radio style buttons since take is just an advanced level of query it makes no sense that both should be able to be checked at the same time this will not only eliminate some confusion but will also allow users to at a glance see which set of right the user has container take as its own category with the exact same setup as hanger takequery is just silly as well remove these categories and simply add a radio button to the right of take that says all then when you are in the permissions sections for the various hanger permissions you can plainly see if the player can a simply see things in a hanger b take things other than containers or c take everything including containers or at the very least consolidate these check boxes to the hanger screens area add a mouse over tooltip for all of the permissions sets that says straight from ccp exactly what the various permissions are supposed to do remove the excess unused titles and instead add a buttons at the bottom of the title section that say new title and remove title if there still needs to be a hard limit of 20 then fine give an error message when the player goes to create title 21 but there is no reason to have all those extra titles cluttering things up this also helps so that you do not run into problems when repurposing titles as a new title would always be perfectly blank change the roles section so that there is a space for duration that is to say allow someone to receive a role for duration x with 0 of course being infinite most of the time a permission added through the roles section rather than the title section will be for one of three things 1 to make someone a director 2 to temporarily add a feature for a character or 3 to give a character a slight modification from others with his title such as the leader in his group or something of that nature clean up the output from the auditing tab and allow people to see more than just the 10 or so entries it normally displays any of you who have ever usedor more likely tried to usethis feature will see that it is more or less unusable allow the deletion of decorations no longer in service i myself had an officer think it was funny to make a completely bs medal that has since been deleted and is no longer in use however every time i go to assign someone a medal that garbage medal clutters the list support for discontinuing a medal needs to be implemented it is important we clean up the interface so that 1 people actually have the ability to make a corp with a legit hierarchy and more controversially 2 so people dont make stupid permission assignment mistakes by accident due to the bulky beast that is the current ui while this will make spies actually have to work a little bit it means anything they earned they actually were meant to earn which should make the victory sooo much sweeter please be sure to thumbs up if you agree
ERROR
helloi have an issue regarding the price for faction weapons in the lp store in brief the cost in tags for these weapons is too high tag generation rates have suffered from a series of patches and game design changes but the lp store tag costs havent been adjusted to compensate what we see now is these weapons are disproportionately expensive to other weapons of the same type this is not an issue of drop rates players can physically build these modules and that needs to be accounted fori request a rebalance of their cost to increase availability as the end goal long versionthe central issue of the current balance for faction weapons are their meta level with some of these modules having a meta level of 9 in terms of ccps internal balancing metric this would require them to be very expensive and have a degree of power higher than the lower meta levela where faction weapon stats specifically are considered they typically possess a few key bonuses first of all they generate heat when overheated at around half the rate of t1 and t2 modules secondly they have a bit higher ammo capacoty in terms of caldarifed navy turrets i observed slightly higher optimal on caldari faction rails while fed navy rails had more fall off lastly navy weapons have less fitting requirements in theory a dedicated fw player should be able to through only his own efforts obtain the tags for and build himself a full faction ship complete with faction weaponssupport modules and ammo it would be time consuming but the overall benefit for this player would be possession of a ship that is considerably tougher than the base t1 variant and have a full compliment of high grade weapons his ship would have efficient tanking modules and better weapons for general purpose combat this is a noble goal in itself  the player has built this ship through his own workthe issues start when you begin to account for how he will build it there is only one way to get faction stuff  tags tags are generated in three ways primarily those being mission running fw missions or coercing faction police to fight before the fw rebalance a couple of years ago it was possible to use the bountiful faction rats found in button complexes as a steady source of tags with the other dominant alternative being l4 misssion running it was much easier just to use fw for collecting tags  a theory supported by the internal game mechanics of the lp store especially the fw lp store the rebalance was enacted to reduce the npcs in a complex to bare minimum as a measure of enabling players to fight on more even terms unfortunately this stripped one of the most popular methods of tag generation from the game entirely and the fall out from this has been faction weapons are a tiresome grind to build now in terms of balance of the faction meta items themselves i do not intend any action here i am solely concerned with making these modules easier to acquire in a perfect world faction stuff ahould be more expensive than t2 gear where they are just outright better mainly in terms of like cal navy shield extenders or pds things like passive shield hardeners or boost amps are outright better than t2 and cost a respectable amount alrrady its when looking at weapons that things start getting crazy as of this writing cal navy ham launchers are 60 million each  a price not justifiable through any metric they are so expensive only because to build them costs an upfront few million from the lp store and also something like 500 tags five hundred ccp should in my opinion reduce the lp store costs of these weapons and weapon bpcs in preference to creating a more accessible tag generator why because if a new source of tags is created but is created in the wrong way or place nothing will change people are already not expending the effort to farm hundreds of tags and they wont do it in the future either by reducing the lp store cost however you let the market drive demand ny virtue of much lower costs and an associated increase in supply as peoples pre existing tags get more mileage faction gear already out performs t2 stuff by a not inconsiderable margin depending on what youre looking for lower prices will drive demand up the increase in demand will see prices fall further over time and hopefully have the tertiary effect of making fw a more attractive and serious occupation in and of itself with lp stores acting like a giant isk sink for the game getting people to buy more stuff from there will benefit the economy and help to drive inflation down i wont specifcy any prices for a full faction fit but if conjecture put it at 2 4 x the price of a t2 ship i think that could be very reasonable
whats the problem heresome guys just seem to be more efficient than others
hahahahahahaabloobloobloobloonever gonna happenthis made my morning your salty incursion tears have fueled me for an entire dayi need a cigarette after that
so youre mad at people for completing the content as ccp intended instead of abusing the mechanics to farm it for more moneyi see
yeah pretty much thissympathy level  0
i heard a rumour that the direct application of sufficent dps will stop anyone from shooting npcs
didnt expect sympathy did expect ridicule just documenting again that douchebaggery is rampant and encouraged in this game
this is where the correct application of yea this is eve is permitted
nerf shields that will show them 
setting up in 00 type space and making it more like wh space requires organized players even more so if the traffic is going to be much higher then typical wormhole space
ive debated writing this up for a while now because anyone can see the kind of backlash im going to receive for doing so but some topics are too important to be ignoredin 2012 im sure you all remember there was an incident involving player on player harassment that tested the bounds of how far the quote this is eve goes im referring of course to the mittani incident
you seem to have mistaken the forum for a support ticket
please read the last sentence
nah its stuff like this that makes eve funim pretty sure there is a recording of me somewhere singing i like big butts and i cannot lie after a particularly embarrassing incident
this is the op in the minerbumping forums who now without the slightest bit of irony would like to whip out charges of harassment and cyber bullying at what goes on inside of a gameyouve already gotten your answer as to whether it is a eula breach to scam players so your title is misleading go find a game you like to play eve and any competitive game isnt for youithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
i was wondering when you would pull this those are a direct quote of my feelings towards bullies and i am not ashamed of them no actual threat levied against erotica 1 and im sure if you ask him hell tell you ive been nothing but civil even thought i think very little of him to put it kindly
very little you want him dead over a video game youre unbalanced and disconnected with reality im pretty sure you should seek professional helpithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
if you dont mind  this thread is for constructive well thought out debate over whether this type of behavior should be allowed by eula your personal attacks are not appreciated feel free to do those in any of the other threads your currently engaging me inif you dont have a specific argument against the proposal  i ask you refrain from posting
haha complaining about personal attacks that is rich also forum not pulpit your proposal is bad because no evidence cited consitutes harrasment or cyberbulling ccp is pretty good about bringing the banhammer when it does and they sent you here instead in fact the only two people mentioned in this thread who said they wanted someone to die is the mittani and you which while not eula breaking because you like to be passiveagressive with your rl death fantasies is sick if you feel like that about anyone seek helpithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
im currently having the evidence reviewed by a specialist in cyberbullying i should have it within the week
good when he gets to the part where you wished a fellow human being wouldi am sure hell recommend therapy for you as wellithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
hes mad
as a specialist in cyberbullying id like to state erotica 1s activities do not represent what we know as cyberbullying also as stated many many many times before the csm really isnt the appropriate entity to ask for eulatos changes its not something they do id also recommend you take a quick moment to review exactly who your csm reps are theytend to enjoy seeing emergent gameplayif you really really really think ero 1 and company are breaking cyberbully laws i recommend you talk with your local law enforcement entity72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
specialist can you please explain
you gotta go parallux for quality and ancient eve tears
there is indeed a lot of tags that are required for each modulebut the price of those tags still havent gone up to ridiculous yet you can source any of the tags at any of the market hub systems also place buy orders at staging systems of fw corps
hope im not late to the party put on 1 mill to see if i can get a decent bounty out of him t2 bpos should get me at least 100 mill rightsorry to spoil the parade of 6s kaarous maybe we get can get 5 mill more on him to fix thaton an amusing note this guy is apparently now in the cfc eve is a dark and harsh world youre supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in youre not supposed to feel like youre logging in to a happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures thats what hello kitty online is for ccp wrangler
counterproposalremove all other sites when the mothership spawns 100 risk free isk faucets are a bad thing this would at least turn off the flow early
destruction of the mothership does not increase or reduce risk to the fleets while running incursion sites it simply ends the incursion those of us who want to participate in incursions and do not have the means of assembling a fleet capable of running the kundalini manifest site are cut off from running the lower tiered sites due to the almost immediate destruction of the mothership as soon as it appears my complaint is not that fleets capable of killing the mom are killing the mom thats the purpose of the site i have no facts just hearsay to back this up but it appears certain shield communities are intentionally running backtoback hq sites not merely to reap the isklp rewards for those sites but primarily to run the red out of the bar and causing the mom to spawn then immediately kill it again not primarily to reap the isklp rewards but to deny access to that incursion by all players as soon as possible again hearsay tells me that the reason they are doing this is in response to being butthurt over armor fleets occasionally contesting a site and sometimes winning those contests while i can understand the irritation of having to deal with a contest when youre trying to run sites i dont think it adheres to the spirit of the game to pitch a hissyfit and intentionally take a dump in everybodys oatmeal
what if they just legitimately want to rid highsec of the sansha menace as fast as possible
if true that would be very heroic of them i would arrange a ticker tape parade in their honor
soooooo war dec them or hire gankersspies to take them out rather than be passive aggressive and ask for mechanical changes to the game why not actually retaliate directly or semidirectly until they stopeditto me this all seems to be in the spirit of the game the shieldrunners dont like people competing against them so they burn everything hoping it makes their competitorsenemies move onits a valid tactic no worse than people running away from a fight they are not assured of winning or docking up whenever nonfriendlies enter a system or ganking a poor sob that got separated from everyone else
i really dont see why you are posting here about this the scorched earth policy being used is not the result of any ccp created mechanic but is the result of player actions and does not appear in any way to violate the eula if anything i admit from an outsiders point of view its refreshing to see something besides isk farming happening in the incursion community
this
some elaboration on how players might use such space would be goodnullsec has the following economic resources which as far as i can guess would work out distributed as follows in your new localfree regionhigh end money moons  pl or cfcmid range money moons  whoever can be bothered to stick a strong pos on and regularly clear off siphonsanoms scan down combat sites  dedicated multiboxing site runners like joker who gave a talk at eve vegasgas  almost no one an occasional explorerrelicdata  newbies in magnatesasteroid belts  no onenpc missions  cloaky nullified tengu alts if the lp payout is high because of unusualunique itemspocos  probably no oneheres what im seeing resulting from this virtually no fights you could hunt down tengus running sites or doing missions but its a pretty horrible task which is why so few people do it on tqnow presumably this is not the ops vision so perhaps you could explain why you feel this space would be an entertaining addition to the game
hahahahaha the thug lyfe meets internet gamesthere should be shows on this
the words speak for themselves i am a specialist in cyberbullying here bullying at its core required forced nonconsensual involvement in an enviroment schoolkids can be bullied because they cannot remove themselves from school workplace bullying exists because its quite difficult for someone to up and change a job cyberbullying exists only in that social media has become a huge part of todays life and isnt something easy to escape fromero 1s bonus rooms and singing are purely consensual nobody forces you to play eros game you are not required to join the bonus round nobody is holding a gun to a persons head forcing them to sing you can walk away at any timeyou can start calling it bullying when ccp comes in and says sing on ventrillo or lose your account till then its someone making a poor decision72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
and its not done through any eve medium it would be like ccp enforcing harassment rules on kugutsumen
so you think just because we can quit eve online its not cyberbullying ridiculous bullying is the use of force threat or coercion to abuse intimidate or aggressively to impose domination over others the behavior is often repeated and habitual one essential prerequisite is the perception by the bully or by others of an imbalance of social or physical power behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal harassment or threat physical assault or coercion and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets justifications and rationalizations for such behavior sometimes include differences of class race religion gender sexuality appearance behavior or ability23 if bullying is done by a group it is called mobbing4 the target of bullying is sometimes referred to as a victimno where in this definition does it say hey your not a victim if you can walk away i am at work and my manager bullies me but hey its not bullying because i can quit my job no your still being bullied you should not have to quit your job  quit a game or do anything because of another person you are bullies
you are aware that alliance panels at fanfest have frequently contained clips of people being made to sing as ransoms for thier ship right and that these pannels have been preapproved by ccp before theyre put onif they thought making people sing was bad they wouldnt allow that now i have nothing to do with new order other than finding them hilarious but i think the only eula violation here is you literally wishing for the death of another human being over a stupid internet spaceship video game you need helpedit how do the cyberbulling laws in iceland work anyway
your correct in saying that currently its not against the eula hence this proposal if no one shows they dont approve of these actions ccp will never do anything about them i have been messaged by a lot of people who tell me they support my posts about the issue but not one of them is willing to actually take the fight where it matters simply put they are all afraid of you and the backlash you produce
wow op you have some serious issuesmay i suggest you take a short break from gaming for a while and gain some perspective on lifedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
lets take a look back over this thread first the definition of bullying you citeso by that rationale comments like the following must surely count as bullying your arguments are full of inconsistencies contradictions selfaggrandisation baseless histrionics and worst of all glaring hypocrisymight i respectfully recommend you take a few days or weeks away from a game whose rules you openly cite as being unsatisfactory this dissatisfaction being the remit of your thread or even look for another pastime one you find less distressing
i bet you havent
sorry to spam but ive subsribed to the minerbumpingcom thread in question and i now have even bigger concerns over the credibility of the complaint and its source its difficult to be confident that somebody is arguing from a balanced position when they post this kind of comment in an antibullying thread i seriously suggest you take some time away from your pc and enjoy life go for a walk maybe even talk to somebody professional who is trained to talk over your feelings with you it is a game my friend please dont let it consume your life
reading is fundamentalithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
going to go ahead and confirm that before i became a member and backer of the new order erotica 1 doubled my isk because i played the game correctly i am fully literate and i was polite it was in fact her forthright upfront and honest nature that persuaded me to see the new order side of thingsoh and cyberbullying doesnt existin general and certainly not in eve because the internet is an entirely voluntary participatory media i will even cite eve precedent you actually have to make an effort to move away from a bumper as per the gm response on miner bumping before it can be considered griefing in eve the onus is on you
please stop using the its just a game bit this has nothing even to do with eve this is about the cyber bullying  eve is simply the medium being used to do said cyberbullying i am asking the medium ccp to not allow itself to used as a focus for bullyingeven if i walked away from eve i would still feel the same way about erotica 1 not because shes a troll in a game but because she hurts people on purpose
the fatal flaw in your logic is that eve is indeed a game
logic snort this is about the feels manithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
indeed i must admit  this is almost like saying that instead of free will we have free wont logic is for the 20th century dude  let mumbo jumbo rule now the age of aquarius is upon usperhaps we can get back to the good old days of a physician curing people by bloodletting and shaking his fist at the moonone thing this pallarva is great free publicity for your new order she is almost like a marketing agent for you lot
i think it would be useful to have bumping physics work in a recent bumping incident i noticed my freighter 980x106 kg was moving about he same as the machariel that was attempted to hold me up at 10x less mass than me he should have been unable to have as much impact as he did and his rebound assuming perfect elasticity should have been 10x as greatanother thought but impractical would be to transfer damage to both parties in proportion to mass
fyi if you are being bumped use the log off safely mechanism to despawn your ship without alerting the bumpers to your impending disappearance
imo faction weapons generally are overpriced by about an order of magnitude given that they dont in practice outperform t2 due to the effect of weapon specialisation skills and cant use t2 ammo they should have a target price of around double the equivalent t2 gear triple at most that would actually make them a viable alternative to t2 rather than just vanity ornamentsedit and such a change would also allow them to serve as a useful alternative if we see runaway t2 materiel prices
op updated with more info
ccp has done a lot of dough headed dumb ass things recently removing the juke box is one of them fix this and bring it back in the next update
ive been following this and the jukebox petition thread for a while now and i dont know if all of the eve has sound posts are in the same thread but theyre int here somewhere and theres several of them the jukebox petition thread linked in post 124 above is up to 28 pages now
this feature has been suggested before but i would like to repeat it as it would be very usefulmembers of the logistical backbone of corporations and alliances often provide readytogo fitted ships for their members currently fitting those ships requires individual actions for each and every ship both renaming and fitting the ships has to be done for every ship separately given that the amount of ships handled often numbers in the hundreds this is a very time consuming job one that could easily be automatedit should be possible to rename a selection of ships of a certain type and fit them with a saved fit all with a handful of clicks
still supported
nailed it
you know what it sounds like to me from your description hereit sounds like you engaged in some pvp  perhaps indirectly but pvp nevertheless  with the shield fleets by contesting a site they were going for thus harming their wallets now theyre striking back  namely by shutting off your farming ability as quickly as possible  and youre whining that theyre being unfairbasically it sounds like youre no better than a typical schoolyard bully you pick on the other kid until he lashes back then you run to the teacher only difference is that this is eve not the schoolyard so theres no bull zero tolerance policies that get the other kid expelled for protecting himself
i would recommend that if you do not like the fact that someone is intentionally shutting off the incursion early that you mount your finest battlesteeds and engage them in hounourable player vs player combatif youre unwilling to do this to protect your money making schemes im afraid eve is gonna be a pretty unfriendly place for you especially in the next 636 months
we may need a number smaller than 0 hereget some of our top men on this
in hindsight this was probably the wrong place to post in an effort to instigate an uproar at the behavior of certain incursion communities apologies for that in response to the commentor who thinks denying access to the incursions gameplay to the entire eve community because they got their panties in a twist about being contested by a fleet from another community in a site  im glad you didnt have access to nuclear weapons when somebody picked on you in your childhood
which one
which one what
yes a forum where people recognize and point out that youre suffering consequences for your own actions was probably the wrong place to expect sympathy from
sigh is it a requirement for you to be an insufferable fing dhead whenever you respond to people with whom you disagree

i agree with your assessmentto encourage nonalliance based pvp small scale pvp such region would need to have extra incentives such as1 special asteroids that are more profitable than asteroids found in other regions these have to be either in the main asteroid belts or anomaly sites that are automatically detected without need for scanning equipment2 much more profitable belt rats at least 2x average bounty and greater chance for faction spawnsidealy the npc region should be setup in such a way as to prohibit alliances from setting up jump bridges this should result in greater than usual stargate traffic and greater chance of encounters in easily accessible areas such as gates asteroid belts anomaliesi remember before ccp added all the pos stuff and jump brides and nerfed officer hunting 00 space was much more lively for small scale fights now it feels almost deserted my idea should encourage small scale engagements and make things much more lively at least in a small part of the map
if only for this reason its a valuable ideaadding more variety in eves ecosystems can only make it better
funny first time ive heard any of this
this is a longstanding eve tradition see also ransom for song
if you dont like the idea of having your singing recorded then you can exercise a minimum of self respect and tell the new order to go to hell and blow up your retriever
i appreciate the two of you replying to this threadyour job as csms is to represent all of us player base not just the oldfarts i ask that you keep an open mind to the needs of every player and consider that just because something has always been doesnt make it right
man if i had a nickle for every time someone told me what my job as csm was id be as wealthy irl as i am ingame
heres my question for youwhat do you expect the csm to do actually theyre just players of eve same as you me and everyone else they dont have speshul gm powers they dont have any powers aside from talking to ccp in a slightly more direct way than the rest of uslets say somehow you get the csm behind you next summit meeting they all stand up at ccp hq and say hey this singing for ransom thing is bad make it stop ccp says lol noyou asked via petition the gms said you were wrong they sent you to the forums for lulz youre kinda a laughing stock of regular forum denizens we egg you on over in the mbcom forums for more lolz are you grasping the pattern yetforgive me csms if ive made you out to sound useless you guys get stuff donejust you dont do it the way op thinks72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
gives you a nickle your an elected official no elected to represent the playerbase and take the communitys collective complaints to ccp i realize im just one voice atm but i ask that if more voices join mine you will seriously consider giving it recognition
i dont mind being a laughing stock to fight for what i believe is right areola the whole eve community could be against me on this subject doesnt mean i should change my view and feelings about it i believe one thing you believe another all i can do is put my point of view out there and hope that there are others who feel as i do that eve doesnt have to be played this way to be trolltastic and funedit im sorry but per eula im not allowed to speak about what the ccp representative told me exactly
what you are doing is the equivalent of walking into a peta meeting with the intent to explain how wrong they are being vegetarians eve was very explicitly designed to be trollastic and fun see my sig for a quote another quote comes from ccp describing the collectors editionwe found early on that when friends played eve together they stopped being friends we thought thats awesome we need to keep developing this loose quote btw72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
thats a good jobat least youre starting to listen and learnas per the replies in this thread you hope in vain and there are many other things you can do like wardeccing krypteia operations or even unsubcsribing and playing something else like club penguin or you could divert all that time energy and indignation youre misdirecting into a make believe world and instead fight for something important like world peace equal rights for all and an end to pollutionand boxing doesnt have to involve knockouts football doesnt have to involve goals and ice hockey doesnt have to involve fights see your earlier comment about the whole eve communitysend them a petition perhaps it will be the first time theyve heard any of thisi have to ask are you really a new order agent on a windup is this whole incident including this thread another new ordergoonswarm prank
im going to read this thread but first let me quote our dear op from the minerbumping forumbut now i can only truly say i wish that erotica1 would die in front of his pc releasing his bowels on his chair and being discovered alone with 50 cats eating his corpseif anyone needs to be looked at it is you dear op seriously wishing a real life death upon me like this you are  sick
you guys sure do like to quote only parts of my conversations 3 at least i gave the common courtesy of letting your links speak for themselves
going to go ahead and confirm that erotica 1 doubled my isk because i played the game correctly i too am fully literate and i was polite as are all other successful bonus room winners ops claims are nothing but hogwash erotica 1 is perhaps the most honest and responsible individual i have ever had the privilege of gaming with as for op wishing harm upon erotica 1 well i think we can see the quality of her critics now cant wewhat a shame it is that players such as op continue to attempt to ruin the game for pillars of the community such as erotica 1 it is hypocritical to denounce cyberbullying whilst engaging in a campaign of hate against erotica 1 literally impersonating myself
the amount of im a new order alt in this is scary if your going to pretend to be someone else  you need to lose that repeat things 10 times in a cultish way thing you guys do
so you believe that i am somebody other than myself pretending to be mewho do you believe i amif you need somebody to talk to your local health region very likely has crisis lines available where somebody can talk through your issues with you i wish you all the best literally impersonating myself
read above your quotes are all intact i encourage everyone reading this thread to thoroughly examine the links you and i provided i am glad to see you got kicked from your corp by the way gentlemens agreement has recovered their reputation i dont know what the hell they were thinking letting you in i can only assume something at eve vegas was related until they read your forum posting my god you are worse than any widot monkey on a typewriter than i have ever seen and thats saying somethingi really hope you get some help by the way no matter how disgusting and hateful your public wish that i die a horrible death in real life i have not petitioned it hell theres no reason to youre embarrassing yourself enough without any prodding from mei tell you what though if you want to put this behind us ill offer you a bonus round i dont just do this for everyone generally only one in every 100 clients but you are special i am happy to pay you out if you show me complete faith and stop all this ridiculous nonsense warm regardsero
oh god i laughed so hard at the bonus round thing your so magnanimous in trying to screw me over 3
1 true as far as it goes but were also here to represent the players of the new order too2 were not in any way morally or legally required to represent by poll in short if 10 players want me to support x and 10000 players want me to oppose it i am still duty and consciencebound to support to ccp it if in my considered opinion x is the right thing to do that said i would also be duty bound to tell ccp although i strongly believe x is right there will be significant community backlash if it is enacted3 i specifically campaigned on a specific platform of viewpoints about the game and i regret to say that my campaign platform would not be compatible with restricting player freedom in the way that you want it would be seen as a betrayal of the promises i made by the people who voted for me if i were to do so4 i envy your privileged upbringing if you think singing a song to save an internet spaceship is bullying i could tell you a few things that i personally have been through that actually are bullying and let me tell you singing a song in a damb video game isnt on the list
are you are the person that on an eve fansite wwwminerbumpingcom recently stated the followingbut now i can only truly say i wish that erotica1 would die in front of his pc releasing his bowels on his chair and being discovered alone with 50 cats eating his corpse that is worse than most things ive heard miners say and ive seen all the usuals rl racist slurs rl antisemitic slurs accusations of raping children etc
i appreciate your well thought out and serious response may i ask how the csm works in regards to choosing what to bring to ccps attention is it a group decision  or if i can get at least one of the members to sponsor it will that be enough
can you get at least one other eve player to agree with you lets try that first
you can bring things to ccps attention you have done so the community team at least read the forum csm backing for an idea tends to lend weight and increases the chance of getting that attention you might try mike or ali but i warn you that theres no garauntee that theyll be sympathetic
ooreikaoo michiko i am seriously considering running for csm in the future if i can have your vote your support and your forum activism i think i can secure the spot i promise then i will bring your matter to the attention of the relevant parties
i think reika should run for the next csm if all of her claimed supporters voted for her shed most likely get in
so how are the seating arrangements determined could we sit next to each other
im serious i will vote you in not even jokingwhy because if mittani was an example you wouldnt be able to do the same crap you do as a csm you win i win go ahead erotica run
why did you claim it creates no content then link to tons of created contentthat seems counterproductive
i would hate to think a boring noncontent creating carebear was trying to get interesting content creators banned out of jealousyplease link to an equal or greater amount of content created by you to avoid that impressionthis thread doesnt count as it is more properly considered content created by erotica 1
wit that logic  new order isnt content since it is just a reaction to afk miners content
im afraid youre digging yourself deeper and deeper into a noncontent creation hole here and demonstrating that this thread is nothing but a depraved attempt to tear down content creators due to your intense jealousywe must ask ourselves who is the strong vigorious content creator from whom content flows like a fountainhead and whose contribution is irreplaceable and who is merely a replaceable drone who contributes nothing that a random replacement would notthe new order are the strong vigorious content creators while the various illegal miners contribute nothing but their presence as disorderly criminals and their long drawn out wail as they are brought to justice this thread too is merely the reaction of a faceless drone to erotica 1s fountainhead of content creation it is the review of a seminal masterpiece by a drunken layabout who did not appreciate that the arts illuminating vision exposed the failures of his wretched life entertaining in its own way but purely derivative of the masterpiece and a consequence of its genius
faceless drone practically everyone knows who i am at this point who are you againwould you please get on topic already
hes cfo of the cfckind of a big dealconversely basically no one but the relatively tiny number of players who read this thread  and i suppose the readers of mbcom  know who you arehe also is on topic i mean hes ridiculing you for your topic but that is being on topic one does not have to sympathize with a viewpoint to be on topic while discussing it
pretty sure to be on topic he has to discuss points about the topic not about the opedit and seriously the cfo of cfc dont you think the cfc has had its faced shamed in bullying enough already with the ouster of the mittani from the csm you feel you need to support another debacleedit 2 secondly  should you be really showing so much respect on a public forum meant to give any player the ability to bring up grievances if he has more power then me in this the csm might as well just be a cfc diplomat not a community diplomat
shadow ironic rand dunk classy
ok you know what i am totally going there if mittens had said biomass instead of kill hed have been 100 in the clear
by demonstrating that your grievances are meritless and not worth considering the csm has done the admirable job of assisting the community in relaying legitimate grievances to ccp and increasing the signalnoise ratio of grievances in this forum to improve the ability of players with legitimate grievances to be heard they should be commended
so nice to be appreciated
arent you the one who postedbut now i can only truly say i wish that erotica1 would die in front of his pc releasing his bowels on his chair and being discovered alone with 50 cats eating his corpse you also have a scantily clad underaged girl as your profile picture on the mb forumsyou arent exactly a model internet denizen
im guessing hes the guy who fired you from the cfc i guarantee that other than the tiny portion of eve players who read these forums no one knows who you are
you have already decided my grievance is meritless in the one day the post has been up my apologies your majestyedit answering on behalf of the csm ballsy
we should all applaud what erotica 1 does such an amazingly nice thing to do for the players of evethats all im saying
i have no wish to be anything of the sort i dont care at all about your politics or your players who think they are gods because theyve played a game for a decade i care about humans and people who justify emotionally damaging people by hiding their acts in a virtual world
the problem with using the emotionally damaging argument in a game is that anyone can make it against any part of the game they dislikebe very careful about the arguments you make around people who ascribe to the moral relativism school of thought
i agree lets say i find the molestation of defenseless asteroids to be highly emotionally damaging by the ops logic that activity must be ceased at all costs by ccp because hurt feelings are the first and only measure we should use for anything ergo remove the lascivious strip mining modules from the game and ban all miners
it is actually a lack of existing content that has set the new order in motion nature abhors a vacuum and miners have left new eden in a deprived and wanting state our response to the the vacuum includes the creation of content we make every effort to fill it as we insist that progress can be made and balance restored to the universe if miners would busy themselves creating content in the ways that are currently unknown to them then the new order would be less inclined to fill that vacuum with content as it stands it cant be that we are reacting because that would imply that afk miners are acting which we know is untrue thus because we can see that the new order is in fact creating content where there was none before it cant be the case that the new order is a reactionary force in new eden the miners are in fact the reactive force all content created by the miners in question springs from their reaction to the new orders creation of new and original content the laws of nature are at work here every action has an equal or opposite reaction in this case the bumpee is necessarily acting in a strictly reactive sense as a result of the motion imparted upon him or her by the bumper we can easily see who is the reactionary force here literally impersonating myself
hey op why dont you go join a nullsec group and mine out there null has stronger police than highsec would you believe it being set to red is like a death sentence
thoot him offither thoot him at onthe he puthed me
if you criminalize bumping someone i swear i shall sit on the jita undock with an alt in a charon and rack up killmails the problem with criminalizing an otherwise innocuous act nevermind that its petty and childish is that because a considerable portion of the time the act is commited its accidental without harm intendedyou could instead just not be afk i mean i suppose its technically easier to complain on the forums than push the orbit button but even so id go ahead and put in the extra effort while mining were i you as for escorts l2 escort and double web
an important thing to rememberanything you get i also get keep that in mind when advocating for these changesitd sure make ganking cheaper for one two noob ships noob ship a bumps the miner into noob ship b concord responds blaps ship a for bumping the miner then blaps the miner for bumping ship bus gankers have come up with an awesome solution to bumping give miners a siege module that locks them in place locked to one spot for a 15 minute cycle time cant move or be moved an inch im positive theres no way that could be used for nefarious purposes and its exactly what miners wantthat was sarcasm if you didnt catch it72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
just as well that its sarcasm because siege mode doesnt work that way anyway you can very definitely still be moved
this really is a good idea because faction weapons should be a usable alternative to t2 theyre not op i cant see how this would break anything and it has several beneficial consequencesbefore i try and escalate this is there anything problematic that anyone can see with this ive tried and i cant
i would love to be able and use my lp to buy ships and modules directly  at inflated lp costs of coursethat should encourage people to upgrade ihubs moremy other thoughts on tagsexchange tags for lp directly at a fixed rate based on the tag level  or variable so ccp can adjust it as needed  all items would be lp only other than items that need other things like nexus chips data cores ammo etcorhave 2 different prices on the same item one with tags one without with tags would be a better lp  tag ratio than the strait lp cost the tag market and gathering may pick up in response to better lp  tag ratios more people in faction warfare to gain access to the faction equipment
not that my opinion counts for much because npc corp but i cant really think of anything bad about this right now evecentral puts the average price of fn 250mm rail guns at something like 116m each one rack of those would pay for a small fleet of fully t2 fit battlecruisers to me thats broken
see below my browser screwed up and pseudo double posted
the simple seems short sweet simple and sublime it is really kinda an obvious fix though when ya think about it as far as the advanced fix it would make having a higher sec status actually do something
i guess hes finally admitting that the current is a good thing v0vhopefully he still gives me my bountyeve is a dark and harsh world youre supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in youre not supposed to feel like youre logging in to a happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures thats what hello kitty online is for ccp wrangler
scantily clad its a tank top and a pair of shorts for the internet i feel im doing pretty modest thanks for the personal attack though
i too am going to go ahead and confirm that erotica 1 doubled my isk because i played the game correctly i too am fully literate and i was polite as are all other successful bonus room winners they really areops claims are nothing but bullcrap erotica 1 is perhaps the most trustworthy and responsible individual i have ever had the privilege of never gaming with as for op wishing harm upon erotica 1 well i think we can see the quality of her critics now cant we what a shame it is that players such as op continue to attempt to ruin the game for pillars of the community such as erotica 1 it is hypocritical to denounce cyberbullying whilst engaging in a campaign of hate against erotica 1 it was also shamefuloh and this post was all my own workdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i too am fully literate and i was polite as are all other successful bonus room winners jokes old your an alt we get it get back on topic
your whole hate campaign against me where you link content you disapprove of all over the internet is a bit like someone who hates pornography linking sex videos everywhere she can to expose it i suspect that 75 of those liking your posts are in fact showing appreciation for you conveniently linking the hydra series in chronological orderalso please update your photograph on the minerbumping website since you support me for csm i suggest you hold a sign that says erotica 1 for csm please only do this if you are of legal agethank you
yes anybody who doesnt share your hatredfueled fringe minority position is an erotica 1 alt sure i guess anybody who happens to be literate polite or a winner is an alt of erotica 1 too then is that right literally impersonating myself
hearing erotica 1s voice over comms is a religious experience its sad there are people here clearly jealous of erotica 1s fame and fortune erotica 1 for csm because he truly cares
you mean besides the fact you used the exact same sentences
i yield your mighty logic is irrefutable no person could possibly plagiarise another like minded persons comments on an internet forum to make a point that would be impossible it is much more likely that everybody is erotica 1have you checked under your bed in your closet etc for erotica 1 she seems to be everywhere literally impersonating myself
your right the fact you both were part of deep core mining a corp with tons of new order members in it should be disregarded as well
theyre trolling you very effectively i might addand the reason for this is that you dont have any real argument besides i dont like this and think it is wrong  which is a terrible argument to make because as i mentioned before it can be applied to any activity andor action in this game by anyoneas far as bullying goes sorry but grow some thicker skin everyone has been bullied at some point in the past i was bullied my friends were bullied my bullies were bullied hell my family and my friends families routinely bully everyone and anyone in it ex why cant you be like your brothercousinfriend and get married already i want grandkids son i love you but are you gay why wont you date anyone etc etcyou could say its a part of the human condition or at least so deeply ingrained within the norms of society that it will never be completely removed such as the perception that you should be settling down and having kids when you are in your mid 20s
well this is a step in the right direction at least you can admit its bullying now
you do know deep core mining is an npc corp right72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
actually no ive always been an fna o7 member
actually youre a member of the scope now lots of new order bumpers are in the scope im afraid nothing you say against the new order can be relevant nowon thatyoure proposing grandiose changes to a game you dont even understand the basics of like npc corps cmon you gots to be trollan72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide
gasp
not in the sense that it is an issue worth creating a fuss about much less action against as far as im concerned its normal
you have to admit the logic is irrefutable together with the fact i was in deep core mining lets not forget that that fact alone speaks volumesi also think hes solved the obvious anagram from the name deep core mining we love our drink so the rest is pure logic as welldeep core mining  pre code gin mine destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

i dont know about everyone but ive heard of you as the one who saidon the minerbumpingcom forums

this thread is why i play eve
im at a loss for words first off falling for these scams is just silly i just dont understand how it happens nonconsensually next ransoming for a song has been done many many times in the past and i dont see it as some terrible shameful activity its just another form of exchange where someone willingly entertains others to get ahead in the game next your trying to invoke cyberbulling to get attention but you are way out of line in a game of chess it is not bullying to take your enemies pawn in a game of eve it is not bullying trying claim a system and control activities in it bullying is much more personal it is much more aggressive and it is much more harmful if these folks were following you from system to system insulting you preventing you from playing eve posting nude images of your likeness whatever that would be bullying what the mittani did while talking to hundreds on stage and thousands on a live stream was identify a player with emotional problems tell everyone to harass them and recommend that he kills himself that is crossing the line bumping players about to prevent them from utilizing a system they are claiming is fair game play asking someone to sing embarrassing songs in ransom is not recording the vocal ventings of a player losing their head on the game is not

faction weapon imbalance is another issue that would ideally be rolled into a metacide initiative for module balancing along the same lines as the tiericide of ship hulls we have already seen fozzie has indicated previously that such a balancing project might be on the cards eventually but if those plans can be made reality then the sooner the better

i have criticised them for it but in truth i cant really fault them in this thread because mynnas first and second post was not really that unpleasent though it could be that i actually agree with them so the biting wit has less of an impact seriously i think the frustration you have is that you can see no way to get back at the people doing this as they are spread out in diffeent corps and npcs corps you cannot war dec them nor can you suicide gank them because that takes a certain amount of organising of like minded people and they dont really exist in your community but you could impact some of them and chose not to why not at least target some of what you feel are their leaders speak to fellow pilots upset with it and get something going their objective could be to reduce the number of people running incursions and it is effective or it could be that certain people want incursion runners in bling fitted ships warping gate to gate so yes it is pvp and if you wantg to gather that isk you will have to harden up and resist rather than call for a change in the mechanicsnb i should point out that this exact strategy to close down inursions earlier has been used before blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
potential solution add sansha sites to go kill concord npcs or faction npcs run site get sansha lp increase blue bar if blue bar is increased enough have mom despawn edit there really ought to be some drawbacks or conflict available here you only collect lp if the sansha is not defeated you lose standings with the faction npcs for helping out sanshas maybe running these sites while the mom is being attacked spawns new bomber waves at the mom site for those who dont know a bomber wave deals 50k alpha and is responsible for most ship deaths in a mom site

i resent the implication that i did not read and listen to your original postthe reason people arent supporting you is not because they are afraid of the cfc and something awful will happen to them or because they are afraid of other reprisals by other groups or individuals the reason is because you are just plain wrong you arent a focal point for the issue if you are trying to be and this is the best focal point that can be mustered the planning committee for your cause needs to have a few more meetings maybe hire a consultantthe activities certainly arent nice in fact they are downright cruel but nobody is being forced to participate up and until ccp says hey guysthis isnt cool anymore we now have rules in place to stop you from behaving badly accept the change to the rules or walk there is nothing wrong with it in so far as the terms of the gameyou are implying that the behavior is bottom of the barrel does anyone go hungry because they lost their space possessions is anyone being denied basic human rights because their behavior has been spotlight there are many forms of behavior that are reprehensible that steal peoples lives none of which can happen in eve unless the victims are operating a rmt operation and all those assets that were given away expecting to be doubled or tripled just happen to be their next paycheckis that why you are so upset is this putting a crimp in your rmt bot empire or something through an altor are you trying to apply some sort of extra moral behavior on the activities of pilots in eve just because we play a game that has no rules against a behavior that we enjoy means that we will indulge in that behavior not everyone will but getting your bowels in a knot because someone does engage in it is about as useful as pissing on a nuclear reactor to cool it downyou want to push the issue be my guest ccp pushed you here so you could air your grievance dont think they dont know what kind of reaction you would get hence my you got trolled by ccp comment so which is it are you just some errant knight tilting at windmills are you an rmt boss who lost a paycheck and are pissed are you the allinone troll or god forbid do you actually believe the fountain of words you spew here and are riding a moral high horseactually curious about how you see your role and your reasons for being in that role
yep proposal dropped
fun is for weak dont you remember eve is not about funcustom ship skins character creator style repaint bring it
lots of people have read the op youve gotten lots of intelligent responses you have responded with nuuh numerous times and one time hilariously insulted the cfo of the alliance you were inbut then there is thisso were all pretty sure you want the attentionthe only storm here has been raised by you and your emotional profanity and exclamation point filled responses frankly considering your complete lack of understanding about eve i think the responses youve gotten have been quite measured youve gone to the gms they said no youve gone to the csm and at least the ones who responded here said no considering your op did not actually have a suggested eula change in it i think the csm responding at all was fairly generousi hope you can find a way to enjoy eve despite the cruel harsh universe it exists in i for one am delighted that ccp seems to be taking a stand against the carebearization of that universe eve is hard may it ever be soithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
from my carebear point of viewno eroticajames315whoever at miner bumping study the line very carefully so they know exactly how close to it they can getsongs poetry whatever is it illtempered teasingbullying according to some peoples definitions probablyquestion is did it cross a line where ccp has to step in for that answer you do not try it in the court of public opinion i dont care what you were told at eve vegas if you think it is a real issue file the ticket this is not the place where you will get satisfaction merely attention in the form of tauntinghate to say it but half the time i see people angry at miner bumping i figure it is more of their shills trying to drum up support for last years news that is the biggest skill set they show is that of having a greek chorus look it up you illiterate swine to add the air of legitemency to what they are doingmy basic advice is take it up with the ccp soundcloud and stop feeding the primates here in the monkey house of forumsmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
im sorry you feel personally slighted by me perhaps i didnt elaborate clearly im not implying you have some personal desire for attention im saying you are employing the name of cyberbulling to bring attention to the topic to give an unrelated example that happened to me yesterday a friend and i were discussing illegal immigration and she brought up the recent gruesome murder of several children in ny by an illegal immigrant to emphasize criminal activity of illegal immigrants the murder reference was simply a sensational approach to discussing the topic just like cyberbullying is a sensational approach to discussing the actions of erotica 1 really take a step back and look at waht erotica 1 has done and keep the sensationalist stuff out of it then we can truly evaluate whether erotica 1 has crossed the line a protection racket erotica  crew have claimed several systems as theirs they run a protection racket to strongarm isk out of any miner that wishes to utilize those systems  we could discuss the pros and cons of this but ccp generally gave it the thumbs up believe it or not but the new order recently moved into my highsec industrial home and attempted to strong arm my alt that utilizes the system to casually mine invent and manufacture it has been entertaining b scamming erotica  crew have scammed players out of all their assets i truly dont understand how you convince someone to hand over all their assets to another player in this game that really just blows my mind but it happens and way more often than it should  we could discuss the pros and cons of this but ccp also gave scamming the thumbs up as long as its not in the rookie channel c humiliation erotica  crew have potentially shamed andor humiliated another eve player in a harmful manner they recorded people flipping out on coms over their scamming  strong arming they recorded people singing and willfully doing silly things in the hope of reclaiming scammed assets then they publicized these recordings for anyone  everyone to know  this is where you believe they have crossed the line and this is where you need to address the pros and cons of allowing this behavior pro  provides humor to many eve players  teaches believe it or not people learn from being humiliated and other people learn from their public examples  provides content this goes both ways be it someone looking for the next laugh or the humiliated looking for revenge  publicity word of mouth is the best form of publicity that exists and humorous quips spread the fastest cons  potentially results in players leaving the game ultimately some people get so down trodden when scammed humiliated or faced with a conflict of interest they simply leave the game thats unfortunate but sometimes there isnt a solution that satisfies everyone  potentially causes people emotional damage some people after experiencing something humiliated look back and laugh some people get angry and goal driving some people do something stupid some people retain the hurt and truly are wouned from these experiences to be honest though this is a game and anyone that is actually harmed from ingame activities really shouldnt be playing in the first place so the question is where is the line on humiliation and did erotica cross it did continue abusing someone showing signs of severe emotional distress like threaten to commit suicide did they perform truly targeted harassment as in the victim tried to move to a different area of space and they followed them system to system to poke at him etc did they do something illegal sexually explicit photos rl asset scamming rl harassment i havent seen any evidence they crossed any of these lines and thats the crux of the argument ps you can turn off notifications by clicking unsubscribe on the top right of the forum thread
well this is akward i make a post refuting the no one even reads the op and tthen csm mike azariah posts and shows he didnt read the op she did file a petition mike the gms apparently gave her some form of working as intended  when that didnt placate her they sent her to this forum im also sure you can look forward to a lump of coal in your christmas stocking from soundcloud for suggesting she take her fight to themithe purpose of fighting is to win there is no possible victory in defense the sword is more important than the shield and skill is more important than either the final weapon is the brain all else is supplementali
so got my ce and plugged that golden pod implant into my head with held in breath and for once i undocked in my podso i let out a moan of disappointment that the golden pod isnt as gold as it was proposed to be in the adverts at allat best its a bit of a golden hue in the right light i thought it might be my laptop so kicked up the graphics from best performance to highest quality and let out another moan an implant that was selling for 36bil and i plugged it in for not even a bright gold coloured podquite upset by it still as you can tellim hoping when my motherboard returns and i have my pc that it turns out to be my laptop cannot render the goldness as its just so golden but i feel that im letting myself in for another moan on exhalethis is golden and this is not and the latter is exactly what i am seeingi paid for a golden pod not a dimmed down might be golden but cant make it out pod disappointmentbfast character switching xp stylee undocking  more routes out of stationb heres my tear jar    fill er up

i think incursion should be strictly lownull and just rebuff missions
to be honest i disagree with this sentiment i believe highsec incursions are overwhelmingly positive for eve in general they are difficult enough to require teamwork and operate in a manner where even more riskadverse members of eve community will participate in other words they are one of the few highsec activities that actually brings players together this is important for forming contacts friendships and more believe it or not forming these bonds joining into a community is one of the largest factors that govern player retention
thisits part of the learning curve in eve i say no as well
actually i did read the edit at the end of the opamazing i know what i meant was to continue down that path not here i am not trying to shush or shutter debate just that if it is a gameplay issue of harassment then this is not the place for it to be weighed op assembly hall rulesare we looking for debate on this a common consensus on whether it is harassment or a single player asking for a ruling from ccpmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

cmon folks the op has dropped the issue and should probably request the thread be locked the horse has been beaten to death and at this point youre just making it harder to clean the remains off the sidewalk
the problem is it not showing up on a km it is an implant and value of that implant should be displayed
