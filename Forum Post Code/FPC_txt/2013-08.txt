my position on this issue was very clear long before i was elected i would be doing those who voted for a gross disservice by changing my mind without a far more powerful argument than a bloo bloo someone put a bounty on metalking or typing are both verbs they are actions it is ridiculous to say that mere words cannot be sufficient motivation for revenge and punishment when even a cursory glance at history shows that they most certainly can or even the news im pretty sure that mr bradley and mr snowden could both provide you with a very definite opinion on the subject
to the tophrolt ceo live free die proud
one general rule of eve keep calm and ignore the asswipes in local
2 csm thats cool  and o aaaarrggthis would be usefull for alot ppl and nice for some events like the rifter party
i figure we have ships that have computer systems that we cant really fathom correct computing actions which hurl us through space at literally astronomical speeds and stopping on a dime well most of the time at least so long ago when i first started playing eve i just chalked it up that the planets and other things which werent on an orbit or moving werent doing so because of our advanced ships computers constantly calculating the drifts and such if you think about it its the most logical out for this also i dont understand this i pvp so im not sure how pos bms are the only ones we really need if it werent for bms we would just be crashing into each other all the time at gates and the such that would break null sec as all you would have to do is bubble camp a gate and wait for everyone to warp to zero because you dont have a bm
this arguement is so dated defending high sec ganking based on pvp eve logic makes no sense as high sec ganking has nothing to do with actual pvp high sec ganking is science done by spreadsheets and cheap tactics an invulnerable bump shipa handful of trash ships that meet a spreadsheet requirement to kill a ship with a set unchangeable hp yes skills can change it but the gankers just calculate that there is no skill and barely any effort pvp logic doesnt applyif you want to pop a frigate with plex theres nothing wrong with that in eve the problems with high sec ganking are mostly centered around freighterscatalyst  12mlight neutron ii x 8 866k  6928mmagnetic field stab ii x3 894k  2682m1mn micro warp drive x1 80k  80kantimatter navy 20 per gun 160  80k10970000
if you read what i wrote i mentioned that it already does you get no insurance for suicide ganking and loot is not guaranteed
im afraid youre not making any sense suicide ganking is still pvp whether you like it or not and there is still the astoundingly stupid idea that the price tag of your ship should make it immune from ten or twenty other ships just because of the price i cannot begin to understand the flawed mind that would come up with that logic

obviously what ccp need to do is have an emergency fanfest for the sole purpose of allowing each and every eve player to put decker above a dunktank and dunk him repeatedly maybe put him in a clownsuitbeing publicly humiliated for the fun of all involved would be the only way for him to truly show he is on our sidehonestly if he can just prove hes a fun guy who cares about the spirit of the game more than what he can get out of it well be good and no public address can prove that its something eh will have to prove with actions
dunk tank or drunk tank i thought fanfest was all about the pub crawls
i would like to start a thread asking for more choices in making  any ideas from you all to get this started into ccps attention in adding a bigger variety
proof that people in highsec have no idea how the game actually works
no let the pubbie speak the truth we obviously have the funds after our technetium exploitation over the last 2 years to be able to field officer fit gank ships  still profit from the gank
someone being hugely dishonest in a suicide gank threadwell i never thought id see the day
i have only been on one suicide gank but thought i would share the story for people that say it is too easythe gank was lead by elo knight of bl famehe organised for many catalysts to be fitted and placed into target systemthen he organised a fleet of people to jump clone to high sec and buy the shipsthen he sent out scouts while we stayed docked2 hours went past until we found a profitable target coming our wayundock was ordered and bump ship started bumpingquite a few people were afk by this time but no matter we still had enough this had been planned forwe got a bad warp in so we were quite a ways offwe started to burn at the freighter while elo screamed at everyone to hold fire until all were in rangesome didnt listen and started shootingthen some more didconcord turned up too soonwe all diedfrieghter pilot lold at us whilst cleaning his underpants and warped off into the sunsetso logistics patience numbers discipline doesnt take much for it all to break down and failgoing on the titan gank with elo was quicker easier and more fun tbheven if we had succeeded and made 200 mill each it still wouldnt be worth repeatingmoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is
1 u were just seasonable workers of this trade those whove done this for several times wont have those problems of yours2 no its not nesseraly all the planning and logistics it can be done by several or even one man easlya issue invites and register 20 new accsb pay for one month for each of them and ur main char which invites were used will receive plexes for every subscirbed acc use them to prolong his subscription so uve basically got 20 new accs with 51 days on all them almost for freec train the minimal required skill set and use them for ganking using allowed automating tools like isboxerd after 51 days in fact a little earlier so new ones would be able to finish their training to the moment previous 20 spent their subscription time dropdelete them and repeat from a
id like to see corporations that can make their own logo like alliances but its probably not feasible because of effort  some technical hoobyjoob that i know nothing about
fully agree the logo generator has been needing an overhaul for many years nowhopefully ccp will get to it after they finish upgrading the graphics of all the ships maybe we will be able to put these logos on corp members ships at some point toojint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
tell us more about your wonderful idea that could never be abused by anyone
1 so youre admitting that freighter ganking isnt as easy as you think it is2 if its so easy for 1 person to gank freighters why is literally everyone doing it with with their friendsa anyone can do this for anything not many people bother and certainly not for ganking freightersb people that actually do this enmasse tend to be of the mining variety that fact that literally no one does this to suicide gank freighters should tell you something about the activities difficulty in setting upc isboxer isnt automationd recycling accounts is a bannable offence if you think ccp wouldnt notice a person doing this every 51 days then youre very delusional
1 ive never said its easy i was saying its not sufficiently hard to pull in financial and organizational in terms2 because some people have more fun from their point of view things to do and others have some moral constraints yea a plenty have and others just dont know thats really so easy or just prefer to continue along their beaten path but u dont need a lot of people doing this as u see just a several people with several alts each per gang and even few such gangs can wreck sufficient havoc in trade hubs regionsc isboxer is automation tool in the sense that he allows to simultaneously order all these alt armys accounts to take a specific actiond do u work for ccp and have some insider infostatistics on that other than that how can u tell currently this is a widespread practice a lot of people create altssalvagers altscouts or small gangs of altscarribers to farm missions quickly and without cooperation with real players for free i dont know about how easly my hypothetical scheme could be pulled though  thats a lot of accs being recycled constantly so may be noticed quickly but it seems like a solid approach to form cheap and easly managed one man suicide gang army so why not rmt has been battled for years still for no avail so there are always some loopholes general public dont knowabout and thats why something should be done about this to make such abusings not viable
alt recycling was a widespread practice but now there is literally no reason to bother doing it because running at 10 is trivially easy couple this with the fact that there has been several highprofile bannings over the practice which leads me to ask do you have insider information if not your argument has no basisisboxer isnt an automation tool because it requires consistant player input a bot requires zero human input your argument has no basisthe reason you never see people solo ganking freighters is because its insanely difficult to run 15 catalysts a machsfi a scan alt an agressor alt  a freighter all at once  pull off flawless freighter ganks go on try it tell us how easy it was for youfreighter ganking has been perfected by us over the course of the last year it took a year to perfect the art but somehow its not sufficiently hard enough to do have you even tried organising your own freighter ganki used to have a saying people in highsec choose to be victims through refusal to implement the counters  mitigating actions available to them some things never change
people have been asking for multiple character training on account for a long time now so this feature was brought in its not intended to be a longterm thing its more for the people that want to train a bunch of cyno alts or something similar trade alt anyone i particularly like the part where you call out a math alaert after having said ccp makes hundreds of thousands if not millions per year a little math would give you a rough estimate of their base income from eve subscriptions so you wouldnt have to make such a silly statement
tldr minigames for carebearsbackgroundi played eve when it first came out in 2003 again in 2008 and again now in the other cases i got bored fairly quickly and im pretty close to that point nowi like the idea of eve i like the cutthroat hyper capitalist scammy pvp based mmo eve is probably the only pvp based mmo of any consequence since ultima online in fact but i dont have the timeinterest to play that kind of mmo for my pvp needs i usually play something with a more structured format with known time commitments like lol or left 4 deadhowever eve is also the only mmo with anything approaching a proper economy that part of the game does definitely interest me and there isnt really anything like it anywhere else but theres no content for industrialistcarebears you can mine but thats boring really mind numbingly boring which would be okay if you could do fun things with the minerals but you bring them back and either sell them immediately a few minutes of fun looking up sale prices or refine them literally a button press and then sell them or build something with them by loading up blueprints and pressing a buttonhigher level mining with a group is possibly less boring but i wouldnt call it fun eitherthe problem is that the whole process from start to finish involves no creative effort or strategic thought beyond finding good prices but it doesnt have to be like that its possible to make the process far more interestingan example of an mmo that has taken a stab at this sort of thing is a tale in the desert some of the high level crafting essentially requires playing minigames where if you win you make the product you expected and if you screw up you lose some amount of raw materials see this youtube video of alloy creation for instanceit reminds me a lot of the probe scanner in eve in factproposalim not actually suggesting this happen specifically but just to give a flavor for what id like to seeimagine something like the probe scanner but instead of a solar system you had a look at some raw veldspar in order to refine veldspar youd need to find a preexisting seed crystal in the ore youd be able to ping the raw veldspar with an ore probe which would return the distances to possible seed crystals from wherever you set the probe but not the vector from the probe to the seed crystal similar to the probe scanner but you can only do one probe at a time and old probes dont move once you manage to triangulate a 100 lock on a crystal you can refine the batch of veldspar in to tritif you had a high refining ability youd get a certain number of starting probes on a batch for free but if you run out you have to burn through some number of ore for each additional one to represent loss of material as you keep shoving probes in to a pile of raw ore or scrap the batch recover what ore is there and start over youd also have a certain fuzziness to your probes readouts based on your refining skill similar to the probing skill and youd only be able to do a certain number of veldspar per batch so the sheer time it takes to go through a large batch of ore would be reflected in the price of trit which is the main reason im saying im not suggesting this specifically as i dont know what sort of effect thisd have on trit prices and through that the rest of the game for all other occupationsperhaps larger batches are possible with better skills perhaps larger batches have higher stakes with fewer seed crystals that are harder to find and more ore cost if you use up your free probes maybe you cant scrap the batch and start over for large enough batch sizes it adds a riskreward element to refining based on material efficiency and player time and the soft skills of playersin short i think it makes something thats just a single boring button press right now in to an actually interesting game mechanic and one thats well suited to the sort of casual player that makes up the carebear population each batch wouldnt take more than a few minutes for an experienced refinerhell you could have people play bejeweled with no anterisk involved at all just connect 4 and turn veldspar into trit itd still be an improvementconclusioni really want to play a carebear industrialist as it fits my time and interest but its just not fun  this is just a direction id like to see ccp put some resources in toalso sorry for the wall of text  i at least proofread it for you guys p
i am a bit sad because i have just discovered that my ideas are not in the list of the 1363 suggestions submitted by players in csm8s reasonable things crowdsourcing initiative and of course not in the list of 99 reasonable things that now need to be votedi guess i should have discovered this thread earlier99 every list in the game should have a filter box seems to match in a way some of the ideas of this thread but what about the smart filters  i thought contacting a csm member months ago was enough to promote my ideas during the csm meetings it seems i was wrongsad sad reality
sad if you actually do believe that we will limit ourselves solely to the 99those are to help us have our top points the ones that the most players have shown an interest in fixingyou wrote to csms before do it again in the next two weeks would be a prime indow of opportunity find out who is active who is willing to liste who is going to iceland or plans on telecommuting to take part even if they arent there in carna or you can give up and feel sad but i dont think that is the right choicemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ill try and put this in a way you cant possibly misunderstandno
malcanis why do you assume i would expect you to take this important issue to ccp i never said that once thankfully you are not the only csm member and that your term is limited especially given the fact i already pointed out you do not seem to even comprehend the stated purpose of a csm that ccp posted and you severely lack any kind of social skills on top of the inability to comprehend the difference between objective and subjective proof apparentlyit is also mildly interesting how other certain posters continue posting and helping to bump the thread even though they already proved as well that they are apparently not able to comprehend that a dystopian sandbox  anarchy the fact that they automatically chose such hatemongering tactics is proof enough for the necessity for morality mechanics ingame every single openpvp mmo has proven this time and again it is no different in eve online either granted there are seedy types within the lore of eve however there is nowhere near the large unregulated scale of anarchy that those few claim exist in the lore i would post links to quotes of that evidence however those posters have proven an inability to concede being wrong so far and insist on pure trolling at this point so i wont bother regardless of the trolls and the egomaniacal malcanis it does not make the issue of exploited bounties magically vanish especially given the fact the number of players that post on these forums are nowhere near the representative consensus of players who play eve online i have been in eve for over ten years now staying the course and playing the same way based on the same ideals and i will be here another 10 years as well doing the same this bounty issue is only a recent problem with the latest expansion so it is not irreparable and certainly not wholly representative of the usual nature of eve based on its short exposure ingame so far
ah the classic everyone hates my idea that proves its good line
in allowing players to place a bounty for whatever reason they wish rather than restricting bounty placement only as a response to a handful of actions ccp made the wise decision to respect the sandbox and interfere with it as little as possiblethis is a good thing sorry if you disagree
i guess this topic will be neverending been out of game for a year and here it still is some say worse than before some say lesswhether suicide ganking frieghters miners whatever is good or bad if ccp ever wanted to make it less attractive a simple mix of rl and sandbox mechanics should do the trick1 the police act like real police offenders are locked up and stolen goods recovered 1 month locked in station training turned off no communication etc2 if podding of gank target involved then execution ie offending characters deleted and that altslot eliminated permanently from account3 extend associated kill rights an additional 2 months after coming out of prison add a decent concord bounty and make the kill rights tradeablerepeat if if ifbefore the tears lynch mobs start if not its gonna happen and we can assume ccp wants it to be part of the game just something to live with there are ways to reduce the risks which ppl dnt always employ  to their peril
if the police acted like real police theyd only turn up 1 time in 10 then thered be a 50 chance theyd just shoot the nearest minmatar and go for donuts
and if these real police were based off the police in my country the criminal would get away scotfree while the victim has to suffer think about what youre asking for
not asking for police from inefficient states rife with corruption most unfortunately but this is a game run by algorithms so police can be programmed with whatever level of error is desiredso difficult to separate rl principle from imagined rl statisticsand pls read  im not asking for this just stating how simple for ccp to attack the issue if they wish
your answers are completely disingenuous irl we have laws purposely limited access to supplies and security organizations that attempt to thwart a shoulder fired missile from ever reaching the hands of a civilian criminal or not in eve highsec is still a war zone where you can buy military equipment at the local convenience store a more apt comparison would be how effectively do the security organizations of washington dc thwart gun related crimes ill give you a hint despite all our laws and regulations despite our tirelessly working police forces criminals regularly access guns they regularly commit crimes with guns and police rarely ever arrive in time to stop gunrelated violence and this analogy still isnt truly appropriate for eve as our gun laws prevent the legal sales of weapons to criminals where it completely 100 allowed to sell military hardware to anyone anywhere in eve finally do you really think it takes so little effort to get a group of ships together and gank a freighter for profit most of those freighter kms listed have 4 month old characters
would be cool
give jukebox back pleasei want to change the music as i please ingame
mynnnai would not expect you to agree with anything that is not anarchistic given either of your history as far as respecting the sandbox goes as i pointed out previously no other mmo has ever been able to sustain profitability by allowing anarchisti
per the related discourse on cloaking over in fi i propose that a delay be added to local in the realms of 30 second to 2 minutes to allow those who hunt minerswtmission runners an actual chance of catching these people before they can log offwarp to posdockleave system the current local channel reporting on those entering a system has long been a complaint of pvpers due to it heavily favouring the unfit or those with heavy static defences a delay of a couple of minutes would balance the power between aggressor and defender greatly through facilitating the use of combat probes without alerting the victim instantly of hostile presence
i cant say this is an ideal solution and it will have strings attached to balance it after the factbut it at least changes the current dynamic to one requiring actual effort and group focus particularly in the part of the game supposedly designed for group effortupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
 post deleted for inadequately thought out opinion 
how about mmm nothe hacking minigame is annoying enough when im trying to get in and out of hostile systems thankfully they changed scanning so you can pretty much instantly scan down verything really evens out the time sink to only take somewhat longer than it used to to scan a relic site and retrieve the goods minigames in toher places would only make the game tedious and boring as mining and industry are for groups of people who want things slow and mathspreadsheet related amjority of indy corps i have friends in dont like minigames in any mmo and were some of the biggest voices against adding lootspew and minigames for mining when it was thought of the first time most of these people would rather be left alone to their spreadsheets and talking with friends over chatif you want minigames with your industry so bad why dotn you open up minesweeper and jsut not allow yourself to refine that trit until youve won does that sound like it would be fun and engaging because it wouldnt and would just remove even mroe people from those professions raising the prices on everything
do you have fun doing industry maybe im just missing something i like spreadsheets and math i think theyre fun but i need more to keep me engaged
then go run missionsthe second me or any of my friends have to play minigames to do our industry is the day we quit eve we play eve for industry and being froced to do something as stupid and monotonous as a  minigame just to do a task you will have to do hundreds of times is a good way to not only  off alot of dedicated industrialists but make many quit the gamemining and industry are aprts of eve enjoyed mostly by people who prefer a more clickclickafk way of playing eve usually because they are either busy with real life and so only have time for things they can do on a second screenwindow without compromising the rest of their work or people who would just more prefer to sit back and talk with friends while playingif you enjoy spreadsheets and math but dont like how boring industry is then do the market industry is good as is besides some minor qualityoflife ui changes to lessen the amount of clicks we have to make instead of increase it with a minigame
unfortunately you need a fair bit of capital to make playing the market take any significant amount of play time its fun sure but it doesnt take more than 15 minutes a day as a new playerpvp is interesting in eve because theres an amount of soft skill to it if youre clever about it your skills hardly matter but theres nothing in industry that requires player skill beyond finding good prices which i think is a shameif the existing player base likes the current state of affairs thats great but i probably wont play much and i know a few friends irl that feel the same way eve is boring was the common refrain when i started playing at lunch in the office
if their general opinion is eve is boring minigames wont fix that and thats soemthying you gotta realizeccp thought adding minigames to scanning would make it more engaging but it didnt it just added a clickfest to yet another part of the game that a majority of the playerbase find monotonous which has actually turned away many from exploring because they find its interesting the first 4 or 5 times but quickly becomes extremely repetitive and boringminigames are never the answer to providing engagement only way to add engagement to industry would be to add customization ala galactic civilizations or endless space style ship construction but the permutations on ship builds that would result from that would stress the server too far adn eventually end up with one single optimal build fro each ship anyways
youre fixating on the minigames aspect and i think youre missing the forest for the treesmy point fundamentally is not just that industry is boring but that its boring and theres no room for creative expression or strategic thinking theres no room for player skill which is a fundamental asymmetry from pvp contenti want to get in a flow while im building wealth and theres no way to do that for flow you need an activity thats fun takes skill and requires some non trivial time input its hard to flow in a single hand of poker for instance i flow playing minecraft league of legends go starcraft skyrim xcom simcity civ 4 and a whole host of other games i dont flow playing evei choose to use minigame to mean add some element of riskreward for player skill by that definition manually modifying your approach vector to spiral in to an enemy ship keeping your transverse high is a minigame choosing different ammo types after you break an enemy ships shields is a minigame but i dont think anyone would argue that making approach spirals automatic or automatically shooting the optimal ammo type would make pvp betteralso i actually really like how the combat scanner works i think its interesting i could see how itd be annoying when you just want to find someone to gank but playing around with the scanner is the closest ive come to flow in eveother issues aside im not sure i see how thatd help from an industrialists standpoint arent they still just building modules that players combine to produce ship hulls
 in fleet window i want to see what ship each player is in maybe some other info like  location or just the info docked with no ship showing if the player is docked create a visual difference between npc corps logo and player corp logo as a noo
ragnarok online has been letting you create your own guild emblem since before eve was even released dont see why it would be technically hard to do
well to be fair your posting and attitude towards others leaves a lot to be desired im surprised your bounty isnt far higher tbh and what they have done is a perfectly valid use of the  if you could actually point out the abuse not based on what you think is a good or bad reason to use it then go aheadbut im sure as always your argument will boil down to this you wanting to decide what is and isnt a good reason for a bounty in a sandbox game that isnt going to happen but thanks for postingoh and bump destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yeah like the way that you were super objective about the fact of snowden and manning being punished for mere wordsyoure literally the king of subjective opinion
this is an excellent use not abuse of the  perfectly mirrored in the real world as if that mattersor are you going to claim thats a subjective opinion too
i have deleted some pointless bickering from this thread
it has even been suggested to add a bounty button to the forums by the previous csm chairman no less
it is not a claim it is a fact that you obviously do not understand what a subjective opinion is simply put you are stating that persecuting a player for posting an opinion is in line with ccps objective for the  which is false that is because an opinion is not an action and therefore not in line with ccps own statement on the purpose of the nowhere in the definition of the word action does it state that an opinion is an action which is what i am being persecuted for which by the way is illegal in most countries if you want to make false claims that persecution in the real world for an opinion based on existing laws and freedoms is somehow in itself illegal is absurd to say the leastas far as the continued threats go on about adding bounties go those only further prove my stance that the system is being exploited based on the facts not opinion just as i keep having to bring up ccp themselves said that one of the purposes of the change in the was to build upon the theme of the expansion of strengthening ties between actions and consequences including making the company you keep a factor in that
please prove that giving someone a bounty for something they typed is persecuting a player if the act of typing a comment on either the forums or in game is not an action then what is even your american english link states its boththe fact or process of doing something typically to achieve an aimanda thing done an actsounds like typing to me and in eve actions have consequences destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
not its truebut only if you go by things that ccp devs actually say which according to you carries no weight
ahh the good ol we build your ships argument what i think these people fail to realise is that for example i am a pvper and i have industrial alts you may be surprised how many of those people who build things are pvpers in maskshahahaha brilliantand now we have argument by semantic never once have i seen this win as it usually means all other attempts at wheedling the point lostpersonally i think if you insult someone either verbally straight out or by acting as if there opinion is wrong then they should be able to exercise a little revenge ccp we need a forum bounty button now
there is only one appropriate way to respond to anyone complaining about the im sure you all know what it is
the bountry system is horrible and putting bounties on people is horrible illegal abuse as you will all find when i consult a real grown up lawyer who will in no way laugh so hard that he actually throws up a little and has to skip lunchwaits patiently
hey malcanis about putting the add bounty button next to the like button on the forums
it was a good idea with ccp punkturis suggested it and its a good idea now
1and heck yeah i know i will get isk on me too but it wont be the first timeupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
it was but i dont trust the forums and wouldnt use it for that reason destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
lol as soon as the was put in place my ceo bountied every member of the corp in our group its a badge of honor one of our directors put a bounty on an excorpmate just for grins when said excorpmate announced he was off to join fw our director however hit the 0 key a few too many times guess he was used to paying millions on market for the highisk deadspace stuff he was fitting his t3s with anyway our guy went off to join fw with a 500m bounty instead of the 500k intended as far as i know he still has most of that bounty on him good times
our ceo put 50 mil on each of us and told us to go lose it within a weekthat was a hectic week of roaming but it was a good way of making sure you became immune to loss
ahh so we now have figures from you but you said the following in your op then saidso you said 5 million per catalyst but then gave us a fit without rigs costing 1097you said 850 dps per catalyst but your fit only does 5807 overloaded level 5 skills playeri think your going to have to rethink your figuresoh and there is skill logic and effort that goes into these ganks but you not knowing this doesnt surprise me in the slightest and player verses player is pvp just what do you think pvp is an acronym fordestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
no the problem is definetly with you you even dont think about relicdata hunting as about thrilling adventure chasing you just view it like an easy source of isks you can farm probably for something more of interest to you you would probably be totally satisfied with a golden dialog window with a singe huge button get isks now without really playing this part of game but many in fact find fun in exploration and challenges it s bringing about like the thrill the exitment the joy of overcoming the challenge and finding something of real value and this is why i hate new scanning system  its so casual that doesnt even offer a room for excelling there is no means for mastering it and i would strongly object any proposals for simplifyingremoving the hacking minigame it should become even more complex and random but with far more rewarding outcome if succeded and i like topicstarters way of thinking though i havent got enough expirience in this part of the game and dont want to jump to conclusions there are people more involved than i and with your way of thinking you probably shoud resort to plex donations thats exactly what you want  you press a couple of buttons and soon get a valubale item in your cargo you can sell for lump sum on market no need for some boring games at all
the part of exploration i always enjoyed was going into a hostile system doding the locals as i scanned down the sites then getting in grabbing the loot bouncing between celestials and coming back onto grid fo a bubbled gate with 3 guys landing behind me and barely escaping with the 200 mil i may ro may not have been able to score off the cansnow its enter local if theres reds  forget scanning because by the time i can even finish the hacking minigame theya re ongrid killing me you cant be in dangerous sapce postodyssey because it forces you to be vulnerable for far too long not saying on some higherlevel sights i havent tried for it anyway and still gotten out but thats only because the other guys had horrible scanning skills and so couldnt get the sight anything common gets probed down so quick i might aswell be afk next to their stationi like exploration basically for the interaction with other players now with postodyssey that interaction becomes something to avoid because of how long the site takes
you are just mixing absolutely different things together the problem not in exploration mechanics the problem is that you cant stand taking risks and making some efforts to mitigate them what life in nullsecs is all about and i know people playing eve for 23 month who successfully explore and gain substentional profit from relicsdata in nulls they do it on trash ships like heron they die often but still they manage to lift enormous sum of money for newbie you are for some reason believe that exploring mechanics should help you to overcome them in hursh environment of nulls while thats you who have to overcome all these additional challenges you can do it the hard way like you are doing it currently and live with the consequences and risks associatedand many are enjoying it this way or you can probably think how to become not redneutral for those who are shooting at you the point of view that somebody should just help you to gain lucrative summs of money in nulls contradicts with itsnulls basic principle additional risks are rewarded with additional profit this is not the game which will babysit the player and definitely not in nullsecs and this is exactly the reason why most of these people play it
one more bump to try and gain some steam otherwise letting go 
basically i think it would be nice if when you press the logout button the window wouldnt close so you wouldnt have to relog all it would need to do is go back to your character select screen must like other mmos
you can allign your ship to some stellar bodybookmark and even maintain speed needed for instawarp to it but when the time comes you still need to do right mouse click for context menu then choose the action from the list  and all this in critical combat situation thats simply intolerable i know about sclick hotkey but its still too complex and cumbersome and prone to missclicking what really is need is a single keystroke warp ability without any mouse movementswhich is potentionally more inaccurate then keyboard stroking here how i see this implemented1 player right clicking or use a new hotkey for this action the objectbookmark and choose new option set as default warp destinationwith ability to specify offset distance as usual like 5102030etc km2 he then alligns his ship to this destination as before and optionally maintain its speed3 when time comes he just use one simple key combintation only keyboard mouse not needed to send his ship warping to predefined location
theres a shortcut key already for warpingyou could also use the radial menu or the navigation windowmajig
ive wrote quite a detailed explanation conveying strict requirments of proposed feature why stating the obvious facts ive already mentioned radial menu prone to misclicking in stressed conditions you cant use it as fast a typing a single key shortcut which is combination of mouse move and click with key pressed sic even worse in such a situation all these arent even close to efficiency of single key stroke this feature im asking for is an emergency safeguard which imidiately and 100 guarantee will send your ship to predetermined and easy to set safespot with single and quick move of one hand in fact one finger mouse not involved if you are already aligned and moving at least 34 of your normal speed of course so its like normal warping from any point except for it can be initiated with one key pressed
i dont see how that can proof something if he has to and ccp still dont want to reveal the change in course of development he will do all this humilating stuff as this is needed by his employer
ha i wish i had been culturally aware enough to even make that reference at the time
but dont forget the donate isk button
ive removed some more trolling from this thread
as long as they make it look identical to the place bounty button and have them side by sideoh and occasionally switch their postitions
the assembly hall section is there to encourage debate of the issues being presented ccp eterne there is nothing encouraging for any kind of debate here when players are spamming condescending remarks and blatantly trying to harass my character ingame via the  as far as placing bounties on someone being any kind of badge of respect is complete nonsense i highly doubt those who continue to waste isk by adding bounties on my character ingame are trying to show respect for my opinion here is the official statement by ccp last year on player harassment after the fanfest i want to reassure you that ccp in no way condones the harassment of players ccp public relations and social media specialist ned coker
and as yet youve still not shown how placing a bounty on someone is harassment trying to include obvious harassment that actually broke the eula last year is not helping your case one jotso once again please prove that placing a bounty on someone because you disagreed with with something they said on the forum or in a chat room is harassmentbut you wont because you cant and im so appalled at this fact i upped your bountydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
wait because a number by your name increases you think thats harassmentor is it because people who were going to kill you anyway now get a small reward to do sono wait maybe its the wanted sign everyone should feel wanted though so it cant be thatim stumped
the only thing i could think of where i would be ok with this is plex for skill removalnot reimbursement or any of that abuseable rubbishstraight off aurum for skillpoints gone from your sheet either from the point of view of the ocd people out there who no longer want mining foreman 3 or from pvpers who want to bring their clone costs downanything else no no noi have spoken
i love this idea it will make tasks such as fitting 200 suicide ganking catalysts require so much less effort
yeah i actually find that fitting ships is the rate determining step for losing themif i could fit them faster i could lose them much faster1 for me
i think he must mean damage to rmters right thats the only valid thing i can think of only an idiot would think plex is bad noone in these forums are idiots are they
plex makes eve a mix of sub based and f2p thats very unique in the industry and you could argue that it works perfectly in eve and its economynot to mention that i dont think that plex changes anything on the perceived value of isk on the contrary i think if somebody loses a t3 bought via plex could rage quit faster than somebody who did some trading or pve to get the isk for the ship
my arguement is tehir is a difference between mitigating risks and oops someone decided to start scanning your site down guess you have to drop hacking and let the wreck blow up with all the loot in itmy problem is with the loot spew and hacking minigame it takes forever and has absolute consequences if you are interupted for any reasonas for living with risks i spent a year in highend wormholes i dont have a problem with dodging locals and ninjalooting things its when the mere appearance of a threat causes me to permanently lose any chance of actually getting the loot because it blows up that pisses me off
my only problem then is warpins you absically say that whatever group of miners warps in first owns the belt at elast with many small belts you can choose to go somewhere else if you just had 2 massive belts to replace 20 belts soem systems have then you are forced to either mine in a different system often forcing you to haul ore much farther to your main system or fly for half an hour in a barge to try and get to an unmined section of the belt granted often you could use bm for this but since mining is heavily populated by noobs who dotn know hwo to do this aswell as the number of bookmarks people would then have to maintain for all the belts this could become annoying very quickly
this sint other mmos this is eve htfubut in all seriousness this is something people have been asking about for years but it has to do with the way the game was coded and how the client works which means changing that is an awful lot of development work to save player 30 seconds of work for the few that have characters they need to play on the same account as another hint most eve players maintain multiple accounts so they can use those characters simultaneously rather than one at a time
bumpso frustrating that this was taken out
please bring this backthis is very annoying
among us pvpers getting a bounty is a form of respect we literally jump for joy and giggle at the thought that someone either likes or dislikes us enough to put cold hard cash on our heads im totally not kidding about this either my ceo got a billion isk bounty on his head once and everyone in corp kept recharging it when it got too low stop reading so much in to the fluff descriptions on what the is on the expansion portals its almost pure marketing bs they only thing that ever matters as far as mechanics go are the dev blogs and devgm posts on the forums both of which clearly state that they designed the to be as open as possible because good and bad are relative to the values of each playeralso i will add more to your bounty tonight because the thought of your posting in this thread distracts me while im pvping and i lose ships and i dont like it
im okay with this providing that the use of u instead of you as well as other gems such as 2 for to c for see and the like come with either a suspect flag or a security status hit it is for the use of these that ive placed about 90 percent of my bounties and i must be allowed to continue to bounty for these crimes
your comparing note an action of your bounty ingame to mittanis drunken and rather inexcusable action offends me deeply to express my displeasure at your action i have increased your bountysee action  bounty straight forward enough eh
once again you provide a classic counterexample to your own positition by providing a game relevent example where someone was punished persecuted if you will for no other action than speaking some wordsso either you believe that mittanis punishment was not justified or you believe that people should be able to put a bounty on other players for what theyve saidwhich is it
i begin to wonder especially in the light of all the obvious argument inconsistencies pointed out by malcanis et al if this is galdors secret plan to get the highest bounty
im starting to believe that hes actually a tom gerard style reverse troll out to ruin the proposal he pretends to supportif so well played good sir well played indeed
along the same lines as the bounty exploit and abuse pointed out in this thread i want to add a complaint and demand ccp fix the issue with likes in the eve online forums there are obviously people posting in these threads that wantonly and with cruel disregard to actual post content click the like button on any and all posts they read this must stop im feeling very harassed by the whole thing as i watch the likes ive personally received approach the 200 marksomething has got to be done people are likeing posts for invalid reasons i think its highly likely that some of these abusing harassers may actually click like on this post please ccp stop the madness
amen brother 1 from medestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
what if all likes cost the clicking pilot 1000 isk which was immediately placed as a bounty on the character posting the message in questionupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
mynnnai would not expect a person who cannot use proper capitalization of a name to understand the definition of the word action it is unfortunate how everyone ignored the fact that ccp eterne quote about this forum section being intended to be used
we were debating it but you chose to stick your fingers in your ears and shout lalalalalala what is the point in debating with someone who refuses to listen or understand what a sandbox is or what the word action meansyou mean the action of typing in a chat room or on the forum which can have the consequence of receiving a bounty that action oh i think mynnna knows exactly what it means unlike yourselfironydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this is an absolute lie also cloaking is fineon the subject of jita spamming and such it does make sense to crack down on the bots if theyre not humans manually spamming the stupid contracts they should be booted to reduce the congestion
its quite easy to get around the gaming the system  a skill point remap refunds only points on your base start up stats that means if you were training for a year with 5s and say you had 25 perception 24 willpower you would be refunded the years worth of skill points based on your base stats completely ignoring the 5s and the attributes points that can be allocatedsure you might end up losing 50 or more of the skillpoints but who cares i would only support this reallocation though when ccp makes very large changes to the game that make that skill you trained for uselessand please dont tell me its not useless i havent fired a torpedo or missile since the missile nerf and never plan to that s what 7 years i specialize and never do flavor of the month same as the shield compensation skills i have all trained up nowi could go on for a while lots of wasted skill points that will never have a use also i agree there should be consequences for your choices however those consequences should not extend to ccps unforeseen and arbitrary changes to core game mechanics
i currently find it annoying when at certian angles from the sun it is impossible to read the names of places i cannot find and option to have the writing turn black whilt over bright objects i imagine many people have the same issue but i work in securty and when a bright or light colour object passes the screens font it turns from black to white plz make ccp sort this out
so i was thinking about the vigil the other night as i often do and i wondered what the harm was in that proud ship being the fastest t1 frigate who was the vigil hurting so badly that other t1 frigs needed to be able to chase it down i dont know how the usage numbers for the vigil have changed in general since the ewar frig patch as well in relation to the other ewar frigs but at this point id honestly be less shocked to see a guardian vexor undock than a vigil if anyone uses them they dont do it near menow usage rates will have a bit to do with target painting not being as sexy as other ewar options in that it doesnt protect itself like the others and theres a hard and low cap in how many are useful in a fleet but that doesnt mean you cant give us speed as a reason to use the ship i cant have been the only person to fit a gisti mwd on this thing to so i could permarun it and use it for all manner of bookmark making i cant be the only person who wants to fly a vigil when im carrying small stuff through dangerous areas with the cloak  mwd trick why should i use a slasher for these things the slasher looks like ass the vigil looks freaking sweet i promise you there wont be any complaints about vigils wrecking shop if you adjust the base speed to that which was achieved with the minmitar frig v bonus and then add another meter per second for good measure because youre all intelligent and attractive people what you may see however is a few vigils undocking every once in a while
that someone in this case was 14 years old at the time and is now in his early twenties im almost twice his current age  but i can tell you i dont think someone should suffer the consequences of their actions for something as simple as a name they picked when they were going through puberty if someone has been loyal enough of a fan to a game company to keep playing after nearly a decade allowing them to change their hardearned characters name to something they like better is a small bone to throw i may change a toon name if it is allowed or i may not i dont have any names im unhappy with which were picked 6 years ago but even still i am very much in favor of this idea and jint just as you dont care if people are offended by your choice to be against name changes i dont care if you have to overcome a minor inconvenience while mining if it is implemented
i support this 100 i would love to change the name on this character my character name sometimes even causes me problems in the game my name is also the name of a cosmos npc and normally that would break the eula but ccp says otherwisei bought this character years ago because i knew with a little work i could make it a great pvp toon now that i have made the character my own why cant i name it as my own
apparently these forums are officially useless and the assembly hall is a joke it is also apparent that with the new changes anyone who has an honest opinion is only a target here for egomaniacal children with god complexes which is unfortunate for eve and the writers who took the time to develop the novels and game environment that has nothing to do with the anarchistic mentality that those here on the forums are intent on trying to establish ingame what this means for me is that i am washing my hands of this farce of an assembly hall forum that clearly has no intentions of an intelligent debate unless it suits the hatemongering bigots that infect this game this does not mean however that i will give up playing eve after 10 years of investing time in it despite the bullying tactics of my current bounty on a final note the name should be changed to something more fitting because a bounty infers justice and hunting down a person based on an opinion that did no harm to anyone or anything is anything but justified instead the would be better off being called a hit list
underlined and bolded the errora bounty represents an interest in the capture or execution of a targetfrequently associated with forces recognized as governments or individuals wielding comparable power and control bounties are more like formal shopping listsduring wars it is common practice for high value targets on all sides to have prices on their headschanging the name of a bounty is semantics the meaning stays the sameand as poets say a rose by any other namethats why police and bounty hunters are not considered the same thing police only cooperate with them when an issue of mutual benefit is present such as law enforcementa bounty hunter who works outside the law is called a hit man they use the same logic get the targetthey simply dont have the same tools availablea bounty hunter is a mercenary with a specific target in mind nothing moreand whether you call someone a warhero or a war criminal really depends more on your point of view than any action they committedupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
supported except the skills part i just want refining arrays to not suck
the easiest way to make them not suck is to remove the 75 cap on refining and apply the same skillbased refining formula that is applied to npc stations and outpostsaside from that the other changes just make them more convienent if it takes me 3 hours to refine 200k m3 worth of one type of ore people still wont use them as most decent mining fleets can drag in 200k m3 worth of ore in a few minutes my fleet ops can do it in about 10 minutes or lessupdating the op with some thoughts from the wh threadrequoted some herehrolt ceo live free die proud
actually the refinery arrays do take skill into account saw a low skilled character attempt to use a intense refinery array in a wh and get less than the 75 cap we just want the cap raised even if only to 95  would make mining in wormhole more like the 00 mining value it is suppose to be without having to invest in a rorquel
i wil say olnly one thing ccp dont even think about this please
i have been playing eve for 5 yearsi have never seen a change in price for the bounties on npc rats in asteroid beltsi am not 100 sure if they have been stagnant on anomolies dead space and missionsi am getting the same price i was paid 5 years ago for killing the same npc ratsplex prices are at an all time high 500m  yet bounties are the same pricewhen will bounties go up in 10 years time 20 years timeif there is no intention for the bounties to go up in value why not
why its not hard to rat up isk
pretty much this its stupid easy to make isk in eve which is why plex is around 500mil from 250mil 23 years ago and we dont need to increase an isk faucet see a mechanic that introduces more isk into the economy as we already have too many
bump
i dont feel there are enough ways to lose my hard earned isk i would like to see a casinotype station or two out in lowsec where there would be an option for capsuleers to play poker or whatver maybe bet on pvp fights in an arena style station no ogbs ect i know there are some websites that you can play this kinda stuff on but id like to see it incorporated in game thanks
a few others have championed this in the past often tied in with a nice place to put avatars and walking in stationscue howls of incarna hatersm
yes i was pretty sure i wasnt the first one to think of it tbh walking in stations doesnt interest me but playin a few rounds of poker while i wait that horrible one more hour for the skill im training to finish up does just trying to do my part to expand the game content im really surprised that ccp hasnt done this of their own volition just think of the plex sales they would make
i say we let them gank to their hearts content but there are consequencesnot only should they loose their sec status but loose faction status to who owns the systemstations should not let them dock if its bad enough or pay a penaltyexampleyour ship will be towed into statio wait youve been a bad boy you must pay a fine of xyz iska ganker tax should be implemented so as their standings get worse they pay more for market and contract itemsif you really wanted to cover it how about thisconcord special victims unit
i could definately support this but highsec needs to be nerfed to balance it outnerf highsec
bump for option b
ive moved my corp 3 times since 2009 and i subscribe three accounts so i can triboxwhen i move and haul some 400 bpos to a new station it takes me no less than six hours of mouse clicking to lock them all down and then then next reset i find out my votes didnt take and i have half my bpos still unlockedwhile there may some really off the wall argument that the game mechanics favor the fact that you cant select multiple bpos to lock them down  at least you can fix the damn stupid voting uiso here i am with 400 votes to cast after having to select each individual bpo to propose a lock down  btw thats 4 mouse clicks each and mouse motion to get the right buttonand i get this list were i first have to expand a vote to find the button to vote yes  and then the damned vote collapses  so i have to expand multiple votes to find a vote i havent clicked because with hundreds of bpos you tend to lose your place when all votes look alikei know there have been posts on this before and i did try looking for the old threads but hell with it  why isnt it fixed yetits been this way for years
problem going around 00 and having to deal with 100s of bubbles which dont expire are there for days get abandoned and are just time consuming and space junkproposal limit the amount of bubbles you can have on grid to a maximum of five as well as introducing a expiry timer on these bubbles so after a specific amount of time they expire and then explode therefore solving all problemsi believe this is beneficial to both pvpers and industrials
i believe bubbles are an excellent deterrent against space invaders however i do agree we need some sort of limits on the amount of bubbles why not implement some sort of structure to be space constructed and add on system cpupowergrid requirements onto bubbles so this could possibly limit the amount per system eh eh
this may list a repeat of things listed previously but i dont post often and want to clear my headname changewe live in space in the future with warp drives cloaks instant travel over large sections of space why cant we change our name i think many of us including myself came from other mmos where spaces in names for example where unheard of i chose this crappy name drunk charge aurim for it alot of people probably still have a cache of 5500 aurim from ccp handouts charge 12 a plex of aurim and place a cooldown on doing it again list your old names in a new tab in character info so people can see whom you where once called as such records would still existfitting tooli love eft and pyfa i use them alot but why do i have to tab out of the game to do something that should easily be available living in nullsec it would help tons to beable to see whats available on the non jitatrade hub market and see if the ship fits together at all with whats at handeve gate killboardwith updated killloss log in your character sheet why cant we have a proper inhouse killboard with settings to make it public private corpalliance viewable or viewable by standings it would also fix the issue killboards like evekill or battleclinic have where if the person who earns the killmail doesnt post it or have an api set up for those sites ingame kill log could stay as is but evegate kill board could pull all kills and losses you have even if you didnt earn the killing blowpreset display settingswhen in big fleets i have to turn down everything gfx wise so i dont have to put up with both low framerate and lagtidi allow us to save several set gfxaudio settings for when ppl are in big fleets or running around in small gangs eve is a beautiful game but i cant have pretty when im doing warfare but i can when in small gangsearning iskguess thats all for right now
you can move to low sec or null secyou dont have to worry about these things in null sec
if people can prevent concord blowing up their ship then it means that they can gank anyone in high sec for free now you are profitable to gank if the value of your drop exceeds the cost of their ammowhich means that its profitable to gank almost everyone
ore type belts to replace ice beltshow about removing the ore sites from every ship scanner except mining shipslet them be probed out like previous
a returned player is missing his jukebox
lmao
i could only agree with your proposal if hidden belts were indeed hidden again requiring all ore prospecting belts to be scanned down
in null the current system is a massive giveaway to those hunting pve pilots right up to the point where they cant stop the pve pilot from leaving before they ever load grid on themno need to scan for hidden belts point click warpa pve pilot worthy of being called a miner has no trouble scanning these down especially in their own sov systemsseriously in order for pilots to compete with each other they need to make an effort if the game hands everyone the same intel the same results will be repeatedstalemates and zero progressits like a scout taking credit from the sidelines when your team scores you bet i would have provided exactly that intel and our team would have done the same great jobupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i cant agree to this it would provide the hunter an unfair advantage over the prey remember they are not looking to fight even if you and i are
you assume an awful lot with thatthe prey as you call them are in their own space where having and maintaining an intel channel takes very little effortthese same prey at this time can completely avoid any and all hunters simply by watching local and staying alignedsee non blue appear in local hit warp you are in warp before the would be hunter finishes loading the systemwhat can the hunter do to block this escapenothingonly through pilot error on the part of the prey does the hunter even get an opportunity to threatento the prey with this ability to avoid pvp completely the hunter is no more than an annoying interruption to their pve playupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
so in essence you want to be able to warp into a system that your scout has found someone mining in cloaked and sitting on top of them so then you can fleet warp to the scout and have the miner scrammed and dps proceeding before he even knows someone else is in systemlook man i agree with you its annoying i hunt these guys too but that is not at all fair to them im also not assuming anything your not like that they are in their home system with an intel channel set up and scouts on gate to be able to provide inteland if this were implemented what would a simple miner have as a counter dscan wont really work because it only works out to a certain range he would be able to see your combat probes only in the event you needed to find him somewhere not listed in the probe scannerhow exactly would this not be tipping the scales in your favoryou could always go hunting in wh space
whoa whoa whoayour example pve pilot is already operating with a known hostile in systemat what point did they stop being responsible for their own safetywhen did they no longer need to fit for defense hereyour example prey needs to fly aligned to a non beaconed safe spot it might be a good idea to fit a few stabswant to loot that npc wreck tractor beam or salvage dronesat no point does a pilot have the backing of logic to ignore potential threats especially not in nullthe venture is great to mine in it has built in 2 warp strength a low signature and it aligns fastmany ratting ships can fit stabs and those rats will fly right up to youtractor beam the wrecks its a beautiful thingbm a safe spot to warp to and use it unless they read your mind they really cant bubble a random point in space that only you know aboutnull is supposed to be better rewards in exchange for greater risk but risk has to exist firstupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
not at all if i were doing it i would fly my scout in check the belts one at a time and warp the scout back out before the local timer expired it would take a few times to get the belts without more people scouting but still mr pve is unawares anyone is thereim not defending the pve guy im certainly not advocating he not fit for defense im also certainly advocating they shouldnt be restricted to flying a venture to be safe lmaonull has plenty of risks getting in for one i usually fly in lowsec but last weekend made the mistake of jumping my exploration ship into null and into a overlapping grid of interdiction spheres you can imagine the rest i will never say that the game should be a norisk but i dont think a change to local would do anything other than give guys like us an undue advantage
the time can be delayed certainly without giving one side or the other a major advantagewhy should a pve pilot in a system not shielded well enough by a blue donut to block hostiles not always fly defensivelykeep in mind as the current system standsno single pve pilot ever was killed in their home system except through pilot errorthey either made a mistake about another pilot being active and undocked in an unprepared shiporthey failed to prepare by aligning to a safe spot and hitting warp when the hostile enters the systemall the cloaked pilot ever did was take advantage of an opportunity one handed to them by a mistake on a silver platterthat effectively is consensual pvp they have a default action that gives them freedom from attack 100 effective when used correctlyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
the trick is to find a balance between the hunters and hunted 30 seconds is way to much time advantage for the hunters i think 10 s is a reasonable amount or alternatively you dont appear in local until you break gate cloak 1 min max both of these would help balance the field but a ratter can always rat aligned always warp in at a distance and even use intel channels this means the ratter sill has a major advantage to avoiding hunters really though ratters should be more accepting of losing their ships with the rewards for ratting in nullsec increased enough that even with regular ship losses it is more profitable than running missions in highsec then you can make hunting ratters a bit more balanced without eliminating the herd
how about they implement changes for concord to pod people below a certain sec status
how about concord start charging realistic services for their fees this subsidised state monopoly distorts the economy and stifles opportunity in the free market by denying hard working private enterprises the chance to compete for protection contractsend this socialist oppression
only if they can keep the real criminals out of empirehow can they let a 10 standing player into a 10 system
the ability to attack members of your own corp is a very powerful right the newest member can attack anyone he chooses and there are no controls on this ability with the increasing frequency of awoxing this ability is now very dangerous people joining a corp should earn the right to engage corp members not get it as a basic function of being in the corpproposal  make the ability to freely engage a corp member a corp role that can be assigned as is or attached to a title this would require a few extra colour tags or background colours so that people can tell the difference between a corpie that can be engaged and one that cant reasoning the ability to attack other corp members is a powerful ability it is also being exploited mercilessly by people who have a low moral code this means that in order for a corp to protect themselves they must have recruitment procedures which are very elaborate and verges on paranoid this turns off a lot of new players and draws out the recruitment process considerably it is now not safe to recruit someone without a full api background check and killboard check that still doesnt protect you fully if we make the ability a corp role then awoxers would have to work much harder to do what they do they wont automagically be allowed to attack anyone in the corp this gives the ceo and directors a chance to actually get to know someone before deciding to trust them
or rather than by default being mechanically granted protection from allowing bad apples into your corp you could make the effort yourself to screen out the bad applesshocking idea i know
so after you get to trust someone you then grant them roles to attack corp mates whatseems that the better idea is not to accept applications from everyone that appliesdid you get safarid by psychotic monk
i hate to use a realworld analogy while talking about a video game but can you give an example of how a real corporation would be able to limit roles to a person performing some form of corporate espionageno i thought soeve is a sandbox where were given the opportunity to be about as dark and dirty as we want to be unless youve got a way to show how a real world corporation would be able to effectively do the same and how the idea would not ruin the sandbox aspect of the game i can only suggest going back to some hardcore twink raiding
there is a control against awoxing its called blowing him up
awoxing has a lot of value in eve and your suggestion pretty much eliminates it why would you do such a thing good recruitment practices already eliminate most awox incidents
i can see where youre going with this but a little known important side effect you would crush is awoxinoh wait i see what you did theretricksy you
the thing is if bounties go up then everyones income goes up this means that everyones buying power  isk goes down which means eventually it levels out that 1 hour of ratting buys you exactly what it did beforethis also works for people askingmake my mining lasers mine moremake sites give more lootgive us all free isk
im pretty sure bounties were modified in dominion when pirate infrastructure upgrades enabled infinitely respawning anomalies i thought they have been modified since then too on one level the rewards for isk making in nullsec should be balanced with the risk of a standard ship fielded there the last two years have seen a significant increase in the build costs of ships and so it is appropriate to increase the rewards in nullsec to maintain the risk vs reward paradigm at the same time more isk for bounties doesnt truly solve the issue we need more things like revamped ores which we just got and the like which keeps nullsec isk earning potential high more bounties on npcs in nullsec  alright but id like more scramming frigs and possibly cruisers  bss too
anchored spacejunk cans bubbles are cleaned up via a script at startup if it hasnt been touched within x amount of days i cant remember the time amountyou can always petition bubble spam if its congesting a system as causing lag with anchorables is a petitionable offense
if the bubbles offend you so much maybe you could try shooting them

first off the removal time limit of bubbles is very very long ive come back to a region i left 6 months before and found my bubble farms safe spots where i leave bubbles to quickly grab and replace the ones that get blown up completely intact and untouched next limits on the number of bubbles in system would be awkward when people like myself put up a bubble farm in the middle of space which would then result in no bubbles being allowed on gates because too many were deployed else where a limit to bubbles on grid would be the best way to limit the 100s of bubles on grid type of situation however this is completely unnecessary even if the enemy puts 200 bubbles warping a gate grid so thoroughly you would have to travel 200 kms to get out of the bubbles there are several options already available to you interdiction nullified t3s can simply warp in and out as if they arent there blow up the 13 bubbles that inhibit you from immediately warping a talos can make quick work of even a large t2 bubble which costs 24m isk and a bunch of their time to setup if you do it right they may not even notice the hole in the grid that allows you to immediately warp out when gate spawning bubbles can be annoying but they are an amazing tactical tool that i really dont want to see nerfed
ccp is one of the few only game publishers that have for years embraced and supported thirdparty tools and robust community sites and its paid off tremendously for them the api allows thirdparty developers to create innovative and helpful tools for the player base for the very small cost to ccp of maintaining an api you the player have your choice of killboards skill managers and loadout tools have you looked at the fansite list there are dozens of insanely fun and powerful sites that support eve online  all enabled by ccps apithese tools and sites support and help drive eves growth over the years theres no way to accurately count this but consider battleclinic serves 19 million hits a month and 45000 people visit the site daily on average we estimate that evemon has been installed 25 million times i imagine other popular tools like dotlan maps and eveboard can boast similar stats now heres why these numbers are meaningful at least a few times a week and typically more often a player will make a post on bc or a note from our contact page or a tweet or whatever stating theyre subscribing  converting to paid  coming back after hiatus why because evemon helped lower the initial learning curve or got hooked on climbing the killboard rankings or got the help they needed on a loadout that kept them playing instead of ragequitting in frustration or mucked about in eft and got excited to fly a new ship and this list of course is endless multiply these sentiments by all of the people who did the same thing but didnt post about it i argue its hundreds perhaps even thousands every month that subscribe or come back to eve because of the community sites and toolsyou could argue many of my examples above could be just as easily served by an inhouse app but economically why would that make sense for ccp it would cost money to develop  costs that are currently being borne by the community it would put the burden of updating and introducing new functionality on ccp which increases costs it would eliminate choices for the player and stifle innovation ccp devs dont operate in a vacuum they watch the community sites and take away feedback and new ideas it would frustrate players because ccp cant just add features and try them outthey would have to put new features through an entire development process probably scrum meaning as good as ccp is they just wouldnt be able to react as quickly to the communitys ideas or desires it would impact livelihoods some community operators derive decent income from their sites and most i know reinvest that income back into the site it would impact eves seo which drives player acquisition and retention it would undercut eve by giving rise to cursedotcom sites that hack the client for their functionality a few years ago ccp toyed with the idea of a licensing agreement where community publishers could sell works derived from the eve ip at one of the meetings during fanfest i croaked my support i had lost my voice talking to players at the battleclinic booth i argued that this would be a great idea because it would add economic incentive for community developers to make the eve ecosystem even richer  but that it needed strong oversight i volunteered to start or sit on a steering committee but the idea seems to have gone the way of walkinginstations so my friend if anything and ive argued this for years the tiny cost of maintaining an api has yielded unquantifiable innovation which drives subscriptions and retention that seems like good roi to me left undiscussed in my reply your argument for eft evehq pyfa etc to be integrated into the client is counterproductive to ccps business model they want you to spend time in the game improves subscription revenue and they want you to sink isk experimenting improves etc to plex sales there i said it a private killboard is worthless just put a mirror over your monitor if you want to admire yourself
yup you
dust should have been for pc too which would  increase dust players even more id love to play dust but i am not gonna buy an inferior platform to do it
would prefer about 13 of the way along the spectrum between the current situation and gainaxing
i have more of a problem with new characters being created every day and taking up new pilot names than them spamming a local channel use amarr or rens or somewhere
this very much sounds like youre butthurt because you cant prey on unsuspecting miners in nullsecreally stop your whining and go play another game if you dont like this oneyou do realize what will happen if local is removed right you will be flying your noobship in about 3 months because only the bigger alliances read goonswarm and co will be able to sufficently blockade their entry systems with 1000 interdictionwarp spheres247 200man blobs to prevent any hostiles to getting even within a 10system vicinity of their mining fleets which will be mining under huge protection and the prices will rise what happens when mining 10milhour you need protection of 2bil worth of ships and pilots well prices rise exponentially because minerals will become the most prized commodity in eve why because only precious few will be mining them due to no safety whatsoeverand you the silent hunter will begin to whine about unfairness againwhat will it be next prevent bubbles forming 200km off the gate give point immunity to stealth cloakies really where does it stop this game is 95 pvp and 5 pve the pvp people have immensly huge tools to get their prey and still you whine and whine and whine how you are unfairly disadvantaged over minersreally just think on it you eliminate 90 of miners and the mineral market and everything that stems from it will crash simply because the flow of minerals will stop grind to a halt because you cant get your  togetherall of the points you have made in this thread are noted but invalid youre trying to tip the balance in your favour you want everything and pvecarebears to have nothingseems to me all in all that your skill and abilities are seriously lacking if you need so many tools to get that one kill
not just delay local should be totally redesigned shifting to the way it is implemented in wspace1 you are able to see only those who willingly manifested their presence2 you can see any member of your corp or ally3 others arent present in local but there is an unknown vessel signature counter which displays approximate number of other ships like neutrals or minuses to you in the system3 if your fellow corpsmateallied pilot encounters someone neutralhostile to your corpally this one added to the local chat with expiration timer of sort displays how much time has passed from last encounter and deletes it from local after say 10 minutes under encounters i mean he was able to observe it for some time like one second or two that will mitigate current game mechanics drawback that forces covert ops vessels to recloack after entering the system
more foolish assumptionsi am a miner in null secfeel free to check my kill board this is my mainmy problem is this absurd lack of risk in my mining area and how the devs are killing the rewards because some terribad null bears cant stand the idea of being shot atcongratulationsyou have now condemned mining to also being a race to get to ice belts first not just the ore beltsand no they do not respawn very often simply because someone always leaves behind scrub items to hold the belt as isthey dash off to another belt somewhere to cherry pick the more profitable ice insteadi am perfectly willing to operate at risk if it means the devs trust this method to limit the ice coming out of nullif you dont want to be shot at leave nullits safer than high sec for too many pve aspects already which is every bit as ridiculous as it soundsupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
everyone has assumed that i have a very open recruitment process they are wrong my recruitment process is very involved and takes time however new recruits in the game find it daunting and it often puts them off i have to be completely paranoid to be able to catch the awoxers i get about one in three applicants are trying to do something nefarious i fully expect an upsurge after this postawoxing gives no value at all to eve it is just a way to ruin someone elses game i consider people doing it to have a very poor moral code if someone was seriously trying to insert a spy into a corp then they need to make a greater effort ok to the real world argument seems the poster has not had a real job in the corporate sector firstly the real world corp actually meets the person that they are going to enter into the corp next they are on a trial period no new employee will have access to the corp accounts the corp secure documents or assets or to the corp passwords and full info network it would take months before someone could really work into a position that would harm the corp and that would be only a minor nuisance furthermore in the real world there are actual consequences a bunch of security guys and police officers will turn up at your desk and cart you away your argument that the real world doesnt have greater security is completely invalidin my experience the only people that would support awoxing are people that enjoy screwing with peoples game experience thats a very twisted view of the world i want to install some basic security for corporation in empire space as i said in the original post the ability to attack corp members in empire freely is very powerful it should be controlled eve may be a sandbox but that means i should have all the tools to manage my corp that ccp can supply this is one i believe is necessary
every corporation i have worked for has massive security down to door cards to access the lunch room and restricted access to different site buildings your access is given based on your roll trust and length of service but back to in game why do you have the ability to stop corp members from accessing a pos force field or even joining certain fleets i think is is a good idea to help maintain a corps integrity and trust in their toons
remember when there was an advertisement for eve and the entire premise of the advertisement was that you can infiltrate a corporation and wreck it from the insideremember how that ability that freedom was literally used to promote the gameand then op comes along and says it adds no value and needs to be removedhahahahahahahahhaha
awoxing is a very valuable tool this game is about being able to do things like infiltrate and destroy a corp from the inside
sorry but what do morals have to do with it using that argument is like saying you are against chess due to regicideridiculousdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i disagree with the proposal i dont do awoxing and i have had it done to a corp i was in    but i dont think that granting internal kill roles is the solutioni will be very surprised if you find any support from any members of the csm on this onemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ive been absent from the game for 4 years and after all that time its still painfull to see how high agility high speed vessels behave in combat while orbiting a target they bump into obstacles like they are are piloted not by a seasoned space combat veteran but by some green rookie they drop their speed almost to 0 to perform a sharp change of course under the heavy enemy fire and just cant measure their speed and distance properly when ordered to approach wreck or containter  with mwd turned on they always will pass by then turn 180 pass by again and only after that at last successfully aproach object all these can easly result in their destruction if happen in the midth of swarm of hostile mobs because most of them heavily rely on speed tanking couple that with the fact that in many pockets mobs are intentionally located near structures of different kinds and often its not so easy to drag them aside from itif this cant be fixed for some reason it could be mitigated by adding some ability to manually set orbiting trajectory in some intuitive easy way and by adding some controls hotkeys especially to adjust it in real time on the fly currently it can be done only with doubleclicking nonstop and is extremely tedious also ability to control the turns radius would be of great help one could change it to higher values in dangerous situation to force his craft not to lose too much speed while maneuvering by perfoming more smooth turns with greater radius
the probing changes in odyssey were pretty awesome all around i can however see a few little things which would complete the system and make it perfect1 when you launch probes and enter the system map the probes currently are arranged in a default position around the system if you are an fc or wanting to probe something nearby it is difficult and takes times to rearrange the probes to the correct position can we change it so that the probe positioning when you first launch them so that if you launch them on a gate you can quickly change the probe range and zoom them in on the gate and hit scan without having to reposition them2 the preset formations for pinpoint and spread formations currently have default ranges for the probes can we change it so it will change the probes position but not their size so for example if you are already at 1au probe range the pinpointing formation will move the probes to the pinpointing formation and keep them 1au range3 im not sure why you would ever need to have probes at different ranges for different probes how about a unified probe range selector instead of shift clicking all the probes then right clicking and going down to the new rangethoughts and ideas eve down under  australian eve community wwwevedownundercom
sothis is what we should have1 launch probes which deploy at your current position2 set probe range3 click formation4 probes deploy to their formation scaled to the range they are setthis is what we currently haveat the moment when you click on a formation probes are always deployed to their preset range 4au for pinpoint i believe at the middle of the solar system which is great if you want to pinpoint probe say a carrier sitting at the sun another contributing factor to the problem is that when we want to reconfigure these formation the all probes except for the centerpoint probes have to be move along two axishow to fix itif i were to deploy probes set their range to 2au then click the formation button it should take the 4au formation and halve the distance from the centerpointi would also like to be able to save a custom preset for my probes which operates in the same way if i set up a preset that is at 4au and save it if i deploy my probes set them to 1au it will change the distance from my midpoint probe to 25 of the 4au preseti know this would become difficult because the game has no way of telling which probe is the anchorpoint but this really is just another button in a right click menu that needs to be addedwhile i am here i would also like to be able to choose the number of probes i want to use say a menu that lets me enter a number from 18here is a video i prepared earler
if you deploy probes the initial anchor point should be where you dropped the probes makes sense and helpful to get those quick ongrid warp ins to get ships at tacs eve down under  australian eve community wwwevedownundercom
thousand times yes getting the ship signature off of someone who undocks is one of those things that became way more cumbersome after odyssey this is simple sensible and fixes it

there is a thread that has been started over in ideas and features that is getting a lot of positive reaction and ideas maybe it would be better suited here
5mil says i can have a spy in his corp inside 3 weeks
why not cut to the heart of the actual problem and make it so that accepting new players into the corp is a grantable role that way only responsible accountable individuals who can be trusted to investigate applicants properly will be able to bring new people in
it is already a directors jobceos job to accept new members into a corp if you dont trust your director to do the job then why are they there bad proposal
well i did like mining once as a noob mining is a great corporation effort where you can mine billions worth it is really mind numbing work though how anyone could say that miners cannot go afk is ludicrous albeit for a short time and not to use any bots i mean i would love to see huge alliances mining week after week in null sec having bodyguards to protect their flimsy fleets
nope bounties stayed the same however anomaly rats are deadspace rats like rats in missions and plexes not belt rats which have a higher bounty
what do you think will happen to plex prices if there is suddenly more isk being pumped into the gamehint plex are priced at x hours of player effort because theres a finite source of themedit wait you are aware that players set plex prices right
i got told on twitter that if you resize the probes by using the graphical representation of the probes it resizes the formationtested and works things just became soo much easier
lets hope other csm members will read this thread
hi im ccp im just going to throw away a huge chunk of my income stream to make some  on the internet happy
all those who are trying to retort with real world examples miss i hope unintentionally one very important thing in real world the corporation in fact has ways to retaliate some corporations not so law abiding as others like different crime syndicates could actually get the spys family gut his childrens in front of his wife than make her eat their intestines after what they would probably kill him or not the spy knows it and you see this greatly discourage him from such actions even in case of corporatons of more widespread type spy can easly hit the jail after being caught and get his life basically ruined and he wont be able to change his body as easly as one can in eve so basically trying to refer to rl examples in case of eve is horribly wrong way to put it and thats why we have a full bunch of artificial restrictions like one isnt allowed to impersonate other player or corporation why wont you object that descision then in rl no one can forbid you do that but still you usually wont do that for some reason for the reason named dire consiquences which eve universe devoid of well almost any mmo even almost any computer game devoid of thats why the topic starters proposal makes some sense though i dont think the way hes chosen is apropriate to deal with it
1 for this id personally like to see some form of preventive measure to keep pilots in the plex for a certain time once they initiate the counter that way when you want to go capture something you would not be able to leave for a preset amount of time
i think thats a little too harsh there would be no compelling reason to try capturing a complex because youd always be afraid that a big gang was lurking just next door it makes complete sense for a solo pilot to run from a large gang but rolling back timers would make a solo pilot think twice about leaving when another solo pilot came in and any pilot who had absolutely no intention of fighting would have a much more difficult time capturing a complex because every time they left the field theyd have to start all over again
essentially profit from selling loot from wreck isnt in any way different from profit from selling parts gained through salvaging but for some reason current game mechanics wont allow you to at least defend your property in form of potentially valuable wrecks with arms im not asking to get them all concorded eve is the universe of many possibilities but also its a place where one has to be aware of consequences following his actons and be able to assess the risks while making the descision and currently ninja salvaging doesnt carry any risks at all and on the other hand its became quite widespread and very frustrating issue for missionrunners if the ninjas want those wrecks make them at least try harder to not be killed in the processas for probable perfomance issues at least some timer should be added something around 1020 minutes and if a mission runner was absent from a pocket for that long all wrecks become free salvagable for all
this would be a great way for people to trap pve fit ships with pvp gank squads it would end up just like can flipping
they currently can do that by stealing from wrecks as well but there are lot of those who dont intend to do anything other than stealing your salvage at least the descision what to do with the thief should be delegated to player owning the wreck as it is done in case of stealing loot from it i sincerely dont see a point in separation of those two caseswith suspect flag added for example a gang including a pricy bs doing the job and some cheaper and lesser size ship assisting him and doing salvage could try to defend their profit from some ninjasalvager on t1 frigate cheaper one would do the job while bs wouldnt get involved currently there are no means at all to defend it other than shooting your wrecks
1 for supporti have always wondered why the best salvage ship in the game  noctis  has a huge bonus to the tractor range but cannot drag in things you dont own there is no penalty for salvaging another players things so why not add the suspect flag t
huh havent seen someone complain about this in awhileper ccp mitnalper gm faolchu  per senior gm ytterbium  per ccp prism x  per ccp incognito  these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleetcom
wellgiven the obvious and overwhelming ccp response on the topic salvaging should not give a suspect flag but we should be able to drag this spacejunk around no matter who owns itlet us tractor wreaks at all times 
shahfluffers  people sometimes make bad decisions even if they are eve game designers this happened in past this will happen in future sad thing as for this condtradicting qoutesee how easly it can be transformedstealing other peoples loot this is an intended game mechanic and is in no way an exploit people stealing your loot from npcs or the player you just blew up are doing nothing wrong the players are stealing what is effectively floating in a rubbish in space and concord places no value on this stuffeve is a harsh place you wont always have everything go your way its a do or die world and people do what they can to get along if stealing some loot gets them a few more isk someone will do it it doesnt matter who just blew it upstill stealing loot is a nogo why its simply rediculous yes salvaging can be a miniprofession and many conclude agreements with mission runners and split the profit but ninjasalvaging is stealing from any point of view and it calls for suspect flag being set on perpetrator that wont stop those who are going to do it the harsh way but there should be some consequences for them all this contradictions make me think the reason ccp dont want to fix it is more of techincal nature than of game design
eves salvage laws mirror rl salvage laws if you want to bring from any point of view into itthe other point of view is that ccp originally introduced salvage as the basis of a new profession not simply to increase the rewards from missioningstill no doubt youre bringing a fresh new perspective that the other 1000 salvage whine threads lack
this noas a mission runner at times i can imagine someone grabbing the ship carrying the mcguffin i need to complete the mission and towing it way the hell off and demanding ransommmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
but the reason why loot stealing is flagged is because it already exists therefore a theft has taken placesalvage on the other hand is completely different and was made this way by design from the start you need to run a salvager first on a wreck in order to create the salvage if someone then somehow manages to steal your salvage then this too would be flaggedits a mini profession and as such you are competing with others to run your salvager on the wrecks if you run your salvager well then you are rewarded with the newly created salvage if you fail then your competitor winsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i dont know for the 13000 bookmarks limit but what i need is subfolders
bumping for bookmarks especially corp ones and alliance ones would be nice while youre at it
i think we could build a bit more game play into it after all outlaws had different identities and it was always part of the fun to find out who they really were for examplein order to change your name you would need to get a very high standing with a pirate faction and complete a mission you will need to have a low concord standing security standing say 5 before you can talk with this agent as otherwise he will think you are a spy for concordfinish the mission and you will get something from the agent that will help you change your name but you wont be able to do it as long as you are an outlaw you will need to grind your standings back up to positive in order for the paperwork to go through regarding how you are reported in local etcyour name will then be changed on your character but there should be ways people can track down who you were this could include the use of a skill and the use of other agents in the game
i think this would complicate things and i wouldnt use it just like the filter for hangers but i see the use and can see it being useful1
reason bumping heavily abused mainly to devoid ship targeted for suicide ganking of warping ability through interfering with its allining while its being pushed away from gate to ease the looting process afterwards its also being used by well known group of extorters to disrupt mining activities by bumbping miners out of mining lasers range from asteroidsproposal after serveral bumping incidents repeatedly happened in a short intervail of time concord should warp to the perpetrator and issue him a warning to stop his activity immideately otherwise he will get criminal flag and will be fired upon probably will be better if after warning they would use a stasis webifer on him to make him unable to move for some time to exclude accidental loss of ship in case some glitch happened and player indeed didnt mean no harm if after receiving a warning and being stasised for 510 second he continues with his attempts its enough of a reason to apply deadly force

bounties on anyone is more realistic in real life if a druglordcriminal mastermind doesnt like someone they can put a 1 bounty on a person same should be true in eve
1 from context i think you mean implies not infers infer is to listen as imply is to speak2 and youre provably incorrect although there have been occasions of law enforcement organsiations using bounties eg 19th century mid western america there have also been many many more occasions of governments criminals or ordinary private individuals using bountes for their own more or less unjust purposes eg judas and the 30 pieces of silverbut youve been told this about 50 times already and refuse to listen so heyanyway bounties arent changing to any kind of only people that galdor thinks are bad can have bounties put on them system so feel free to shout at the stars some morethe infinitely distant infinitely uncaring stars
working as intended although it would be nice for the person who placed the bounty to have the option of removing it might make for some interesting social interactions between bountyer and bounteein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
we are bickering for nothing there is nothing wrong with placing bountys on whoever you want what is needed is a tool to easly filter such bogus bountys out leaving only most significant ones like additional filter for overview which will show or lighten up only those with bountys greater than 1050300kk and an ability to search for players with bountys equal or greater to specific amount

youve read my mind this would be one of the most astonishing additions to eve universe i would love to see some space las vegas in nulsec npc security zone where decent security maintained by some shady crime syndicate and constant struggle for control over the money flows between players corporations wont cease even for day where regular gambling competiotions with breathtaking prizes are held and hundreds of pro gamblers and regular adrenaline addicts flocking from all over the galaxy or some undegroud may be even playercontrolled like poses of sort gambling houses in hisecs in hidden dedspace pockets regulary raided by local militia forces for bountys which autoset on anyone participating in gambling herewhat for actual games to be played there i dont really know how to deal with it i would like to see something well tested with time like poker mahjong roulette gambling machines but that can contradict with the games backstory

when sandbox games start dictating to their player base how they are suppose to play the game is when that game dies the above suggestion will never be instituted as it would result in the loss of around 4570 of the player base which would spell the end of ccp kind of tired of people saying how the eve universe is suppose to be this chaotic and ruthless environment where there is no order its not all suppose to be the wild west empires thrive on commerce and trade and it makes sense that those empires would try and expand the stability and order that are essential for commerce the idea of small pockets of hisec space out in null is kind of interesting but i also like the idea of being able to lower security ratings for 05 and higher for a while i stick mostly to hisec space because i really cant afford to lose 100m vessels every other day to gangkers it wouldnt be so bad in lowsec space if you had an option to not show up in local or if it was harderimpossible to scan people down in ded space pocketsbut so long as both of these tools exist for people who want find you can kill you i see no reason at all to travel into low sec space

im a carebear and i dont like minigames or whackamole style stuff exploration used to be a serious pita they reduced the skill factor of it which was essentially just whackamole and it is now fairly funif you want more suspense in youre mining activities try fitting out a lowsec mining vessel or mine in an occupied wh the whackamole game becomes the constant eyes glued to local andor directional scanner
first question how did you manage to get 13k bookmarks oo
criminal offense no suspect flag definitelythe game already has built in the tools to make it possible if they werent there there would be bumping at all if one entity collides with another momentum is transferred all they need to add is a simple rule set say if the entities are not in same fleet corp alliance then after 5 bumps its a warning then at the 7th bump its a 15 minute flagas it is now you can bump a freighter out of alignment for an entire day if you have the time which is clearly not ok and im sure it ends up being additional petition volume costumer service has to deal withits simple risk  reward the bumper is having fun but theres no risk ergo something needs fixing
ill just leave this heregm response on bumping
bumping is fun maybe you should try it and it shouldnt be a problem for miners who are at their computersare you saying that you are not at your computer when you are mining
how exactly will eve determine which ship bumped the other because people will attempt to exploit whatever algorithm ccp useswhat happens when someone tries to play docking games at jita 44 wont they keep hitting ships every time they undock 
bumping is fine and working as intendedalso shahfluffers has posted the official response to your requestdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
if i park my talos in front of your mining or missioning boat while its moving causing you to repeatedly bump me and thus get concorded youd consider it fair game right
now this is a sensible idea
this is a proposal to ccp to iterate faction warfare for the winter expansion 2013i will be brief and address specific issues first then more general ones that this system has1 awoxers from allied militia2 plex farming3 no front line4 faction tier system5 general lack of incentiveawoxers are a problem in fw its an accepted part of life in every other part of the game and im not seeking to remove this however it does need addressing when committed by people from the allied militia currently if you awox someone from your own militia you get a standings hit and eventually cannot join that militia any longer the same penalty does not seem to apply for members from allied militias my fix is simple a severe standings loss with the victims militia hq and a smaller loss with your own hq awoxers will eventually find themselves unemployable by either militiaplex farming has been an issue ever since the fw overhaul some 2 years ago the truth is its still very easy to farm plexes there is a difficulty in balancing this to make it harder to farm and also not imposing on solo pilots such that they are at a disadvantage when a hostile warps in therefore i propose a bonus and a nerf the buff is plexes count down faster at a rate determined by the number of people in the plex transpose the mechanics of sp generation and you have a ratio that is acceptable with just a couple of people the effect is not very noticeable but with 20 people you can capture a complex much more easily the nerf is that the button now warp jams any hostile ships that enter the complex up to 50km away this should function like an infinipoint and leave mwd available for use so that normal combat can occur with the exception that the invading ship cannot escape so easily the aim here is increase investment in capturing plexes and incentivise group playthe lack of a front line hurts fw a lot its hard to get any kind of meaningful fleet on fleet fights unless there is an established front like the enalurinennamaila conflict gameplay suffers as a result as there is little reason to take ground in a logical pattern and becomes a matter of whose farmers are more dedicated my solution is to disallow systems that are next to enemy systems to be reinforced via system level similarly as you move further back from each of these front line systems which are increasing in system level you get diminishing returns on offensive plexing them because logically theyre more resistant to capture via being further from the front line and by having a higher system level if a system is captured and flipped over to your opponent you are blocked from further reinforcing the systems back up the line until they are plexed below their maximum reinforcement level this will allow flanking tactics to be established and will condense farming activities to fewer systems instead of the exploitable system we have had for 2 yearssee this graphical representation of point 3faction tier system needs reviewing again i think the current system works well but its difficult to hit tier 3 without already being in a position to overrun your enemy just from the way that plexing works hitting a higher tier in reference to my 3rd point will become a tangible objective as holding a higher warzone control becomes more feasible disrupting an opposing faction from gettingholding tier 3 is also a real consideration as theyll constantly be within reach of it and the only way to keep them from it will be to be very aggressive in defence and offencethere is a general lack on incentive to actually participate in fw instead of farming it super low barrier to entry and easy farming of plexes or using a stealth bomber to run most missions as well as the mechanics of lp payouts encouraging selfish behaviour are allowing characters to cheaply and efficiently punch well above their weight in isk generation there arent really any other parts of the game where you can make 50 mil in an afternoon with a 100k sp character flying a meta1 atron
all of which mitigate but do not prevent corporation roles prevent things from being done not mitigate you can throw as many fancysmancy keyfobs on a lunchroom door as you want its not going to change the person who uses the keycardwar decs locator agents mail spam about former wrongdoings bounties heh bad joke hiring noir posting about themyeah we have no way to retaliate against people who do naughty things in eve
if you wanted to name a character as your own why didnt you create it as your ownthe name was part of what you were buying so you made your choicejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
that response is due to limitations on the game their resolution is since the game has no way to deal with it currently to allow it its is pointless to link it because it in no way closes the discussiontry again
where does it say that bumping is only allowed because of the game limitations all i read wasccp considers the act of bumping a normal game mechanic and does not class the bumping of another playerUFFFDs ship as an exploitthe only exception made to this was prolonged and sustained bumping from the same people despite all reasonable efforts to avoid it
this will be another thread that wont die for years until ccp announce the sparkling new feature to being players to eve the ability to play mp3s in game and then theyll act like its some new thing and not something they took away from us in the first place
make so bounties have a time limit say bounty last 30 days and if not claimed the isk is lost to the system simple as or to even add to that the player that survives the bounty for 30 days gets a percentage of the bounty that was placed on himher and the rest is lost to the system would make it interesting 
ive never been a fan of a time limit for bounties mostly because its currently so easy to avoid and stall for time by just sitting in station or going inactive until it expires
up opposite of downhrolt ceo live free die proud
your proposals just promote a blobby faction war
within limits yeah do you even fw having fleets be the primary objective instead of soloplexing would be a breath of fresh air i guess you wouldnt understand
yep i have been in faction war if you want to see who you can outblob there is always null sec i dont think faction war should be junior null sec for those who like to blob but cant compete in null sec fw imo should be a venue for those who like all forms of pvp including small scale and even solo pvp it also can involve large scale fights for bunker busts or when both sides happen to be able to field large fleets to fight for a system currently if you want a breath of fresh air from larger fleet fights just go try to take someones home system tell me what militia you are in and i will tell you what system to go for
id prefer it if you just debate the points in my op
i just want timer rollbacks your ideas have near zero chance of being implemented if ccp cannot even be bothered with implementing timer rollbacks1 awoxers a faction standing requirements for fw should apply to individuals not corporations b allied militia should show up as a different coloroption on overview2 your proposal penalizes certain fits afterburner by not allowing them to warp out when getting blobbed ccp also has a very hard time implementing timer rollbacks i dont think timer speed adjustments are within their capabilities 3 frontlines edit would rather assign importance to systems but whatever works this proposed system will lead to less small gangsolo pvp at the expense of a more ordered battlefield will push players away from plexes and to missions for lp  which will decrease the overall amount of pew 4 no idea what youre talking about5 only you can provide incentive for you to participate in fw occupancy warfare ccp cannot do it for you sandbox and all that stuff ccp already gives you lp for plexes and lp bonuses for controlling more areas what more incentive do you need a medal yeah they give that to you as well  if you take all the systems
i support ops ideas another thing that i would like to see changed would be to make the system tier bonuses worth something right now i have a very hard time understanding how they would help anyone plus station slots cheaper clones and broker fees so what
1 drone space actually has some validity its crap space diet nullsec little bit more sugar than nulsec zero syndicatecompetition for this space is low compared to other regions i agree its location makes it even harder perhaps it would be better located as a band around lowsec and npc nullsec it would be more fitting with the reduced profitability of the drone npcs being closer to empire cobalt edge and other far outlying drone space would be better served being a different faction of npc due to their location2 bring on ring mining3 one or two npc lowsec systems per region hmmm interesting idea but these would just get as camped
im okay with this idea if us lownull sec people could also claim highsec systems and make them into nullsec or even just lowsecsupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
change is good adds variability to game and invites turmoilconflict a way to slowly change the sec status of all systems based on some sort of metric  either player driven or whatever  should be encouraged
just do it already
i support making it concordable or suspect flagging only because of how quickly the op and the people like him begging for this will regret it the minute they undock from a somewhat busy station or the minute they cluster together in a belt to mine or  etc

the way local works in highlow and null has been since eve came out funny how it took a decade of the game for the constant whiners to start requesting how local should be removeddid you even read your own whine where i quoted you you specifically mentioned how the predator has no chance to catch the prey if the prey is situationally awarebesides the fact that nullsec mining is safer than highsec is player defined and influenced problem ccp has said it many times theyll stay out of player based actions why would they intervene in your favour because you took the time and whined like a little b1tch on the forumsplease cry more
lolnot crying sylphy sending a message to tell those who would hunt pve players like myself to bring the noisei want to be shot at and hunted i want to need more effort to be safe and have that effort be an opposed contest of skillsnot some default option with 100 success rateand i love how you make it sound like a challenge if the prey is situationally awareyes because watching local requires you to press nothingit require the additional skills and hardware fitted noneyep that sure is a steep obstacle to overcomeand me crying because noone wants to shoot me help me sylphy shoot me and make me feel betterupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
we should just remove concord and hand the work over to player driven police force corporations
i did your proposals have been brought up and rejected several times because they would just make fw more blobby if you want blobs eve has a place for you  null sec the only exception is your awoxing idea xg had a better idea for that make the ability to be in militia be based on individual standings i would add that killing allied militia should  a standings hit as well problem solved
why not just change that across the board im sure you and your hotdropping buddies will run out sooner than us miners will 
us minersjust so we are clear you do not represent my interests and i am a miner in nulli want back my unlimited ice belts at the very least i dont want my rewards rolled back even furtherthat means we need risk not this loony tune default mechanic that is killing the riskupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
this is a tool that no one in eve besides a few highsec carebears want the majority of players know and understand that awoxing is a good part of eve and it allows you to get targets that you would not normally be able to get i am guessing that you have had a rash of awoxing incidents in your corp or this wouldnt even be an issue for you go put your big boy pants on and fight back against awoxers if it means that much to you or go away cause crying on the forums is not going to get you anywhere
you arent really trying to imply all that youve mentioned are equally disastrous outcomes to having your family tortured or your life and career ruined are you war decs that can be made totally useless just by all members of targeted corp unsubscribing from it for a week and whom you would declare it to to some npc corp this alt of an awoxer belonged to before youve let him in your corp mail spam of specific account which is just a mere nuisanse and due to multiaccount nature of eve gameplay wont do any harm at all to a player this account belongs to posting on forums which only will attracts criticism and ironies is that all youve got its nothing and no awoxercorp spy will ever be frightened by those he just will createbuy another char in most cases it will already be another alt of him the eve universe offers no solid ways to retaliate in such cases period thats why we have some rules that limit players activities in the game no impersonation no repeating meaningless harrasment of other players  like those because there is no way to fight it like you would do irl what topicstarter is trying to propose is just another such rule thats all there is no way to somehow check backstory of newly accepted corp member other than employment history which hardly can be of help in case of some alt or buyed character there is no way you could somehow spy on your members make all their activities logged for your security department to analyze you cant even trust their former employers because they could be those who are ploting against you in the first place you cant monitor their communications because no sane awoxerspy will use ingame mail for such talks and even chat system which you cant monitor at all even through api in cases where rl human will defenitly know he will pay dear price eve awoxer who are using fresh alt for the job knows he will pay nothing at all thats why this should attract attention of game designers crew
you couldnt be more wrong ccp made a decision that salvaging is a profession and much like maritime law and pretty much the definition of the word salvage  it is first come first servedmaybe rather than crying on the forums about it you should fly with a friend who salvages for you this is an mmoor fit a salvager to your missioning ship but that might impact your iskhour mission setup oh noesor dont mission in a busy mission hub to be honest im quite surprised that a 2007 character is complaining about thisjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
youre right can stealing should go back to not flagging you like it used to be
i almost thought you were defending the existence of local in favour of pvp pilots inspite of all your valid points in the add a delay to local thread because your point in that thread keeps punching the punchline that nullsec has no risk due to local existing
oh that is a fair statementbarring pilot error you cannot catch a pilot in sov null who is in a friendly system with a pos or outposthostiles are reduced to being annoying because we are told to stay docked up if we undock and let them get a kill they will come back like ducks after you fed them onceand we can get docked up the moment they appear in local because by the time they finish loading system we are in warp to that safeso unless annoyance can be considered a risk a pretty fair statementupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
the gallente have some more haulers than other races so the issue is located therein future i have to train gallente industrial for minerals pi or ore transport and minmatar industrial for the ammunition transport ship well it got easier to lern these skills but it looks not rightmany many threads have opened to improve the industrial skill pathes and a lot good proposal were found there but the easiest and fastest way to a temporary solution would be the transfer of  kryos epithal miasmos hoarderto the ore industrial skillpathin a later rework they can get a ore specific or intakiy syndicate hoarder specific repaintsthis would lead to pairs of typical racial haulers smallfast and bigslow with typical racial slot count and usageall specials are united under the colors of ore and independant of racial skillsthis is a short term proposall in front of an ore industrial ship rework suggestion elsewhere maybe the ore ships skill path could be advanced as nonracial ship skill path
i am not sure how i feel about thisi am pretty sure this is not something that veterans will like but i could be wrong i will have to ask some of my friends to post how they feel about this
what risk does a miner face that a bumper doesnt
why has discussion came down to miners suddenly bumpers are more of a threat in suicide ganking scheme here they face almost no risks while basically asist criminals and in many cases its them who make this crime even possible still they wont get neither killrights on itself nor criminal flag such bumping has a very distingiushable pattern it lasts for such a long time its highly unlikly that can be done unintentionally

oh you youngins eve isnt about all thatits about your choices impacting the life of your character just like the real world 
looking at the killboards of blown up ratters and miners in nullsec it seems to require quite a lot every dayso since your environment you are in is so flawlessly empty and devoid of hostiles you either presume or assume its the same in all other nullsec regions
oh i dont assume this i really have no opinion on the statisticsbut other pilots seem to assume this too much judging by those kills you mentionedno single pve pilot ever was killed in their home system except through pilot errorthey either made a mistake about another pilot being active and undocked in an unprepared shiporthey failed to prepare by aligning to a safe spot and hitting warp when the hostile enters the systemall the cloaked pilot ever did was take advantage of an opportunity one handed to them by a mistake on a silver platternow if the mechanic to get safe involved an opposed contest of skills rather than a default one like we have now that might be different players might plan on beating other players instead of a clockupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
this has been bugging me for months and would like to see this fixed in the next update when adding a new bookmark the drop down list of all your folders is in a randomized order i like to have many folders to organize my bookmarks and having to scroll the entire list reading very carefully so i can find the correct folder is very frustrating this should be an easy fix as many other things in the game are sorted alphabetically and i cannot figure out the mechanic on how the bookmarks are sorted to me it seems that the folders are placed in a random order please fix this here is a screenshot of what i mean
looking at the number of salvage whinethreads in the 2007 forums im notincidentally as long as were being all real life about it shooting empire faction rats should incurr a criminal flag should it not
normally when this happens it drops in a can next to the wreck  i know not always what if all wrecks that drop loot dropped it into a can siting beside the wrecksalvage hunters can freely drag and salvage wrecks while the mission runners mcguffin is protected from being movedi realize it will cause more server load as if effectively doubles the objects in space after a battle but it means my shiny noctis actually has a purpose when cleaning up a battle  mission i was not part of
youre right after repeated ship bumping concord should join in with the bumpers and take out the offending minerfreighter etcdisclaimer viewpoints in this post may not be supporting the op as i dont support it
apart from the fact ccp are on the side of the bumpers they generally exhibit a lot of skill as its not just approach a lot of the time
you missed the point entirely anything done to penalize bumping will be turned right back around and used against miners and other indutrialists all one of them has to do is get in your way then have a friend who doesnt care about dying bump you into himof course you could have the mechanics not register the second or third bump so then the bumpers would just flip it around and bump one of their friends into youquite basicly your idea is a loselose situation for all miners

yes i agree but i would like to have the choice to remove unwantedunused skill pointsand with that choice the consequence is that i will not be reimbursed the skill points for doing this
that makes absolutely no sense so basically what is being asked here is to allow someone to delete skills to satisfy their ocd
no delete skills i have no use for and will never have any use for againexampleccp gave me mining lvl 2 when i created this character this is a combat character i have no use for this skillwhen planet management first came out i wanted to give it a try you know something new lets try it i injected all 5 skills and trained each skill to lvl 4 after a few months i decided that i did not like pi i will never have any use again for these 5 skillsshould i be penalized for trying something new then deciding that it is not for me i do not mind losing the skill points  think i should lose the skill points for trying it i just want to remove it from my skill sheet if i want too charge me a plex if youccp thinks it is a vanity thing like plex for resculpt
i am not sure where you are penalized for having it
seconded how does having skills you arent using penalize youits like knowing irrelvevant trivial from the 90s when you are an engineer its not useful right now or in the foreseeable futurebut it might come in handy if you are randomly invited over to a coworkers old school game nighti can use myself as an example i will never be a serious industrialist or miner yet i can fly exhumers orcas and freighters which i dont intend on ever buying or flying unless i want to feel cheeky with a skiff but those skills might come in handy if there a pos bash and said stuff drops out you never know
and i want to dock in the pleasure hub with the company of some exotic dancers while i gamble and walk around with my avatarwis and fluff stuff i dont see coming back around for a long time considering how many things like poss and such that actually need work and the terrible reaction they got from incarnaif you really must gamble there is eve online hold em ive known players who completely fund their shiny ship habit with it
no opinion on the statistics how about facts if you fail to observe that youre talking out of your assand yeah certain people cant simply have an eye out on localintel channels and warp to a safespot when a potential hostile enters their systempocket greed and ignorance are by far the two tools that have served the agressors with a fully sized meal so many timesactually pilots are killed in their home systems all the time welcome to a game that isnt bug free when youre 25km away from any asteroid and your ship fails to enter warp because its seemingly stuck on space dust you lose those precious 12 seconds that it takes for a cloaky hotdropper to get to you and light a cyno we all know how the procedure goes from there then theres lack of focus rl factors neighbour wants to borrow 2 cups of sugar telephones tv etc and some annoying game mechanics that prevent you from warping until you click that stupid ok button example during alliance tournamenti would agree its mostly to pilot error but you have that in pvp as well you can play if game all you wantall the cloaked pilot ever does is take advantage of stupidity ignorance or lack of focus why should it be any different the game itself punishes you for the mistakes you do why would 90 of eves players have another advantage over us industrialists isnt it enough that our ships are lacking agility sublight speeds manuverability thickness of defenses and lack of offensiveutility moduleslets make this an instagib game industrialists have 1hp everything else has 510hp im sure everyone would agree on that since its totally fairgo look at the forums go look at killboards the industrialists are the single most singled out target for all the pvp pr0 players of eve who by the way dont go flying around looking for skilled and experienced pilots in ship fits that match their skillpoint effective margins no the preying on the weak defensless and nonoffensive targets is the main focushow many people out of 100 new players  brand new were not talking about people drawn into the game by their friends to bolster their fleets or alts of people how many of those 100 players are not taking the im gonna kill anything that cant shoot back way to trying to be a recognizable pilot and fame assorted with that 99 of pvp pilots already thinks industry branches are boring and how pvp is the only adrenalinefilled enjoyable part of the gamethat and seemingly popular way to grief other players to the maximum because the game allows itin the end a lot of people will agree that changing the way local works would be a good idea but not without game breaking changes to some other mechanics that local currently is a part of in other words making a delay to local without much consideration is like making sure the zebra is blind deaf and cant run more than 5 feet without a heartattack so the lioness has an easier joband thats what this silly proposal stems from whiny little b1tch3z who need additional tools and powers to get that kill
this is the key statement you madeeverything else you said was either unsubstantiated or your opinionthe key point and fact since you respect facts remains that pve is not playing against pvpand i want to as a pve pilotif you do not want to compete against other pilots go to high sec where concord acts in your defenseif you accept that other pilots will attack you outside of high sec stop complaining when they camp your systemno sylphy i am not pointing at you as a complainer specificallythe only reason afk cloaking is not a primary concern in high sec is concord and the already heavy population of non bluesnrds play is only possible when you accept the presence of neutral pilots in the first place concord enforces peaceful behavior whenever a war dec is not present so nrds is not so much an option as an enforced play aspectlow sec makes no promises and security status hits do eventually mount up assuming pilots are not manually entered on watch lists alreadyin null it can be possible to play as nbsi because non blues are far less frequent i will never say this is good game play but it does happen a lotand every system where a cloaked camper is present clearly advocates for nbsi by their panic ridden avoidance paranoiathat or they ignore the pilot and continue business as usual if he proves hostile a fight happensyou seem to be describing a system where a prepared pilot never needs to face an opponent or compete against a hostile player directly they will always have an opportunity to say no to direct interaction making it only possible if they choose it or by carelessness  accident miss the opportunity to avoid ityou just made player interaction on this level a punishment rather than the primary game aspectthat is what we have now and you are defending itupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
what kind of player interaction are we talking about here because what were doing right now talking is player interactionplayer interaction is also trading buying coop play in mining missions pvp and doesnt necessarily demand you to shoot first and ask questions later to interact with other players you have a choice of how youll interact with someone or if youll interact with them at allpersonally im not bothered by cloaky afk campers theres 50 systems in providence that i can do my industrial stuff in and all of them wont be camped at the same time and even if they were i can find other stuff to dojust because i live in carebear hq doesnt mean i wont sit into a combat ship and defend my home system when its necessaryat the very least afk cloaky camping is unimaginative and people say mining is boring hah sittign in one system hoping someone will be stupid or ignorant or complacent so you can take advantage of that its something i wouldnt do even if i got paid for it
nor should youthats the problem with the current mechanic as a miner i only need to watch locali dont need to coordinate with other pilots i dont need to watch intel channels i dont need to fit for defense against other playersif a hostile enters the system i dont worry about how clever they are or if my scanning skills are up to the challenge of detecting them in time to react before i am in dangeri just watch local see the name and hit warp done and donebut that same source that handed me the information now tells him that i am still there to be hunted how many other pilots i have to back me up in system all he needs to knowso if i do decide to take a chance he knows if others might join him and i know if he has others in system too but neither can anticipate cynoslocal is telling both of us too much to make us willing to risk a fight either it favors me and he avoids it or it favors him and i dofights happen when the results are either uncertain or one of the pilots has incomplete informationlocal makes that difficult to happenupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
if you went to the shop bought wood and nails and built a table on your own would that make the table have equal value as purchased components or would there be an added cost for your spending time to assemble itfor everything in eve you do there is a price time sink and for every month of having ability to time sink stuff you need to pay the piperpersonally i dont use isboxer but im not against it i 7box the old fashioned way but then those 7 accounts arent necessarily all doing the same thing some could be boosting mining hauling doing missions or rattinganomalies all at the same time as doing pi manufacturing overseeing jobs or scouting for pvp targets i guess someone could say i have an unfair advantage over others since i can see hostiles entering my system and can get safe on time
can i also ask for sane way for exchanging your bookmarks thats good you can transform it in the game item but there has to be a way to easly share it through chat or mail also when in deep nullwormhole space you must uncloak just to make an bookmark item and jettison it for your friendalt that can easly drive one mad
did an awoxer kill your ability to use paragraphs
no it shouldnt attract the attention of the game designers the game designers explicitly advertise these god damn mechanics in their advertisements for the game showcasing it as a bloody feature are you lot so off base that you dont understand that ccp want this kind of treachery and backstabbing to be possible have you missed the point of this game entirely bloody hell
you know what is so great about this game you can  with the minds of other players with out even firing a shot
that is as it should be organized groups of players have by default  through organized defense and play  an advantage over the lonewolf variants of pilotsare you saying that me and my friends who have built a castle set up watchpoints guards and pit traps are unfairly advantaged over people who didnt
no you earned the right to use these structures and any intel you or your allies took effort to gainlocal is helping your opponents far morethe hostile entering your system has no way of knowing who is currently presentthey might know about recent mining or ratting but they wont know if your patrol happens to be in this system or the nextthey have no way of knowing who is docked in that outpost 3 people or 100but local will tell them more than enough to make a judgement call on whether to attack in this system or come back another timeand if your gate scouts already spotted this pilot across the last three systems what great value does local have confirming what you already knew and expected that they would show up in the next systemlocal is helping that hunter far more and making your efforts effectively meaninglessyour scout on the gate may as well have been relaxing docked up in the station the hostile sees him in system either way despite the fact he should never have known he was spotted at all but local tips him off to your defenses like thatupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
curious of why eve does not allow plex to skill conversion meaning 1 x30 day plex traded for 30 days worth of normal skill training time or even like 70 of what a person would normally train during that time but as unallocated skill points to be used where the player wants them since null space and low sec are dominated by players who have played for 1 to 10 years as a new player you really are stuck in high sec for years until your gunnery skills etc are up to par enough to not be podded in low sec this creates the feeling of i really came in to this game to late to enjoy it as a new player and really questions whether i or a new person should continue to play it at this point and is it worth waiting in high sec running missions for years before your able to venture off in to low sec the issue with this never ending problem is the fact that combat is driven by skills each skill lowers your amount of damage and at the same time strengthens your gunnary and hit points per level if some one has say 20 mil skill points in gunnary and a new person only has say 5 mil than its a pretty certain deal whos going to win unless the old school player just flopped and did something stupid which cost them the fight but the chances of that with skills its going to be minimal as a new player i would love to be able to work for isk and than be able to buy a plex on the market for it to trade it for skills or even pay 20 dollars to eve to save me 1 month worth of waiting for a couple skills to train to a certain level with the ever growing issue of this eve eventually will face certain death or only be played by them who are trying it out or dont want to use a plex for game time who have been in it for years since this makes it almost pointless for new people to join while at the same time only ensuring people who have played for years continues to stay on which sucks because eve is a good game its just boring as hell having to wait for skills to train for months the only other option is to mine for months on end hoping of buying a possible eve charactor with the high skills to get you in to null sec and survive for atleast a few minutes just something to think about i hope this marks my 4th time coming back to eve to give it another shot since the plex system came out but im afraid im boring easily by mining and running missions with the hope of one day being able to fly in null sec or low sec with out the never ending fear that there is a 999 chance ill end up podded because my characters are only a year old or newer dont take this as me dinging eve because of my laziness to play the game and enjoy it i do enjoy the game as it is however it seems new players 1 year or fewer are at a disadvantage over the general population of eve who have played for yearsto me it just seems in a business profitability mind frame eve would make it better for both new comers and old schoolers if this was just a game and not a business who cares right but since it is a both and eves future rests on eve staying alive building in more people every day who end up using plex for game time ultimately avoiding the cost of playing will eventually kill eve and force eve to shutdown unless the company can shift the profit sources correctly this is just a idea to built upon that you cant let 2 to 10 year old characters dominate 00 sec or 01 so on for 2 years making it entirely impossible for a new person to enjoy the game since high sec is also some what dangerous space but not as much as low by any means this also questions again whether its worth it unless your multi boxing but again there are them who hunt down multi boxers alone in high sec with them targeted hulks etc a portion of your old player base is truly stopping eve from being what it should bewith that said this is not a rant p but more a idea to strengthen the game a little more for new comers and old schoolers if the players agree to use the plex to skill conversion
as someone who dies mostly to month old fw noobswhat is this rant about againyour argument amongst the wall of text seems to be that a plex conversion to sp would make a level playing field between veterns and new players your argument seems to be flawed unless you made it so only so much sp could be purchased or what prevents me from buying a butt ton of sp and just giving myself all 398 skills in the game at v i see these posts all the time amongst my formum trolling and it boils down to some confusion that sp at some level replaces pilot skills trust me it does not a person understanding the game mechanics with a couple weeks training in a meta 4 fit frigate can be a threat to a 150m sp player who thinks his sp and faction fittings are going to give him a win its something unique to eve and its something that keeps me logging in day after dayi started my pvp life at 250k sp i killed a three year old character who war decd my little new player corp walked outside smoked 5 cigarettes with my hands shaking like a leaf and been hooked ever since it can be done and done without trying to buy your way to sp heaven
well first off as i said its not a rantso please reread it as it is simply a way for eve to make more profit and bring in newbs to keep that you are huntinglowering the thought of this is a pointless game and a waste of my time that newb will havealso nothing keeps you from buying x plexs and getting all skills in the game if you can afford to buy that many plexs and would like to use them for that so lets say with 5 improved implants with a avg skill points of 2400 per hour times 24 hours  57000 skill points now 57000 times 7 days  403200 skill points one last time 403200 times 28 days worth of game time  1612800 skill points for 550m isk or 20 dollarsso lets look at a average 10 year old character  120 million skill points divided by 1612800  74 74 that is the amount of plexs you would need to gain 120 million skill points now lets do this in usd cash 74 x 20 usd  1480 this also comes to 37 billion worth of isk so if your that richplease be my guest and dish out 1500 dollars on the game or if you can make 37 billion isk to pay for skills than also be my guess but lets not forget this is basically already being done on character bazaarthe only difference here is eve makes a profit off of it and new comers have something to drive towards when mining knowing they wont be able to go in to low sec etc any time with in the near future thanks
why cant i like this post a hundred times
because paytowin will kill eve end of storyjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i would rather use that plex to remove unwantedunused skills that i havei do not want to be reimbursed for the skill points or skill books
you are telling like this is something but this done relatively easy by farming sites in nulls with couple of tenga alts or sweeping wormholes with capital gangs like a billion per day or two its not so hard if you have an access to specific tools and really motivated to do such a money youll be able to without any magic so basically its no go as too many will be able to rocket up their leveling progressbut from other poing of view its already here any noob can buy a few plexes accumulate some isks by selling them and purchase an already skilled character on the char market and many do so and here is a problem i can aknowledge  this character may happen to be far from what buyer would wanted to aquire unneeded skills wrong specializations that stuff and in eve we already have a well developed production line of chars for selling run by ordinary players so by allowing to inject some sps into newly created character to some reasonable extent like 1 or 2 mills sps max we would hardly break anything aside from the fact that ccp by doing so will dominate this market and cut these character raisers profits severely but new players would still if they want to and ready to pay for this in real cash be able to get their already developed to some extent character and could choose which exaclty skill build it must has and ccp would get additional money from additional plexes seems not so bad to me
thank you kyon for seeing it as a debate instead of jumping in with no lol i agree on all of your points for sure and i agree for the character who has played for a while to build up to that tenga alts etc to making 1 billion a day its simple what im referring to is what you stated its a winwin for newbs and for eve since like you said newbs can come in and plexs for new characters and allocate the skills exactly where they want them which isnt a lot of skills for a plex price but it atleast gives them a optionlike you said its relatively easy to make 1 billion isk eve cant pay its electric bill or devs with plexs although come on that would be pretty cool as long as it came with a discount to lol  so eventually what you end up with right now is a bunch of people buying plexs and paying their monthly fees to play while eve is forced to only bank on newbs or thoughs who would rather fork up the cash instead so this gives eve another source to go off ofagain thanks for debating it just a idea is all companies who dont look at what their customers want because thats what we are and find a way to make it reality are the companies who become just another faded memory every great company or game didnt build it self on the no attitude they build it on hard work in going over and over the plan until they found a way to keep cost low and still deliver what the customer wanted i get it the old schoolers want to rule eve and rule space and change scares themits cooli get it you worked hard for years for what you havenow let some newbs get a chance at the game cause if high sec becomes to dangerous already almost there and low and null you cant fly in than eve the game you worked hard to build your self will be forced to shutdown since no new players will want to stay and most old players are paying with plexsits a simple equation if you start paying me in bananas and peanut butter and jelly d and than bulling my new customershow can i keep supplying you think about it eveps edit and dont tell me to sell my peanut butter and jelly or banana p

counterpoint there are many people who go into nullsec at a week or two old and never leavehaving all your skills to v doesnt mean a thing really if you dont know how to fly your ship youll still be killed by the week old newbie in the barely fit slasherthe problem here is the misconception that you need 120 million sp or whatever to actually survive in nullsec thats entirely false and it always has been all you need is a clue and some friendsfurthermore i have 14 mil in gunnery and 26 mil in spaceship command how much of that do you think is actually relevant for whatever ship i happen to be in at the time say im in a rifter how does large blaster spec iv help me here or minmatar carrier v what about that 2 million sp i dumped into wing command how does that helpinside of three months any newbie can be exactly the same as me in a rifter sp wise hell theyll probably beat me in a fight toothere are corps and alliances all over the place who take in newbies train and support them and wind up with experienced vets who know how to handle themselves and pass on the same treatment to the next crop of adorable newbies maybe you should look around find one of them and try the game from a different angle
case in point within 1 week over 4 years ago i joined nulsec this character has almost never been in hi sec just because youre new doesnt mean you cant jump straight into the deep endin fact id argue the game is easier if you do as your mentality gets adjusted straight away that everything you have you can lose
first off all characters go through the same growing pains when skilling into any aspect of the game even a bought character goes through this pain next plex is game time which can be exchanged at mostly free market rate to other players for their isk that isk they earned through time doing stuff in game the plex program is actually ingenious as it allows those with surplus resources earned by time and energy in game to swap their ingame assets to those with surplus game time because of rl resources your proposition plex for sp would ruin the all characters take the same amount of time to train into a ship aspect of this game this is actually a great equalizer as the rich players and there are many trillionaires in this game cannot utilize their wealth to gain a sp advantage if they do use their wealth for an advantage it is almost always in the form of an asset officer module that is at severe risk of loss when used against another player frankly your suppositions are also wrong you dont need to wait a year to pvp in nullsec lowsec or highsec there are many accessible ships and game avenues very quickly accessible to characters less than a month old ill concede for capital warfare or blackops or other niche areas there is a skillpoint barrier but that is a good thing furthermore most battles are not two identical ships shoot each other in a fair 1v1 thats not how eve combat functions outside of rare circumstances can you do us a favor what exactly is your hurdles to lowsec and nullsec game content that you need more sp for

i myself would like nested folders or sorting by jump would be nice as well better than alphabetizing imhom
i agree that would be a nice feature but lets not get bogged down with big projects prior to odyssey 11 like the title suggests simply alphabetizing the bookmarks when adding a new bookmark is a very reasonable request its a realistic goal a dev can seek for the odyssey 11 updateanyone else have any comments
andor a search function would be doubly as good
i thought bookmark folders are sorted alphabetically
yes they are but when you click add location the list of folders that drops down is not alphabetically bookmarked i have about 250 folders and when they arent organized its a complete pita to find the correct folder
this thread is basically going to deal with item clutter after a string of lvl 4s  lvl 3sits really easy to get a lot of different items considering how security missions will vary in loot because of the faction youre going up against i find it hard to believe that anyone would enjoy hammering away trying to sort through all the items so that you can try to maximize your profit i can remember a lot of times having 250 items and selling each individually waiting for he menu to pop up then going onto the next timei propose that just like being able to shift right click on an item and being able to reprocess them you should be able to do the same with the items in addition i propose a filter to a sell all button that allows you to put on a few variables such as 1 dont sell anything under 20 regional price wo authorization 2 put a flag on a meta 4 for item so you can make a sell orderim just throwing out a few ideas id imagine that this may conflict with buyers who put very cheap bids on generic items which i can understandany input to this thread would be great for the csm to review id bump the thread again with the progress weve made so this doesnt get buried thx
while a sell all button seems to have its advantages i would not support the followingyou should take some responsibility in your actions and not have the game hold your hand through everythingjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i support this idea personally i prefilter the loot so that very low item stuff does not get sold manually and instead goes into my reprocess pile to try to keep the number of items to actually be sold to a minimum but even doing this i often end up with several hundred different items to chuck through the market i dont check the prices closely as long as i see a green percentage i ok the sale being able to do joblots would be a major improvement for the user aswell as reduce the amount of server queries being pushed down the connections thereby reducing lag in trade hubs looks like winwin to me
ive seen this topic before and support it still come on ccp make the sales of rat droppings easier 
this is beyond mechanicsthis stuff is in your head your own paranoia is ruining your own game not any one else
i am copypasting my usual spielthe skill and ship class system is ingeniously designed such that newbies can compete while providing veteran players with perks that give an edge here and there but nothing so brokenly overpowered that a newbie has no chance all skills cap at level 5 no matter how many years you have played the game you cannot exceed that limit and lower level skills ex racial frigate are very quick to train relative to more advanced skills 5 to 7 days for frigate level 5 try getting cruiser to level 5 or battlecruiser or battleship those are 30 day skills same applies for all their respective weapon systems too only a limited number of skills affect any one ship module weapon system and specialty at any given time ex1 someone you are facing has about 20 million sp but how much of that overall sp is actually combat related heshe could be a huge industrial player with limited combat skillsex2 a veteran player has just trained up the skill large hybrid turret to level 5 that skill in no way affects the skill small hybrid turret and thus the veteran will be no better or worse than before at the frigate level getting a skill from level 4 to level 5 only adds on an extra 2 here 5 there exceptions apply if you simply train up all the skills within a specialty to level 4 which takes 17 of the amount of time it takes to get those skills to level 5 you will find yourself flying at about 80 to 90 of the effectiveness of a multiyear veteran with those same skills in that specific specialty at level 5 which is something that can be easily overcome with the right module or tactic getting a skill to level 5 is supposed to be a painful train many players yes even veteran ones opt to avoid doing it and instead train up other skills to level 4 again because its faster ships and weapons have been balanced against one another ex a battleship can potentially instapop a frigate but the frigate can fly very fast making it difficult for the battleships weapons to track especially at very close range then again the battleship can deploy drones to deal with the frigate and the frigate can shoot the drones down however the battleship might have a large energy neutralizer fitted to nuke the frigates capacitor power every 24 seconds in which case the frigate could use a small nosferatu that sucks out capacitor from the battleship every 3 seconds etc etc high tech equipment ex t2 faction officer etc will not confer a player i win abilities they simply give a player a linear edge at an exponentially higher costex a group of two or three t1fit frigates that cost about 500 thousand to 1 million isk can kill a faction frigate worth about 50 to 100 million isk provided they are using the right mods in the right configuration and know what they are doing tldr  the point of the skill system is to force you to learn the games mechanics and nuances in cheaper equipment and ships that way when you do gain access to more expensive equipment and ships you know how to use them properly and wont cry as much when they die you do not need to have level 5 in any specific skill to be competitive having level 5 in a skill is simply an edge exception when it is required for something else more sp is not indicative of a pilots ability it just means that the pilot has more options in what heshe can do smaller and cheaper ships tend to be more flexible and have more tactical options than larger more expensive ships no one ship is superior to everything in the game even titans the largest ship in the game has an achilles heel smaller shipsnow for the meat of your ideas read up on how goonswarm came to power say what you want about them but they literally waged wars using the zerg rush tactic in cheap and often fit equipment in addition to cunning diplomacy which doesnt require any ingame character skills currently they dominate nullsec and still still use the same tactics because they are so goddamn effectivecorrect me if im wrong but you seem not to understand how plex worksplayers buy plex in rl and then sell them to other players ingame whether its a subscription or plex ccp still gets their moneyanother way to look at it is people who sell plex on the market are paying for the subscriptions of others in exchange for iskand as others have stated introducing plex for sp wont help newbies at all  older players especially the powerful ones out in nullsec will be able to afford more plexes than any newbie will and still stay ahead in terms of total sp it will make newbies think that more sp  more powerful which i showed above as false it deprives the newbie of the painful experiences of being new which is necessary as it teaches newbies how to work with what they have rather than just throw money at the problem in fact it makes the beginning experiences of newbies more painful as they will throw their best stuff into a situation and wind up losing it due to lack of experience
it would be better if malcanis was here but you are stuck with me    he wrote a law saying basically any change made to be an advantage to one group will be a bigger advantage to the more established group already in placeplex for sp goons will now outfit their newbies that much faster after all once the renter program gets going they will again be the richest organization in evemake for an even footing not unless you believe in pay to win is even footingi worried about the same thing when i joined eve i was six years late to the party id never catch up never be as good as the older guysbut what if the older guys wind up in flying coffins aka supercaps unable to play unless fc clearance is given what if the older guys are unwilling to risk the loss and clone fees of their valuable headsthey make alts new players with the same skill point total as you or less only they are richer so they could plexskill seven ways from sunday you short of having a no limit credit card would always be behindbut right now as it stands you have the ability to read learn about good skill plans you can get out into null fairly quick if you meet the right recruiter sure you will have trouble fitting sure you will be at a disadvantage for a while but it is your chance to grow learn not just swipe a credit card and get in a ship you still have no clue aboutkillboards are full of poorly fit ships and idiot deaths and every damn time the ones in the know nod and say he bought it before he could fly it we dont mean sp when we say thatnoi do not support your ideammike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
mike is referring to this
i think you should probably play the game for more than 2 months before you go about telling us what the old schoolers wantremember we were also noobs at one point with that seemingly endless list of skills ahead of us but we managed somehowalso you are 2 months into the game and you are suggesting a huge change to what is pretty much one of eves core principles everyone skills up at the same ratejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
honestly theres something wrong it would be great to have smaller jump radiuss or bubbles and points that go out to 50 with out bonuses flame awayam i at 0 or 25
i want the jukebox back too  please bring it back ccp my computer is far too crappy to run oog players anyway and besides the more features you have that sets your game apart from others is better i dont see why you would take it out in the first place

there are very very few skills in this game that have a drawback the afterburner skill used to have a capacitor use drawback but they fixed that warp drive operation reduces the cap needed to warp and could be considered a drawback if attempting to dump cap and make a precision short warp but that is a very very niche situation if you have many many extra skills it is possible they bump you to the next clone grade but that is again a very rare thing as you need to have an aweful lot of skillpoints to get you there especially if you are a high skillpoint character there are two reasons for the please let me remove skills crowd a ocd b rp you have a character that you want to be all amarr but trained some minnie crap at a young age before you went all cva and wish to remedy it for rp reasons
i think i understand this point being that a pilot would have let the item clutter happen and that ccp would help too much by helping you organize your mess part of the main issue that i would like to address is the fact that you can easily get over 100 of different items on a lvl 4 mission with several pockets and have to wait for the menu to pop up and load the highest bidder then also wait for the transaction to complete which even though takes all of 5 seconds it can be a rather slow and methodical process thank you for your input the thread seems kind of slow and its a topic thats kind of been beaten to death
alternatively you could use an arazu lachesis proteus or even a fleet interceptor

new pilots have plenty to do in eve with proper guidance my corp proves this most every day its just a matter of people wanting to stick out 714 day trains in there first few few months
i can see the news headlines now20 freighters destroyed by concord on jita gate during traffic jam after unfortunate frigate ends up bumping off all of them simultaneously and goes flying into deep spaceseriously though if someone is bumping you so that you cant warp and isnt shooting you then report them a gm will be along shortly if someone bumps you a few times and you make no attempt to avoid them or leave then well thats sort of your fault orbiting alone makes it harder for miners specifically to be bump victims or gank victims for that matter
let us have our jukebox now please

nope sorry guys there is no cut off yet trebor and half the csm are in planes now and not able to access internet until they reach iceland to run this election results so you still can vote at least for more 12 hours probably morewhen the election is run trebor will post here to warn everybody that the vote is oversorry for not having the results but i totally depend of the csm and they are all travelling to the summer summit in iceland we have to wait until they get there get in their hotels rest and them connect to the internet

UFFFDreasonable thingsUFFFD results UFFFD industry version
during the last week eve industrialists cast their votes to determine which of the 40 industrial UFFFDreasonable thingsUFFFD i choose from the csm8 crowdsourcing initiative down from 1363 suggestions submitted by the community the selection criterion was simple i filter out all issues by the following tags industry pi pos mining market contracts hauling custom offices invention or manufacturing i choose 30 by the most amount of likes they had from all of them them i choose 10 i likedi would like to thank all those that voted the csm will discussion with ccp the planning for the winter expansion this week in iceland during the summer summit and these results should help guide both parties though discussions if and when an industry issue is raisedthe same wrightstv system used in the csm8 elections and csm8 reasonable things initiative was used to rank the items of this vote in these results the  figure is what percentage of the current election leader the item had when it was eliminated from the election and gives a rough estimate its popularity 100 represents the most amount of votes and every other percentage shows the amount of votes received relative to the total cast as results were eliminated votes were transferred to the casters next choice and so on until there was only one choice leftthis is the top 10though the first choice will require a lot of work on ccps part due to the nature of the industry ui and game mechanics the rest of the top 10 are improvement of life issues that should be simple to tacklethe csm summit starts this week please remember that csm and ccp is not obliged to use or do nothing with this list this is just a guide of player wishes industrial player wishes lets just hope ccp reads it and tries to tackle some of these issues while preparing and implementing the winter expansion we all thank ccp in advance for any effort they put to helping us with these issuesthe entire results can be consulted here
please from this point forward feel free to use this tread to discuss the results or make questions
damn i didnt see the existence of this threat until it was too late  mutters ohwellpoint 13 is a real must have in my opinion put in a warning if a courier is about to accept a drug containing courier contract or something but please make it possible for people to contract drugs to other people being a small market that is often clandestine in the sense that the real buyerssellers tend to sell directly to their customers instead of just dumping their junk on the market having the ability to put it in contracts would greatly ease this means of selling drugs
bump it would lower server requestsatm to fit 100 ships i need to assemble ship then activate and then fit it x 100 that would be 300 request to fit 100 wich can then be reduced to 1 i personaly would love to fit 500 at once wich then only 1 request vs 1500

supported timer rollbacks and an enhanced barrier to entry should be first and foremost in any changes to the fw income stream
hello fellow players and developersas a droneboat pilot i have noticed a few changes that would drastically improve the ease of use of drones and would make more sense for their background i welcome any constructive criticism on these topics1 change sentry drones have two modifiers in two separate categories giving a total of four drones which each shine in their own specific area as followsbouncers make these shortrange drones 24 km optimal give it a higher tracking as angels are close and orbit fast but lower damage mod than the gardecurators increase the damage these drones do almost to the point of the gardegardes keep as iswardens increase the tracking of these drones keeping damage about the same2 move the salvage option on the rightclick menu of salvage drones to the top of the list instead of putting it between the most unwanted options towards the bottom scoop to cargo hold and abandon dronei feel these changes would be simple and improve drone use drasticallyedit corrected grammatical mistake
i believe that a pilot should not show in local if dockedi think that a pilot should not show in local until he pings his dscan if a pilot does not ping dscan then that pilot is invisible unless he either uses dscan types something in local chat or is spotted by being on grid with another pilot who is already in systemthis works both ways the local sovholders are also hidden from any hunters until either party uses dscanof course there are flaws with my ideas above but its just a few thoughts which could be modified and made to work anything that kills afk cloaky camping and encourages sologang roaming must be a good thing
you should really look at this thread if you have not already seen it
this whole local thing albeit a good idea was put down because ccp said although it broke the emersion aspect of the game they felt it necessary to maintain some social aspect in other words to make sure you closet nerds will at least feel like there are others that play the game too and forces you helmet wearing introverts to deal with others
actually the availability of a chat channel to use represents the peak of this effortthe actual pilot roster itself has a demonstrated chilling effect on actual socialization it is not simply a point of diminishing returns with this list present it has a negative impactit too often either lists too many pilots to be meaningful or exposes too few to feel safeoutside of a corp channel where people you expect to know and be interested in seeing local itself is best served being as anonymous as possiblewant to increase socialization offer anonymous comments as an option with no pilot rosteryes you will get trash talk but you will also get everything elseupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
easy francis i am just recanting the previous rounds of this debate and paraphrased what ccp had stated i could care less whether it is there or not just like sound the new warp jump tunnel crap or any other special snowflake stuff that make people get all verklepmt over
ccp has also stated they want to kill the pilot list aspect but they realize so many have come to rely upon it that they need a better alternative to simply removing itthey are simply trying to avoid another outcry akin to the one about captains quarters which admittedly in hindsight was more perception of error than actual too many assumed too much and perception is never about truth and facts aloneupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
so cloaking afk or otherwise is a good counter balance here right the perception that peeps have about a scary cloaky is afk is their perception and always not about truth or facts
im invoking that one law by that one player who may be in this thread alreadythe idea ostensibly to help new players is going to help the old and the rich far more  they can buy the plex with isk earned from their moon goo or marketeering or industrial empire or nullwh sites etc in order to skip past training time
quoteevery single empire eventually fails and nearly always they collapse into anarchy violence and disorderquotegreece rome ottoman empire persian empire etc etc etc just to name a few if anything the empires should begin to fall and high sec should begin to become unruly chaos zones until somebody steps up with the ability to seize and hold territory and stabilize thingspersonally i would love to see some chaos enter into the eve universe via high sec strife smaller lesser groups within empire space begin to revolt etc like the minmatar did and begin to carve out their own space with the help of capsuleer fleets we would demand to be paid of course we have sansha incursions why not begin to add empire incursions into each others territory minmatar begins to randomly invade amarr and vice versa khanid throws off amarr completely etc there are a ton of things they could do with incursions that would add more pve to the game hell allow alliances to begin to attack empire for control i agree with most the problem is not low or null the problem is high
as stated before by many others the main thing that would need to be implemented here is your public character sheet would need a list of former identities as long as the paper trail is visible its fine in my bookbut id charge for it if you want to change your name i think thats a good use for aurum and that goes for the fact that a lot of dusties have been begging for this ability too i wouldnt make it a onetimeonly deal either game is going to exist for decades yo
gamer4liff tea has just snorted out my nosebut great advert why this would be a good featurei would say same costs and rules as character transfernot in corp etclimited to 1 change a yearname change would take 1 week to apply so that those who naughty  exploit  can be found and petitionedno joining a corp during name change timeout
as a larger little fix its a good onejust use conditional formatting and filters from excel it doesnt necessarily have to look great just be functional
well it made it to the list of reasonable things to be voted upon but did not make it to the final vote so we shall keep this alive until the next time something like that comes upi thank all of you for the overwhelming support of a simple idea that could make our lives so much easieri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

so after incarna as we all know ccp had to resort itself and it lead to effectiely the death of wis we had one expansion after incarna that added to wis which was the additional merc quarters since then nothing before the riots and all ccp was gung ho on treating wis as a whole nother game indicating it would receie a large portion of the deelopment effort i am not asking for thati think about 15 of eery expansion should be wis a good expansion balance in my book would be like 40 major feature reision for the expansion ie retribution  bounties odyssey  exploration 20 quality of life enhancements 15 balancing 15 walking in stations improements 10 dustalkyrie integration worktheres a lot of potential thats been abandoned the game is in much better shape than it was during incarna and the reasons for doing walking in stations now is so much greater than it was then i think the idea of a common area that dust mercs and ee capsuleers could mingle on a station would add olumes to the feel of game integration take that and add in a couple years ee alkyrie pilots being able to enter that common area from a firstperson irtual reality perspectie and youe just changed the ball gameteam aatar was created and then team aatar was disassembled with no outward progress ccp has nailed the idea of widespread iteration in the last three expansions wis needs to see that iteration many of the assets already exist the bar from the playstation home area would make for a fantastic basic common area three games can potentially benefit from this one projectreasoning has been gien in the past that it was hard to find meaningful gameplay uses for wis but i dont think thats necessarily important ee has often gone from players creating their own gameplay and then ccp later supporting it if we open up the area let the players come up with something to do with ita point has been made about the amount of effort required being too much to count as a minor step but i feel minor steps could be taken while i think between the existing assetsdesign from ps home we hae the makings already of a good common area a first small step could be allowing one guest to isit your captains quarters something as simple as a rightclick option in the station occupants list to isit their quarters along with a acceptreject dialog for the hosting player akin to a start conersation dialog of course entering someones quarters should create a priate chat of occupants automatically anyways so this would make sense to be a near identical dialog
id like to see more walking in stations content open the door ectafter the ship balancing and art passes are finished though
realistically it should be possible to coincide these i would doubt anyone working on walking in stations has expertise with regards to ship balancing and ice ersa i definitely want the graphics 3 upgrade finished but thats almost done artwise and some of the initial improements to wis could be done without art aforementioned isit other persons quarters button for example
im torn about this issuefrom the no cornerthe player in the ops example is paying for 80 accounts and using 80 all together each account earns only what each account could do if there were 79 other people playingyou cant ban a player for duplicating commands as the eula says he must be creating commandswhich is the main account which are the additional accounts if you accept its wrong at least one account is not breaking the rules so which are the ones that arefrom the yes cornerone player could mine with 1 ship and make x isk per hourone player could mine with 2 ships and make 2x isk per hourone player could mine with 10 ships and make 10x isk per hourone player couldnt really feasibly mine with 80 ships and make 80x isk per hourergo isboxer is allowing the account that is hauling and selling the product to make substantially more isk than he could without the oog toolassuming each account makes more isk than a plex costs its not costing the player anything to increase from 10 to 80 accounts but hes making more money
so two points one its not 40 accounts on one machine its one guy running 1020 computerssecond these setups arent going to be as effective as 40 individual players for all but the most mundane of tasksthird these are not macro programs a macro isthis is a single instruction being distributed to multiple clients not a single instruction executing several ingame commandsthese command distribution or multibox programs have been legal in eve for years
move to wormholes problem fixedsack up problem fixedhtfu
i know there are continually drives to fix the age old bugs and problems with the game but recently there seems to be too much focus on fixing the large of the little thingsso run a new drive to find and fix bugs examples should includetitan bridging bug that can only be resolved by a safe log offthe fact that eve gate cant display emails with the same format as in game links dont appear bolded and underlined text vanishes despite these being the only formatting options eve gate allows you to actually use to compose the mailthe fact that linking in game to something in eve that requires you to be logged in fails with a 404 it should either take you to a log in page or log you in since you already are logged into the gamethe bug where you can start two pos mods anchoring at the same time leading to the pos to be completely locked until it is reset at downtimethe fact that you cant drag materials from a blueprint show info window to the market etcthe fact that you cant drag a ship type from a fitting window to the market etcthe fact that when you drag a person into the eve mail to box it still opens up a list of matching usersoverview bugs how can they still happen just make it default to personal then corp if no personal standing then alliance if no corp standing and be client side derived solvedim not even going to consider graphical errors like sideways warping ships as this doesnt affect my game play but it might be a big issue for somethese are issues that im sure affect most players most times they play the game and are in some cases bugs that have existed for years they really need to be sorted out
sadly ccp are not omnipotent nor omnipresent they can do everything at once all the timesome of those things like expanded drag and drop functionality are very obviously and publicly being added over time some of those bugs have gotten much less frequent as well but a single bug can have multiple causes and therefore be hard to fix entirely
great ideaits about time awoxing needed more effort than clicking the apply button and then awoxcorp newbies  including awoxers  should earn trust on the job not at the front door
1 for timer rollbacks
hi sec ganking is acceptable because you get kill rightshowever an alt corpmate or anyone else can loot your items and steal millions of isk worth of your hard earned items this violates many international laws concerning gambling you can not have an unfair risk of real world money in game loop holes designed to harm your chances of fair playccp profits from every hi sec gank it takes an average of two to three months for the casual player to recover the lost items that is a lost of real world money because you have to gain those items againccp by their game design loophole allows others to take your real world money via stolen in game items thereby extending your play time which cost you more real world moneyccp need to modify their broken rules to allow eithera no one to loot your items but the person who ganked youb give you kill rights on who ever loots your itemsc offer full value insurance to replace what is losti have already contacted ccp legal for all their corporate information so i can ask the attorney generals or that contries equiivelent to file the appropriate laws suits on behalf of eveonline playersif 5000 loses 1 months worth of real world money because of the game play mechanics thats a total of 5000000 us dollars in come that ccp gets because of its unfair game play mechanics now how do you feel about ninja looting and ganking in hisec
good luuuuuuuuuuck
not without going suspect and risking death themselves if anyone around happens to be paying attentionexcept that isk is not realworld money you cant take it out of the game and eve is not licensed or regulated as a gambling institution thus no law gambling related or otherwise has been violatedthen dont haul 23 months of loot in one industrial or freighter ccp only profits if someone buys plex from ccp to recoup those loses most people dont therefore this argument is erroneous again isk is not realworld money if you buy golden ammo in another game you dont get to sue every time you miss a shot with it because it has no real world value you paid the game company for ingame currency which you can then spend as you likein the case of eve online you buy plex which is gametime and can sell this gametime to other players for ingame currency since you can not then take this ingame currency and turn it into realworld money and the game mechanics are clearly laid out for you in various places you have no standing to suealso this is probably covered in the eula
thanks for wasting ccps time and money  that could be better spent on almost anything else  because you cant accept that youre not immune to ship lossi trust you will also sue the organisers of the next game of football that you play for permitting and encouraging assault and robbery against you
i refuse to take that seriously
not sure if troll thread or someone not heeding robert downey jrs advice in tropic thunder
bahahahahahhahahaha
i am locking this for either being an elaborate troll or for discussing legal action against ccp in which case this should not be handled on the forums
sentry drones dont move thus they cannot have transversal
just putting this proposal back up to hopefully gain a little more supportdmc
1 since you create a toon before you know the naming conventions of the gamealso if someone howls droooooooo at me over ts one more time im going to shoot myself in the face
helloi would like to propose the following  the ability to filter local chat with  eve only dust only or both playersthankskitty
ccp i think its time
no
youre wrong and missing the important part about player drien content in order for the players to create their own gameplay there need to be the tools in place to make this possible putting a player or two players or 8 or 100 players in a room together with their aatars doesnt achiee anything unless there is something for them to do in there and parading up and down in their monocles and aurumpants throwing o7s and drinking pretend space beer in a pretend space bar doesnt count as something to domeaningful gameplay uses which tie into and interact with the wider ee unierse are absolutely key to getting anything of alue out of the whole incarna mess
second life disagrees with youid argue that i see a significant amount in other mmos of players hanging around in city areas chatting doing business managing spreadsheets etc now you can indeed sit in your captains quarters and do all that or spin your ship and do all that but the feel is ery different captains quarters and your ship hangar make you feel like you are in an isolated bubble een if theres tons of other people in the stationas others hae pointed out in other discussion threads about improing ee seeing more ships in space has a drastic impact you want to see oh look there are other people about a feeling you cannot get in a station make it so you can see people moing about throw a stupid dance emote in and youe made people ridiculously happy normal people anywaysif you want you can een go so far as to gie yourself a bit of a shortrange intel in allowing people to look out the window on the undock
i second this sentiment all that really needs to be in place to make the space useful is a few interactie tools integrate character trading or contracts throw in a card game dare i suggest danger game the ability to wanderstand around in a station might eentually hae the same appeal as ship spinning which i spend at least 10 of my log in time doing there is also the potential to leaserent large conference rooms for your corpalliance within the same way as hangars are currentlythe potential extends beyond social interaction though the prospect of customizing captains quarters could lead to an interesting sideeconomy rare furniture items or interactie objects arcade games would be interesting the detail differences in the arious interiors could potentially do a lot to help with immersion slaes being bartered for in amarr space tribal ceremonies in matari regions a quasicombination of amarr architecture and minmatar trappings in ammatar space it would make it worth going to a part of space youe neer once docked in just to see what its all about inside
id spent aurum to change the stuff in my captains quarters if it was cool stuff though thats a decent art workloadraasta i definitely see minigames sering a purpose we already know many players go play other games while in the hangar or ship spin which is practically a minigame in itself imagine if ee eer has achieements congratulations you just spun for the 100000th timei wonder what minigames could be integrated with low deelopment effort slay already exists and would just need to be ported from playstation home the hacking minigame is neat and i wonder if it could be repurposed as a twoplayer instation minigame as well
i must admit i am not entirely sure where my dislike for the proposal comes from logically it doesnt really hurt to hae it it may attract people who are interested in that sort of thing into ee howeer they will in all likelihood leae once they realize that the ui is nowhere near as polished as second life or wow and there is ery little functionality to play around with all because ccpplus as long as it doesnt take functionality or too much deelopment away from inspace stuff and doesnt force spaceshipcentric people to join most people will just grudgingly accept it what some intelligent people are concerned about is that wis will create a second tier of gameplay that allows people to isolate themseles from the rest of the game without any ability for anyone to get them without also joining ina good example would be the industrialist to pper dynamic neither side necessarily needs the other one to ply their trade but either one can easily manipulate and get at the other one within their respectie specialties without haing to be the other and there is no sure fire way for either side to a kid the othera problem i see with your proposal is that dust and ee can neer be linked in the way you enision unless dust is ported to the pc they both use completely radically different physics enginesand now for my personal opinion i still dont see the point in itwhat possible gameplay alue could sitting at a irtual bar hae oer slurping down actual shots oer comms while doing something productie
this deeply upsets me i am going to unsub all 753 of my accounts and cry unless ccp takes immediate action for what we the players are too pussy to do woop woop woop woop woop woop
you arent special enough even with so many accounts inb4l
im refering to the search option of personal assets toolset currently assets which were placed into containers in stations hangar or into the corporate hangar cannot be located using this featerue this creates a lot of inconviniece while trying to audit and enumerate ones belongings at least there should be an option to add them to the searchs result as well
sov rental payment alliance srp for hd fleets factoring in the costs when you winbuy and lose the systems your figure might not be too far offbut if you factor in the lost income that alone can be upwards of 5 million isk per minute
good pointi suggest fitting defensively and undocking to mitigate these lossesupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
good point
think of the costs of the needed hardware to implement such changes and the cost in human resources will they be worth it just for the sake of having celestials that actually move  i do not think so besides there are still plenty of more important changes to be made changes that are more or less at hand for the moment
id love to see it i think itd be a great endeavor and i do think youd see the benefit particularly if the system occasionally had weird alignments and things on occasionthat being said its a long way off the basics of grids and such would be affected and all that is some of the most low level base code eve runs on that nobody has touched in ten years itd be a massive overhaul of that code which admittedly is due someday anyhowthered be a lot of gameplay adjustments but i think theres nothing wrong with having bookmarks go out of date itd make sense really though the removal of ability to hang onto perches longterm would mean gatebased gameplay would change drastically though i honestly dont think gates should move theyre pointed at other stars they should be stationarythere could be a case for certain types of dynamic bookmarks a bookmark being tied to the pos not a space coordinate or something like thatgame performance might be a huge issue too where ships would be if planets moved into the same space while they were logged offi mean id love to see it in eves second decade but low priority i want walking in stations first 
ok this just made the number 1 slot of stupidest ideas ever
shah i hae a couple comments its a definite thing that deelopment effort needs to remain small ccp went too far for incarna howeer by taking small bits out of the ee dust and alkyrie teams they can create a compelling cohesie product across all three games without impacting any one game too hard the next couple points can be addressed easily as capsuleers are ulnerable when not all capsuled up we should assume that firstperson combat will not be aailable in a shared space between games this means that you still hae to undock to do most of any of the games it also means its easy to hae them in the same space despite differing engines port the graphics assets into each engine each game is just sending positional and descriptional data between so that each one can render moement properly also i figure eentually dust will someday be using the same carbonbased engine ee is its just absolutely impossible to run that on a ps3
which means that walking in stations will be completely safe outside of tinkering with the market and lack the risk that the rest of ee has to contend with outside of the station the only way this would be balanced is if the people in station could not affect the rest of ee which means either instancing wis and creating a second economy making wis effectiely a gamewithinagame taking away the ability for people walking in station to do anything other than well walk aroundthe first option doesnt sit well with me goes against the mantra of a single ee uniersethe second option makes me question why deelopment time should een be spent on wis im ery sorry but i laughed really hard at thatim no computer programmer but i spent enough time playing around with code to know that it is nowhere near this simple games may seem the same and hae the same results on the surface but game engines generate see and process information differently depending both on how they hae been written and which programming language it has been written into hae two different engines communicate they hae to be compatible usually possible when the languages and programming styles are related to one another an adapter is created wine for apple is a good example of this howeer such adapters usually hae issues with stability and require extra attention wheneer an update on one platform or both comes upbasically what you are saying is this tf2 and battlefield 3 players can both easily join the same serer and play withagainst each other its just a simple matter of graphics and hitboxes neermind that they calculate damage differently or the aiming mechanics are different etc maybe i would like to see that but i wouldnt hold by breath for the next year or two remember were talking about ccp here
youre completely safe in stations now too i think station content should be interesting and deelop oer time but in no way a replacement for space trael i could see missions that inoled a stationside component proided that most of the mission was in spaceit is that simple if you arent talking about combat all you hae is animations and moement they dont een hae to be perfect carbon copy in appearance as long as the space is the same scale and the people moing within it look roughly the same as a game programmer yes its possible it does hae challenges sure but its the sort of challenge ccp is good at insane ideas like putting two games in the same sererand i dont expect to see dust running on carbons graphics engine for at least three or four years
what i think is really all that needs to be said about multiboxing  alts in every online game everplayers with many accounts pay ccp more moneyplayers that pay ccp more will always be the preferred customer sadly this is the end of the discussion ccp may make space ship games but their primary function like every business is to make money considering we cant bring our internet space ship dollars to a competing mmo none really compare there is no incentive to ever remove alts  boxers from the gamewhat alts  boxers do that actually does ruin the game for methey remove the social requirements for playing eve i bought into this game with the assumption that social interaction and cooperation was required to reach the highest levels of game play boxing makes this assumption incorrect instead of players using each other as resources we simply make a hauling alt or a scouting alt or a mining alt aside from totally destroying certain career paths this also just greatly detracts from social interaction taking away that social element of the game penalizes players with actual social skills and rewards those who have trouble connecting with real people last time i checked thats not how an online game should work why are we networked together playing an mmo where isolationist behavior is rewarded why play online at all i really dont care about the pvper boxer who kills me with 80 rifters because hes not having fun either but i can understand why lots of people get upset at that kind of play especially when that boxer shows up at a fleet fight oh and btw that whole one player with 10 accounts is not as efficient as 10 different players argument is crap they are 10000 times more efficient a huge part of group pvp is organization and command with boxing you need 0 communication skills 0 leadership skills 0 charisma 0 loyalty from your group and 0 friends how thats not cheating is beyond me tldrccp presents eve as a social experience despite allowing boxing the reason money you
my head hurtsits convenient you pay for convenience to me it is intended for those oh  i could use a couple more sp on that cyno alt for something else i want to do with it scenarios but i really need to stay on track with my main  i guess 20 bucks wont hurt for a month or 2 shut up and take my money ccpthread closed
it is a quick way to make cyno  pi  trading hauling whatever alts i started using this feature as soon as it came in and will shortly stop using it as my goals for it will be furfilled at the end of this process i will have a bunch of useful alts that can sell stuff do pi light cynos all with multiple jump clones i could have done this before but i would have had to either stop training on my main for a while or open yet another account train for a bit and then use plex to transfer the char across to my main account it is easy  convienient and once done i will retain access to these chars for as long as i play without increasing my long term playing costs the old system is still available if you prefer that onemoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is

if this is implemented then it should be done as an ingame player provided service run by certified space lawyersmoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is
i will fully support wis when ccp ensures that i can assasinate other peoples aatars or clear the jita station traders clustered around the market kiosk with a smartbomb suicide est until then it is a funny little sidenote that could imo be totally deleted captains quarters is dumb i only enter it when i play drunk and miss the undock button there is no reason to enter it so i can sit on my sofaill go sit in the cold tritanium of my cargo hold and count my corpse collection
second life already exists and has a decade headstart on ccp in terms of aatarbased content what youre saying here is ccp please spend our subscription money on a watereddown clone of second life rather than spending it on deeloping new features for the game we actually play
if they ban one program well they could just change the name of it what the op is really asking for is to ban software to broadcast hardware events banning something means policing its use how do you pretend to police a hardware event specially when the original event is indistinguishable from the broadcasted one and according to the very same os the software runs in they are all the same eventimagine a box inside the box you have the eve client outside the box you have the rest of the os and the walls of the box are made of the eula the hardware inputs fall into the box and whether there are other boxes around receiving the same input means nothing given that they are each individual users and the eula restricts them into their memory region as a means of safekeeping its own integrity they cant legally know that the same input fell on a nearby box unless they want to undermine the very same legal precedent that made modern eulas possible which is also the reason all eulas look alike what did you really think they were all alike because the companies are cheap and lazy please dont be so naive i mean does everyone here know that we are not players i guess thats the starting point to any discussion on this matter we are not players we are users if you get killed on a gate by 20 people you got killed by 20 users if you get killed by one guy controlling 20 ships you got killed by 20 users if you cannot understand this then this discussion and its complexities escape you and you should just avoid joining the conversationthat said multiboxing is the biggest cash cow eve has ever seen the power of any multiboxing fleet is dismal when compared to any real fleet or even gang and the drive and interest of the player base on it is so high that ccp needs to make their own multiboxing software and sell it now if theres future on the eve business model its there having players paying 200usd a month only to play as targets for pirates whats not to like the only things that need changing are the mindset of the pirates stop flying solo pvp fits please webs and point are a waste of midslots and fly in fleets please if you refuse to then dont engage fleets and expect your 1337 space pirate flying skills to save youany complaint are just complaints about the way eve works did you get blapped on a lowsec gate well what does multiboxing have to do with it its a design flaw on the game did your ship get obliterated by 10 ships well welcome to eve if they dropped on you you should have kept an eye on dscan if they didnt then why did you engage and above all the biggest problem when people discuss multiboxing is this false belief that ccp allows it they dont need to allow it why well because multiboxing doesnt do anything that would require authorizationmultiboxing software does not read memory regions or modifies them multiboxing software doesnt monitor cache or disk activity multiboxing software does not make decisions for the player based on feedback from the game for example it wont overload your hardeners if you take damage and multiboxing software doesnt increase the damage extraction rate speed or any other stat on any particular user outside of whats allowed by the game rulestheres nothing to allow and theres nothing to banand the bottom line is always this do you not like it can you not do something about it is this not a sandbox then go out there and shoot them stop being risk adverse
hi im doing this the first time i had this idea about new drone ui i just opened photoshop and did what i could for you to visualise this idea since im not photoshop genius be gentle its just a rough draft what you need to imagine it is with eve colours fonts appropriate boxes act basic navigationlet me take you through it step by steplaunch  return buttonthis is going to be one button upon clicking launch the drones will launch and the button changes to return and vice versa this will give the ui less buttons if one set of drones is launched in space and youd like to launch another set then launch of another set of drones is pressed the set of drones in spaces automatically returns back to drone bay once returned the new desired drone set launchesengage  disengage buttonthis button will spawn once the particular set of drones is launched by clicking engage the set of drones in space will engage the selected target and of course as with the launchreturn button the engage  disengage button changes its state once presseddamage indicatorthe indicator will spawn and start flashing when a particular drone is being attacked that goes for ecm webs tp and all offensive modules being applied to a particular drone once the indicator is clicked the drone will make an attempt to return back to drone bay and immediately launches itself back to space and engages the target the whole set of drones is engaginggroupsthe separation of drones is sorted via three different groups for better navigation the first group illustrated as heavy pwnage  is the one group which houses up to 5 different sub groups illustrated as hammerheads ogrezz my favourite all of these groups are fully customisable inside drone bay where you can create folders and folders within folders name them however you like the desired drones are dragged and dropped inside these foldersheavy pwnage  folderis the main folder housing other sub group folders the drones cannot be dropped into this folderhammerheads ogrezz my favourite foldersthese folders are where the drones are dragged and dropped and are assigned to specific sub group just like now these folders can house unlimited amount of drones depending on the size of your drone bayother foldersthese folders will be particularly designed for ships with greater amount of active drones in space carriers act the folders will be created inside folders like hammerheads ogrezz my favourites where the user can drag and drop desired drones and amounts of drones to each folderthere should be launch all button which would launch all drones from all the mini groups each of these groups shall have engage  disengage and launch  return buttons themselves next to themonce a drone is killed from one group it will be possible to drag and drop single drones from group to group the replaced drone will automatically behave like the drones in the particular group that means if the group is engaging the drone will launch itself and start engaging the target the group is engagingthere can be multiple master folders that will improve drone separation there will also be navigation arrows between master groups like heavy pwnage example of folder hierarchy master folderfighterssub foldersdragonfly eniherji firbolg templarminifolders10 dragon 5 dragon  7 eniherji 8 eniherji ect
not sure if photoshop or ms paint
much like many people who run multiple accounts simultaneously i am tired of having to launch each account individually and change graphics settings for multiple displays and have to roll the dice as far as which display the client will open on at what resolution etc is it really that hard to remember which display and resolution individual accounts always use i like the new launcher in terms of how quickly you can open multiple clients on different accounts but seriously the individual accounts can as far as i know maintain whatever your graphics settings are when it comes to the very specific detailed settings bloom effects settings etc but they cant always open using the same display or resolution
